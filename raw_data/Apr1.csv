1,Productivity and motivation during quarantine,"I am a (surprisingly) very extroverted person and this quarantine is killing me. I am fortunate enough to be working but that drains my energy and once I get home I am unable to do anything else. I moved into my new (and first!!) apartment right as all this started (3/13) and after everything being shut down and unable to visit with anyone I cant find motivation to finish unpacking, clean, or cook. Everything is a mess and it just makes me very anxious and sad to the point I cannot even do anything about it. Does anyone have advice on the best way to stay motivated to do all these things and prevent the mess from getting worse?"
2,I'm smart. But I often feel stupid.,"I've been told all my life that I'm smart. And I believe it. At least sometimes.

But there are some areas where I enter a mental fog and can't figure it out, no matter how I look at it. These involve things like games that involve strategy.

I'm no good at anything where you have to take risks, use strategy, and ""think flexibly."" 

Take Scrabble, for instance. Sure, you don't know what your opponent will do, but once you put a word down, that word will not be removed from the board. You know exactly how much that word is worth, and that amount will be added to your score. Contrast that with trading card games, where there are zillions of rules, you have to think on your feet based on what cards your opponent used, there are many different kinds of cards with countless effects, and with most of them, I don't even understand the point. (Show your opponent this card, and then shuffle the deck? What the hell does this accomplish?)

Things came to a head in a video game I've been playing, Trails of Cold Steel III. There's this card minigame called Vantage Masters, and I've been trying to understand it, but I just can't. And every time I lose, I feel like an idiot. And you know what's worse? Going online to look for help, and seeing comments like, ""This is so easy, you have to be intentionally trying not to win in order to lose.""

I've just always been more of the concrete than creative type. This reminds me of the time I asked what's good about my writing, and they told me it was the accurate spelling and punctuation. That wasn't what I wanted to hear. I wanted to hear that my writing had *soul*. 

But I feel like I'm a robot, and am only good at things that trained monkeys could do. I have OCD, so it makes sense. How can someone so rigid be creative and good at things requiring strategy?

I just feel so dumb and worthless and I've been crying for the last hour about it."
3,i've been feeling rlly sad lately,"hi. i was okay, or at least i thought i was but the last week or so i feel like any little thing that happened put me off n i'd be sad for the rest of the day. today seems to be harder than usual for me as i've been on the verge of crying since the moment i woke up. today i'm feeling a little too irrelevant, a little too annoying, a little too much like i should die. i don't want to die. i wish my thoughts would go away :("
4,Quarantine with one addict parent and the other mentally unstable,"The situation sucks everywhere. I have been in quarantine for over three weeks now and it has been bad. But the real disaster happened yesterday. My alcoholic parent left for ""work"" and came back two hours later unable to walk, yet still capable of driving them home. Upon arriving at home and barely standing, me (F24) and my younger sibling tried to somehow get the drunk parent to back of the house to sit down, since we have stairs in the house and that was a no go. The mentally ustable parent got involved in this procedure, started yelling at the drunk parent...the drunk parent tried to run away but ended up falling and hitting their head on concrete. The paramedics arrived, got the parent to the emergency and fixed up, but did not want to keep the parent in the hospital, because of corona danger and the drunken state.

So we put the drunk parent in the basement for now. We have to observe the injury just in case. My problem is that I can't, I am so traumatised by the events of yesterday, that I have a panic attack just thinking of facing my drunk parent. I cannot fall asleep because these event keep playing in my head. I wanted to leave the house and just go stay with friends or in an empty flat, but my mentally unstavle parent threatened with suicide if I left and my younger sibling blamed me for trying to leave them alone in this. Now they blame me for not wanting to take care of my alcoholic parent jn the basement, but I just can't. 

I feel trapped and it is affecting my health and my psychological state. If anyone knows of ways to cope with all this blame that is being put on me, for not wating to help and wanting to leave, please do share."
5,There are more of me??????,"Ok so idk how to explain this very well but I’ll do my best shot.  As a young kid I seen this black figure, small like another kid it struck fear in me, I would burst into tears just by looking at it.  I would get random bursts of anger and lash out, I just lost all of me.  I ended up turning into anger, putting my family’s lives in danger literally.  Years later I have learned to control most of it but there’s more of these black figures, they are the same height as me.  They tell me I have powers and all that crap I know I don’t but they keep telling me that.  They keep telling me I deserve to hurt and I deserve to feel pain and that others deserve to suffer. Idk if this is what this subreddit is for but I just hope someday I’ll be normal."
6,I'm feeling like a monster because of a comment about me in a animal subreddit,"I'm about to cry hardly because of some guy who started to talk to me like I'm someone in prison for murdering an innocent. Started with me, a fucking idiot saying some shit about not letting my pet rats out of the cage everytime, going about my mom's holy rule: never say something in an animal community. I tried to tell him about my side on the story. I live in a house with my parents and my brother, we take care of all pets we have. My comments got downvoted but that's insignificant when I compare it with how I'm feeling right now. The worst part is: I think I'm the wrong one in this fight, I'll go and cry a bit now."
7,How do I ask my parents to let me get help?,"I’m a teenage girl (if that helps), and I have an unhealthy relationship with food. I’ve never had a healthy relationship with food. Not once in my life. I’m overweight, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me mentally. I eat when I’m stressed, sad or angry. I eat even when I’m not hungry. When I eat, I feel so shameful but it’s as if I can’t stop. I know that there will be consequences after I eat, but I eat anyway. And after I eat, I feel so guilty that I often break down in tears. I’m constantly thinking about my weight, to the point that headaches are a normal thing now. I cry nearly every day because of my weight, and how much I eat. I know my parents disapprove/are scared of my behaviour and don’t know how to deal with me because they talk about my weight and eating habits all the time, as if I wasn’t in the same room. Spoiler alert, I’m in the same room. I cried so hard after hearing my parents talk that I fell asleep. Then, I woke up and couldn’t control my tears for around an hour and a half. This stress caused me to eat, and that was half an hour ago. I’ve been crying since then. I want to lose weight so so badly. It feels like my life is focused around losing weight, but I feel so hopeless around food that I’m scared. Negative thoughts to do with weight, diets, exercises and food plague my mind every moment that I’m awake. My mental health is starting to get worse. I’m terrified of what my parents reactions will be if I tell them. I need a professional, but I don’t know how to ask my parents.

TL;DR: I’ve had a problem with overeating for my whole life, and I need professional help. But, I don’t know how and I’m reluctant to ask my parents."
8,"Weird mental ""attack"" that I haven't experienced before... I think I might be going insane","so... like an hour ago I tried to go to sleep, but I have a headache since like 22:00, so I couldn't really fall asleep... I went into the bathroom to wash my face and somehow refresh myself... and that's when the ""attack"" really hit me...

I looked into the mirror after washing my face, and I felt like I'm being watched, then I couldn't stop walking around in circles for like 10 minutes, I was also moving weird... like it wasn't me controlling my body... I started snapping with my fingers... but without my knowledge, I only realised I was doing it after a minute or so...

then, we have a rubber rug in our bathroom that has stars on it, I looked down, and saw myself walking around on it, and it felt like I was walking on a glass plate, and I can see trough it and there is space.. with stars...

I also felt really clumsy or like.. about to faint or something like that...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm sitting in my room, feeling almost calm, writing this... I still have a headache and I feel it in my neck... and I can't help but to roll my head in circles to numb the pain... but anyways, I recorded a 3 minute video of me whispering... I basically tried to describe this ""attack"" as clearly as possible...

this got me curious... what did I experience?... and how can I stop this..."
9,I want to care,"I feel apathy, anxiety and rage. That’s it, everything else is weak to nonexistent. I can’t feel joy at all. Apathy protects me but I’d trade it in in a heartbeat for some passion."
10,What mental illness do you guys think I have?,"Symptoms;

Random episodes of extreme fear, usually daily (yet it doesn’t bother me)

Sometimes nightmares where I should be terrified I feel nothing.

Repressed rage that sometimes slips out. Occasionally. After which I feel awful about it, for letting people see that side of me.

Don’t sleep much but again it doesn’t bother me.

Not eating much but only out of laziness. If somebody else made the food I’d eat it every time.

Absolutely hate myself at times but even then I’m still happy? And most of the time I think very highly of myself.

Often think of the people who have wronged me and the damage they caused. Sometimes I like to dream about revenge, other times I sympathise with them (when logically I absolutely shouldn’t!)

I can easily laugh at myself and genuinely don’t give a shit.

I don’t feel guilty about anything.

I don’t feel like I deserve bad things to happen to me.

I don’t feel sorry for myself.

Even with these things I am still extremely happy to get up in the morning and enjoy life. Truly. Seems very odd to me?

I feel like my life’s going nowhere and I’m sat there, trying to survive, smiling and content with the whole shit storm.

I also feel like people laugh at me and think I’m a loser. I don’t have a job so people pick on that but I do have a valid reason for it and it won’t be forever. But I would never tell people my plans.

Does this sound like anything in particular? I’m curious more than anything."
11,I feel like I should be depressed but I know I'm not and I don't know why.,"Okay so this has been on my mind for a long time, let me explain. 

I grew up in an extremely abusive household, and from my general intuition id bet my mother has had depression from since I was born up until recently, where she seems a lot better than when I was a kid. 
My mother is from a third world country and was forced to marry my dad who is a man with what I believe to be autism (I don't know for sure and no one in my family explains, he can't read or write and can only do simple tasks.)

So yeah her being from a 3rd world country where child abuse is given a blind eye and all the other factors led me and my sister to grow up in an abusive household.

We would get beaten up with bamboo sticks and most of the times we would not know why, reasons being the beating were because we did something which she deemed as ""wrong"" in a more complicated way than we could understand. There was a lot of politics and tension within the family so we would do something like hang out with out uncle whom she disliked and we would get beaten up over severely over it. Again, in our minds we was just hanging out with our uncle. My mum never gave us emotional support and my dad did nothing but bully me relentlessly for most of my life, there was one time I was walking in the corridor minding my own business and he just slammed my head against the wall. I suffered this relentless bullying up until the age of 16 where I finally fought back and he's never bullied me again. There were periods where he would try to show him authority but I could tell he was too scared to go through with it. 

I lived most of my teenage years without maternal love and no father figure so this has strained my social skills and all these factors still effect my life to this day but it doesn't effect my mental health. Even during the abuse. I understand why I never went through depression, from as early as I can recall iv always seen the end of the tunnel, whether it be growing up to get a job, get married or what. There's always been something I look forward to. 

So finally, can someone explain this to me? Is this common? Am I depressed and unaware of it? 

The reason I'm so sure I'm not depressed is because iv experienced something called ""post vacation blues"" and that was by far worse than what I feel in my day to day life. I'm assuming real depression is a much more severe thing. 


TL:DR - Suffered horrendous physical and emotional abuse as a child and teenager but I'm not depressed, why???"
12,I’m having a panic attack right now and I need help,
13,Pathetic. One Conversation and I see it. I'm Pathetic.,"The perfectionist in me didn't want to believe it. Everything about me, all that I feared, became true. 

Getting diagnosed may give you an answer, but it doesn't set you free. Your mind has been so occupied. So distracted with trying to fight whatever it was, that when you do find out, you don't want to believe it.

Anxiety, that was fine for me. Medication, numbness, it's gone. Not mentally though. Depression, it made it's own entity. People tell me it was me, but it wasn't. I didn't focus on it. I didn't manifest it. The more I ignored it. Or tried, the bigger it got. OCD. PTSD. All of that was an imperfection. They're all imperfections to that perfection I wanted. Mine also deals with my health and body. And if mentally I'm not ""sane"" then I'm not perfect. 

I tried to self medicate. I tried everything I could fine. All those supplements, positivity shit, exercise, diet, etc. I went to so many doctors to prove it wrong, but that's what it was. And the more and more I talked. The deeper I got with my therapist, the more I felt I was out of control. I was never in control. I just tried to hide it.

I can't help people like me. I talk to my friend and I'm a fucking hypocrite. I can't even admit that I'm dealing with so much turmoil. I can't sit there and think everything isn't okay. I can't talk to anyone around me. I just feel like I don't know what's going on with me right now. I just want it off my chest. I want to be left without it. I wish I could have avoided the conversation. Obsessions. They become obsessions. I want it out. I need it out. I don't talk to my therapist until Thursday. But I know it won't go. Not until I find something else to occupy my mind."
14,Ibs??,I have ibs D and it has been really bad recently. I am going to ask my psychiatrist about starting an antidepressant for it. I also have anxiety/depression. Has anyone had success with antidepressants for ibs? Thanks!
15,Is it normal?," I've recently become friends with a guy from another state who informed me he has depression. We used to talk every single day, but here recently he's been sporadically messaging me. It's been 5 days since I've spoken to him, is that normal in people with depression?"
16,im getting more suicidal every day,"tldr: lost a lot of friends, made me extremely depressed, quarantine isnt helping, starting to get suicidal, cant reach out to friends for whatever fuckin reason. 



a while ago i lost a little more than half of my closest friends and its been eating away at me ever since. 

ive also been in the worst depressive slump ive ever been in in my life.

idk how to vent or talk, ive never really communicated with friends or reached out. i have a therapist now but i missed my last appointment. im blaming it on the quarantine, which has made it to where my therapy appointments are online. idk

i miss my old friends way too much and lately ive been seeing them all over my social medias. theyre the people who taught me how to make music and art, and with everything that happened theyre also the ones who made me stop creating. 

creating was one of the only passions i had that stayed around, and im just too depressed to do it lately. i need to have someone with me, and i do have friends who make music but the music we make is so different that its hard to work with them. 

it feels like ive had an open wound that just wont stop bleeding and it wont heal no matter how much i try. 

i dont know why i’m posting this here. 
i dont know if a lot of it even makes sense. 
but every day i get more and more thoughts of killing myself. idk what to do about it. 

thanks ig."
17,Suicidal thoughts are back.,[deleted]
18,Am I retraumatized?,"So I try to keep it short. I'm 29 years old, m.
My sister died 20 years ago. I don't think I'm allowed to write down what happened or my post get deleted? Not sure. Let's put it this way. No natural cause.

I was pretty sure the years of therapy got me pretty straight up. So I quit going there.
A few weeks ago I got the result of an assassment I had to do ( to see if I'm still handicapped).
In the assassment, there was a police report of what exactly happened to my sister  Pretty detailed stuff, but yet a lot of questions unanswered.

To cut to the core. Since than (and I happen to bump online into the person responsible for her death)
I started to become more afraid of everything. Dark, I feel like I see shadows in my eye corners and hear steps sometimes. If I watch movie or even funny videos with my so, most of the time there is something that reminds me of the situation.
It's 3.30 am right now. Again no sleep until it gets bright outside and I know everyone is awake.

I tried to get an appointment with a therapist. But they all told me only in 3 month. And most of them called back and told me duo to Corona they can't see me in person either.

I do know there is Noone in my apartment, still can't sleep. I got all doors locked and blocked with Glas bottles so I would notice if someone comes in.

Any advice? I'm from Germany btw. Tried the standard Hotlines everyone know about. It's blocked or they tell me they can't help me because of stupid Corona problems...

Sorry for the bad Englisch and jumping from topic to topic. I'm realy tired right now..."
19,"During a depressive episode my thoughts are so loud, sometimes I can’t hear what people say to me. But I heard it this time.","My car broke down last week and I’ve been dealing with my depression episode since I lost my job. Major stressors right now. So I went to spend some time at my mom’s house. My two sisters live with her. One is 13 (Trae) and the other is 17 (Kenzie). I was missing my apartment really bad the second night I was there and we were talking about it. So Kenzie drove us back to spend a night there, at about 2 in the morning lol. 

I was really quiet that night. I have these thoughts that I call “automatic thoughts.” They’re just crazy irrational things that I say to myself when I’m depressed. Most of the time they are mild suicide ideations. I deal with these often but I can tell when my depression is bad when I don’t tell anyone what’s going on. It’s SO hard to pay attention when there’s so much going on in my head. It’s easier to stay quiet and I don’t want to hurt anyone.

As soon we got there, Trae said to me, “Shelby, I love you. I’m so glad you’re here.”

I ACTUALLY heard that. I recognized it. I am still in shock by how specific her wording was. I didn’t tell them how I was feeling and I don’t think I’ve ever heard her say anything like that before. It came from a 13 year old.

We talked today and she said, “I know it sounds dumb but I always get a feeling when something is off.” 

It may seem so small to make an entire post about this. But I think my little sister might’ve saved my life."
20,How is OCPD often diagnosed? What clinical instruments/best practices are used to screen for and diagnose personality disorders generally? (x-post from r/OCPD),
21,What is wrong with me,"Recently I feel like I am going back into my depression which is supposed to be gone thanks to therapy and medication. The wish to cut myself again has returned and the excessive sweating is just tormenting me. My anxiety is killing me, my body physically aching from it. Small apetite, now I take long naps after school, I feel tired all day, and can't even pretend I am okay, sometimes my mood swings terribly; from enthusiastic to fully paranoid and thinking about how everything can possibly go wry. I want to cry but no tears come out. School has me stressed out in such a way that my smoking habits are slowly going up. I need someone to talk to but the more intimate I become with a person the less prone I am to open up, as I don't want them to worry to much, that is why I speak to strangers of my problems and the nerves kill me when I subtly express how I feel. I am just fucking broken."
22,Do I have an eating disorder?,"I (F21) was over weight about 2 years ago and decided on losing weight and so far I've lost about 20 pounds. I've become about average to a little bit less than average weight for my height and age group but I want to lose more. I weigh myself every day and write it down and if I gain even half a pound I panic and over exercise or not eat. I try to wake up late so I can just skip breakfast and eat a late lunch. My lunches are oatmeal with protein powder in them but before I eat my lunch I have to exercise and sweat a lot to feel like I deserve to eat. For dinner, I have to eat with my mom so I serve myself so that she doesn't realize that I'm serving less for myself than her and after eating dinner I feel obligated to brush my teeth right after so that I won't be tempted to eat more or even if I were offered food I can say I already brushed my teeth. I watch videos of skinny people on tiktok or YouTube eating candy and snacks and I feel so bad about myself because I'm not skinny and I have a muffin top. I exercise everyday till my body hurts. I have made a rule to only drink water as my beverages and I don't eat much of anything but I still can't lose any weight. 
The day before yesterday, I lost 2 pounds and I was so happy that I lost it for the first time in forever. But now I feel like I need to keep at it and I can't eat even more than usual. I feel like I need to fast or exercise to maintain what I have accomplished. 
It wasn't fun bring fat and I know it. Since losing weight I got a boyfriend, clothes that used to make me look like sausages actually fit and I don't hate how I look as much as I used to. 
Considering that I can't seem to lose weight and I don't look skinny by any means, I don't know if I have an eating disorder or if it's just something all twenty something year old girls go through. So do I have it or is it normal for us?"
23,Day 1... again. Extremely scared,"Day 1 again... extremely anxious

Hi! This is my first post here in this subreddit so bare with me I guess haha. Also I could’ve picked a million different flares like health, sleep, etc so don’t take mine tooo much to heart. Two weeks ago I posted in r/leaves about how I am 19 years old, have been smoking weed for a year and daily for about the past 10 months. I did quit. Throw everything out, and went to a partial program at my local psych hospital to help with my anxiety. This was two weeks ago. Of course, the last day of the partial program was my birthday and my gf came to surprise me. We smoked that night and I thought I’d be able to control it afterwards, felt good about it. Of course I got back into smoking everyday and then right back to morning afternoon and night. All was well and I was back to smoking everyday until last night I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat and puking and shaking. The only time this has ever happened to me is with weed withdrawals but I was smoking last night so idk how I would’ve withdrew. I decided today though that I’m gonna try and quit again. The only issue is that there is so much anxiety for me revolving around going to bed tonight because I’m so scared of that happening again. I literally felt like I was dying.  I don’t really know where I’m going with this but thanks for listening to my ted talk and here goes night 1 again :/"
24,I’m getting kicked out and stuff.,"I’m 20, so yeah. She can do that. She owes me nothing. I know. It’s just that it makes me feel awful. My bf lives here too. We were staying only temporarily, but the covid 19 stuff happened so plans got set back. He pays rent, utilities, groceries, I do most of the cooking and cleaning. Other than that we keep to ourselves. I try to do as much for the household as possible. I try so hard not to be a burden with the amount of energy I have. I do nothing but things for them. I use all of my energy on helping. I can’t do anything I enjoy. I’ve been really low for a few months. 

Anyway, a few days ago my moms husband started sending me places. Like ok, we’re not staying around here (we also have pets, no places around here allow them even for extra. plus we’re moving out of state as soon as my bf can transfer) so I just kept ignoring them. Today he asked what site I was using to look for places, I said we weren’t looking. Apparently we’re getting kicked out. Yeah, that would have been nice to know from them beginning. This was also allegedly my mom’s decision. 

This makes me rage. I don’t know how to explain how much I hate talking to her husband. It sounds like I’m being dramatic so I hope someone understands. He’s a piece of shit. I hate him. He was physically, emotionally, sexually abuse. He sexually assaulted a few other women. My mom knows this. I feel like she’s choosing him over me by kicking me out but letting him stay. He also sexually assaulted my best friend when we were teens, who has PTSD from being raped by her dad. I want him to die. He does absolutely fucking nothing for this house yet I’m the one who has to leave. Sorry, a bit off topic. I can’t talk about him without explaining how much of piece of shit he is. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to stay here feeling like a burden. If we leave now my bf will most likely get fired. I’m so frustrated. I know this doesn’t seem like much but I’m really not in the place right now to type out my whole situation. I am overreacting so much right now. I’m so angry. So upset. Feeling suicidal. I don’t want to deal with this."
25,Disordered or Normal?,"Do you think that things we consider disordered now will eventually be considered normal, just due to the sheer number of people with the issue?

Like it seems like EVERYONE these days has a diagnosed anxiety disorder of some kind.  At what point do we consider it just a divergent but normal way of being?  When 30% of people have it?  50%?  80%?"
26,I am writing a fictional story about a group of teens in the psych ward and need help.,"I know the topic is so basic but I am looking to Reddit for help. I started this story years ago and now have found myself picking it up again due to my state's stay at home order. I want to add realistic aspects to the story. Basically any details you could provide about a typical day at an adolescent psych ward would be appreciated. Activities that were held, the amount of therapy received, list of rules to follow, visitation, etc. Anything you might think that will be helpful so that this story, which is fiction, doesn't seem totally wrong about what happens in an adolesecent psych ward. (Edit): Also are there phrases therapists love to hear? "
27,"I’m happy all the time, to the point where it’s crippling (Crippling Happiness)","I understand happiness has a positive connotation. My happiness is almost so consistent to the point where it’s a little damaging and almost leads to self-destructive behavior in a way.

*Where I am now*

I find it very hard to get motivated to do anything and to be consistent with anything I guess because my brain has a “I’m perfectly content and happy with everything right now, why would I wanna do or change anything” if that makes any sense. It’s like I’m always on an steady and consistent amount of happiness, nobody what bad thing happens I’ll get over it and it will continue, something good comes out of every bad thing.

*Example That I Think Is Telling*

Like my physical health for example. I used to take it pretty seriously last year in freshman year and in 8th grade. (I’m 16 btw). The reason I took it seriously was still not because I was sad or depressed, it was because I was scared, and insecure and didn’t like myself in many ways. I had extremely bad anxiety and was actually diagnosed with anxiety disorder.

 (which would sound like I was not very happy but I still managed to maintain a consistent level of happiness even though I was struggling with self image). 

This year in my sophomore year of high school, my anxiety, insecurities, and fear dramatically increased to the point where I barely have any of it anymore. So know the one thing I managed to be consistent with for years no longer seems like a priority to me, because people’s opinions don’t really matter to me as much anymore and my brain is just in a state of struggling to get me to do anything that it doesn’t want to do, because I honestly feel like the constant state of happiness sort of has my brain not seeking any activity other than what I’m currently doing. Because once again, why would it feel the need to seek anything else?

* Information About Me*

I’m an extravert, I love talking to friends or just people in general more than I like being at home alone by myself. In fact in school I’m actually sort of a class clown that just talks to people and makes jokes instead of doing my school work, I’m always at least failing 2 classes because if I drop out of school, guess what, it won’t matter because I’ll still get a low end job and pay for a cheap studio apartment and continue to be happy and contempt. Even though I’m an extravert at heart, watching YouTube videos and playing a video game or playing guitar still makes me feel extremely happy and I’m always very curious and ambitious about things, I love learning new information on things I found fascinating which happens to not involve school at all. 

Turns out when I’m being forced to abuse how my brain works it turns self destructive and repels everything when I actually every once in a while try on my work because I’ll have 4 U’s instead of my usual 3. I’ll actually sacrifice my time talking to people to try to get a good grade every once in a while but it’s like I’m literally not capable.

I also have an extremely unaddictive personality, which is generally looked at as a good thing but those people who say it’s a good thing fail to understand just how important addiction is the human brain. They think of it as “you can’t get addicted to drugs or gambling” rather than me not even being able to hold a steady job or maintain a healthy physique even tho I love fitness. (weightlifting)

*Theories I Have*

One of the theories I have that might somewhat lead to this is my philosophy on life itself. I’m an existential nihilist (and an anarchist too). Because of my philosophy on life which is that there is quite literally no meaning to anything in this life, I should just do whatever makes me happy because mindset is everything, if I don’t wanna do something that doesn’t benefit me in making me happier for the short term, why should I do it.

Or maybe down to a neurological level, my brain just produces an abnormal amount of serotonin at an abnormally fast rate.

*Drugs/Substances*

About the point I made earlier about my unaddictive personality, I have tried many drugs. I’ve done cocaine before, a long with a variety of prescriptions from stimulants, sedatives, to painkillers,alcohol, weed, and even DMT. People see me take these substances and think I need help and that I’m depressed or addicted but in reality I do them whenever I get bored and to have a good time, I’ve never been addicted to anything I’ve ever tried. My favorite drugs are psychedelics and weed because they reveal a more vulnerable, humble side of me. Where as most pills make you stupid and cocaine, adderall and alcohol sort of just strengthen your ego and can lead you to dumb decisions. Also the feeling of feeling too good and on top of the world doesn’t really interest me. I just recently just stopped drinking alcohol because it makes me uncomfortably happy and euphoric and began smoking more weed which when it’s not making me feel weak, vulnerable, or humble, it’ll give me a nice, healthy hit of anxiety and panic that’s sort of therapeutic to me in a weird way. I mainly just like the feeling of being sober more than anything, reality sort of is my drug.

(I felt like mentioning drug use might be helpful since I feel as that how they affect my brain and my personal preference, towards specific kinds might be telling of my personality and how I’m neurologically wired)

*The Saddest I HAVE Experienced*

The most amount of time I’ve ever genuinely been sad was 3 days, and that was after my grandpa died. Which I still wasn’t depressed because I was still very hopeful for better days and I started healing right when I found out he was dead. Depression is an emptiness and lack of interest and motivation (which I lack motivation a LOT but NEVER interest) also it has to I think stick with you for at least over a week.

A few years ago my brother died, now this was a pivotal moment in my life. I actually didn’t really know how to react. I only cried for a total of about 5 minutes. Before just going straight to the grieving process. At his wake, I didn’t cry. I wanted to but I held back tears (which was stupid on my part because I was trying to be macho.) “My dad wasn’t crying, and I’m big and tough like him so I shouldn’t either” was kind of my mindset.

I’ve always been a very confused person who tends to overthink every single small thing but never quite to the extent I was doing it a month or two after his death.

(I’m trying to detail this transition the best way i possibly can but it’s kinda blurry)

*Mental Illnesses*

I remember I started to get very fidgety in class 
and nervous all the time and started acting out in class and getting into a lot of trouble. I found it literally impossible for me to sit still and do work.

I went to a psychiatrist that diagnosed me with ADHD and I got adderall.

I started taking it which only made my anxiety 5x  worse than it already was.

Then I went to a psychologist that said I was misdiagnosed with ADHD and that I actually have an anxiety disorder.

Other than that, when I was in elementary school, I was never diagnosed with it but my parents could’ve sworn I had OCD.

*Emotional Impairments*

I’ve noticed I’ve never really had a serious feeling of love or affection towards another person I guess because I have myself that I love. 

I used to think I was asexual because I never had crushes on any girls, even though I thought they were hot, sexy, and attractive still. I knew for a fact I wasn’t at all attracted to guys.

Later in puberty I realized that I do in fact want to have sex with girls...... however that’s about it.

I wanna have sex and just be friends, I don’t want any relationship at all 

(which sucks because girls at my school only fuck you if your dating them)

I also rarely ever get mad or angry, however I do get it quite more often than sadness which is almost never.

So yeah, I guess you could say I have impaired feelings of affection and anger"
28,Too scared to see a doctar,"Hello

I am certain I have a mental disorder, some psychotic disorder. Not to selfdiagnose, but I fit all the symptoms of an early schizophrenia prodrome or have schizoaffective disorder. I know I need meds but am too scared to go to see a docter.

* When I am going to sleep I hear voices, even in the day now sometimes.
   * i.e.. it's getting worse ever since a drug problem
* I see colors that aren't really there and shapes
* I am always very paranoid
* My social skills are bad
* My speaking is very bad
* I can get very irritable and unimportant things can make me very agitated

&amp;#x200B;

So I know I have *something* and I need something like medicine. I think if I don't get medicine for it I will have a breakdown and my life will crumble down.

&amp;#x200B;

I am scared to go to a doctor because my family/friends/parents will not be receptive to learning that I have an illness, and am also paranoid that the doctor will send me to a hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you"
29,How to get help for a parent who is in denial with their rapidly surfacing mental illness?,"What can be done when you have a family member who has become very mentally ill quite quickly (delusions, paranoia, violent outbursts, beliefs based in their own reality, making plans and decisions that make no sense to anyone except them, etc.) but will not allow treatment, and can talk their way out of wellness check situation?

My mother is living with my father who's mental health is deteriorating severely. He is emotionally and mentally abusive to her every chance he gets (some examples include: asking for her round the clock care but saying to get the eff away from him anytime she goes near him, threatening to kill or release their pet cat that she loves, bringing up nonsensical stories from over 20 years ago as evidence that she hates him and is plotting to turn the family against him, etc.). I'd chalk this up to just him being an abusive ahole, but combined with some other things I won't get into, lead us to believe this is a mental health issue that's been surfacing for the past few months. 

We've spoken to our family doctor and unless my father allows himself to be evaluated they say there's nothing they can do to begin assessing him and prescribing anything to stabilize him. He's threatened suicide once and when we acted on that asking for a wellness check, thinking this would be the thing that finally forces him to get evaluated and hopefully on the way to something to stabilize his moods, they spoke to him and released him 3 hours later, deeming him not a danger to himself or others.

He is a danger. He is a danger to my mother every day. If she tries to leave he threatens her with nonsensical empty threats, but she won't call the police because she thinks once again they'll just allow him to return home the same day...angrier and more irrational than ever. So in the end that will just hurt her situation more. 

What can be done? We can't get anything prescribed to him without his consent (and he doesn't think he has a problem) we can't have him forcefully committed for evaluation, doctors are deeming him not a danger after spending less than 10 minutes with him even though we see the danger everyday, and we can't leave out of fear he'll hurt us or do something else irrational. This is absolutely killing my mother - the fear she faces every day is giving her daily health problems, but all we're told is there's nothing they can do because after evaluating him ""he's not a danger to himself or others""."
30,What’s the point in living if I’ve got nothing to look forward to?,"I don’t even know what to say I don’t want to actually die I’m very very scared of it but at the same time for me life is shit. I live in a developed country with healthcare plenty of other things and I know it can get way worse than it actually is but I’ve had everything I ever loved taken away from me one by one and it takes a toll on you eventually I’ve had most my childhood taken away because some guy was horny and raped my mum but I guess that is growing up in a shitty place house gets robbed frequently too. My dad got way more how do I put it “angry” I guess. I don’t know how to feel to be honest I feel not much at all I guess but at the same time a big hatred and anger towards a lot of things. I thought I had my life on track and a set plan was beginning to make friends too for the first time in so long I felt a tiny bit happy then this stupid virus hit then it’s all gone again. I can’t describe very well how I feel all I can describe is a prolonged anger that’s it not even sadness anymore I haven’t felt anything else but anger and a strong feeling of fucking revenge for years upon end and none of this helps when every few days I hear news of my mums suicide attempts in hospital which just brings back awful fucking memories of many unfortunate events. 

Eh if anyone read this thank you for listening to my little rant I guess reddit isn’t the best place but this deviated from the main topic a little bit of that I’ve got nothing to look forward to and nothing to enjoy right now all I can do is sit and question why I’m so unlucky."
31,Am I being self-centered?,"I took a leave of absence from work due to Covid-19 because I work in a health department. We don’t do the actual testing in my facility, but my co-workers answer questions and order the tests. We also have a home heath department on the end of the building that takes care of sick and elderly patients. Once Covid-19 patients start requiring home care, they will be taking care of them. 

The extra stress of the pandemic along with the anxiety of who could be carrying the disease has my anxiety in overdrive. My employer allowed me to take time off because of this. I can’t draw unemployment because it’s a medical issue. In order to utilize my sick time, which I have 180 hours of, I have to file for FMLA. 

When I spoke to my doctor about FMLA paperwork, at first they kind of made me mad because they insinuated that if the time comes and they end up quarantining, they will have to use time. I pointed out that they then can draw unemployment. Once I explained that if I don’t use FMLA, I won’t be paid all, they agreed to fill out my paperwork. 

Now I’ve been at home over a week and I feel like I’m faking it. I’ve been following the shelter in place order instituted by my governor. I don’t let me kids go anywhere except out back and to their grandparents. I go to the grocery store once a week. 

I am taking triple the amount of my Klonopin prescription. I have a knot in my stomach. I forced myself to stop watching the news. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being self-centered and there are people out there getting sick and dying of Covid-19, and I should be at work doing my part and making it easier on my co-workers. 

Is anyone else struggling with Covid-19 induced guilt?"
32,How do I stop isolating myself?,"I told my boyfriend that I'm isolating myself and my mental health was spiraling. He was very supportive and comforting. Me isolating myself is killing me. He's trying different times to give me space or to try to get my attention and spend time with me. I can barely look at him because I feel so horrible for isolating myself. What can I do? I know he's hurting too, I'm just so disconnected and detached from everything. I feel like I'm watching myself from afar."
33,Nightmare problems,"Hey! Uh I don’t post things much but I feel that it’s important for me to put this out there. Since mid-December I have been having horrible night terrors every single night. I was not usually effected much by nightmare before, but these leave me crying when I wake up 8/10 times. I have not been able to set up a doctors appointment, as my healthcare provider has been booked since December. Does anybody have any ideas as to what I can do? I don’t watch scary movies, read scary books, etc. I’ve tried home remedies (no blue light before bed, tea, warm milk, music, etc) and nothing has worked. Does anybody know what this is and maybe how I can stop it? Literally anything helps, I’m terrified to go to bed!"
34,"strange attraction (not as bad as you think, but still bad)","so, any time i spend any normal amount of time with a friend, i find myself attracted to them? it’s really odd, because the moment they leave these feelings completely disappear. and it happens with EVERYONE. like EVERYONE. close friends, acquaintances, random chicks that walk by once and put their hands on my shoulder, everyone. 
i wonder if this is some kind of mental illness or im just touch starved, but it’s happened so much that i consider it to be a problem.
i’m a girl (bi) and most people this has happened with have been girls, too. 

has anyone else experienced this or know anyone who has? i just wonder if this is one occurrence or if there are others like me."
35,dealing with some issues.,"So, i'd like to start out by saying that i'm thirteen. Pretty young, I know. I've suffered no real life trauma, besides seeing a few gory images on the internet when I was about ten years old. I was generally safe online, but my curiosity got the best of me and I looked up something I shouldn't have.

But that's not relevant. My problem is the fact that I have issues with existential thoughts. How the universe is pointless, we're all going to die, and nothing that ever happens will truly matter. It's been messing with my mental state significantly, causing minor self harm (about a year ago, I don't harm myself anymore), stress issues, depression, and more recently, disturbing nightmares. I know it sounds edgy, but i'm here for genuine help. Not to be called a ""depressed emo kid"", so please keep those comments to yourself.

I've considered asking my parents if I could go to therapy, but I really don't want to make them worried. They're the kind of parents who won't leave you alone when something like that emerges, and i'm extremely introverted and alone time is critical for my health.

Should I go to therapy? Any advice? Worldviews that might change my thoughts? I'm an INFP if that helps."
36,easily irritated,"sorry for the lack of punctuation and proper grammar

does anyone else get really annoyed whenever someone does anything? like they could be talking about any random think nd in my mind im like god stfu no one cares, obviously i dont say that bc i hate being rude but its really annoying when im just tryna talk to someone and all i can think about is your so annoying stop. i always feel really bad when i think this so i overthink it when i get home or when im in my next lesson (used to). i know i can also be really annoying so i try not to ramble on about things but i guess i am now. i wouldnt be surprised if they thought the same about me lmao"

38,Am I delusional or is this normal?,"I had a dream a few nights ago that I got into a car accident and injured someone else in a car, when I woke up, I sincerely couldn’t remember if this happened (I woke up from this dream in the middle of the night so my brain was groggy) of course this never actually happened in reality I know that, last night I was watching a movie where that happened and again, (this was in the middle of the night 3 am - 3:30) I couldn’t remember if I’m reality I did. I don’t have these thoughts when I’m going about my day, just when I get groggy tired, in the middle of the night, not just with car accidents, also things like hitting deer, getting injured (myself) and breaking my arm or leg. Is this delusions?"
39,How to cope with an injury,So I've recently pulled a hamstring and the first couple of days were fine but as the weeks are progressing i have no energy mentally and physically I'm so done with this damn leg my doctor doesn't want me using crutches but it's getting to the point where I can't go a day without crying because I feel so helpless and stuck and it hurts like crazy and the feeling that I can't even do my regular things because of the pain and it doesn't help that I'm stubborn as hell
40,Feel like giving up,[deleted]
41,Has your mental health affected your memory?,"From as long as I could remember, my personality would do a 180 from the end of the year to the middle of the following year. During that time my anxiety would be severe. I'd cry easily without warning and for the pettiest thing. I'd have random but frequent waves of sadness and I would not have the motivation to do anything. I would just sit and do nothing. The frustrating thing about it is that I would become aware of it and give myself pep talks about how I need to be productive and the benefits that would come with getting into the task. However, whenever I would muster up the courage to start the task, it would be too difficult to do. It always baffled me because those tasks are what I would have had during the other part of the year. The task would have been tackled and succeeded with. Around this time of year it is too difficult. So, I asked myself ""why?"" Then i realised that my thinking ability had severely diminished and my memory was almost laughable, making any task extremely hard. Has anyone experienced this? Is there a way to fix it?"
42,Coronavirus,"I just need a place to rant my thoughts and feelings, I couldn’t think of anywhere else where people would give insight and not hostility

This situation were all in has made me realise something about myself, selfishness. Everyone I’ve talked to says this isn’t the time for it but is that really true. I can’t help but think about all the things that I am gonna miss out on or is going to be significantly worse for me:

My 2 month summer holiday that everyone at my age will have got in their lifetime, a ever looming recession that’s going to haunt my coming years where prosperity is supposed to happen, time spent with my girlfriend and friends.

I understand it’s not just me in this position, everyone is. But it still doesn’t fix the issue. My biggest fear is that the government isn’t being truthful and will extended my country’s lockdown further and further.

I have gone through so much progress in the last year with my mental health. As someone that’s suffered with depression and self harming you can understand stand why isolation scares me. The thing that hurts the most is it seems my government has disregarded mental health like it seems it normally does. 

I don’t really know what I’m looking for here, It just seems like people shrug off my thoughts. Maybe this social isolation is getting to me"

I know if you have suicidal thoughts you should go hut I’m not planning on acting on it so like I’m not sure"
45,Why is the voice in my head so mean?,It just tears me down.
46,"Very Hopeless, Need Some support","In 2018 near the end of the year, I ODed on 87% thc dabs and thought I was stuck in a time loop and possibly even died, I somehow managed to call an ambulance on myself where they told me I was fine. Ever since then I haven’t felt real and my anxiety/ocd I had before went up 10 fold. Have felt like I’ve been in a dream/disconnected for almost what seems like past a year and a half. Never was able to get help or anything because my parents wanted me to keep going and work and I never had time. Fast forward to today, I’ve gotten so in my head about everything that I don’t even feel like I know what’s real anymore. I have these fucked up ruminations where I’m scared I’ll become some mental fuck up I saw a while ago at work, and maybe even a killer or some kind of fuck up that’ll be locked up for the rest of my life. I’ve been trying to hang in there and have been taking natural supplements to combat whatever this fucked up shit is. I wanna buy a WRX, I want a girlfriend, I want to be happy...I want a normal life, but I’m scared I’m gonna turn out a killer or go crazy before any of that happens, I’ve felt so alone through all of this, I don’t even see or hear things that aren’t there but I have delusional/paranoid thoughts. Mostly if becoming things I don’t want to become. Society and the medical system has failed me. I don’t know what to do anymore. It feels like this is some kind of sick fucked up experiment. I just want my old life back and to feel happy for once. I don’t think I’ll ever get better and even while typing this to you all right now I don’t feel like myself anymore since after I’m pretty sure I had an ego death after that trip. I’ve lost hope long ago and even before this virus shit I’ve isolated myself for a while just to keep everyone else safe and because I just can’t even look at people anymore without fucked up thoughts I don’t wanna even commit. I’m just hoping there’s hope out there...I feel like I’m in a scary movie where the guy has gone crazy. I don’t wanna be crazy...I wanna just live my life..."

50,Should I get my brother (8M) to see a Psychiatrist?,"Hello Reddit!

First of all English is not my first language, sorry if you find some mistakes. 

I (24F) have a little brother. He lives in another country with my mom and my stepfather (his dad).
Me and my mom videochat daily, so even though I'm not living with them, I get to have an idea of their daily life.

A several months ago (not sure if more than 1 year) my brother started to develop a particular obsession with expiring dates. Every single thing he eats, he has to inspect the package, check the expiring date and always brings it to my mom for her to double check that the product is still good to eat. But it's not once or twice a day, we are talking about: he'll do that in the morning if he eats a cookie and 1 or 2 hours later if he wants another cookie from the same exact pack he'll do it over, ask moms, check again.. I feel that this is too obsessive for a 8 year old. As it has been going for several months.

He have another obsession, now about his personal hygiene. Everything he poops he'll spend a ridiculous amount of time cleaning his anus, with toilet paper, then wet wipes, sometimes even shower after to make sure it's really clean. This, again have been going for even more time then the expiring date. This is serious to the point he already got micro fissures on his anus from too much cleaning.


My mom is the kind of person that doesn't give much credit to mental illness, but I brought it up to her and she seems to be worried too. My daughter is only 3 months old so I don't have experience with toddlers or preschoolers as a mother. I don't have much experience with mental issues on kids.

Please tell me if you think that's a normal behavior for a child of if I should talk mom into taking him do see a doctor."
51,How to lower stress and anxiety levels during the coronavirus pandemic,"Remaining indoors can take a toll on our mental health especially those diagnosed with mental disorders here is a list of activities you can do in the comfort of your own home to cope better with the chaos around the world due to the coronavirus

52,"There's something really wrong with me, and I need help.","Hi, I (M,21) have been doing some self reflections because lately I've felt kinda off. Although to be honest, I've felt off for a while.

So I'll just spill out everything I've noticed and go from there, and it'll probably be me just rambling...

Firstly, I lie a lot. To everyone and anyone. I've never been caught or at least I've never been confronted. I lie about what I'm doing to sound like I'm a diligent worker. I lie about achievements and things that happen to me. Whether it's to illicit pity, support, or praise. I have even made myself breakdown and weep over a completely fabricated story. I have lied to family, acquaintances, and even my former partner. It felt really natural and I didn't even notice I was spewing lies until after I thought about it for a while. I lie about my past especially to make myself sound better than what I was or am. Mainly because no one would care about a graduating college senior that does nothing but watch youtube and waste on the computer. So I lie, and I'm genuinely astonished I haven't been confronted because it feels like i do it constantly. Honestly, I think I may be some type of narcissist or something because that's not normal. 

I also buy books that i never read just to ""impress"" which to be honest no one sees them so I guess it's just for me. I can't even stay focused long enough to read two pages without getting bored or distracted.

I also have very little motivation to do anything. I deal with depression, but this feels different because usually I can get myself to always do top quality college work and write a butt load since that's pretty much the only thing i think I'm any good at. My drive to do anything has just evaporated. It may be due to my grad school applications being denied. I used to think I was fairly intelligent, but honestly now I just feel so damn stupid since there's people out there with a better gpa, gre score, and actually got in. I didn't really have any other motivation to do anything but go to grad school since I'm interested in a very specialized sociological sub field that's ties into my personal interests. Regardless, I've just felt so inferior.

I also have no friends. It's completely my fault to be honest since I cut them out because I felt that they weren't interested in talking to me anymore and after any amount of contact I just write them off because I'm always afraid to initiate as I feel like I'm bothering or burdening them, so I just cut ties because of that.

I haven't made any friends either since I'm really reserved and hate being in social situations. Mostly I feel uncomfortable and end up leaving or quivering like a leaf. I'm actually pretty anti-social and generally try to avoid any and everyone. I even made sure that I declined going to my college graduation.

I am a terrible person, but I want to get better. I honestly wish I could go to therapy, but alas I have no health insurance. I went to a free religious counselor, but it didn't work out considering I'm an atheist. I thought about going to the counselor at my college, but found out from a professor who used to run the program they aren't very good, so here I am asking for any advice or suggestions."
53,"I have a theory about the growing anxiety surrounding mental health and self diagnosis, opinions?","Hi! 

So these thoughts have been running through my head a lot recently and I wanted to try and see if I can make sense of them in text. I’ve noticed for the first time in my life that every single person I know seems to struggle with some sort of anxiety disorder or depression, it’s always a conversation, and it seems everyone is self diagnosing (myself included), thinking back on the last year on social media mental health became a huge conversation. Every influencer / model I follow has spoken out about their struggle with anxiety / depression / etc. and it really caused me to look at myself, my habits, it had me wondering am I unhappy because I have some kind of imbalance? Do I need medication? Do I have Aspergers because of my inability to interact normally with people? What is wrong with me? Now since I started asking these questions I’ve been through the ringer with medications and doctors but this time quarantining I’ve really reflected and honestly I think my anxiety came from the need to find an explanation for my issues because that’s what everyone else is doing. Also I am a nanny and the little girl I watch who is only eleven is already claiming she is depressed, and she was exposed to social media a lot earlier in life than me. When I was eleven all I could think about was my next sleepover with my cousins and playing bratz! But as I got more sucked into social media and got into these deep conversations about mental health my anxiety grew because I felt I needed to get to the bottom of my unhappiness and I found that as I vented to my sister about my concerns she began to do the exact same thing and is now struggling more with her mental health than ever before and I feel so guilt like I’ve dragged her down with me and when I first went on medication one of my friends began to express that she wonders if she needs to. Now I actually get very anxious when people start to vent to me about their mental health because I have this theory that it is breeding fear and negativity in both parties. Am I even making any sense? I want to clarify that I am in no way trying to invalidate anyone’s experience I’ve just noticed these patterns in my own experience and I’m trying to understand it. Can anyone relate to this at all or am I just ranting nonsensically?"
54,I could be terminated,"TL;DR: Depression relapse has caused me to be ineffective at work. I might get fired within 30 days. Trying to figure out how to move forward without making myself anxious.

I saw on my supervisors desk a 30-Day Performance Improvement Plan with my name on it. She’s back to work tomorrow, and I know we’ll be having a conversation about it.

I started this job July of last year. I was doing really well, everyone was impressed with my performance at work.

But it has slowly... strained my mental and emotional well-being. It also did not help that my s.o got shipped out to Navy bootcamp before Thanksgiving, the same day I had to start a course for my masters degree.

She only noticed my poor work efforts and results last week, as I was out sick with bronchitis.

But I’ve known for awhile, and just could not figure out how to ask for help at work about it. Largely because of shame; particularly because 3 of my uncles work for the same company.

But, for awhile now, I have been ineffective at work. And I cannot focus. My turnaround is slow. I can barely find the motivation to work (I am underpaid, but even then money has never been a motivator for me), and when I do... I can’t hold on to that steam.

I’m trying to be careful now with how I speak to myself; being careful not to call myself lazy. I am seeing the edges of relapse (I have been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, Panic Disorder and PMDD). And I am trying to take ownership of my actions without blaming myself.

I cannot sleep right now because I am trying to mentally prepare for (re: dreading) tomorrow.

I’m just not sure how to approach the situation and move forward."

I have no idea. We are close though, its hard to place context in here. but its wrong... All I want to do is run away when it happens, and in the wake afterwards... When will I stop feeling like I want to run away and do the right thing? its hard. I have so many problems and flaws and struggles besides this. im scared i will kill her (hurt her) because of my own fear, my own desire to run
 
i dont know what to do. i just needed to vent my emotion"
57,Im about to have a mental or psychotic break,"I feel desperate and trapped right now. Well, I actually am.

Im living in one of those countries with declared confinement. This is really important. I cant leave the house unless for buying food. I CAN NOT look for another place to live.

One of my housemates is a f*****g b***h. The kind of person that is all the time telling the other what to do and how to do it. I think sharing a house is about everyone finding the shared things and places clean and well preserved. For example, if someone goes to the kitchen and needs to use a pan, it should be clean and people must so their best not to scratch it, etc.

She is constantly complaining about everything. Yesterday I was really tired and watching outside through the kitchen window standing of the window frame. She was bossy telling me not to do that because my hoodie was gonna get dirty. That day I had used the microwave and used one of this plastic covers to avoid splashes. I was gonna wash after lunch it afterwards, but I left it inside (small kirchen) face up so no grease felt into the microwave to avoid it to get dirty. She complained because I didnt rise it and leave it upside down. This was in a time lapse of 15 minutes. Now remember that we are in confinement.

She does not only complain about how things are left, but how we did it. Ive been living with her for a year and a half, but until a couple weeks ago I was writting my phd thesis, so I had other things in mind. I defended my thesis and the next day the confinement was declared. I never realized how unbearable is to live with her. When I moved here, I remember her telling me that she was looking for a housemate to see films with, to play board games, etc. None of the previous ones wanted to. There is another room in the house, and the three guys who lived here did the same than I do: stay all the possible time in the room to avoid contact with her.

Ive been meditating for the last 20 days and Ive realized that my jaw was tense. This is also important.

Last 4 nights have been a disaster. The first one I couldnt sleep until 8 am and slept for 3 hours. The next two I got up after 3 hours and couldnt sleep more. Today Ive only been able to sleep for 4 hours.

I think I cant sleep because I have so much confined anger. I wish I could get the fuck out of here, but Im literally confined. There might be a small chance of going back to my parents house (disobeying law), but it will be the same (overprotective parents). Also, my mum takes care of my grandma, and I dont want to take the risk just in case I have the disease.

My head has been hurting for the last days. I feel Im gonna break down. Im scared that all that contained rage could escape in a violent way making me break all the fucking stuff of the house.

Im glad Im virtually seeing my therapist tomorrow (i started seeing her for something totally unrealated about low selfsteem, etc). She once told me that tense jaw is a symptom of repressed rage. She will probably tell me how to deal with my rage, but still the problem is here: I cant leave the house. Id love to move somewhere else, but I just can't.

My head hurts because the lack of sleep. But I cant sleep. Im desperate. I have no fucking clue what to do. Im pretty scared of ending up having a psycotic break or something like that.

I dont know what to do."
58,Must I Go To A Therapist? (this ended up being long),"My girlfriend has been urging me to see a therapist because she says I'm showing many of the signs of depression that she had before she started seeing a therapist. I guess this started when the coronavirus stuff happened, but not because of the stay at home order or social isolation. I have no job, my friends are in college while I'm taking a gap year, so I basically stayed at home with my mom and two dogs all day except for the occasional shopping trip, so my life is the same except for the fact that everyone in my family now works or goes to school at home (note: my gf does not live with me, though we text a thousand times a day)

I got up early before this all started. After feeding the dogs and taking care of morning chores, I sit on the couch and go on my computer. I work for my mom, basically promoting her site on social media, then I browse Reddit and Tumblr for a bit before I suddenly REALLY HAVE TO SLEEP. It's like I'm hit with a wave of tiredness where I can't keep my eyes open. So my normal schedule involves a one hour nap. This slowly became a longer nap until my family members started working from home and I was suddenly ""sleeping"" from 8:30 till noon. Except I also have to get up and stop the dogs from barking so often. And I'm the go-to person for computer problems somehow, which my dad seems to have every 30 minutes. So it's not sleeping so much as frequently-interrupted unconsciousness. But no, I sleep all day and don't do anything around here.

I don't want to get up in the mornings anymore. I want to continue sleeping. I don't feel any reason to stop sleeping other than my family's ""You can't sleep all day, you have to get up."" Because of this, my girlfriend thinks I have depression and need help. Every time I tell her things will get better once I go to college. Things will get better when my family members go back to work/school. I don't see how a therapist will help. What will I tell my therapist that I haven't already told my girlfriend, what will they say that my girlfriend hasn't? 

She's the sole reason I bother to try, the reason I didn't give up long ago. The person who I can trust with everything, who I can tell everything. She makes me feel better somehow. Is this enough, or should I actually try to see a therapist, despite therapy being expensive and my lack of driving license, money, job, and faith that my parents will help me get help?"
59,Accepting life alone?,"How do I accept that I’ll probably end up all alone?

I cannot really say I have friends. I know a lot of people and I know how to morph myself into someone they like without losing a base personality (which I’m not even sure is real) but I doubt they’d care or support me for who I actually am. They usually come to me if they need help but more often than not they leave me out of the fun. I don’t mind (and very much enjoy) people out of their hard times but I want to have fun too. I know if I don’t put in the effort to talk to them, all of them will probably stop caring and forget I exist. Which I guess is ok because I don’t really have much to offer anyway but it still hurts. Everyone thinks I’m an extrovert, fun loving person who’s always around people and has a bunch of friends but it’s really not true. No one will really like me past the surface level and we really are different beneath the surface. I guess I’m just tired, I know I really don’t have any actual friends and I really doubt I will.

My parents are abusive and more or less hate me. Mentioned that they wanted me to die and that they’d be better off without me. Which I guess is completely fair, I again never have/had anything to offer them. 

I dated someone once and things were going ok for a week or so but than it was obvious that he was starting to get annoyed with me. The only time he ever actually acknowledged me was when something sexual was happening... broke up with him bc I didn’t want to have sex and bc it was obvious that I was bothering him. 

I’m just tired of trying. I create giant mazes around myself and people like me but I want actual friendships/relationships. Yet at the center of the maze there is nothing. I barely feel and when I do it’s almost always pain, sometimes anger. 

I’m tired of people, I’m tired of this world. I want to kill myself but I feel selfish doing that. I know I’m intelligent and capable of helping so many people in the world. It’s the only thing that keeps me from slitting my wrist right now... I’d regret not trying to lessen the sufferings of others globally.  

But it still hurts. I seek to not be alone but I know (and past experiences have shown) that I always will be. I have never fit in and I really cannot see myself actually fitting in anywhere. No matter how much I try to be like everyone else, I somehow manage to stand out as abnormal. I’ve come to accept that I am abnormal but how do I accept and come to terms with being alone for the rest of my life? How do I give up on my one secret desire that I’ve head forever (and this probably sounds pathetic) of actually being liked and feeling wanted?"
60,How to not lose your mind,"This whole quarantine thing is making me extremely antsy, angry, stressed, anxious, and paranoid. I don’t go back to school, until god knows when, I have no hobbies. I’m 20 days in and I’m officially losing my mind. I feel like I want to commit suicide. I know I won’t but I’m panicking here. If the rest of the year is like this I’m going to go crazy. How do I regain my sanity. How do I not lose my cool? Please help me because I’m desperate for answers"
61,Oh god He’s stressing me out but I don’t want to be mean.,"So my partner has theses random outbreaks, he sends me long messages or says “hey we need to ya all” or “can I talk to you?” It’s scary when I see that pop up on my screen, I let him vent &amp; they’re always so long, they’re of him saying he’s losing it, &amp; 
 I want to help him believe me, but all this stuff from the quarantine to online school, it stresses me out, they way I deal with stress is hurting/ inflicting harm on to myself, I want to say all the cliché consoling things that people say “it’s ok,” “I’m here for you” all that crap, but I feel like a broken record, I want to snap at him &amp; tell him all this stuff that I think but I don’t really feel about it, when I get stressed I get mad or moody &amp; I say stuff I don’t mean, it’s just the heat in the moment, &amp; I don’t want to do that especially since he’s very vulnerable/ emotional when he’s with me. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been eyeing my old harming tools, even though I through them out ages ago, this stuff of what I think comes back to haunt me. I love him but I don’t think I can handle a person that is this mentally unstable."
62,Family issues.,"Living with my parents, I am the only one son. My mother doesn't stop to feed me, she cooks like two or three steaks and she wants me to eat all. I've tell her several times, politely and keeping calm that she should not do that, that is not even healthy for me to wake up from bed to work and have to eat 3 bacon and 2 fried eggs. Yesterday I just could not resist no more and I had a very big argument with her, I shouted at her and obviously she shouted at me, I am feeling bad about it now because she also goes through depressive problems all life but I dont know how to make her understand. I've never been bossy with her ordering her food or requesting her to have food at the table at certaing hour, I've just tell her to cook if she wants and leave it on a plate and If I want I'll eat but still she even yesterday approached me while I was eating with the pan in the hand still hot to throw another bacon steak in the plate and that was what it make me go out of my head. I don't know what to do. If you speak nice no listening and if you speak wrong obv no listening."
63,Seasonal affective disorder and quarantine.,Does not getting enough sunlight affect your mood? How are you guys handling it now?
64,Why do I keep suddenly remembering suppressed memories?,"A lot of the memories have to do with things my emotionally abusive dad has said or done. I just moved out of his household 3 weeks ago. I keep remembering things out of nowhere, like the one time he choked me. I hate it. My mental health is horrible and I really don't need these things on my mind."
65,Being a student sucks right now.,"I'm a student in the UK at the moment. 

My university closed a few weeks ago due to the virus, and I am not taking it well in the slightest. My course is all to be done remotely. All my exams have been replaced with piles and piles of coursework. Due to the specifics of my course certain things have to be done on the university computers, but there's a 1 second delay while writing to them remotely, which at least halves my productivity.

I suffer from anxiety and find uni work difficult anyway, so with all of this added stress on my work I've sort of just ceased to function. The sight of anything university related sends me into a downward spiral at the end of which I end up literally lying in bed and curling up into a ball.

On top of this my flatmate who works for the NHS came home from work with a note pretty much saying that anyone who lives with an NHS worker is almost certain to catch the virus. Lucky me.

I really cannot handle any of this at the moment and I just need a break, but from what I can tell it isn't a possibilty."
66,I want to cry again,"I can't remember the last time I had cried I was a child but I would have been really young. I remember even when my parents told us about their divorce when I was 10 years old my brother, my sister, mom and dad were all crying and I just didn't care and went back to playing on the computer like nothing happened. I find it really hard to express my emotions to people and to myself. I just have never really had anyone in my life that I could trust on that level to be that open, and I think that my inability to handle my emotions properly has really effected me in some negative ways. sometimes my mostly genuine happy demeanor feels like a facade. I don't ever really feel sad anymore, just indifferent and it is mentally messing with me a lot. I really wanted to go see a therapist about this and I was making arrangements to see one soon but then the covid lockdowns happened and everything got canceled on me. 

That all being said, I'm not a person who is at any risk to themselves. I'm just really at this tipping point of really wanting to understand how to develop emotions and manage my emotions in a healthy way that is beneficial because Ive recently come to realize how much it's actually held me back in life, and I guess I've been blocking my own emotions for so long that I don't really remember how to have them anymore."
67,There’s no reason for me to be this sad.,"I’m on mobile, so formatting may be off.

Tw/ suicide, abuse 

I’m suicidal. I don’t have a set plan, so I guess it’s more ideation. I literally think about dying every night as I fall asleep. It’s been like that for a few months. The thing is, I’ve been this low before, but it always made sense previously. I had a really tormented childhood. It was really, really rough and I experienced a lot of constant physical and sexual trauma through my adolescent years. 

But my life is so good now. I’ve moved away from all my abusers. I have a decent job. I’m engaged to the most wonderful person I have ever met, and even found a family for myself who (I think) truly, honestly love me. 

But I want to die. Remembering all of the good just makes me feel that much more selfish and terrible for feeling this way. I feel like a burden to my fiancé and my best friends. I have so many “triggers” and I feel like it must be annoying to spend time with me. And my fiancé deserves so much happiness and just everything good in the world, but he’s stuck with me, someone who seems to always be on the brink of crying or re-living some trauma that happened years ago.

And that’s another thing, despite being a few years past the terrible things that have happened to me, they still effect me so much. I still get so upset over the things that I experienced- and it feels like I’ll never get over it and it’ll never end. It’s preventing me from enjoying all the life I have now. It’s so exhausting and frustrating and I just want it to end. I feel like I have no escape. 

So I want to die. The only reason I think I haven’t tried anything yet is because I think of my fiancé finding me dead and my baby brother being told what happened and I feel too guilty to ever do that to them. But I want it so bad and I’m afraid one night I’ll get low enough to where that thought won’t stop me.

Am I just a big baby? Is something wrong with me? Why can’t I get over my past and just be grateful? I hate myself for it.

I don’t know what to do. Thanks for listening."
68,Low self esteem,"Hello there, i am dealing with really low self esteem, it’s affecting my relationship and career. I will start working on it with a therapist but want to see if anyone here has a book suggestion that could help? Thank you! X"
69,What could this be ?,"So first, i know i can’t get diagnosed on reddit lol but i just wanted to see some opinions . 
I am a 17 year old girl and i was diagnosed with GAD, OCD and Tourette’s . For as long as i know i sometimes had a lot of trouble going to sleep ( indeed sometimes it was because of my anxiety or intrusive thoughts ) but other times i just can’t get myself to do it, and if i do try to lay in bed and wait to fall asleep it’s just almost impossible, i’ve always found sleep so boring and i always wanted to do something else . I also have restless legs syndrome and i feel the urge to always move my legs. Just sitting there and looking at the ceiling while trying to fall asleep it’s so annoying and boring i just want to jump out of bed . I always imagine scenarios in my head and sometimes this gets me through but most of the time my mind won’t shut down . The thing is that i don’t feel anxiety behind this, i just feel agitation and restlessness, like the need to do something . It’s not that i’m going to bed too early either, it’s actually the other way, i can only force myself to go to bed at at least 4am and then it takes me like 2 hours or more to fall asleep . Do you have any idea what this could be ?"
70,Little poem,"*trigger warning*  
  
-Can’t be freed -

We’ll live together in a sweet home 

Sitting remembering the good times 

While I sit in with my clouded head 

The fog filling in 

Blocking since 

Home I am not 

I’m in a endless hell 

A hell I created 

No where but down 

Can not see up

I feel no hope 

She left me along time ago 

Falling deeper and deeper 

Can not be saved from my demons 

I may tame them for a short while 

Yet I will never be free 

Because they will always come back 

Come back to torment me 

Free I can not be 

Will never be"
71,Is this a good enough message to let my therapist know I need help but not to panic her? Do you have any suggestions on how I could better this email?,"
Mrs. ———-,

I hate to bother you again, but I am need of your professional opinion.

First, I’ll start off by giving you a little background into why I’m emailing you. As I stated in my last email, I have been working hard to better my mental state by trying to keep up with my school work, taking walks, and forcing myself to not self isolate. I know I have mentioned during a few of our appointments that my family has had some issues in the past, but things are going great with them now. 

That is where I’m having trouble. I started medicine less than a week ago but I’m feeling pretty hopeless. Everything in my life is good right now, but I am still struggling. 

I certainly don’t want you to be alarmed, but I have been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately. I don’t think it is a result of my medicine because I’ve been struggling for a while, but I’m slightly concerned about how the thoughts will influence my behavior. 

Again, I am not trying to worry you. Just thinking about how impulsive I can be I am a bit concerned for the future.  

Do you have any suggestions of what actions to take to work on this?"
72,I don't know if I should increase my Wellbutrin dosage now.,"Hey guys. So long story short, im on 150 mg of Bupropion SR. My doctor wants to up my dose to 300mg. I told her that with all this Covid-19 crisis, i'd prefer staying on the 150mg for the time being, and when all the dust more or less settles, i'll up my dose to 300. So she faxed the new prescription to my pharmacy, and said when i'm ready, they will have the prescription, and to stay on 150 until im ready.

I went to fill my prescription today, got home, and realized that they gave me 300mg instead of 150. I called, and they're asking me to call my doctor, so she can fax them the details, because they only have 300mg on file now. Super frustrating, but eh, im sure any health worker is beyond stressed now.

My question is, if I decide to just start taking the 300mg tomorrow, will I have more startup side effects? I deal with anxiety as well as depression (i've already heard everyone saying that wellbutrin isn't good for anxiety, but it works for me, doesn't give me much more anxiety). When I first started wellbutrin, I was already in an anxiety crisis,so I don't know if the Wellbutrin gave me any more anxiety than I was feeling when I started it. I'm thinking that maybe this is a good time to start my new dose, because if there is any increased anxiety as a result, well at least i'm stuck at home. But i'm also kinda handling this covid situation really well with my mental health, and I don't want to jeopardize that by starting any higher dosage.

I know it's my decision in the end, but what are your guys' thoughts? Making decisions myself is always difficult."
73,"The gun comes in tomorrow, I hope I don't do anything stupid.","Tomorrow's me and my dad to to pick up the new gun. We've never had one in the house, but given the circumstances it's a precaution. I don't know what we're expecting; looting? Robbery? I don't know. All I know is if I end it this way, he'll blame himself. I'm so scared i don't think I'm strong enough. I need a way out of this."
74,i think i have trust issues,"i take things rlly personally a lot and the little negative things ppl say rlly get to me. ive had a few falling outs w a few close friends in the past bc theyve broken my trust or were just horrible to me. i feel like this has caused me to not trust ppl i meet, like im rlly scared to say something wrong or voice my opinion bc in the past ive always been punished for it. i just need some reassurance"
75,Anyone else exhausted by the discrimination you have faced because of the label of “mentally ill”?,"Story time: When I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD. Since then, I’ve gotten a lot better and would even say I feel ok again. Last year, my dr told me I don’t even qualify for a current diagnosis due to my lack of symptoms.

But the issue is that the label of being mentally ill still haunts me. I was a volunteer firefighter, and the dept I worked for fired me when they found out about my history. I required no accommodations and could do my job.My former psychiatrist even wrote a letter advocating for me, saying that the issues weren’t current. But all of that didn’t matter.

Whenever people find out about my label, I am viewed as weaker and as less of a person. It’s awful and frustrating. At times I feel like all the progress I have made is for nothing, because all people see when they find out is the broken kid that I was, not who I am now.

Can anyone else relate?"
76,Any recommended online therapist/therapy sites?,I'm just looking to make the most of the time indoors. Anyone know a good place to find someone professional to talk to?
77,Family slowly draining my will to live,"I've been depressed for the last few years (am currently 17). I tried to tell my parents and brothers when I first noticed myself feeling down for days at a time for absolutely no reason. Both told me to stop whining and that people with real depression are the ones overseas struggling for their lives (my family is middle-eastern and strict Muslims). This initial reaction got me to stop talking about it for 5 years. 5 years of a weight dragging me down. I kept on going, graduated top of my class from my high school, worked 30 hours per school week and was on a school sports team. The sports were probably what kept me going the most and my job(s) definitely have/had their moments as well. Throughout my years of high school I became pretty independent, never really needed my parents money (they're broke anyway), never needed help with school, and once I got my drivers license and started paying them to use their car I was all set. Everything was actually going pretty great for a solid few months. I even graduated this past January a semester early. Then my parents caught me smoking weed (January). My dad was definitely angrier about it than my mom but I honestly didn't care. I told him I was going to keep smoking weed and there's absolutely nothing he can do about it. I paid for everything I own with my money, I offered to move out immediately, and he still kept trying to come up with punishments. I don't know why or how but I snapped. I began yelling at him demanding that he stands up and throws the first punch. Him and my mom kept spouting the same religion crap they always say to justify their actions and I let him know that I truly do not give a fuck and that if he wants to keep talking to me or do anything to me he was going to have to try and fight me first. I am bigger and stronger than him and I am 100% sure if he had actually tried to do anything that day at that particular moment I would've killed him on the spot and felt no remorse. I did actually threaten to kill him when he said he would call the cops on me if he thinks I am smoking again. Anyway we haven't talked in almost 3 months now and I am absolutely fine with it. We just ignore each other now and yet somehow it feels exactly the same as before the argument. If he had been supporting me through anything I had gone through in the last 5 years then maybe when he came to punish me I might've just taken it. But he wants to talk to me about how smoking weed is going to ruin my life? I'd been smoking weed for almost 2 years before he caught me, got straight A's while maintaining a job and doing a sport and he never noticed. If I am going to hear a lecture about how I'm throwing my life away I'd rather it be from someone who actually knows a damn thing about what I'm doing in my life. He spends more time at work (not working or making money from it, just staying there to not come home) than he does at home and has absolutely no right to judge me. My mom at least understood the first time I said I wasn't going to stop smoking and didn't pursue it any further with me. I got accepted into a few decent colleges and my made my choice on a school that is well within driving distance from my house (both brothers actually drove there when they attended). I'm paying for my own education and between scholarships and aid everything except housing/meals is pretty much covered for me. My mom insists that I live at home and save the money. However, my home life has become so toxic that I don't know if I will survive another year of this shit. I am applying for housing and will continue working through college to pay the loans off a little faster. Living at home might be an option after a year away but for now, I can't wait to leave. However, having no moral/emotional support to live on campus is draining me even more. No matter what I try to do in life I feel like my mom in particular is always inadvertently working against me. I had never cussed at my mom with the intention of harming her before this year. The things she says infuriate me to a point where I can no longer hold back. I used to love my religion but the way she uses it to justify her being a terrible person and raising 3 terrible people (myself included) is making me hate it more than I thought possible. I hope the situation will cool off eventually but I am tired of going out of my way to fix people who are too stubborn and stupid to understand anything that's going on from a point of view other than the ones drilled into them by the shitthole countries they come from. As of now, I hate my family, I hate my heritage, and I hate my life. The only thing really keeping me afloat are my friends and the hope that one day I will be in a much better spot and will be able to smoke a fat blunt in their face before I leave the state never to be seen again (by them at least). I know that the chances of anyone actually reading this are slim but I have no one else I can talk to without feeling like I am poisoning them too.

79,Research recruitment: Social Media Narrative and Mood,"Hi!

We are a research group from University College London and the Anna Freud Centre and are conducting a small study on how one’s digital social media narrative may relate to our mood.

There is more and more interest in how we present ourselves on social media and our previous studies have looked at this through other platforms.

For this study, we are interested in individuals who suffer from low mood or depression and who use social media.  The study has ethical approval from UCL

There will be very little for you to do.  
All your data will be kept secure and safe. We will also share the findings from the study with you.

81,Takes me thirty minutes to fall asleep,"Does anyone else have trouble falling asleep? I can’t tell if this is totally normal or not but it takes me like half an hour to fall asleep. I usually get distracted by thoughts and end up going down a rabbit hole of bad thoughts, which causes me to be afraid to go to sleep at times since I don’t want to think those thoughts. I think it’s due to my ADHD or/and anxiety but I’m not sure if it could be something else."
82,Weird Grief Dream,"The other night I had a very upsetting dream. As a little background info, my father died for reasons related to drugs/mental health 4 years ago. In my dream, I was at my grandparents house -where my dad was living at the time of his death- and I was chatting with my grandma in the kitchen. Out of nowhere, my dad walked into the kitchen like nothing ever happened. I don’t remember the details because it was a dream, but I remember feeling really angry with him and asking him over and over “Where were you? Why did you leave me?”. It was like I made up this scenario in my head that he had faked his death and he had finally decided to come back. Overall, it was very upsetting. And the worst part was waking up the next morning and knowing it wasn’t real. It brought me back to the first few weeks after he died when it hadn’t fully become a part of my reality yet."
83,Emotional Abuse Still Leaves Scars,"﻿Emotional abuse literally drives you crazy. You constantly think you’re overreacting or that maybe you did deserve the abusive behavior. My father is an attorney so I’ve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it’s very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.

&amp;#x200B;

 I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren’t abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn’t interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn’t “fun” enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren’t from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest.

84,"Feeling of powerless, and wanting to be in charge of any situation, feeling I can get away with anything? What's wrong with me?",What's wrong with me?
85,Early exposure to sexual activity.,"Yesterday I managed to recover a memory from my childhood, completely at random. It’s one that seems to have evaded all my thinking since it happened about 12 years ago. When I was around 7/8 I used to have a babysitter - S (this isn’t where you think it’s going), she was a saint and I remember her to this day. She would babysit me, my friend T (who was two years older) and another girl who’s name - or initial, I can’t remember. S would often take us three to Tim’s house or the girls house and we would all play there or do homework etc. 

I have a distinct memory of one afternoon where S must have been distracted, I also have no recollection of T so I presume he was also unavailable. I’m not sure what kind of detail I should/can go into here given the context. But I am sure beyond doubt that on that same evening me and the girl engaged in some sexual activities - nothing like how adults do I mean. I mean more in a sense of exploration. Now it bothers me to wonder how this situation came about - I know it happened with certainty but I’m not sure why my mind has repressed it for so long (if that’s what has happened?). Naturally, it is not often that two 8 year old kids will become sexual with each other.

It begs me to think that since I have no recollection of the girl other than she exists, could she have maybe been slightly older and coerced me into what happened? I know she wasn’t in my class, I’m not even sure if we went to the same school - so it’s a possibility. I have recently discovered I have a couple of suspected mental health problems, namely some form of anxiety disorder, OCD and (possibly) imposter disorder, I’ve never really thought too hard about my mental health so I’ve always shrugged off my feelings as mood swings etc. Could there be a link between these?"
86,My friend is stuck in her own mind? What should she do? What can I do to help her?,"Dear psychologists who always give out the advice that patients of mental health illness should visit psychological doctor to have suitable psychotherapy. you also say that mental disorder patient should call close relation such as parents, close friends for help. But I am just wondering that, exactly, in my close friend’s case, does it help when the major factor leading to her current situation comes from her family? I know as the only one who understand her the most right now, I should help her get out of stuck but how could I help more rather than just listening to what she says. Still being a student in college, I have no financial security yet, live on my parents and do not work part-time, therefore I cannot take her to psycho doctor. Let me brief a little bit about her situation:

What are they like?
We are in Southeast Asia, you know, “men-preferred” tradition in a normal striking-traditional family and parents always care much for their image among surrounding people, living up to the majority ignoring their own personality, rather than living for themselves. Any language oppose to her parents or just share her opinion that is different from her parents thought, or her decision could make her parents lose face with others, she would be considered as undutifulness, ungratefulness toward her parents “who bearing and rearing her”. 
Growing up in a men-preferred family, her elder brother is very unthoughtful, and very patriarchal. He does not care for what he says that hurts her. When it is the case, her parents say that he is just a oblivious one, he did not hurt her deliberately, he just tells the truth, he is just a little bit rudely but he is kind, he will forget it later and never mind it. And she, the patient, is considered as vindictive or overthinking to pin the hurt and fasten on him. She was slapped on face by her elder brother for switching the TV channel to what she liked from the channel her brother was watching

What they made her?
A unselfconfident girl, disorientation, suspicious about her abilities, do not know what to do to prove herself, do not know what to live for, what she was born for,...
Her brain is overwhelming with many bad memories. She usually comes to me and releases her emotion, I do not know what to do rather than just listen to her. I live quite far from her, so we just can inbox each other, and sometimes set a date to hangout eating with each other. 
In our country, mental health is not cared for enough. And my friend cannot truth others, she always suspicious about everything, she said she just a critical-thinking one, she just thinks about more than a single side. Also, she does not believe that psycho doctors could do anything to help her. She thinks that what they do is just to relieve her mind, but truth still is the truth, no-one could manipulate it. And even she could visit a doctor, she could not stop thinking that her ability is bad in relation with others, she is not preferable, she does not deserve welcome because she is negative, no one wants to communicate with a pessimistic person.

So, what should we do?
As the one who overcame this mental illness do you have any advice?

I just wanted to know if there's anything you use to help with your Mental Health? Like stress balls or other things? And why it helps."
88,I've given up on life but I'm not suicidal,"Title says it.   


I used to have passion, drive, energy. I would set goals and I was committed. No matter what, I was not a quitter. If I fell off the horse, I would get back on. Then, something changed, not entirely sure what. I suppose stress from the Military, issues w/ my body (injuries from PT), and finances played a huge role.   


These days, I live with various amounts of depression. Some days I feel good, some days I feel horrible. Usually for no explainable reason other than that's just how I woke up. But consistently, I have very little goals or ambitions for the future, I don't plan for the future. I don't exercise like I used to and I used to love being in the gym. It's like I've gotten tired of fighting so I just quit.  I'm not suicidal, suicide thoughts to me are like thinking about playing a Nickleback song. The thought is there, but I don't do it. So I just go through life depressed, often with little desire to do anything.   


Idk what to do about it. I'm considering I go see a mental health professional but I'm afraid I'm going to be super vulnerable then end up feeling worse. I don't like to talk about my feelings."

90,I feel fat,"I’m 5’2/158 cm and about 47kg/103 pounds. It’s only about 3kg/10 pounds more than my lowest but feels like I’ve put a ton of weight on.

I eat well. My partner makes sure that I have my three meals a day. This morning I tried exercising indoors since, y’know, lockdown and quarantine. It feels stupid but I couldn’t touch my toes and that’s what triggered all the rest. 

For the past week we’ve both been trying to be positive, call family regularly, read, anything but let the thoughts take over and that’s what did it.

I feel stupid. And more than anything, I feel fat again. It keeps going round and round, reminding me of how massive my stomach is, that I don’t deserve the food in my fridge or the loving person by my side. That I’m so stupid and useless, that I should work harder, or I’m going to get fired, and I’ll fail my degree, and maybe then everyone will see that I’m a massive failure."
91,Theories of Dual Diagnosis Prevalence,"Individuality is the barrier that makes people different. The way a person thinks, feels and acts are the things that make someone unique. Some may choose how they live; some will just go with the flow. Others may enjoy something will others may not even see the slightest fun underneath it. https://article-directory.org/article/696/11/Theories-of-Dual-Diagnosis-Prevalence"
92,"I'm scared, feel like a failure, and want to give up - and the timing is awful.","TW: Abuse? Toxic workplace. Depression/anxiety. Suicide. 

For context, I work at a grocery store. First paragraph is kind of backstory because I'm emotions and not sure how to explain things without it. Probably TMI. 

Nearly a year ago I left a five year relationship I'd been wanting to leave for a couple of years, but was scared to because it gave me security in somewhere to live, which is something I hadn't had since I was about 12. This relationship was okay at first, I moved interstate to live with them for a few years, but it kind of quickly became emotionally and sexually abusive. I had moved to a new state, had no friends, no family here, and any attempts at making new friends had made my partner extremely jealous. Eventually I got a job with him, but was never taken seriously because coworkers often saw me as being favouritised because my partner at the time was a supervisor on the same department as me (didn't have any part in hiring me). I ended up losing shifts, trying to switch to other stores, only to end up back where I was because workloads and staff were shifting and I had a limited area of stores I could work at. 

After a few significant events, suicide thoughts/attempts and therapy, I realised this relationship was harmful to me, and I moved interstate again (to a new city altogether) to live with family. 

At first things were fantastic, I was taken seriously at work, and managers were telling me I had potential. I felt valued at my workplace for the first time ever, and it felt amazing. I was putting in extra time, taking extra shifts, earning enough money to actually live off, but most of all I was actually, genuinely happy. I was good at what I was doing, I loved it, I loved my coworkers, I loved coming to and being at work. 

Unfortunately after a few months, near Christmas, we had some manager changes and I had some family problems (family were trapped in bushfires four hours away from me, we had to put down family pets, family members were in/out of hospital), and this interfered with me being able to attend work. Everything has significantly gotten worse since then, our new manager is well, interesting I guess. He pushes off any and all jobs to whoever he can for the day, often putting the same jobs onto multiple people through the week. This has resulted in a lot of trouble because I'll be told I'm running x, but other person has been told that manager has said they never told me I'm running x, but I was never personally told otherwise.  Our store manager was never really someone to talk to about it, I had tried to speak to them before about under-staffing of shifts I was running, and that it was burning me out quickly. 

All of a sudden people were under the impression I was doing y and saying z about them, and it was causing conflict. I've learned from therapy that I have people pleasing tendencies, I don't like conflict, and I tried to clarify and fix these situations, but this often made it worse? After this, my shifts had been cut back from 36 hours (having to give up a really loved pet I no longer had time for due to the hours) and the need for me to do more, but I'd be going into overtime, to my base hours of 16. I was trying to save up for a car at this time, as I normally walk/use public transport, but my family was looking to move somewhere this wouldn't be possible, even if I switched stores.

I went from one month, unofficially running a department (unpaid for it) because I was the only one (they admitted) who knew what to do, proficiently, to then not running it, but being expected to run it one day, then not run it, and having that decision flip flopped on a day to day basis without being told until after my shift, where I would be yelled at every shift for not doing what my supervisors had wanted. I'm not sure how I was expected to know what to do when my job role was never clear to me? I'd try asking before doing, only to be told to just do my job and not waste time asking. I eventually asked to step back from managing shifts in my department of expertise. 

The other week we had a particularly stressful shift I was forced to take charge, because no one else was available. Essentially we had 12 hours of work to do in 2.5, with 2 people including myself. The manager knew we had this much work, and made no attempt at trying to get more staff in to help, even though budget could afford it. I was so overwhelmingly stressed from this shift that 2 hours in I had severe abdominal pain to the point I was almost blacking out. My manager was refusing to let me go home until the work was done. I was later told by my GP that it sounded very likely that an ovarian cyst had burst. This was before COVID shut downs and I was unable to get imaging to confirm this. Additionally, I was yelled at several times by several coworkers for not doing things the way they wanted to, when I wasn't aware of how they wanted to do things until afterwards, even though I was communicating with them throughout the shift trying to ask what they wanted/if they were okay with x/etc. (This is a recurring problem, with coworkers saying yes but changing their mind and not notifying me - only for management to tell me that was my fault for not communicating with them)

Week before last I had to call in to several shifts due to family again, sisters being pulled out of school due to COVID, family unable to organise time off work for them or babysitting. Way my family is, it's kind of a no choice if they want you to do something. Then was told the night before my other shift of the week that my family was going into quarantine, and if I wanted to continue working I had to organise somewhere else to live. I had to take the next day off to organise a living situation so that I could continue to work. Later I was messaged by my manager saying that if I wanted to keep taking days off then I should consider changing from part time to casual, and he refused to approve my leave to be paid, but offered me the option to take time off. I asked if I could take time off, and was then told to call 000 if I was experiencing issues, not him. I have now found out that he is now telling people that I am verbally abusing him, calling him lazy, incompetent, telling him he doesn't know how to do his job. 

I finally had a complete mental breakdown, took the next week off (had to ask new store manager to approve my leave - he is mostly aware of the situation, but is only temporary and I feel he doesn't like me so much and he never saw me when I had any real work ethic left)  and asked other stores if I could transfer. Today I got word that no other stores are accepting transfers because everyone has just done mass hires because of COVID. I'm scared that asking for these transfers will affect me at work further. 

I'm at my wits end. I don't know what to do. I can't take leave or quit my job because my manager refuses to I can't afford to pay for my basic necessities, and family can't help me because they're having their pay cut. Nowhere is hiring. I'm having severe mental breakdowns even thinking about having to go back to work. I've been thinking extremely negative thoughts about myself, and about how maybe things would be easier if I just took my months worth of antidepressants and locked myself in my car, not that I'd have the guts to hurt myself. The thoughts just scare me, and there is no support available because everything is shutting down. I feel like I'm failing being at basic adult things, and that everything that's happening is all my fault. I'm not getting sleep, I'm sleeping into the day, I'm not eating. I have so many bills due and I just want to give up. 

TLDR:

* Struggle with severe anxiety/depression
* Moved to new city with family 
* Was appreciated at work, did well 
* Events happened in personal life, resulting in me not being able to attend work
* Went from being praised and with max hours a week to minimum hours a week
* Constantly verbally abused by coworkers, rumours being spread
* No clear role anymore at work 
* Manager being abusive and rumour spreading 
* Several mental breakdowns, panic attacks before shifts
* Have been crying before/during/after every shift for the past three months
* Trying to leave, being denied
* Bills to pay, grateful to have a job but I'm mentally struggling, no other financial options
* Stress of everything is making me want to kill myself
* Don't know what to do, will take any suggestions/feedback, please help"
93,Have you used a mental health app to deal with Covid-19?,"Hi all,

I'm a journalist at the New Scientist and I'm writing a story about mental health apps, like Headspace and Talkspace. The story was originally about these apps in general and whether they work, but we've now reframed it around the current pandemic. 

Alot of these apps are offering free trials right now and providing free access to healthcare workers. Was hoping to talk to someone who has used one of these apps in the last few weeks about their experience. 

What did you like about it? What did you not? 

Would be so grateful for any help! We can talk by pm or you can email me on [jason.murugesu@newscientist.com](mailto:jason.murugesu@newscientist.com) 

Thank you again!

94,[serious] Young (29yo) and unemployed doctor with suicide ideas,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me or hurting myself. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, went throught hell doing that, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they academically evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move or look for job, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time for refusing. I want to fight the stupid pandemic, but at least want to be paid if my life is being risked, NOT EVEN NEW YORK IS OFFERING ME THAT CHANCE (I already tried to reach hospitals). they fucking need doctors right now and here I am unemployed and still no responses.

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from committing suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughly"
95,I need help/suggestions,"Hello, I'm probably going to ramble and get off topic because I have so much to say and I kinda just want someone to understand honestly. Sorry if this really unorganized but I would like to share everything that has been wrong in my mental health. 

For as long as I can remember I have been this ""robot"" I no way to tell what or how I'm feeling, I have emotions but I can never tell how I'm feeling because in all honesty it doesn't ""feel"" like I feel anything, like I'm just empty (I don't known if I have always been like this or it just has been somewhat recent.) I have been going to therapy for a while and it hasn't done anything for me at all. It further just points at things that are wrong with me, that I have already known but I cant fix them worth shit. Don't get the impression that I don't try to fix my problems because I try my absolute hardest. I like my therapist but I have told her what still goes on and it almost seems like she doesn't listen to me or even give me guidance to help me. I'm also completely locked out of my own brain. I have no way to know what I'm thinking or what my brain is up too. For example I never know what I'm going to say, I think of the first word and then it just goes from there, sometimes I even surprise my self from what I say because I wont even know I was ""feeling"" or thinking that way or I'll say some smart shit that sounds like I already knew something but in my own head it just seems like I made it up on the spot. Honestly it's like there is multiple me's in my brain and they all just control a part of my emotions and thoughts and let very little information go to my concision. Another main problem is I don't know how to relax or focus on me, I am constantly putting everyone in front of me. I never do things with the thought of me, I can't do anything that will truly help me relax as for I have really bad buyers remorse and get bored and impatient very easily. The only thing that makes me ""feel"" something is working out. These are just examples of whats wrong with my mental health, trust me there is plenty more. I really wish I could explain things better I just don't know how to say it.

I'm kinda on my last limb here and I would like guidance on where I should start. I really want to see someone that could diagnose me with whatever I have or am going through. I'm extremely lost and confused about my mental health and every year it seems to get progressively worse. It's also probably gonna be difficult to see someone due to the corona virus.

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
96,I think I have ADHD and I don't know what to do,"I (23M) have difficulty in focusing on something for too long. When I'm watching lectures online, I inevitably open another tab and start watching YouTube videos. I cannot concentrate on the work I'm doing. I'm starting a career in Data Science and it requires me to learn complex algorithms that I'm finding difficult to keep up with.

I first ignored it as a sign of procrastination but this is affecting my career now and I'm worried that I won't be able to succeed. 


It was work at first but now I can't even watch a full movie without opening reddit or Instagram on the side

I know this not serious as other mental problems but I would like some advise on how to handle without medications. My country is not big on mental health and I don't want to go to a Psychologist since my dad is one and I'm afrad he would find out about it"
97,I hope I do what I need to do now..,"I been partying too hard lately, I've been escapin my whole life.

Well, I met somebody recently who I think has changed my life. A great ass friend, my god I love him. I had a breakdown, and nothin went over well. We might reconcile but I'm not gonna be placing any bets.

It left me with one stubborn lesson... That the consequences of my actions have led me to a lonely night and one less option and one less person.

It feels like too monumental of a job to even get up most days for me, so I'm hopin I'll be workin pretty soon and learning to unwind and trash away the habits and thoughts embedded into me that hold me back.

I'm scared, but I'm hopin' this mental illness shit don't take me away soon.

Anyway, thanks for reading this whoever. I hope you've got things to look forward to.. Awe hell, you know you do even if they aren't around the corner just yet.

- sincerely, Tylo"
98,Gaps in memory,"I'm hesitant to ask this under mental health, because I'm not certain if it's physiological or psychological. I want to know if anyone else experienced this and if they had some diagnosis for something similar.

I've turned 30 this year, but for the past 4 years I've been having some problems with my memory. I quite literally never remember what I ate the day before or what I had done, let alone the week before.  

Dates and numbers are simply an unpleasant experience. I saw people on tv remembering the date of their graduation or the day they got their license and I always scoffed at the bad writing, because people can't remember such stuff, until I found out yes... people do.

I can remember pin numbers and other things, but I think the problem is long-term memory. 

Just to mention, I've never smoked marijuana or done any illegal drugs, but I have been on anti-depressants on and off for over a decade.

Anyone has any idea?"

100,Help.,"So I suffer from Bi-polar depression, and really bad Anxiety I’m *21f*
About 10 minutes ago I was washing my face and was putting my toner on my face, I always Pat it into my face, but for some reason tonight I just stood and looked at myself and started basically slapping myself non stop on both sides of my face with my hands, not like a slap but like something between a slap and a pat to the point where my very pale face is now dark red/purple and I don’t bruise easily. I don’t know why I did it and it’s like I couldn’t stop myself. I still want to do it but I’m having to stop myself. Idk what to do or what this means. Please help me figure out why I’m doing this"
101,Drunkard Short Stories,"I got wasted last night and tried to discuss some of my concerns with people.  I'm trying to put some type of humor together that amuses people instead of just looking like an ass.  I don't know, people are just grieving me to stop the shenanigans.  Amid constant world turmoil I know religion and dogma is a personal matter to most people. I'm not an imbecile trying to break out the Bible while people are in their constant darkest hour.  I to am struggling to cope and just was trying to put some faculties together in warning people through my experiences.  These boogieman seem pretty really, Corporate boogieman, just bad people in the world that get away with being above the law.  Things people had heard before, just another loonie re-affirming some of it.  I'm not superstitious or very religious myself.

I'm very informal and all, I just wanted to amuse people.  I'm an ass, It doesn't get any better, people are generally evil and insidious.  So I'm only bringing more pain and anguish to myself.  We're all struggling with world turmoil and baggage.  I am not helping anyone or myself with my silly bullshit, while trying to compensate.

I go back over whatever abomination I wrote the night before, It's not even coherent to whatever the fuck I was thinking.  Whatever I wrote last night was nonsensical and just diluted bullshit, excuse me.

I've had some odd experiences over the years with the celestial boogieman. I was just trying to tell warn pagans some of those beings seem evil as fuck.  I don't understand why I am such a warped jackass sometimes to try and humor people.

It's not really worth exploiting myself any further for the amusement of others.  To many cruel people want to hurt me, hurt me, hurt my feelings and I don't deserve it.


I don't even know what frame of mind I had last night.  I was trying to tell people about myself while joking about cannibalism again and the demons.  I am beside myself, cannibalism is not freaking funny.  I don't think I need to go into Man Eatin to get a rise out of people.


Well I think I've done enough to amuse people and make an ass of myself. 

Stay safe from these animals, best wishes.

My bad folks, please no crucify."
102,Why Do I Never Want To Settle...,"I'm in a relationship. But I feel like he's not enough. Like I want more. But I don't know what I want. So then I will get in this mood where I want to reach out to old flings or past relationships. I know that's probably a little crazy and probably not healthy. But the urge is so strong. I have so far not reached out to any (during this time of my feelings being wonky). But this seems to be a common thing for me.

Oddly, my sister is the same way. She'll burn through relationships, and often try to rekindle them. 

Is this normal human activity? Or have we suffered trauma from our childhood? 

I'm sitting in my car trying not to cry because I feel unhappy, and yet I've really nothing to be unhappy about..."
103,Feels like my brain has shut off,"It’s hard to describe, but I’ve had this problem for a while and it has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Basically, it feels like my brain is never “on”. If I need to think about something, like REALLY think about something, I have to actively decide to think about it.

For example...

Situations where I don’t need to “think” (the answers are pretty obvious and don’t involve reflection or real decisions) - Am I hungry? What should I watch on TV? Should I do laundry?

In contrast, my therapist asked me how I was feeling these days, and I said “pretty neutral”. They asked what made it “neutral”, and although I told them it was because I felt neither good nor bad, I realized that I said “neutral” because it’s a non-answer and I haven’t really evaluated how I feel about my life. So I asked myself, how DO I feel about my life right now? And it felt like I was skimming the surface of a lake with a net and not really catching anything, because the question really needed me to THINK about my life and my feelings about it. But I couldn’t just THINK about it. It feels like there’s a little button in my brain that I just have to hit in order to activate it, but I can’t, or don’t want to. 

That’s just one example. The same thing happens when a friend asks how I liked the movie we just watched. It takes me so much effort to decide if I really like it or not that I usually just say, “it was good!” because I’d have to boot up my brain to generate a single critical thought. It’s not like a fear of having an opinion on something. It’s like my brain literally doesn’t have the energy to even form a complex thought.

Sometimes it’s hard for me to concentrate while I’m reading, like I read each word but the meaning doesn’t fully reach my brain. I used to be very, very advanced as a kid and I had excellent reading comprehension, so this is a relatively new thing.

My brain just feels sort of empty. It’s easier not to press the “THINK” button, easier to not really think about things too deeply. 

I also have some memory issues, like I’ll send a text and immediately forget what I sent. Sometimes I can’t even recall the gist of the message, or who I sent it to. But then I’ll look at the text and be like, “oh, yeah, I remember now.” 

When my coworkers ask what I did over the weekend, I draw a blank. I usually say “nothing” to avoid the embarrassment of having to switch my brain on a try to recall anything I did.

I guess it’s nonessential information, so my brain doesn’t try to store it. I have trouble remembering everything I did the day before, or what I had for lunch sometimes. It’s just “little” stuff like that, I can remember events, or conversations that I actively tell myself I should remember. But the little day to day stuff drifts away because it’s not as important and the days tend to blur together. I keep a journal and a planner to document what I do each day, otherwise it all blends.

Does anyone else experience stuff like this? I’m going to talk to my therapist about it, but I don’t know if I can describe it well enough to make sense. It just feels like my brain is... gone."
104,Lost desire to learn,"I was wondering if anyone here has experienced a loss in the desire to learn. I'm currently doing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I'm horribly behind on lecture content and my dissertation. I'd go to classes just wanting them to be over. Moreso, I feel like I don't even want to read about anything (academic or non-academic). I'm worried about what this mass disinterest in, well, basically everything in my life means. 

Sometimes, I'm filled with panic, realising how much time and space I'm wasting - I'm at university - I thought I wanted this! So many people would love to be in my position! I'm so behind and what's going to happen if I fudge this whole degree up and graduate with a 2:2? I'm just very lost and very insecure - feeling like I'm just nowhere near smart enough to be here..."
105,Went from caring too much to caring too little...,"As title implies, has anyone experienced this? I grew up in a broken family, had both mom and dad issues, along with depression, anxiety, and anger issue. 

I’ve since gotten much better, realizing my issues are getting out of control, and took back control. This felt like a huge victory and have found inner peace. I’ve also been patching things up with my parents and partner, but now that I have my personal life under control, my work life is taking some hits. Simply put, because I realized that I’m more happy if I care less, I’ve become much more unprofessional at work, and although I still have friends, I’m now having quite a bad working relationship with my bosses. Im kind of radical and uncontrollable, as I tend to do things my way and would be quite aggressive whenever someone tries to make me do things I don’t want to do. As in I’ll have an attitude, a very obvious one since I think obedience is overrated. Am I becoming yet again selfish and arrogant? How do I balance this? I find that I’m quite an extreme person, either very happy or very sad. Either caring too much or not caring at all. I write this because I don’t wanna go back to how I was before. I’ve come so far, lived so far,  survived so far, and really, really fucking don’t want it to spill into my personal life again :/ 

Thanks for your time and advices. Take care and stay safe especially during these times."
106,I (19F) have been extremely stressed and irritably over the past months for no apparant reason,"I (19F) have a pretty busy student life usually, with always something to keep me busy. I have been stressed about uni and other things for quite some time as well, but it was always manageble. I have never had any trouble keeping up with the work, I passed all my semesters, but lately (especially now I am staying home because of the pandemic with my 3 roommates) I have been extremely irritable at random moments. 

I get irritable from small disagreements, or when my roommates don't take care of the cleaning tasks, or when a friend does something slightly irresponsible. Things that I rationally know are not really a problem. Except I get really irritable, emotional, anxious and stressed about it.

I don't know what the cause for this is, the only things I can think about are that I am on the pill or that this is just my worrisome personality. I'd love for you to give your opinion on this, it would really help me out.

TL;DR  
Very irritable, anxious and stressed lately for basically no reason, need some advice"
107,I'm seeking Help.,"Hello
I'm a 20yo college student. I'm Indian and I'm currently pursuing my degree in Budapest (Hungary). Ever since i came here i have been having inferiority complex seeing all these people from different parts of the world. I have many cool friends from my college and we used to hangout before this lockdown. The thing is lately due to being in isolation i have been thinking too much. I'm single and i make up things in my mind which says I'm single because I'm a brown guy. I am skinny and i have poor body image. Sometimes i cry for nothing. I am planning to hit the gym after this lockdown but I  am anxious about working out too. I'm really weird. I need your help."
108,small room giving me panic attacks,"Right now I’m living in a room about 8’x12’ with 3 doors so it feels even smaller. I have a queen bed, dresser, tv, computer, and cat scratching post. Everything else is in the closet. I can’t move anything out, I have a storage unit for as much as I can. My dog, cat and bf are also in here. It’s so crowded. I can’t handle it. I’ve tried rearranging every possible way. I’ve been losing touch and going into my own world, but anytime I’m out I have a panic attack. Everything is frustrating. Everything is stressful. It’s taking such a toll. I can’t even stay out long because quarantine and it’s shitty out. Moving plans are pushed until things calm down. I genuinely feel like I’m going to go absolutely insane."
109,feelings dump. i guess," 

i want to do horrible things to myself. 

sometimes i feel like a nobody. actually, i feel like that a lot, even more so recently.

it feels like everyone i know ignores me and never bothers to text me first. i'm always the first one to make a move, to try to be social as everybody else. 

it makes me feel like a desperate bitch.

maybe that really is what i am. i'm so desperate for someone, anyone to remind me that there's an outside world, one that i should be a part of, to come on in, that i beat myself the hell up for not living up to their standards.

and now that i'm in a whole another country with little access to people i've known all my life, i can't go on. i can't keep putting on a show just for someone to remind me i'm a part of society.

i mean, i'm not significant in anyone's life anyway. they'll just be sad for a few months and forget all about me. i don't blame them. they have their own lives to live.

i just want to quietly slip away from here and let everyone off my hell of a ride gently."
110,I'm stuck and my PC broke.,"I don't post much on reddit anymore because i tend to deal with my mental issues better but a week ago my PC broke, my GPU fried so i don't even get a display. My dad said he'd buy me a new one (I'm broke due to COVID), but then he hasn't really gotten back to me in 3 days. This is now my 5th day with nothing to do and I'm having real thoughts and wishes of death, I'm smoking way too much and i feel almost exactly how i did in my very darkest days. I genuinely just hope i don't cut myself because I'm too old for that shit now. 

Hope you're all good, thanks for reading i guess."
111,I’m struggling.,"Oct 15, 2019–was in a bad car accident, in which I was hurt. Missed lots of work. 

Jan. 15 —was fired from my job in a now no existent industry, without cause. 

March 15–former employer lies regarding unemployment benefits, so I’m jobless and waiting for the appeals process which takes 10 weeks. 

March 30–computer breaks, but I have no money to fix it. 

Wife and I can’t work because of coronavirus. We’re broke. Ex employer is reminding me daily that there are actual bad people in the world. I gave my life to them the last few years. And this is how they treat me. 

I’m just over it. I hate feeling helpless. And so worried about money. 

And this feels like everyone’s story. Everyone is in this same situation. Uggg."
112,I feel like I am being treated ''special''.,"I feel like I can't say anything in a group of people without having someone smirk, or give me that ''wtf'' face. Whenever I say something I consider NORMAL I always get a remark from someone. That remark is either an irritating laugh or someone quietly looking at me while they whisper to someone else. The worst comment I get is when someone says ''Haha, I love you Morten''. I know it is just for fun people say it, but it seriously pisses me off. I have always struggled to conversate with people, but this is just fucking retarded.

I have noticed how it is with other people, but they just don't give a shit about when other people talk. Whenever it is NOT me that is talking, people just listen and treat it normally. But whenever I open my mouth, it is a worldwide cultural event everybody listens to. And whenever I am done speaking, it's as if I am some sort of messiah people always give a special regard. Can you shut up?

Hell, even a few days ago when I was in class, I got a comment that I sound depressed. But it wasn't a concerned comment about me. It was a genuine ''haha, did you notice how stupid he sounded'' comment. Idk how to explain it, but it happened and it is SO annoying. Other times when I participate in my class, I always notice at least one idiot quietly repeating what I say to someone else.

&amp;#x200B;

And you wanna know the best part??? YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE CHERRY ON THE CAKE?

Every time I tell people it bothers me, I am always told to shut up and do not take it seriously. Shut the fuck up you stupid cunt...

It is SO FUCKING ANNOYING. I don't know if I explained it correctly, and I apologize if I heated up at times. But it is something I have struggled with for a while now, and I need to know if it is normal, or if I have some sort of mental disorder."
113,My mom didn't take the fact that I was very suicidal earlier today seriously (trigger warning),"So basically my mom said, ""fuck you the world and everyone around you have more problems than you and  you have no reason to be depressed."" At least she had a life before she met my dad, I was born into not having one. Like seriously, man, if that's your biggest thing, shit. Fucking wish she aborted me. And I fucked scratched up my arm. I don't own a knife so I was just using sharp scissors to scratch up my arms... it's my second time actually trying to cut into my skin. For a while, I've been ripping my nails off till my fingers bleed, and I punched a wall for the first time...and I didn't damage the wall, but I bruised half my fist cause I'm fucking weak after not practicing karate for years. Also, I'm a girl... cause everyone assumes I'm a guy whenever I post here...so yeah, idk. But like, everyone has different experiences...and to one getting a 66% on a test is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to them while another person was blackmailed...you know...its all about what has happened to you that makes it bad. And my mom's issues are valid, I just want her to see that my issues are also valid. I literally wanna kill myself for god's sake. Idk...I only slept two hours cause I was trying to tear up my skin while journaling my thoughts while waiting on the lifeline chat waitlist from like 11 PM-5AM... and then I got happy for a second after passing out for an hour or two, got up cleaned my room, and right when I ask my mom to please just make the phone call she promised to make literally like a month or two ago to the phone call therapist person she's been talking about (that requires your insurance) she basically says I'm just being fucking lazy. Which is fair... but I just want to talk to someone... just anyone seriously, anyone but my family... my siblings are too young to understand, my dad's beyond pissed cause I super behind in school and self-sabotage and procrastinate way too fucking much. I just wanna die, my guy. Rip to the grammar, I ain't editing this shit. And if you took the time to read this I appreciate you, I hope your quarantine is going well."
114,U.K. “gatherings of more than two people” corona virus vs ptsd,"Can two people, different households, who’ve both isolated for two weeks (no symptoms in either) see each other? It is the anniversary of my sons death tomorrow and I don’t do well being stuck alone (ptsd) my whole process/therapy for the last few years has been, don’t get stuck in the house, and obviously due to quarantine I’m edging quite quickly back into complete agoraphobia. 
I do completely understand the quarantine and severity of covid. I’m not even leaving to go to the shops and trying to walk the dog has been a terrifying process full of people from all over gathered and ignoring the rules, so I’ve had to stop that to, but I’m getting quite scared for my mental health if this goes on much longer (inevitable) 
Please advise? What’s the law on this? 
I can’t see a doctor, therapist, can’t get food etc, don’t drive (person two does, so it would be a straight car journey to a private place) 

Don’t flame me I’m just wondering

115,I'm spiraling down into a bad hole....,Everyday lately I tell myself is my last day and it's time to give up. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I've only gotten 3-4 hours of sleep a night lately even though i'd like nothing more than to just sleep forever.. Honestly i'm scared. Don't know what to do...
116,Other Frustrations,"I write and post and all trying to talk about some of my thoughts.  My experiences and frustrations in this world, some of it is typical and some of it is spiritual.  Seeing the world in a shroud of bullshit is maddening at times.  I do not understand how this was a sensible way to try and run the world or hoodwink Man.  Like with religion and spiritual things being held in skepticism when some people are quite certain these things are true.  I am uncertain what religion or dogma would be adequate, trying to let these individuals represent themselves without wrongly incriminating them.  

It's never a good time folks, I'm not selling bibles.  We've reach an incredible observation of the Solar Minimum and Maximum...  It would be a period, a golden age, where Man would live in some harmony that the Sun is tranquil.  It's constant waves of bullshit in this world, a viral pandemic, skirmish, war, the shit is unending.  Nor am I trying to hold any organization accountable for these problems.

  There are organization and charities hard at work.  I find myself feeling useless in a situation where education and certification is in necessity.  I've found charity organization and made some donations.  I'm not a tool, these does alleviate some of my woes in feeling hapless.  

It's a hard time right now, the economy is just about to tank.  Local private business are about to tank, it's very bad.  We've been shut down going on a month soon, I'm not sure how set back some of these business can get.  

Remember to find an organization and charity you trust and help them.  They have professionals that can do work.  People want to get involved, just get in the way.  



I don't typically struggle with humanity or sympathy to extremes and melodrama.  There are people out there constantly grieving the wolves and crocodiles in this world.  I am more than willing to help and donate to these organizations. I  get quite angry when people are grieving others over problems in this world out of most of their control. 


Just give them money, and they'll go away.




Cheers, best wishes."

119,Suffering from extremely vivid dreams,"I'm a 20 year old guy, been depressed and anxious since 16 cos of long term emotional abuse and neglect by my Dad and stepmum and then cos of bullying in school. I was also diagnosed with OCD by a doctor when I was 18 or 19, can't remember which.

I've been to a lot of counselling and been on antidepressants and that to varying degrees of success, but in the end I'm still the same really. Anyway, I had been going to counselling (before all the coronavirus stuff) in my Uni city, been to about 12/13 sessions before it got cancelled. I noticed a few sessions in as the topics of the sessions got more extreme and upsetting that I started getting really vivid dreams. At first they often involved by Dad or people that had hurt me in the past.

As time has gone on and I've worked through certain things however, the dreams have tended to be less about topics like that and most of the time are just completely random. Last night I had a dream where I was mates with Cristiano Ronaldo and I took him for a night out (???), it wasn't upsetting at all but it was extremely vivid, like I was actually there. This happens every single night without fail unless I was drunk when I went to sleep.

My counselling sessions have been focusing on trying to release this inner tension or emotion or whatever that is stuck inside of me that I can feel every day wanting to escape but I can't seem to let it. I don't really know what to do about the dreams or how to release these feelings."
120,Do you have toxic friends? ➟ Finding Happiness With Positive Friends 😊,"Do you have toxic friends? ➟ Finding Happiness With Positive Friends 😊

[https://youtu.be/dtWCEETT\_ak](https://youtu.be/dtWCEETT_ak)

😊 In this video, we look at the importance of positive friends and we question those friends in our life that may not be helpful in the development of our happiness.

Do we find some of our relationships are clouding our happiness? Maybe some of our friends are quite toxic and instead of lifting us, inspiring us and making us happy are in fact a cause of our unhappiness. 

We need to develop happy states of mind and to do so we must spend time with positive uplifting friends and family so that we can find the happiness we are all looking for.

121,Thought about suicide for the first time,"     I have been really doing bad in the last week. I feel so empty, lost, alone (even though I know I'm not), and exhausted. In the last week I tried alcohol and cigarettes for the first time. The cigarettes are especially bad because I have a chronic lung disease but I really don't care because I just want my emotions to stop. I also have slit my wrists and deep down I want someone to see it, to see how much pain I'm in because I'm not strong enough to admit it to anyone or even really to myself. 
     Thanks to whomever listened to my rant."
122,A close family member passed last year due to mental health and substance abuse issues. Today is his birthday. Please read this.,"I wrote this last year when I found out he had passed.  It has just been sitting on my phone.  While the message is not a new revelation to anyone, it never hurt to hear someone say these things to me.  So I thought that I would share it.


The path of life is not paved solely in joyous moments, there are twisted unknown parts that lead us through the darkest of forests, hills that seem insurmountable, rivers that we cannot ford, and past demons that others cannot see.⁣⁣


We cannot make this journey alone and we should not try.  We must know, and remind others, that there is always an ear that will listen, a hand to offer aide, a back to share the load, and a shoulder to cry on.  No one must ever think that they need to face these challenges alone.  Call on others and find the strength you need in them.⁣


Please know that I love you and that no matter the challenge ahead of you I will stand beside you.  Please do not think it will ever make you lesser by asking for help, it makes you stronger than you know.


I miss you so much James."
123,Quarantine is hell,"Woke up in a very low mood, quarantine is hell and I hope we don't have to do it for too long."
124,Does anyone else feel like they’re in a movie a lot of the time?,"I just feel like I’m being recorded a lot of the time and not in the paranoid way, just being observed from a distance when doing just the most menial tasks. Whenever I have this feeling I view myself from the lense of the camera and I act differently. I act like an actor and I never feel genuine when I say things anymore, I always have a different voice other than my own dictating me (it’s still my voice, but masked. For example: when I say something smart it comes from the mouth of Will Hunting). Nothing feels genuine unless it’s completely bizarre and I couldn’t have predicted it. Is this like a form of disassociation or narcissism. It’s getting kinda annoying."
125,Communication roadblock: intuitive-based personality &amp; very logical partner,"My partner and I have been struggling with communication for awhile. Partner is a lawyer (extrovert/introvert) and I am a more creative type (ENFP). 

He lovingly shares that he cannot follow my logic or understand my thinking. 

I agree that I often get excited and am over the place when I speak. I have started to loathe my natural enthusiasm since it hinders our communication. I feel so robotic sometimes speaking now. 

Partner is craving a more structured approach. 
I find myself fearing questions and criticism so I freeze up or doubt myself (I often hear: “what you’re saying doesn’t make sense..”/ “I don’t understand”/ “do you hear what you are saying?”). Partner is loving (but sometimes condescending) and tries to summarize for me and I can tell he is getting annoyed by this. 

Does anytime have experience, suggestions or resources for more feeling/intuitive-based individuals communicating their thoughts? 

I’ve always been an endless optimist however fear of letting my partner down has led me to dwell in negative thoughts..

Would a psychologist help me improve how I express myself? What should I request of them, what should the first session be like?

Thank you so much."
126,Just laid off... from a healthcare position.,"So much for being deemed an “essential worker”... I am a medical scribe in an inundated rural family practice clinic. I have been exposed to 15+ confirmed positive patients, my hours got cut, but then all the COVID patients were sent to a designated clinic and my hours got reinstated. I feel like an idiot for feeling like I had job security. 

Got an email during lunch yesterday saying that my position was on “indefinite pause” until the pandemic calms down, with notification of less than 4 goes before the end of my shift. I know it’s not quite the case but it felt like I was basically fired on the spot like a piece of trash. 

I went into full panic attack breakdown mode, and couldn’t stop crying from 4pm basically until 2am when I was too drunk to stay awake anymore. 

I am the sole provider for my partner and I because she isn’t working due to having recent surgery and I was dumb for thinking I was immune to the economic strife the entire country is experiencing. It was tough before, supporting our household working minimum wage with 4+ hours of overtime weekly, but it was working. 

Now I’m shit out of fucking luck... 1/4 of the country just got laid off and jobs aren’t exactly opening up positions right now. I have no idea what I’m going to do I feel like an utter and total failure. 

I woke up at 7am and am wanting nothing’s more than to just drive right back in to the drunk state of last night. Just did coke again for the first time in 9 mo. because I’m just numb and hurting. Fuckkkkkk. What do I do. I’m spiraling."
127,How often do you sleep especially during this quarantine period?,"Hi,

I hope everyone is doing well during this period. Please, try as much as possible to stay safe and healthy.. At the moment, virtually everyone is away from work especially in those areas mostly affected by the **corona virus**. Now, you have enough time to work on yourself. What have you been doing with it? Something beneficial to your well-being, I suppose? 

Well, if you have not been doing so, you may want  to start today. As there is no much work to do at the moment; ensure to eat well, exercise well, **sleep well** and stay at home. Although the number of hours for sleeping varies from person to person, the recommended number of hours is usually between 7-9 hours which you should start working towards. You shouldn't be filled with panic and overthink things as that could impair your sleeping cycle, ultimately, your mental health. I believe it's gonna end soon and everyone will go back to their normal way of life.

Sleep is so important to your overall health that improving it is one of the essential things we can work on to make our overall health better.

Stay safe! Stay healthy! Stay at home! Read more [here](https://blosumcbd.com/blog/cbd-for-sleep/)"
128,Admire and envy a youtuber simultaneously,"There's this youtuber,Jaiden Animations,whom I like a lot. However,one day,I saw her playing the piano,and very well,despite her channel being about animations.

   I feel extremely jealous of her,almost bloodlust,while admiring how talented she is,simultaneously. She does not have some great college degree or stuff,but still she is so talented and loved. And here I am, a 15 yr old who knows how to fly small aircraft(Really,I do. No showing off),gets nice grades, and wants to become a professor,but all I get is a simple, 'Good,could've been better.' Nobody knows me and I am known as a clingy person.

How can people get so much appreciation, while those like me can't ever find appreciation and love. Honestly,I am so jealous of her that I have recently started over-exerting myself while studying,while thinking that I am just a NORMIE in the crowd. 
  
 I never wanted to get in the youtube spotlight. I have totally different goals. However,the amount of love she gets from fans is enough to make my blood boil.

I know this is not healthy. Any suggestions what should I do? JADF (Jaiden Animations Defence Force), please do not bash me."
129,A long post. TLDR at the end,"So I just left my workplace after feeling sick and being worried about it being the virus. I was told before I left that I would need to be cleared by a doctor to come back. So I came home and took my temperature and it came back normal. I’m now afraid that if it turns out to be nothing, my workmates will think I just wanted time off and won’t trust me. My mind is running rampant about everything it could be. I can’t stand thinking that I may have just messed up because of it comes back and is nothing, then I feel like a fraud.

TLDR: I left work after feeling bad and am worried that I may have to deal with repercussions if it just turns out that my body’s as exhausted and nothing comes back after I go to the doctor."
130,"Shout out to everyone who had life kinda figured but then lost their job cos of covid, found a new shitty job working nights and now are lost...","Can't be just me who's struggling to switch over to night shifts on a shitty job they had to take. I work in a supermarket warehouse picking orders all night and it sucks but the pay is decent. The worst thong is my days off. What am i supposed to do till 6am apart from masturbate, play video games and drink. Also my gf is asleep so im creeping around the house trying not to wake her up..."
131,I need to talk with someone wiser than me,"I have problem with very high standards for myself, but then being too lazy to actually do something. It's a circle. I hate the person I was, I dislike the person I am when I look objectively at myself. I hate not being perfect even tho I know perfection in theory it's not possible. It's just.. why am I like that.  Why I'm not doing anything in order to be more competent, instead of just being miserable because I'm not what I want to be?"
132,Doing things right away,"Once I get an idea in my head I need to do it right away and I expect results right away. It’s exhausting to think this way and idk what it is. Example, if I have to go to the store later I tend to get anxiety at work bc I want to just go to the store get it done with. I’m not satisfied until I reach that point. Or if I do something like post a song or selfie or anything I expect it to blow up or get a bunch of reactions right away. It’s like my brain doesn’t understand patience or the fact that I can do things later. Does anyone else feel like this? I’m not expecting a diagnosis but is this just anxiety?"
133,I’m worried about myself,"Hi. I just wanted to say that I’ve been growing increasingly worried about myself. I’m not suicidal. I’m more on the upswing (bp1). 


My March mood chart looks like a heart monitor, and I haven’t been sleeping. There’s nothing for anyone to do, so I’m not asking for anything. Idk why I feel like I need to tell someone, but I do. 


Anyway, thanks for listening."
134,Journalist Looking for Sources for Article About Mental Health + Technology,"Hello,

I'm a reporter with [The Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/author/allysonwaller/), and I'm currently working on a story about how increased dependency on technology during a time such as this — when many are staying home and taking proper precautions in social distancing — can affect mental health. As someone who has dealt with mental health issues, I know I've experienced some fluctuation in moods/emotions due to having to work from home and life being sort of upended due to federal/local government precautions being put in place to tame the spread of the coronavirus. For my story, I'm not only wanting to talk with experts, but just everyday people who've had to deal with addressing their use of technology in lieu of all this and how it has affected their own mental health. Please feel free to respond to this thread with your own experiences or feel free to privately DM me to share with me as well.

Thank you."
135,Sometimes I feel like I’m a huge joke that the whole universe and everyone in it is laughing at,"I actually had an episode of psychosis in the past centered around this basic idea that really got out there. I’m currently on sertraline and low dose aripiprazole. I’m actually doing very well even with the current economic problems etc though. I guess I have issues with self-worth and caring what other people think. I often start thinking everything is a catastrophe where I’m not in the know about something awful. That no one takes me seriously, everyone is having sex with each other and doing drugs and stuff at these huge orgy-parties I imagine up. I was never invited because unknown to me everyone sees me as a huge loser. Which somehow makes me enormously more innocent than everyone else, for not partaking in what everyone else is doing. Everyone knows there’s something basic wrong with me and they don’t want to be around it. I feel like this a lot and it’s a really uncomfortable feeling. It’s really pronounced/intense and intrusive"
136,Am I being emotionally manipulated by my own mother?,"I constantly feel guilty when my mother is upset at me or when she yells at me, she had a hard time raising both me and my brother because my father wouldn't work although she was constantly angry and would always yell and swear at me as a child I understood that she was just frustrated and I was the only outlet she had.

As I grew up it didn't get any better, she stopped working when I was 15 and started relying on me and my brother. I would work, cook and clean to help her but she always complained that I didn't do it right.
There were nights when my father would get drunk and I'd pick him off the floor, clean up his vomit and put him to bed there was even an occasion where he burned down the couch but my brother helped me stop the fire.

I remember one night there was no electricity because we had it cut off, I fell asleep with a candle lit I was maybe 11 at the time and I woke up to flames. Luckily I woke up in time and it only damaged a part of the room, when mom got home she just spent hours swearing and yelling at me for ruining her stuff. Again I cried but shrugged it off, she must have had a long day and it's fine.

After my father passed away I'm sad to say that things got better, I moved away for work and would visit on the weekends I'm a nurse and I would give mom a good allowance every month so she could get what she needed and I even payed for a trip for her to make her happy.

After a few health scares she had I got a job closer to home so I can stay by her side, but things got worse because I couldn't give her as much money as I used to because the pay is lower and I couldn't afford to buy her the gifts she wanted...

She never lets me complain or speak up to her, when I say she needs to get a job she says that I've changed and that my current boyfriend is turning me against her.
When I told her that I wanted to get engaged and get married she said that I can't afford to start a life with someone because I need to keep taking care of her and that I should marry a doctor or somebody that can take care of me financially.
When she found out that me and my boyfriend had slept together she told me that she wants to kill herself because of that, and that I am a slut that doesn't have any self worth.

We got into an argument today because I've been having really bad shifts and I'm just tired she complained that I'm not taking care of the house or cooking although I've been trying my best to keep up but I just couldn't take it anymore and I snapped and yelled at her saying that she should take responsibility since she doesn't do anything and that I'm tired of it always being my fault. She stopped talking to me, she refuses to look at me and she keeps yelling whenever I try to say anything or when I'm even around her...

I am just at a loss and I don't know what to do anymore... I'm tired, this has driven me to consider suicide many times but the only thing stopping me is that I don't want my brother to deal with this alone...

I've tried therapy and I've been on paroxetine and I stopped a few months ago because I was tired of it and I had the worst withdrawal, I don't want to go back to it I really don't and it just sucks that I'm trying my best just to make her happy and safe and in the end I just feel like a fucking mess and a failure..."
137,I was never accepted. My relationship ended. I'm hurt. I want to get out of this bs.,"I am 19 years old. I was not very good in studies, below average. My parents wanted me to score the highest, but I couldn't. I tried, but most of things didn't make sense to me. Most of my teachers used to made fun of me, when I scored low grades or when I couldn't perform. I found solace in arts. I used to draw, I still do. I love to draw. However, I am not the best artist out there. It makes me feel good. I don't think I will ever do good in life, I don't even think I can get a job. Right now, I am in college studying engineering. I met a girl here. She is the best girl I've met. Everything was fine, until now. She has decided that I'm not good for her and our relationship has to end. The only thing which was making me feel good is now over. This relationship was my hope because I wanted to do something in my life because of her. I cry, a lot. I am so heartbroken now. I don't now why am I living? 

I'm not even living, I am just existing because that's what I have to do."
138,Mental Health Attack Every Couple Months,"I’ve had bad mental health attacks every couple months. I just had one last night where I felt truly alone. I have a loving family and a fiance but no real friends that i can speak my mind to. My attacks are usually about whats the point of living or how alone i really am in this world. 

I asked my fiance if he wanted to watch a show with me but he said it was too feminine and declined and so i asked one of my gaming buddies because he said he seem interested but also declined so im left with no one to watch. After that, it hit me how i’ll be alone forever. I need to find a friend who is like a ride or die.

I used to have a ton of real friends but we parted ways after middle school.

I pretty much cried myself to sleep. Idk how to deal with it because im usually a happy person and make others happy and have a positive outlook in life. 

Im at a point where i’ve come to a realization life is just about us waiting to die. No one to speak my mind to. No purpose in life but to make others happy.

Not gonna off myself but yeah..just sucks"

157,Any advice on the correct way to process experiences?,"So, lately I’ve been seeing a lot of things one social media where people reference “processing your emotions completely”. I guess throughout my life I have noticed that I am still bothered by old things that don’t even impact my daily life anymore.

Furthermore, I have a ton of good memories that I’m not sure I have “fully processed” in order to move on I guess you would say.

So, I guess my question is, is processing ones emotions simply thinking about past experiences until you can have some sort of “closure” or do I have this concept completely wrong?

I just feel like I would gain a ton of mental clarity if I could accomplish this.

TL;dr: noticed that some past events still stick around in my mind that no longer have any impact on my daily life. Wondering if I’m doing the whole “processing my emotions” thing correctly."

172,I feel like I am literally going crazy.,"I don’t know where to even start.  I have always had anxiety and depression and have been medicated for years.  Things have been slowly getting worse minute by minute.  I am doing all the things to keep myself regulated not having more than 2 coffees a day,  going outside for an hour walk everyday, eating healthy meals,  and going to bed at a regular time and sleeping at least 8 hours.  

My skin all hurts, I feel uncomfortable in my body.  My chest feels so tight it is hard to breath at times.  My jaw is constantly clenched to the point it is painful.  I notice strange thoughts and memory’s are creeping into my head and I don’t know if they are real or not.  I flux between completely not giving any fucks and being in a full on panic about everything.  

How long will it be like this as I don’t know how much more of this I can take on.  I am sooooo tired of living and being sad.  I just don’t want to hurt anymore.  If this is what normally feels like I’m happy to check out."
173,I'm so tired of listening to these mean thoughts,"Ever since I broke up my mind hasn't been kind to me. It's always over-criticizing me, or even my ex. Neither of us were perfect so the list will always go on for both sides. But I'm so tired. I'm so tired of thinking I'm not good enough, I'm the toxic one, I don't deserve any love. But the next day I condemn my ex, thinking he's not trying hard enough to make our relationship work. But then my mind says it's me, I'm the reason he won't try hard enough. I'm so tired of this... Rollercoaster of emotions and thoughts. I'm tired of blaming. I'm tired of thinking what ifs. I want peace. I can't even sleep early anymore. I hate myself so much."

I wish I could be like them, I wish I could share ideas and be listened to, I want to have a voice and I want to have love that I never had. It's weird, their life has nothing to do with mine but it feels personal to me as a person that I feel I am less then some people. I don't know if this even makes sense. I've always struggled socially so it may just be a flaw in my character. Any thoughts would be appreciated."

176,Having childish reactions to small disappointments,"When I was a child I used to get really upset over minor disappointments. For example, I would get really upset (sad) if I asked my mom to pick up something while grocery shopping and she forgot, or if we were going to go to a restaurant I really wanted to go to and it was closed.

Lately I've been having this type of emotional reaction to similar situations. I'm a grown man so naturally I hide this on the outside, but I really wish I could unchain myself from the un-earned sadness that comes along with these reactions.

A recent example: My wife was going to pick something up for me from the post office on her way home from work. She forgot and I had to wait until Monday to go and get it. Upon hearing that she forgot I was so sad I felt like I could cry. This is obviously not a reasonable reaction. 

What are some methods I can use to get over these silly feelings as quick as possible, or better yet, not have them in the first place?"
177,Not sure what to do.,"Ever since I graduated high school ( and really before that), I have had no motivation at all. I went to a shitty community college for 1 semester and didn’t go to most of my classes. Then I got a shitty factory job that I have been at for 3 years now. We have an attendance policy where instead of sick days or anything like that you can call in and get a point. If you get 15 points you get fired. Ive been juggling the points very close to the limit basically the entire time, usually with 12+ points. Most days the only way I can get up to go to work is the fear of being fired. Then I dont even enjoy my days off because I’m just worried about getting crap from my boss when I go back. When this pandemic started in the US they informed us that we no longer had an attendance policy while it was going on even though they say we are an essential manufacturer (we aren’t). I haven’t been to work since last Wednesday and can’t seem to make myself go back because Im afraid of getting made fun of or even getting fired or laid off because I didn’t even bother to call in when I skipped today. My relationships with my family and fiancé have also suffered because Im so apathetic. I can’t count the times I’ve held her while she cried over me not putting effort into the relationship or hurting her feelings because Im so apathetic about everything. Lately I’ve been having some dark thoughts that I wouldn’t call suicidal but Im worried they spell the beginning of the end. Like would I really miss much about my existence right now if I died tomorrow. Never seen a professional about my problem because I keep convincing myself that I’m just being lazy and that everyone hopes they get T-boned on the way to work every morning. I haven’t had a doctor since I got too old to go to the pediatrician because it’s more comfortable to come home and play a video game that’s not fun or bringing me any enjoyment as I sit in my room with literally knee high trash everywhere because it’s more comfortable to keep playing my games or watching movies than cleaning up after myself."
178,Why am I so sensitive?,"I can't handle criticism and a single glance in my directions spawns thousands of 'what-ifs'. I can't manage online school and I can't manage my time. In January, I was right on the border of killing myself because of academic stress. I went to inpatient and then some therapy. I just don't have the motivation anymore. It used to be ""get good grades and you'll be considered valuable"" but I know that that's a path to figuratively drowning myself in work. Now, I just can't do it. I don't have a healthy motivation to do anything. These past few weeks have been fine and my mood was better but one little bump in the road and I crash. Why does this happen? Why am I so fragile?"
179,"Emotionally manipulative outbursts and lashing out on people I really love and trust, and then apologizing after. What is wrong with me?","Yesterday I posted my first post in this community, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fslssp/i_consider_myself_very_manipulative_and_toxic_im/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I talked about having this dark and violent side of me in the post in the link. And I was thinking a lot about it yesterday and saw a pattern in my anger issues. 

I did some research on my own and it seems like I have borderline personality disorder?

This pattern of lashing out and apologizing right after (involving saying “I was a mess, I didn’t know what I was doing” and feeling extremely guilty afterwards) happens A LOT. A recent example is when, like a briefly described in the post linked above I got a lot of pent up rage and anger with my mom, my boyfriend joked about something when I was ranting (that joke has a word which my mom used to degrade me with), I got tipped over, started fighting and arguing with him, and started lashing out on him with his past mistakes and berating him. I had a lot of self hate so a big part of what I said was how I want to kill myself and make everyone suffer. It was just straight up hurtful, especially to my boyfriend.

In the moment, I couldn’t see any of the good things and good memories in our relationship, and all I saw, truly, was the mistakes he did that hurt me. But the next morning I felt really, really bad and broke down crying because I couldn’t believe I said all those things to him. I kept apologizing but deep down I feel that even apologizing is making it worse. I felt like I was emotionally torturing him and manipulating him with the chain of events. 

The same pattern happens to my sister and best friends when things get extremely bottled up. And during this quarantine I really want to fix myself up. The reason why I brought up the fight between my boyfriend and I is because 1, that’s the most recent event about my rage issue, and 2, my boyfriend’s mother is very much the same as me—she lashes out, says really threatening things to him, and then feels super guilty, cries, and apologizes right after (the next day). FYI, his mom isn’t abusive and hateful like mine, rather, his mom really loves him to the point where it’s “scary” according to him. 

He told me some details about his mom after I’ve calmed down and it really made me wonder if it’s actually a disorder that exists. On one side, after knowing that he already has to deal with his mom and help her out, whilst damaging his emotional state, I really want to use this quarantine to fix myself up so nobody has to deal with my violent side anymore. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do I have Borderline Personality Disorder? Has anyone experienced the same thing? 
I’d love to DM you and talk to you about more detailed information, I really need help on this and I’m trying to gather as much perspectives and real-life experiences as possible. 

Thanks!"
180,My friend's pet ideology is setting off old trauma,"Some time ago, I went through a series of abusive relationships, one of which I didn't manage to escape until my abuser abruptly died. As a result, I have a lot of discomfort and trauma around feelings I can best describe as ""don't forget, you're here forever."" Being trapped with someone I can't escape, that sort of a feeling. Over time, the severity of that discomfort waned, but it's recently gotten a lot stronger due to quarantining and the general stressful state of the world.

A dude in my social circle, J, is really, really into transhumanism, and particularly the idea that we should ""abolish death"" and ""promote immortality."" He brings it up whenever it seems even vaguely germane to the conversation. And... that's pretty upsetting for me right now! 

I don't have him followed on the primary social media my circle uses, but plenty of the people I do follow also have him followed, which means he's still a part of my online experience, and I can't cut him out without cutting off the vast majority of my close friends. 

Is it remotely reasonable for me to ask him to cool it with that kind of talk when it's on someone else's post? It doesn't seem reasonable, but neither does having to pull away from all my friends to avoid randomly running into him talking about how my late and unlamented husband should still be alive. (I know that's not how he means it, but right now, that's all I can hear.) 

Or, is there something else I can do that doesn't involve either placing this strict limitation on him, isolating myself from everyone through the only connection I have left, or randomly sending myself into panic attacks?"

182,Online counseling?,Anyone have any recommendations or experience with seeking or going through online therapy? I’ve heard of better help and some other but before I seek one I wanted to ask people’s feelings!
183,Anyone else feel like they don’t deserve anything anymore?,I don’t know I just feel like sometimes I wake up and thing I’m just a waste of oxygen or something. I mean i want to just be back to a time where I can’t enjoy life and feel like I have a purpose. But with all sorts of problems it makes me feel like the world hates me and the reason I have so many problems is because the world wants me to kill myself or something.
184,Was it sexual assault/abuse?,"
Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain. It makes it so much worse."
185,does anyone play on Xbox one?,I'm not sure if this kind of thing is allowed here but I was wondering if anyone plays on Xbox one. I don't have any friends so I have no one to really play with and it's making me rather sad. I try to make friends with anyone and everyone online but so far no luck :/. I wish I could have someone to talk to and play games while my SO is working. it's hard being so isolated rn
186,Ehh is my imagination and creativity completely gone after experiencing trauma?,"So I'm a 22 year old female, from being a toddler up until the age of 15 I was an artist. Not a great or even very good artist, but I spent 75% of my time drawing, doodling, coloring. I loved to draw people and animals, I was never very good at drawing things you'd see outside like buildings, trees, roads, etc. I had a very good eye for detail, I studied painting for a couple years, I've tried every medium of art. 

My entire childhood was extremely traumatic, my home life and school life and family were absolutely awful and evil, so I think drawing was my way of escaping that. At the age of 15 I was in a very happy long term relationship, I think my creative output increased a little while dating this guy. 

After a few months towards the end of this relationship my boyfriend realized how racist and bigoted and evil my family was, he grew disinterested in someone who was related to people like that, and he broke up with me. 

My brain just kinda.....snapped. I don't know why. I was crying all day every day for months, I was hospitalized, I was suicidal, I was taken out of school, I even started to smoke cigarettes, drink, do drugs, and have sex with any guy that would look at me. Hell, even my taste in music changed from soft indie rock to pretty intense rap and hip hop.

Ever since then I can't draw. I feel no creativity, nothing makes that spark anymore, and when I did try to force myself to draw, it was like all my skill and years of practice was just gone. Everything I made myself draw looked like a small child drew it. My imagination is completely dead. So I stopped. 

Has anything like this ever happened to anyone else? Why is this happening to me? It's been years and I think it may be resolving itself kinda, I haven't tried to draw anything in years but I've found music gives me small sparks once in a while. 

TL;dr: Used to be a very proactive artist but a traumatic experience took away all skill and imagination I used to have."

188,Someone tell me what's wrong with me please. I can't go to a therapist.,"So I've been consciously choosing not to be happy for years now. Like today i decided to stay in bed (i know it's a decision because I know I can choose to physically get up) JUST because it's my birthday. I cried all day thinking about how I'm going to die and I wouldn't remember anything in my old age except for me being sad in my youth. I push people away, so how am I ever going to find love when I don't even want to? Idk if that makes sense. So anyway, my mum came in while I was wallowing in self pity and told me to get up and dance, it's my birthday. This was uncharacteristic of her as she's generally pretty uptight and strict. So for some reason, this broke me down and made me want to stay in bed even more and ruined any chances of me fixing the day, so I cried some more. I also hate it when people do nice things for me, or say nice things to me. I know that deep down I want to be happy, so I don't know why I'm like this. I see people around me including my family having fun and being lively and it breaks me inside even though I know I can be like that too. It sends me spiraling even worse than before. It used to be so sporadic but now it's becoming more and more frequent and I absolutely hate myself for it. For consciously choosing not to dance and not to say yes to the things I used to chase just because I can. Because I get to finally make a decision of my own, even if it's a shitty one. Help"

On those days I just want the pain to stop.
193,"Forced to being a ""nice guy"".","I was a violent young man from age 14 to 22. I wouldn't take shit from nobody ever.
At some point (in jail) I understood that it wasn't the way to go. So, I changed, and life should be good now, except that it's not. 
It's like somehow people know, that I'm not going to confront them, or anyone, because I've got so much to lose. I mean, I've spent years getting to where I am now, (now 28 years old) without hitting anyone, or getting into confrontations that might lead to me smashing some mouthy dudes face in. 
It's not like I've ""made it"" but I'm doing alright for a guy with a criminal record.
I was always hooking up with girls before, but I've actually been single and haven't had sex for 4 years now.
My selv confidence is completely shattered and it just seems like its getting worse. I still have some of the same friends and when I'm with them I act like I'm confident, and it works to some extent. But sometimes I'll hook up with a girl and she's down to come back home, but because I haven't had sex for so long I back out. Its been like that for 4 years now and is only getting worse. 
I really just want to erupt and say what I really feel about some of the pricks at work but it'll ruin everything. What do I do? Should I just say fuck it or just walk it off pop a viagra and stop feeling sorry for myself?"
194,How I overcame anxiety and built an app to help others.,"I may have presented myself as a happy person surrounded by lots of friends. Yes, I'm a happy person and am fortunate to have good friends around me. However, it took me a while to live and think this way. Maybe nothing has really changed around me but I know that the way I look and think through things has completely changed. Now I look at things in a more optimistic way than before. It didn't happen overnight but it slowly turned me into this way after simply writing down things from my mind to actual writing.

In this blog, I wanted to share my story about how journaling helped me overcome my anxiety and depression and built an app to write a journal with the hopes that this will be helpful to other people going through the same situation like myself out there.

## My anxiety and stress

I'm a type of person who usually has too many thoughts all the time. I tend to overthink even for a small matter and put myself into situations that give me anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I'm also a bit adventurous and curious, which puts myself in quite stressful situations. 

Having too many thoughts and being stressed from work, finance, relationships, made me anxious. This bothered me the most when I tried to go to sleep at night. Some nights, I ended up staying up till 5 or 6 in the morning cause of this. I sometimes felt that I was not even sure if I'm gonna be able to handle all of these any further. Luckily, I got this habit of writing journals and that has been helping me to live and stay strong.

## Journaling helped me get through a day

The only way out for me to fully express and relieve things out of my mind was writing. I simply write everything down on the paper from my head without any filters. I noticed a bit of relief each time I write everything I have in my mind and it gets better and better as I keep doing this. The things I wrote in my journals are not always pretty and probably not appropriate to say in person but I can do that in my journal. There were lots of anxieties, sad feelings, and frustrations. Letting them out of my mind and knowing what I was struggling with helped me get better at each thing I wrote. There's no magic, simply writing them down all of them from my mind simply helped me feel much relieved and made me better able to move on with my life.

It also helped me stay strong being in an environment where I had no one to talk to. Humans can not live without human interactions and it took me a while to build a small network where I can really interact with others in a deeper manner. Writing about my day and thoughts on my journal helped me stay strong till I get some good friends who I can talk to. Even after, it helps me to fully express myself because I don't need a filter on my journal.

## It also helps me in many other ways

One of things I like to do in my journal is to write todos for a day. It really helps me keep things organized and make sure to complete all the things that I need to do for a day. I found this very helpful since I started working for myself at home.

It also allows me to look back and help me learn things from the past and plan things better for the future.

I will stop here because there are a lot of studies out there that show the benefits of keeping a journal.

## How I built Goodnight Journal

I have this goal for my life that I want to spend more time working on something that can help people live. This might not have a big direct impact compared to colonizing Mars but building an app where people can write journals and interact with other journal writers was something I can actually do and help some people live better lives.

After writing journals on the paper for over a decade, I decided to create an app where anyone can come and write a diary. It came naturally since I noticed myself spending a lot more time on my laptop and cell phone. I also added the community feature where journal writers can connect with each other and have been seeing heartwarming interactions amongst the users.

I understand writing is not for everyone but also believe that it never hurts to give it a try and you can simply move on to something else till you find the one that works for you."
195,"I spent an hour on the phone to a student nurse today, it's haunted me","I work for a university, I got an email from a student nurse who has been asked to help out with the on going Covid crisis. She explained she wanted to end her temporary contract and could someone call her.

I called her at the arranged time, and she was in absolute hysterics. I managed to calm her down and asked her what's happening. She explained where she was placed and the instructions she had been given. She said she had never seen anyone die before and didn't want to be where she was. She explained the process of what she was expected to do and what she was not allowed to do, such as touch anyone who was starting to pass, become friendly with anyone she treated as it would be more difficult if they passed. 
If people go into the place she is stationed they are alone, no family, there is no phone signal due to the infrastructure. 
She lives on her own and it scared her to see that this may be her. She hasn't seen her family or friends in weeks and didn't want to die alone.
I didn't know what to do, so I just asked her questions about her life and hobbies and routine things. She's 22, and feels so alone.
I told her I too feel alone and a bit scared, but we both have to be brave, so when this passes we can cherish more positive things. She was ok at the end of the call, but it's haunted me. I told her I'll email her tomorrow to check if she's ok, she said that'll be nice and laughed a bit at crying on the phone to a stranger. I hung up and cried too, I felt for her. I hope I did the right thing."
196,Seeing things more positive,"Hey guys, i am looking for advices seeing things more positive. I would not say i am a negative person every day, but i have the feeling that negativity often beats positivity in my head. Now, i am looking for kind of a selfhack how i could deal with those situations more easily without falling into negativity. Happy for any advices i can get!
Have a nice day!"
197,apparently bpd and ppd,"I was dx with both today, and its weird. I mean when we talked about it it fits to a T but its weird that theyres two??? its not even uncommon, its just weird that its me"
198,Suicidal Ideation on Wellbutrin,"I've been taking Wellbutrin for about a month now and have had increased suicidal thoughts. I don't know if the quarantine is making it worse or not and I also did not really document it before so I don't have a grasp for how much I thought about it before. 

My doctor did tell me to stop it the second I feel suicidal thoughts increase but I'm really scared about letting medication go as it was a last resort for me. I know it's not the only option but going back to psychotherapy every so often and cbt only is really daunting.

 I didn't take about my suicidal thoughts in my last check up with my psych but he said that they wouldn't begin 4 weeks in. I feel like I'm making this less serious in my head and it's hard to stay rational while locked up in my house 24/7."
199,My mental health,"I dont feel anything. No happiness, no sadness, no nothing. And I dont know why. I have these glimpses of happiness but most of the time I just feel empty, like theres nothing happening in my brain. 
Is this depression? I know depression is more of a blanket term and can actually cover more than people know, but it doesn't feel like I'm depressed. It just feels like I'm wrong and I dont know if theres a fix. 
I keep spiraling and thinking about how my friends might be lying about liking me and I cant get that thought out of my head. Even if I text them about it I just start to get defensive and pretend like I never said anything. I want to open up to them but it always feels like they dont want to be talking about it because I think they dont like me. I think they like me, I just cant get out of the mindset that they dont like me. 
The majority of my opinions on things are just entirely neutral. Family, friends, shows, music, it's all just neutral. Liam it's just sort if there and it wouldn't make a difference if it was there or not. I dont know if I truly love it even like anything, for me everything's just there and theres not much I can do about it."
200,Health anxiety,"

Hello. I’ve suffered from health anxiety my whole life but it’s been at full force since 2019. Also have depression because of this. Does anyone have health anxiety/hypochondria? I’ve had times it was so bad I was shaking crying and screaming in my bed because I convinced myself I had a terrible disease. For weeks I was depressed and anxious I caught syphilis from protected sex (yes protected) and among other things :

A Hernia from coughing , a torn tricep tendon (I weightlift so losing that would be very important to me and need surgery), multiple sclerosis, melanoma (deadliest skin cancer) a torn pectoral tendon ,  and now afraid of a brain tumor or lymphoma cancer. Every time I get over one thing something new pops up and takes the happiness out of me for 2 weeks at a time. And it feels soooo real . If you can go to my profile I recently posted a picture of my eyelid/eyebrow area. Im pretty sure I woke up 3 days ago and they got thicker/puffed up but not swollen, and I’m gonna assume I have a tumor behind my eyes. Especially the fact I seen an article about a girl who had a droopy eyelid and it ended up as a brain tumor. And even worse , if I did I wouldn’t be able to get medical help because of the pandemic! Perfect . And this morning I noticed the skin on my nose is peeling and cracked , accompanied by the unusual rashes I’ve been having for weeks has me thinking I’ve got some type of blood cancer or systemic disease and again, can’t get medical help so it’ll be too late and I’ll die by the time this is over . Also I know this is not healthy but anytime I catch myself laughing or having fun I’ll immediately stop and tell myself I don’t deserve happiness, my life is terrible and that’s what it’ll be forever"
201,"If person kills animals and people and doesn't care how they feel, but cares for people close to him, and interfers with situations where people treated unfairly and similar things, read below description","and can cry and imagen kinda how someone might feel and it makes him feel not comfrotable with this at all!! Can cry hard from sad stories on YouTube like 911 call from woman reporting of boy burning alive because some assholes put him on fire of his age, but thoose who he chooses to kill, doesn't care, does this person has lack of empathy? Or maybe he has little of empathy and still lacks it?"
202,Am I depressed?,"I dont feel anything. No happiness, no sadness, no nothing. And I dont know why. I have these glimpses of happiness but most of the time I just feel empty, like theres nothing happening in my brain.

203,Quarantine has increased my symptoms and I need to seek aid,"I’m a student stuck at home for who knows how long and I am DONE feeling this way. I have suspicions that I may have ADHD with some depression tossed in but who knows unless I get checked out. 


Are there any online resources for counselors/psychiatrist so that I don’t have to leave the house?"
204,Am I delusional or am I normal (Repost because I think it got buried),"I had a dream a few nights ago that I got into a car accident and injured someone else in a car, when I woke up, I sincerely couldn’t remember if this happened (I woke up from this dream in the middle of the night so my brain was groggy) of course this never actually happened in reality I know that, last night I was watching a movie where that happened and again, (this was in the middle of the night 3 am - 3:30) I couldn’t remember if I’m reality I did. I don’t have these thoughts when I’m going about my day, just when I get groggy tired, in the middle of the night, not just with car accidents, also things like hitting deer, getting injured (myself) and breaking my arm or leg. Is this delusions?"
205,Feeling weak,"Not sure. There’s a lot going on . And now the world itself is going crazy. I was kinda comforted by this madness at first in a f*cked up way. I felt like it made me feel less crazy . Cause the world is crazy. I’m a 22 y/o veteran just got out late last year after a bad accident. I’ve been trying to get back on my feet. But I like dust in the wind. There are no reins for me to grab hold to. I question everyday who I am. Mixed with the nightmares , the sleep , the Fucking anxiety, the depression, the eating ..and now the worlds just crazy. Idk , idk what to do, idk where to go. So many facilities have closed down and trying to just get by seems impossible rn .im not suicidal I’m just tired , I feel like everyone and everything wants to see me break and I mean they have . But I feel like it won’t stop not until It’s all been taken from me . Whatever it is I say I have left ... so hard to explain, thanks for listening.."
206,I feel like I'm leaving the best years of my life.,"School's been cancelled until April 30th and most likely just isn't gonna open up again until next year. Im a senior, I'm missing out on a trip to Hawaii, prom, possibly graduation. Missing out on just getting proper closure to the amazing highs and extreme lows I've had. But I've already posted about that stuff, multiple times.

Now it's just me wondering if life is ever gonna get better. After high school and into college or adulthood in general, life just seems to never be as good as teenage years in high school. You have more responsibilities, you have to have a job, you'll be seeing friends a lot less and probably will just have less friends, and the independence is terrifying.

The fact that I may be leaving the ""golden age"" of my life in such an awful manner destroys me. Probably doesn't help that my parents are most likely divorcing, and I'll be living with my mom who doesn't even have a decent paying job right now. I'm just kinda numb to everything at this point.

Does adulthood ever get as good as childhood?"
207,Is their something wrong with me?,"I have been dealing with anxiety and feeling depressed (i do not “have depression”, at least not that i know of ). I finally found real friends and i only really felt happy when i was with them, and of course i have tried many other things, writing, drawing,skateboarding, videogames, guitar both acoustic and electric , and nothing has really brought me any happiness, i havent been able to find it in myself, when i start feeling depressed or mad or anything the only thing that makes me feel better is being with my friends or skateboarding, but unfortunately i dont have the luxury of a sidewalk or straight road or even a driveway to skateboard on, my driveway is all gravel and i live in the middle of fucking nowhere so even if i tried to go skate on the road id get ran over with all the curves, and thats if my mom even allows it. 
Anyways after being in shutdown i havent seen my friends in 4 weeks, worst time of my life, every day ive just been depressed, watching my brothers , doing laundry, struggling to get them to listen and clean their mess , washing dishes, not eating because i dont fucking feel like it , ive gotten behind on my school work and im failing all of my classes, theres so much i gave up. thats gotten me really stressed and going crazy, last week i went outside and started laughing like a phycopath because i felt like that was the only way to feel relieved , i wanted to scream more than anything but i didnt want my neighbors to get worried (they are pretty far but they would probably hear a scream) anyways i cant find relief in anything, all of this stress made me feel crazy, i wanted to punch a punching bag but i dont have gloves or a bag , then i saw my pocket knife and thought about cutting myself, i decided not to because i did t want to start a bad habit like that, so i saw my waterbottle, flicked my pocketknife open and swung at it a couple of times, then i stabbed it directly, i stabbed it again and again, because it actually felt good, the feeling and sound of the blade going through the plastic was so relieving , is this normal? Is their something wrong with me?"
208,Anyone else downplaying for the sake of othes?,"Just wondering is anyone else is downplaying how they actually feel about what's going on to spare making other people more upset? Outside it looks like I'm still doing good, live streaming fitness and reaching out to people. But when the camera is off I just cry. I cry about all the kids stuck at home with abusive parents.  I cry for the elderly. I cry for everyone dying alone. I cry for my family. I cry for my friends. I cry for myself. But if you call me,  I'll say I'm fine, just trying not to eat all my snacks."
209,I’m hearing voices,I’m a 28 year old male who has recently started hearing strange things. I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder and am struggling to cope witht the things I’m hearing. I am also battling addiction but am 2 weeks clean. I feel like there are people who are reading my mind. They tell me terrible things like they’re going to put me in jail or hurt my family. Every time I tel the story to somebody I am called a “Snitch” by the voices. They also mock me by calling themselves “Recovery Services” like as a taunt. I’m having a real hard time coping with this. I am really scared and have convinced myself that these are real people but no one believes me. It really does sound far fetched. I can’t think to myself anymore because the voices will repeat what I have said almost instantaneously. I really hope this is just my Mental illness and not something real. Anyone who can help me. Are there easy ways of dealing with this?
210,Is anyone else hearing from CAMHS during this lockdown?,"I’ve just turned 18 so am paranoid about the discharge and then caring about me less, although my service goes to 18. They said they would make phone appointments, but they haven’t? Is anyone actually getting appointments now? Seems like a time they should be putting more effort in."
211,My hurt hearts and I can’t breathe,"It’s like no matter how good things become, no matter how much I do, no matter how much I improve, that hole in my heart is never filled, and it hurts , physically.

For about three years I was in a deep hole, I started losing hope in this life as each day passed on, my self hatred grew and grew until I reached my lowest last year, and suicide started going into my mind, but I never dared to try it or do it, but I would often find myself looking at the streets wondering what would happen. If I just jumped.

Anyways, after hitting my lowest point an incident occurred between me and my friend and I just decided that I don’t want to feel like this no more, I don’t want to feel pain anymore , I want to live not just breathe.

And so thankfully day by day o started getting better , day by day I started to regain the hope I lost in the world, and started to give a little bit of support to People who are hurting as well, and I’m proud of that achievement , and I know that healing takes a lot of time, but for now I’m proud to say I don’t hate myself, I’m still on the way to love myself sure but I don’t hate it anymore.

But you see, some times I would have those days where I feel nothing , where I just wnat to curl inside my bed and cry, but tears don’t fall out, I know everybody has bad days and that they shouldn’t affect us. But this... whatever this is it just comes so suddenly and unexpectedly and it messes me up. I don’t hate myself or lower my self esteem, no I’m proud to be a weird potato and hapoy , but .... it’s just that even after all of these improvements, it still feels like I can’t breathe, I can’t take the air fully, sowmthing is blocking my airways and it hurts, it starts to hurt physically, it’s like there is a big hole in my heart and I don’t know how to close it up.

When I used to be hurt at least I knew that it was self hatred, I knew what was the root of the problem, but now? I don’t know what’s wrong, I feel so ... lost. So out of it. Like I’m here but not here. I feel so disconnected to this world in a way. I don’t know how to describe it exactky, but it’s not a nice feeling, it’s like the pea under the princesses bed, one small thing but she just cant sleep. I try to cry, I wnat to cry but the tears just won’t fall out, no matter how bad. And I can’t tell people because I don’t know what’s wrong, and it’s so hard to explain something I don’t know with the addition of being bad at expressing yourself.

It feels like I’m lost, no I am lost. I don’t know what to do.... it’s like I’m homesick for a place that doesn’t even exist, and the problem is I am home, my family and friends are here, and for a while that hole disappears for a while, I can’t feel the pain. And if for a fraction of second I can feel inhale all the air in. I can breathe without pain . But as soon as it comes it goes.

I wish I can find a place where my heart can beat, where that void inside is filled, where I can cry without wondering why tears aren’t coming out, a place where I can feel warm, look up at the stars and not feel so alone. 

I can’t see stars, and I have never star gazed, but I love them, because I know they won’t leave me even if I can’t see them , they just make me calm down and believe that I can reach out to my dreams and that it’s okay, but still it hurts, after the stars are gone it just hurts.

It hurts so much I can’t breathe.

I don’t want to just be alive, I wanna live, and breathe again."
212,Do you sometimes feel like there's a devil whispering in your ear to kill yourself and that you're a puppet and you can't do anything about it?,"Because that's what I'm feeling right now. My anxiety is heightened as I am extremely scared that I might be in distress too much that I might make a mistake of attempting suicide. I might have a psychotic attack and attempt. And j just recently woken up from a nightmare about a creepy, sketchy person wearing all black that looks like a serial killer or something that can hear everything we say even if we aren't near to him."
213,OK I am more in control today but...,"Has anyone experienced this:

Things are going really well today, compared to the past few days. We got a large tax refund, did 8 baskets of laundry (and that literally took almost 3 hours to finish), got Taco Bell for supper, had Ben &amp; Jerry's for dessert, talked to my Probation Officer AND my Case Manager (for mental health) and both went well, so I have NOTHING to complain about today...not even the quarantine since we DID get out and about for some of the day today. Yet, I feel so numb that it is now really concerning me. I mean I know I am depressed, but these kind of good things still are able to pull me out of it at least for a while. It isn't helping at all today. I feel like my heart is surrounded by a dark, blacker than black mass that I can't shed. I can intuitively see that I am getting sucked deeper and deeper into the hole, but here is the problem--I can't seem to care. I have literally no emotions. I don't feel the despair of the depression, nor the contentedness of a good day spent with my hubby. I don't feel love, hate, aggravation, anger, humor, nothing. I try to crack jokes and they all fall flat. Hmmm...this is really weird, and as I said, concerning.

Can I have a few hugs just to help me through this black time and so I know someone out there is listening?

Thanks all."
214,My mother and her partner (not my father) used to constantly argue in a very loud and aggressive fashion and it has affected my mental health in a way I quite can't explain. I'll try to.,"#WHAT HAPPENED?

So my mother and father divorced when I was around 14-15 and not long after that my mother got in to a relationship with a man. 

The first year or two they used to constantly argue about something, I didn't quite catch what it was that they would argue about because all I could ever hear was the muffled sounds of screaming and name calling and sound of furniture being hit and doors being slammed. 

They never let me bring it up. The arguing would mostly happen during the night time and I would try to discuss it with them at the breakfast table but they always silenced me by saying that it's ""adult business""  and that I shouldn't worry about it because it's not about me. I've always been shy and careful, not the one who would talk about things like this out loud so I was scared to even try to bring it up with them. 

So now I'm 19 years old and I've discussed the matter with them many times. They've been kind to each other for many months now and they don't argue during the day or night. I'm happy for that, BUT....

All the arguing and shouting and slamming doors and that very negative energy has affected the state of my mental health pretty badly. I could never tell my mother that her actions have lead to me being depressed, sad and paranoid. I hear that screaming and arguing even when there's no one else in the house but me and my dog. It's driving me insane. I don't know how I can fix this. If I even can at this point.

What can I do?"
215,Earthquake feeling?,"I'm going to say trigger warning for PTSD to do with speak of natural disasters. I won't be going into to depth but I use it as an analogy. 

So for a while I have  Thisthing that happens I focus on my surroundings too much. It feels like a mini earthquake that happens for a long amount of time

For the longest time I dismissed it as the dryer or washer being on in my old house but lately I've been checking any Appliance or possible source of shaking my whole house and there is nothing there.

So I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing and if they could possibly help me. I'd like to be able to know that I'm not alone and what it could possibly be."
216,I have to admit something,"For the past few months about once a week I take a few more painkillers than I should. Not enough to definitely kill me, but I keep adding more each time. I normally wash them down with a beer and go to bed. I'm not really looking for a response to this. I already have a therapist. I just felt like I should write it somewhere."
217,Coping with a traumatic experience,"19m   I should just say it here so I don't dance around the topic. At a young age I was raped multiple times.
This had and still has a major effect on my mental health. During the time my performance in primary school dropped behind other students, I couldn't sleep and had regular thoughts of suicide. I became socially inept, struggling to relate to and befriend other kids. I became emotionally numb and reserved. It was the lowest time of my life.
Today I still think back to the moments that scarred me so deeply. To this day I struggle with my sleeping schedule and feeling of self worth. In effect at times I feel lesser than others because of what happened.
With that said I still have methods and rules which push me through bad times. The first and most obvious way of helping yourself in a situation like this is to try your best to be open and talk about it. I first talked to a close friend about it when I was 17, years after the incident. It was the hardest conversation I'd ever had. I couldn't stop crying and when first explaining what I'd been through I could barely speak because of how scared I was. It didn't feel good to talk about it in the moment, but I felt proud after the fact. I felt stronger and more confident. In the last 2 years I've been able to talk to 4 other close friends about it, each time it became easier, and each time I felt secure when my friends assured me it was ok. So that's the most basic and obvious thing you can do to feel better in the long term. 
Coping with suicidal thoughts is kind of a personal mind game I play with myself. The main thing I tell myself when I want to kill myself is that I'm currently better than I ever was. I think back to when I was younger and remind myself of the fact that back then was the worst moment of my life and nothing will ever make me feel as terrible. In essence I didn't kill myself then so I would be stupid to give up now, as if I'm weaker than what I was.
Having a goal set in mind will help steer you away from stagnating in your life. I keep myself busy and in work always targeting myself towards points of improvement. Realistically I don't mind if I live a second rate life since I don't mind as long as I'm alive and still moving forward but it makes things easier if you always strive for better. My current goals are fairly basic. I'm going to learn to drive (I already ride a motorbike but driving is pretty essential to my future). Then I'm going to join the police and help people since I have a strong mind when geared towards justice. Other than that I haven't got much set. Set your basic goals asap to keep you going.
Being emotionally numb is one the issues I still struggle with today. I benefit in the sense that I've grown to be very empathetic towards other people, but my general feelings of happiness, excitement or even as basic as agitation are stunted and stagnant. It makes me feel just that little less human and it hurts on a deep level. To help with this I often feel bored and depressed as a result, even in tense or upbeat environments. If anyone knows any methods which help this I'd love to know.
I haven't got much to say about sleep since I still haven't solved it proper but i hope you see something here you could relate to and maybe try apply to yourself. For anyone who's struggled with this before, keep going. We'll be ok someday."
218,Why does everyone lie to me,"Why does everyone lie to me? I only want one thing and it's for people to be honest with me and tell me truth. Nobody ever does. They all lie to my face. They all feel bad for me so they feel obligated to lie to me. It hurts so much that they think that they have to give you fake compliments because they realised how fucked you are.

""Hey Tea is cute"" said by many people.
 No I'm fucking not. I don't understand in any way people would say this. I look in the mirror and can't see it. Oh I get it. I'm hideous. That's why they say the opposite.

""Tea are you smart"" or ""Hey Tea is like really smart"" No. I'm not. And you know I'm not. I'm a fucking retard. So why are you saying that or asking it? Oh because they know I'm retarded. I'd be happier if you'd called me a retard to my face because at least somebody would be being honest with me.

""Tea you're *insert positive comment/compliment*"" No I am not please fucking stop. It makes me feel awful when you say these things. I know you feel obligated to do so but please just be honest or say nothing at all.

Everytime they ""compliment"" me I want to just die on the spot. Because I know what they are really saying/mean. 

Please stop lying to me. I know you're lying and it hurts so fucking much when you say these things because I know it isn't true. Please stop lying. Stop lying. Stop lying. Stop lying."
219,Hey guys I wrote a book about living with different mental illnesses all proceeds going to charity,http://www.lulu.com/shop/ryan-mooney/clinical-stories-of-the-failed/hardcover/product-24485340.html?fbclid=IwAR3ot1dTP-kQ9w3Wzc_Wo1vlOk5cj1RPnk_nexWZp6XR_u_upD6zjvGTYE0
220,why do I feel like such a fake/imposter?,"first post, so dont really know what im doing, but wondered if anyone on here has felt similar feelings to me or has any insight into why I may feel this way. all my life I have felt like im just waiting for people to realise the real me and that if they 'really knew me' they would hate me. even those who have shown unwavering love and acceptance in spite of knowing all my deepest darkest secrets; even then, when I told them and the response was positive, I still thought they would hate me only if they knew.. but they did know and they didnt hate me.. I found/find this hard to understand (despite being a very accepting person myself).. I think because of this I have always been bad at keeping up communications with friends and have always felt like an outcast though none of my friends make me feel that way. I have suffered the past year with pretty serious (undiagnosed) anxiety, which left me feeling super lonely, despondent and with thoughts of dying and self-harm. I am super paranoid that people hate me constantly and find it easier to not see people and not to respond to people than feel this crippling anxiety that they all know I'm a fake. every time I receive a message from someone I feel such deep anxiety, as if ive just been 'caught out' (whether that's for not keeping up with school work, doing bad things like smoking when I know I shouldn't be or just being a bum), even when the message has nothing to do with anything negative. I often message people because I miss them or I want to know that they are okay, but find when they reply I often ignore them, and I dont really know why - maybe my view of receiving messages has made me think others wouldn't care if I replied either even though I know this isn't true. and although I choose not to reply to messages, I feel awful about it. I hate that people are nice to me and I wish they would just all go away so that I owe them no responsibility I can't live up to. I feel like im super selfish, even though I am told im not. I also feel like anything nice I do is motivated by personal satisfaction, because I like seeing others happy, so anything I do to make others happy is not selfless, but selfish. people tell me how nice I am all the time and it just makes me feel worse. I have just broke up with my boyfriend of 1.5 years, I am 21 and he is 27. he was the most genuine and best person I have ever met, and because of this I always felt like I could never connect on a deep level as I felt like such a fake around him as he was genuine and I am not. I broke up with him even though I know he was really good for me, but he made me realise all the things I hate about myself more and when I tell him this he just says how amazing he thinks I am, but that makes me hate myself more. I dont know why I feel this way, I never want to hurt anyone and I dont think I am an unkind person, I just dont think I am genuinely good and feel that people will never know the real 'evil' me so I dont deserve true friendships... I feel fucked up and like a real imposter/criminal - I know that sounds crazy but I can't shake it. I dont know if any of this makes sense or if anyone will read this even. but I just needed to vent, I hope you guys are staying well in this time and I hope for better days to come for us all. thank you x"
221,Marijuana Induced Psychosis,"I doubt this will go anywhere. Let alone I’ll finish it. I’m not saying my name, but I’m sure you’ll figure it out. 
At the time of writing this I’m 18, I’ve been smoking weed consistently for the past 3 years, I’ve come across times where I often feel disconnected from the world when I’m sober, not just when I’m high. I’ve thought it’s been a problem before, I’ve been to therapist to try and figure it out. I’ve been to doctors who say it’s limes disease because I got bit by a tick four years ago. 

I’m not starting to come across what is called Marijuana Induced Psychosis, a mental illness that causes one to feel distant from reality. I’m not trying to self diagnose myself, I know I shouldn’t. But I do fear that this is happening. I feel like I should stop but I know I have an addictive personality. When I was 12 I heavily vaped, spending hundreds of dollars on devices, juice and pods. At first it wasn’t for the nicotine, I simply tried it from a buddy, thought it was cool, bought my own that didn’t have nicotine but through hanging out with my buddies, I slowly developed an addiction.

Now all I do is smoke weed, but I smoke it heavily. Hell, the second I turned 18 I went and spent the $200 to get my medical cart and I said “I have anxiety” which in the past I used to and I still kind of do now I guess, but I can manage it find. I just wanted to get dispensary weed. 

The reason I write all this is because I constantly feel disconnected from reality and strongly feel that this is the reason why. In a few months I plan on moving down to Florida for college and I hope I’m able to go down and just completely stop smoking. 

A side note:
As a kid I grew up loving to be outside and hanging out with my buddies (this is back when my parents were together) now I just sit inside getting high all the time unless I’m going to school or work. But even when I’m at school, or work, I’m high. 

Part of me doesn’t want to post this,
Part of me does. 
I fear if I don’t, I mentally won’t set a goal for myself to stop this and better myself before it gets worse. 
If anyone else feels this way, please reach out. 
To those who have read this,
Thank you. 
I hope I can do this. 
I hope I can better myself. 
For my own mental health."
222,What do you guys do when you are feeling small?,"I’m currently feeling incredibly small and like a waste of space, I won’t do anything reckless but I really want suggestions as my normal things have not been working. Thank you in advance"
223,I fear I may harm someone,Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I don't normally go to the internet for help with stuff like this but I feel if I tell anyone what is going on they'll think I'm a psychopath. I've been having thoughts about murdering someone. I can't use sharp objects when others are around I fear I might harm them. These thoughts are unwanted but are becoming regular. I constantly ask my friends if I'm a good person. I think I'm not one. What should I do? How do I bring this up with my counselor. All of this started after I started taking a new med. I've stopped taking it. Was that a good idea should? Should I start taking it again? Even after I've stopped the thoughts are still here.
224,My whole family may have Covid-19 now,"I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i can’t post in the Covid-19 Support group. I’m losing my mind 

I was feeling sick four days ago, had chest pain and couldn’t breathe easily when laying down. 

I went yesterday with my dad and grandma since she was feeling sick too (was coughing, having body pain) 

So i wasn’t coughing so i went inside and got a check up and was told it was sinus infection like allergies. 

My grandma got tested and it took a long time. Fast forward to today, She tested positive. 

She didn’t have a fever and didn’t feel too bad but she still got it. 

I was stuck in a car with her for 4 hours just waiting for the test to be done for some reason. 

My dad doesn’t listen and still goes out and visits her before all this. 

We have to self quarantine now. 


I’m so fuckjng scared. 

I’m overweight, and probably have a chronic illness for several things. My mom is 50 and doesn’t go the doctor. My dad doesn’t take things seriously, he doesn’t wash his clothes nor does he take responsibility for going out all the time to her house. My older sister has had bronchitis when she was younger and gets sick often. My younger sister is healthy but fuck she’s young, she has to live her life. 

My aunt and uncle are old man. They have knee problems and my aunt has cancer. I have been visiting them.... If i gave it to them and it killed them...

holy fuck holy fuck i’m having a mental breakdown. 

WE CANT EVEN GET TESTED IM SO FUCKED 

IS MY FAMILY GOING TO DIE?

AM I GOING TO DIE? 

I haven’t proven myself yet. I haven’t made my family proud yet. I have to live my life. My family should be there. MY FAMILY SHOULD BE HERE WITH ME.

PLEASE PLEASE

I’m losing my mind

225,Realized the potential in myself to self harm. Absolutely terrified,"I am going through a mental health crisis and found myself here. I’m scared of myself. I’m not interested in cutting or something medically dangerous. I just realized I want to punish myself by hitting myself or sleeping on the floor or something like that. I mistakenly believe I will find relief in physical pain. Worst part is... I think I want to do it for the attention it might get me. I just want to be washed over with misery. These feelings are so unlike me and I’m so scared. I need guidance.
This is a call for help."
226,Feels like my brain has shut off,"It’s hard to describe, but I’ve had this problem for a while and it has gotten progressively worse over time. 

Basically, it feels like my brain is never “on”. If I need to think about something, like REALLY think about something, I have to actively decide to think about it.

For example...

Situations where I don’t need to “think” (the answers are pretty obvious and don’t involve reflection or real decisions) - Am I hungry? What should I watch on TV? Should I do laundry?

In contrast, my therapist asked me how I was feeling these days, and I said “pretty neutral”. They asked what made it “neutral”, and although I told them it was because I felt neither good nor bad, I realized that I said “neutral” because it’s a non-answer and I haven’t really evaluated how I feel about my life. So I asked myself, how DO I feel about my life right now? And it felt like I was skimming the surface of a lake with a net and not really catching anything, because the question really needed me to THINK about my life and my feelings about it. But I couldn’t just THINK about it. It feels like there’s a little button in my brain that I just have to hit in order to activate it, but I can’t, or don’t want to. 

That’s just one example. The same thing happens when a friend asks how I liked the movie we just watched. It takes me so much effort to decide if I really like it or not that I usually just say, “it was good!” because I’d have to boot up my brain to generate a single critical thought. It’s not like a fear of having an opinion on something. It’s like my brain literally doesn’t have the energy to even form a complex thought.

Sometimes it’s hard for me to concentrate while I’m reading, like I read each word but the meaning doesn’t fully reach my brain. I used to be very, very advanced as a kid and I had excellent reading comprehension, so this is a relatively new thing.

My brain just feels sort of empty. It’s easier not to press the “THINK” button, easier to not really think about things too deeply. 

I also have some memory issues, like I’ll send a text and immediately forget what I sent. Sometimes I can’t even recall the gist of the message, or who I sent it to. But then I’ll look at the text and be like, “oh, yeah, I remember now.” 

When my coworkers ask what I did over the weekend, I draw a blank. I usually say “nothing” to avoid the embarrassment of having to switch my brain on a try to recall anything I did.

I guess it’s nonessential information, so my brain doesn’t try to store it. I have trouble remembering everything I did the day before, or what I had for lunch sometimes. It’s just “little” stuff like that, I can remember events, or conversations that I actively tell myself I should remember. But the little day to day stuff drifts away because it’s not as important and the days tend to blur together. I keep a journal and a planner to document what I do each day, otherwise it all blends.

Does anyone else experience stuff like this? I’m going to talk to my therapist about it, but I don’t know if I can describe it well enough to make sense. It just feels like my brain is... gone."
227,i feel like im losing all hope," 

Well I guess the title says it. I know that everyone is going through something or the other during this time period, it's pretty awful.

This is going to be a bit of a read.

Lately, I've felt beyond depressed and down. I am already diagnosed bipolar but I've been struggling with noticing my triggers and identifying patterns so I can yank myself out of an episode. I have tried to reach out to multiple people in my life, blatantly sharing that I am depressed and it is getting worse.

I'm posting here because I have an (almost) five year old daughter and to be honest this is the hardest fucking thing I've ever done in my life. I got pregnant at 17, experienced my abusive ex crying and begging for a child while my grandmother (raised me) verbally abused me to get me to abort. I actually set up an appointment to do so, but on the morning of the appointment my stepdad took me to the hospital instead to just see the fetus and decide there. I was 8 weeks or so, heard the heartbeat and broke down crying. I couldn't do it, so I told my family. They kicked me out, I move in with my ex, graduated high school then left to another state. While I was pregnant, I lived in a home with a lot of other teens and no adults, no water, only electricity. They sold drugs, I sat in a room all day hungry while my ex went out to cheat.

My ex abused me physically, mentally, financially, and any way possible here. Multiple black eyes, even one my mother saw when she visited me when I went into early labor at 28 weeks and did nothing. Basically, I dated my childs father until she was 3. He sexually abused me, I used to have embarrassing mental breaks sometimes and hit myself while he tried to come onto me so he would be so shocked that he would stop. Now I fear that all of this has mentally deteriorated me. I should also note that I had an abortion in 2016 (my daughter was born in 2015). I learned after the first time.

Now I live alone in a basement apartment with my daughter, she is properly loved and cared for. Our needs are met. She is happy. I am not. I am going through another breakup. I hopped in a relationship soon after I left my childs father as I mentally checked out way before our breakup. This most recent ex and I dated a year and a half before he decided he no longer wanted to date someone with a child. I feel like I've just experienced true love and a first true heartbreak. It's less about him and moreso about my looming loneliness. He also was my sanity. I get no adult interaction. I am alone. My family can't stand my daughter and I, they won't move in with us to help me. I do it all 100% alone. Financially and physically. I get no breaks. I'm 22 now, almost 23, and I just want to kill myself. I don't want to do this anymore. I am selfish. I want my youth, I can't support her, I fear I just passed on another generation of poverty and poor mental health. I can't do this.

My stepdad was the only one willing to hrlp but he works 80-90 hour weeks and now I can't even move in since it;s a tiny house and there would be 7 people.

I don't know what to do anymore. I hate this. I can't go to therapy as I can't afford it, and with the pandemic I lost my job so I have no money for it. Just spent the last of my money on this month's rent.

Please give me advice. I know this is all terribly selfish but I'm at my wits end."
228,I was just diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and I am not sure what it is.,"I have been struggling with mental health problems for several years, like depression, severe anxiety, and PTSD. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist and have been on 7 different meds to try to help me. I just kept getting worse. I've been hospitalized 3 times and have attempted suicide twice. I'm 16.  
my parents decided to try to get me into more intensive therapy and were recommended DBT (dialectical behavior therapy, basically for patients with borderline, bipolar, and impulsive and things like self-harm) I had an interview sort of thing with one of the specialists and she diagnosed me with BPD. she didn't explain much about what that is. I only know what the google definition of it is. I'm really confused and scared and am hoping someone here can explain it better for me?"
229,I hate everything,
230,Am I in a crisis,"So lately I just don’t know what’s wrong with me, I just feel like my mental health is falling apart at the seams. I will feel okay one minute, want to kill myself the next and then get mad and want to do or say something I’ll regret the next. I feel like I just can’t take this anymore and everything is making me so angry I don’t want to be like this anymore but I feel like I’ll just be stuck inside my head forever because I feel if I told someone what I actually think about they wouldn’t understand because I don’t even want to think about because it’s horrible and it tortures me. And just to be clear I can control myself and I know it’s bad and insensible and I wouldn’t hurt anyone it’s just I’m having difficulty coping right now and it’s really bothering me."
231,"Ideas welcome: I chose something meaningful to me for my final university project, and am designing a set of solidarity cards/gift dressings for young adults with depression/anxiety. I want the cards to be meaningful &amp; far from cliché. Anyone with a spare moment to brainstorm with me? Thoughts below","1. If you suffer from anxiety or depression (I have anxiety) - what meaningful things would be nice to hear from a friend? Something that isn't cliche, and really would show support. (I remember someone once told me that the definition of brave wasn't the same for everyone, and that whatever things I have done that I felt I needed to be brave for are the things I should be proud of. I have pinned that up by my desk and it truly has made a difference to my perspective of what being brave means.)

2. I want the cards to be for everyone. Gender neutral. I am in no way gender bias. But I have noticed many kindness cards and mental health gift dressings/cards are very much in line with trends for a female audience. While I know that men and women can like the same things, I know some of my male friends wouldn't find those styles suited to them. What might be some imagery or visual elements that could reach a broader audience?

Any help greatly appreciated. This project is personal to me, but my feelings are not the same as everyone else's feelings so the input would mean a lot."
232,My therapist sucks (a rant),"Talking to my therapist each week is useless. I've been seeing her for about 6 weeks now. I have opened up about almost everything to her. However, every conversation is like talking with a stranger. It's so monotone, and no matter how I'm feeling she always asks and says the same thing. 

I mentioned on day one that I feel I have an eating disorder. No mention of it since, even with me bringing up using food as a coping mechanism at least three weeks in a row now. She keeps bringing up the same coping mechanisms that I've told her will not work for me because my anger and emotions are too strong when I'm upset to just ""journal"" or some shit. 

I also understand that therapists see many clients at once so it may be confusing at times but what annoys me is she will give me ""homework"" like finding positive coping skills, and then not follow up about it when she said she will. 

On top of these things, she also rushes our appointments. At least half of our appointments so far have been a half hour or less. She'll say things like ""since you're not feeling well, we can end early today."" Huh?! If I drove here and I've already been here 20 minutes, I don't see a need to end early, especially since I didn't comment on how much pain I was in. 

My problems just seem too much for her to handle and I'm wanting to switch therapists again. This is exhausting and why I took a break from therapy for so long."
233,Scared and unsure on getting professional help about my mental health,"(19M) This is my first time posting here and I could use some advice on whether I need help or not because throughout the last 5 years or so, I've been struggling to be happy and motivated to do anything beneficial for myself. I've always put the needs of other people first before mine and I still do to a certain extent but recently this year, I just hit a brick wall and fell into a pit of sadness and that made me disappear off any social media, which in a way is a relief but at the same time, I feel like I'm pushing away some of my closest friends and therefore, I'm putting myself first which I hate.

I got told so many times that I need to be happy with myself before I can make others happy, that I should stop not caring about myself but the problem is that whenever I do anything for myself, even as buying clothing that is cheap, I instantly feel terrible because I know there are people out there that don't have the privilege to do something like that, people who have their life way worse than I do. I never try to complain, I try to not appear sad for others and the one thing I kept hidden for so long is my constant saddness within me for years. I would never talk to anyone about it because I feel like a burden otherwise, and because of that, I'm scared of getting proper help because I could end up needing way more help and attention than I expected.

Right now I'm on a gap year helping out my mother before going to Uni in September and I just want to make sure I do everything right for my family cos I don't want to come off as a disappointment either, which I'm scared of as well. I never really fit in with my age group either when I was in school, I was silent most of the time, I hated socializing and partying, I would sometimes just cry at random points of each week because I always have negative thoughts about myself and the future, and I end up pushing everyone away because I feel like I don't fit in with anyone.

This was a random sort of post but I just want to see if there is anyone on here that I can talk to, someone that I can actually relate to and feel comfortable to express my true feelings, I'm just about done faking my happiness so that I don't bother anyone."
234,I think im losing it,"This is too much to type out but ill try my best. The last year or so has been incredibly weird for me. Im 16 and i have definitely been thinking too much about stuff i shouldn't think about. Ive realised that im going to die one die and cant stop thinking about that for a minute. Other than fearing death, i also fear that ive gone crazy and wont be able to function as a normal human being again. I get panic attacks, i have trouble falling asleep and i have nightmares every night. Most of the comments are probably gonna be either ""lol edgy teen"" or ""get professional help"" but neither of those help. I have been to a few psychiatrists as a child and i am not able to talk to them. Obviously, there is a lot more to this, and theres dozens of other factors even i am not aware of. Anyways, all i want is your advice, maybe a new way to look at everything. The best outcome would be if you could maybe help me think of a way to start regaining my sanity, or to atleast feel like i am.
Thanks in advance"
235,Am I stuck this way forever?,"I think I'm emotionally blunted. I had a bad reaction to zoloft (made me *way* more suicidal instead of less) but they didn't take me off it, saying it would go away. Once it wore off, I got left with an incapability to really feel anything. It's like all my feelings are behind some kind of barrier, but I still get the thoughts from them, (e.g I have suicidal thoughts, but there isn't any emotion going along with it so I get very confused as to why, 'feel' depressed and have bad thoughts but I don't really *feel* anything, etc). I've been off Zoloft since November, and I still feel this way, although sometimes I feel more normal. I'm worried I'll never really feel anything intensely again. Is this a possibility?"
236,"what are mental hospitals like, i’ve been thinking of admitting myself and i just want to know what to expect","so, i’m 14 (i know, there’s a lot of stigma around depressed 14 year old white girls, but just bare with me here) and i’ve been depressed for at least 2 years now. lately it’s been getting worse and i’ve been cutting myself (which i wish i didn’t do) and been starting to be passively suicidal. I’ve seen family members pass due to suicide and i don’t want to get to that point, i’ve been reckless and careless and people around me are actually starting to get worried. Plus now that schools are shut down i have nothing to do besides dwell in my own thoughts. So i’ve been thinking of admitting myself for my own safety and health, but idk how to aboard this with my mother nor how things will go down once i arrive at the ER. So i’d basically just like to know what they’ll do and how my stay will be like"
237,Can you meet the criteria without actually having the disorder?,"I just randomly began to think about the possibility that I have bipolar disorder. That is what I was initially diagnosed with and my therapist acted like it was a no-brainer. My psychiatrist did not agree, though. I do fit all the criteria for mixed episodes or rapid cycling, and many people in my family are diagnosed with BD (but they’re the stereotype – all criminals with addictions, battery charges because of their temper) and I’m not quite that bad. I could always at least manage it enough to not get into legal issues. Though I have laid hands on my partner and I absolutely hated myself for it, but I did it over and over out of impulsivity. I’m not suggesting that those with BD have to be violent, I’m just stating that it can present like that and for much of my family it does.
Anyway,
I tried probably 6 antipsychotics and mood stabilizers and they all made me far worse. Latuda in particular made me very suicidal and also caused akathisia. All of the antipsychotics did, actually, but Latuda was the worst. 
I got very fed up with this process and asked my psychiatrist if I could try an antidepressant, and because she knows I’m familiar with mania, she trusted that I’d let her know if it happened. Again, she was veering more toward major depressive disorder, while the therapist kept insisting it was bipolar. 
She prescribed Wellbutrin. I am not kidding when I say that within the first week I felt better than I had my entire life. Mood swings were gone, energy level was up, I no longer lashed out at my loved ones (or anyone), my once crippling anxiety became non-existent, and I haven’t had one dissociative episode since being on it (it’s been almost a year) and I used to have them constantly. 
After getting my mood issues figured out, I was still left with a major issue: I could not seem to, for the life of me, do well in school. I now had the drive and energy I had lacked before (minus the periods of what was either hypomania or hyperfocusing) but it was like I would read the same paragraph as everyone else and not get the same story from it at all. I felt like I was always missing information. So my psychiatrist tested me for ADD. According to the tests, I really do not meet the criteria. She gave me adderall anyway, “just to see what would happen.” Well, it worked. I went from failing to straight A’s with very minimal effort, suggesting that it really was my brain misinterpreting things rather than me not devoting enough time to studying. I want to add that I’ve never gotten a high from adderall, before someone calls me out for just being a speed freak since I don’t know if I have ADD.
So this is the dilemma I always come back to:
Is it actually bipolar? I meet the criteria, and prior to Wellbutrin I was textbook bipolar 2. And then I don’t have any typical symptoms of ADD other than my comprehension issue. Though that doesn’t even really count before ADD/ADHD is more of a focus related issue. I have always been organized, I do not forget appointments, I do not get distracted in the middle of something and realize hours later I never finished what I was doing, etc. I’ve seen people with true ADD and oh my godddddd do they cause me anxiety. So disorganized. 
But Wellbutrin and Adderall, two medications that could very likely cause mania in a person with bipolar disorder, work perfectly for me.

Any thoughts?"
238,Having a hard time talking to others.,"When I started 8th grade which was last year, I've realised that I was significantly less social than I was and had a hard time talking to anyone who isn't my friend. It got worse as I was mercilessly bullied. I had to move schools and I did make a new friend group but I have a hard time talking to people even in my friend group. I've been in trouble with my parents for not making enough eye contact when talking to strangers. They also tell me to stop being shy and talk to others. This doesn't help. I also have anger outbursts and I try to control that by isolating myself in my room. I get in trouble for being angry which just makes it even worse. I've been told this is a normal part of puberty but I am very doubtful.

TL DR I can't talk to people even in my friend group and sometimes have anger outbursts."
239,I'm going crazy,"I'm stuck here in the quarantine with my girlfriend who's verbally and emotionally abusive. I can't get out and I don't know what to do, I just want to die, end my life and get it over with. I wish I could just get in my car and drive to the other side of the country, chill out by the beaches in Florida but due to this world's situation that just not an option right now, so I just want to end it to get away from this abuse. What do I do? I got nowhere else to go?"
240,I self harmed for the first time today...,I had been sitting in bed totally dissociated for a few hours. Then I just pick up a box of matches and start burning my legs. I’ve battled with depression and anxiety for awhile now but I have never done anything like this. Any ideas on how to prevent something like this from happening again?
241,Don’t know what’s wrong with me..,"So.. my eating habits changed drastically in the past few months. I used to eat more than I should have and now I don’t eat nearly enough. When I was at school, my friends would often have to force me to go eat dinner and sometimes I would go 24 hours without eating. Now that I’m home due to Coronavirus, my parents have been commenting on how I’m getting “too skinny” and I don’t know what to do. Some days I eat enough/more than I should, mostly due to boredom, but other days I’ll eat up to a small meal because I just don’t think about food and I don’t have any sort of appetite. I often will try and eat for the first time in over 12 hours and I physically cannot swallow any food because of how low my appetite is, and I’ve noticed this is more common when I’m eating around family or friends. I’ve lost almost 60 pounds in the past 6-7 months and if I keep continuing this trend then I’ll be at 100lbs which I know is unhealthy for me as I was 140lbs average for the past 5 years. Could this be due to my depression/bipolar 2, or could it be something else? Just wondering if anyone could relate."
242,I (18F) feel like I can’t talk to my friends anymore about my mental health even though they have done nothing wrong,"(Long post, basically a rant. TL;Dr at the bottom)

I (18F) have known most of my friends since my sophomore year of high school, three girls and three boys. One of these boys is a childhood friend the other is an ex turned friend.

 At the beginning of my junior year, I started going to therapy for depression, anxiety, trust issues, and high irritability. I had high functioning depression so I managed to get through the day but only by being in a constant state of dissociation. My friend group was very understanding and ended up being an amazing support group for me. In turn, I became a big support for them. I have a caretaker personality so most of the time I was the shoulder for them lean on, the sensible/rational friend with the best advice and would tell them how it is. I hated feeling like I was burdening my friends by telling them about my struggles with my mental illness. Even then I forced myself to be overcome my trust issues and be very open about this with them and let them know what’s going on with me. I always told them that I am taking steps to improve the situation on my own but some days are hard and I just need someone to tell me to keep my head up and pull me back on my feet. They were able to talk me out of ending my life and help me push forward in life. To say the least, they are the reason I am still alive.

Obviously, teenage drama happens and I ended up being the glue connecting most of my friends up until the summer before college. We were all going to different universities so I wasn't surprised when we all drifted apart. One of my girl-friends went her own way but would still send me a text every so often to check-in. I had a falling out with one of my guy friends and even though we sorted it out and are on speaking terms now, the friendship is not the same. My friendship with my ex became one-sided and I cut him off after many attempts to fix a friendship that he was no longer interested in (we do occasionally talk but it is a toxic friendship). Only two of my girl-friends, my childhood friend and a new girl-friend I made in college are the people I actively talk to and feel like I can confide in. I am still struggling to find my place in my university but I know people around campus, am on a sports team, and I have a social life.

With so many changes the past year and a half my mental health worsened. I inexplicably had a dramatic change in attitude at the start of the year and started isolating myself and burning bridges. I had less than a handful of people I talked to and only one of them lived in the same city as me. I wouldn’t speak most days, I would just put my headphones in to block out the world. I felt so lonely but I couldn't find the energy to socialize. I decided to go back to therapy, this time to be re-screened and for help with body dysmorphia /eating disorder. With the COVID-19 outbreak, so many changes happened so quickly and I have been struggling to juggle my mental/physical health, academics, and helping support my family financially. As someone who is used to having high functioning depression suddenly being unable to get out of bed, feeling like crying all day and starving myself as punishment and having suicidal thoughts is just too much. The past few weeks I have lost trust in even my closes friends and have become very secretive about things that I used to be very open about. I want to talk and interact with my friends but every time I do I become distant or irritable and I blow up and lash out without being provoked.

Even though I have become an observer to most of these people's lives, they mean so much to me and I know they care about me too. I don’t want to lose any more important people in my life and I know I need to do something to fix this but I don’t know what I can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL; Dr: Since the beginning of 2020 my mental health has dramatically worsened and lead to self-isolating behavior. This has made trusting my closes friends difficult, even though they haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t know what I should do to change the situation.**"
243,Quarantine,"I'm not good. I'm really not doing well.
I was getting ok with my routine everyday but since I can't get out because of this situation, I'm a disaster. 
I run, I write, I do exercise in my house, I study, but I'm feeling so alone, so small and fragile. 
Everyday the razor is becoming appealing, not to commit suicide but concentrate in something else. 
I'm so mad with everybody in my house that the only thing I want to do is sleep.
Also, I'm afraid that when this is over and everything is normal again my crazy manic side is gonna come out and make me feel even worse. 
So that's that. 
I don't want any advice, I just wanted to express what I'm feeling.
Stay safe people of the internet. 
And my my first language is not English.

244,Can watching and reading about violence cause you to become obsessed with it?,"I’ve been having scary intrusive thoughts about doing things I would never want to do, and I’m starting to think that it’s because of the stuff I’ve seen online, and the news. Can this be why I might be having these thoughts? I didn’t have them before I became depressed, and that’s because I was usually out doing stuff."
245,"Please help. Why am I furiously hurting myself constantly in every dream I have, every night?","I have been diagnosed with a lot of mental illnesses, so I'll just name the important ones. I was diagnosed with Severe depression, Severe anger issues, Generalised Anxiety Disorder and ADHD when I was around 11, not all at once ofc.

Anyway I havent self-harmed or attempted suicide in well over 2 years now, I still feel like it every now and again but its not as strong, I can resist.

But every single time I go to sleep I go into a normal dream and every single time I end up getting absolutely furious. Always at different things, losing stuff, tripping over, someone not listening, just being in school, and I end up screaming so loud and angrily, like pure rage, (I used to do it when I blacked out in anger irl?), then trying to hurt myself, punching desks, walls, door hinges, cars, smashing my head against said things, and I get even more angry because I cant hurt myself enough because Im dreaming, which makes it worse so I start stabbing myself through my hand and shit, I've been attacking people that piss me off too, beating the shit outta people, swearing at them, losing my shit at irl friends. Why is this happening? Life hasnt recently gotten harder or anything its kinda just the same as usual. When I get angry in my dreams I genuinely feel angry as if I'm awake you know? Im so sick of feeling angry all night, after finally being able to be awake without getting angry.

What does this mean? How can I get it to stop? Please help I dont want it to seep into my real life and turn me back into what I used to be..."
246,My mom called me bipolar,"So I know I’m pretty shitty and I’ve been trying to work on my mental health but as you guys know it’s been hard. 

So I came down to eat and mom came out right after I put my phone on the charger (my charger is broken rn) and said she’s taking it I argued then she went in started mocking me to to my stepdad. So I got up and kinda threw my plate on the table (it legit was a soft ass throw like one potato slice fell off my plate) and yelled well you might as well come grab my knife because I knew if I came up to my room I’d cut. She followed and I threw my knife on my bed, she grabbed and we started screaming at each other. She said my only copping is to run away which is true because it’s better than talking. I started to ignore her so she sat down even tho I told her to get out 50 times and said if she doesn’t I’ll leave she said she’d call the cops cause we’re under quarantine. Then I told her that I’d rather die than talk and it’s easier. Then she said it seems like I’m bipolar and she should’ve called my dad I said ya you should have, my dad lives across the country and she wanted to call him a few months ago to come get me because of another fight, then she left cause “she doesn’t know how to talk to me”
I know I suck hard here but is she being shitty too? What do I do? Can’t leave at this moment because of corona but my grandparents said as soon as the quarantine is lifted I can stay at their place for awhile."
247,How do I deal with trama? I have certain things that seem to set triggers for me.,"Hi, thank you so much for reading. Growing up I went through a lot of shit, I’m sure some people had it worse but I feel like I went through it. 

For example growing up my dad would get on top of me and choke me for ligit just living. Years latter I find that it’s not the choking that leaves the mental scares but the screaming of my mother for him to get off me. Now when I hear someone screaming even if I know it’s a joke or a movie it like triggers me and makes me think of it and actually makes me like made idk it’s hard to explain.  

I also went through a lot of other stuff but I don’t really wanna go to in depth for the sake of the readers. What kinda therapy do you think could help with this. I really wanna get over the past in my life and I feel like this is a good step."
248,"I live overseas, just ended a 10yr relationship, am between moving rooms, have high demands at school and a crush I’m worried I’m creeping out. Corona has now come along and isolated me.","I’m [31m] feeling completely isolated in my ex’s country. 2 months following the breakup I don’t think about my ex which I think is strange. Instead I appear to have shifted all my anxieties towards a crush I developed 6 months ago. 

School has ramped up so much and my mental capacity is failing me. I’m usually a top student but I can’t stay focused. My main teacher [28f] is my crush and she has a boyfriend. She’s so nice to me and I’ve honestly felt that there were sparks developing between us, however inappropriate that is. Being isolated, I feel that I may have recently encroached slightly on her personal boundaries by suggesting we get a coffee sometime. Her immediate coldness and rejection towards me has shattered me like a ton of bricks. 

I get plenty of exercise each day between study sessions, but that my study and crush are so deeply entwined makes it hard to detach. I just wish I could reverse time and never had said anything to her, or have someone to open up to about all of this, but I’m ashamed. 

How do I correct things with my teacher professionally as I need her pedagogic support? How do I navigate to a lighter stage in my life? I’m struggling here."
249,Quarantine is really highlighting how few people I have that care about me at all and i'm having a hard time with that.,"It's not like I didn't know before, I was very aware and have felt very bad about it. Social anxiety has made it feel near impossible to get close to anyone for well over ten years now. The only people i've felt close to are the people i've dated and they all hate me now. I'm in a high risk group, am immunosuppressed, I thought that maybe because of everything that's happening, someone would reach out, just to see if i'm ok. But that was a really stupid thought. Nobody cares if i'm ok. And i'm not really ok, i'm really scared. I know that everyone is and there are people in much worse circumstances than me right now. But i'm starting to just feel it really hard tonight. It just feels more apparent than ever how incredibly alone I am in this world."
250,Mental Health and Employment?,"Hey all,

So I (21F, USA) have had a hard time staying in retail and food work because of my anxiety. I legit quit as soon as I start the job because my anxiety becomes too overwhelming since I feel trapped at the location and I don't have control over my life as an employee. 

Obviously this isn't normal for someone my age. I'm professionally diagnosed with OCD, general/social anxiety, and depression not otherwise specified. I'm not legally disabled. 

Would it be weird if I asked an employer to work with me in regards to my mental health issues? Is it even possible?"
251,How do you keep yourself from being triggered?,"A lot of things trigger me. Brings up old memories and ignites my fear, insecurity, paranoia, and anger.

I just read something right now and I'm trying to prevent myself from obsessing over it and arguing in my head. I'm trying to distract myself but my mind is still wandering there. Lingering in the back of my mind ruining other things I'm focusing on. It's stirring up my worry and anger."
252,I lost my will to live,"I have lost all my will and motivation to actually live my life. although I don't intend to kill myself. I just can't find joy in anything. I know I should escape my comfort zone, but I can't see the point. 

to give some background I'm 21, recovering alcoholic (speaks for itself). seems like for the past 4 years the only thing I did was fuck up my life. I didn't expect to be alive this long. a bit cliché, dad was never home. I was always considered the weird kid, always had friends tho, but they never stuck with me. Since childhood, I was body shammed by most of my family (their kind of humor) so I was always conscious about my weight and I ended up really shy. so during my elementary days I never was popular, always was socially awkward. that changed a bit during high school, not sure if I was popular but I was known. I met a lot of people that are close to me around 17. For example my best friend, she is actually my roommate now too. shortly after I met a person I'm on and off with to this day ( more I look back at it the more toxic it gets) it was around the time I started fucking up too, coming home drunk almost every weekend, once I came home with third-degree burns, one time with fucked up collar bone. went to a psychiatrist, got diagnosed with OCD and depression, was on and off medication during that time. 

got on the first college I was accepted to which was Design, dropped out after the first semester. wasn't my thing, I was unstable and there wasn't two consecutive days I was sober for at least a year. Was playing it cool but after one party I tried to kill myself (very clumsy and stupidly) in front of my best friend, that was the last straw for her, she stopped talking to me for a year or so. I don't think she trusts me still, but I can't blame her. 

after that, I worked for my father for half a year. we weren't on our best terms but we got along. he seems to be walking on eggshells around me still... it was hard construction work, you work for two weeks, 12 hours a day and then you have a week off. I spent most of my money on clothes and the rest on booze. I hated the work, wasn't slacking off by any chance tho, I didn't have nobody to talk to there (all of my fathers' employees were old, conservative alcoholics), I was away from everything and everyone I thought important. so I decided to apply to another university just to get away from there.

So now I'm studying psychology and I moved away from my parents, got myself a cat. We have a deal, I focus fully on my study, they pay the bills for the first year.  Sounded like a sweet deal, but now I'm not really feeling it. I got thru the first semester, I'm not really sure I want to continue. Academic grounds doesn't seem to fit me. I feel guilty about taking money from my parents, and overall I'm just feeling like a fuckup. I know I want to work on myself, I know I wanna stay sober, but I don't have the slightest clue about what I want. Nothing brings me joy, so instead of living I just exist. trying not to hurt anyone. I can't bring myself to do anything because what's the point.

I've been all talk for a long time, but I don't know what to do now. I can't function like this. going from breakdown to breakdown... occasionally have a giant wave of motivation and good mood for a day and then back to breakdowns... I constantly feel complete loneliness, sometimes it just doesn't bother me. every night I'm going to sleep hoping I'll wake up with a different mindset somehow

Everyone seems to listen to me but nobody seems to hear me lately. My friends are angry at me cause I'm not doing anything. I know I need to work, I know I desperately need to meet new people, but I don't know what I WANT to do. 

I'm desperate

255,Depression and Anxiety amidst Isolation and Uncertainty,"I’ve been really going through it since this isolation for COVID-19 started, but I was feeling better today. Finally got more sleep last night after only getting 3-4 hours a night since the weekend, and finally started to feel more normal/awake. But now, I’m sad. I’m anxious, depressed, and sad. At the end of my Zoom class this evening, I had to talk to a professor about taking next semester off because my college is trying to get students to register for classes before telling us, very likely, that everything will be online through the fall; I only have 2 semesters of undergrad left and am in part a theatre student, and I just can’t do that. I figured it out, and some of its details, yesterday, and have been doing so for a little more than a week logistically, but the conversation brought me down. Now, I need to make my goodbye videos for this project my class and the class below me is doing for the seniors who have to graduate online. I’m depressed, and all of this is making me procrastinate, making it hard to do anything (like so much of the time, lately), including things I know I have to do, like that, and on a deadline. What should I do?"
256,"I have anxiety + depression + ADHD + OCD + dpdr + currently having psychosis + possibly Asperger or autism, idk what to do anymore",
257,How do I maintain hope and work ethic in an awful home environment?,"The family I live with has a very awful dynamic where my mother gets whatever she wants or else she throws tantrums or yells at the top of her lungs. This means that she has the power to control every other member of the family and gets to project her trauma onto the rest of us instead of working on it like a healthy person would. None of us want to hurt her back or deny her of this behaviour because we’re peaceful people.

This has affected every aspect of my life; my motivation to work, my happiness, my stress, my anxiety, my personal goals (have been lowered significantly over time because I’m finding it harder to achieve in such a hopeless and hostile environment), my social life, etc.

However, I *did* have a solution; avoid my family when I can. I used to attend the library as frequently as possible and complete as much of my homework there are as I can. Away from the apathetic and harsh family and the home which I associate with so much stress, the library was a magnificent place to study and relax. It was a little stressful having to get as much study done there as possible so I didn’t have to do it at home, but I had all day and reminded myself that I tried my hardest at the end of each day.

And then - you probably guessed it - coronavirus happened and I’m stuck at home; I’m back to square one all over again. I have to live in a house with a mother whom I have to wrestle and struggle against for basic personal boundaries such as organising my own schedule.

Sometimes I can calmly form compelling arguments disguised as me actually caring about what she thinks (after 3 years of this particular bullshit pattern she’s gotten into, I really don’t give a shit anymore and I will run away as soon as I can get a house) and other times I can’t say anything to soothe her anger and attain the autonomy I deserve.

In either case, she always has a sizeable amount of control over what I do and I’ve 100% lost the motivation to do any work at all. How do I maintain hope and work ethic in an awful home environment (which I’m now stuck in)?"
258,I don't know what to? Looking for help. Ocd has taken my life away.,"It seems like I am rarely happy or at peace. I don't have access to mental health care.

If this post better fits in another subreddit, please let me know! 

I have a really bad sexual history, and a history of mental health issues. I tried to kill myself in middle school and a few times early on in high school. I had been seeing a therapist since freshman year, but I'm a dumbass so I never told her anything about my sexual history, I just talked to her a lot about my family problems. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety this year - my first year of college.

My first boyfriend (when I was 14-15) was abusive - he would squeeze my pressure points when I made him upset, threaten to kill himself if I didn't text him, cuss at me and get insanely jealous and controlling, etc. A week into our relationship, he talked me into giving him a blowjob, I wasn't ready and hesitant, but I also didn't say no. After we broke up, when I was 15, he asked me to come over to try his new VR headset (I was dumb for coming over and expecting nothing to happen, I guess) and he then talked me into having sex with him. I kept saying ""I don't know"" and he said, ""I need a yes or no."" So I said yes, but I didn't want to. I bled for three days after that. I talked to a friend about it, and apparently my ex had bought condoms and told everyone he had a ""plan"" for winter break. I fucking guess I was the plan lmfao. It makes me really sad because I  didn't want to lose my virginity like that, and I genuinely hate him as a person. I was sexually active a lot earlier than I was ready, even though at the time I thought I was ready. It also fucks me up that everything I ever did with him was consensual even though I rarely wanted it.

Me losing my virginity to the worst person I ever met kind of gave me a ""nothing really matters"" perspective on sex. Granted, most of my sexual partners (sometimes they were boyfriends) were nice to me. There were issues within those relationships themselves but they never psychologically fucked me up the way my first ex did. Then, I started having sex with one of my friends. We had stopped for a while, it was a few night stands rather than a friends w benefits thing. One night, we were both drunk at my best friend's and he asked me if we could fuck. I wasn't feeling it and I told him no (I was actually kind of proud of being able to say no!) but I sat next to him and we watched whatever was on the TV. Then, out of nowhere, he stuck his hand down my pants and started trying to touch me. I pulled his hand out and walked away. The feeling of somewhere so private just being seized just feels so wrong and disgusting and the shock I felt in that moment made my heart jump. I got over it that night, mostly because my closest friends were there and he was completely wasted and non-functional.

After starting college, I've definitely stopped having sex as much. It causes me so much anxiety to do it with anyone I'm not previously emotionally close to/comfortable with now. It doesn't matter all that much to me that I'm not fucking as much, but I still think a lot about those instances I had with the guys in high school. My roommates and I play Buzzed, and there's one card that I hate: ""Whoever has the best losing their virginity story drinks"". Every single time virginity is brought up I'm forced to think of him. Again, I've never talked to my therapist about any of this, but I feel like there may be some type of sexual trauma I'm not checking.

**What happened:** 

I'll call her Aly. She had a competition at my college the Saturday spring break started, so she came down and I stayed an extra two days, the performance was small and short, but we were both more excited to party together. I wish so fucking bad I didn't stay. We're both 18 and were pretty much the youngest people anywhere we went that night. We pre-gamed with her friends at an apartment. I drank a substantial amount, and I barely remember the walk to the actual party. The only other person I knew in our group was her dance team friend that I've met once, (we'll call her Brianna). 

Parties give me anxiety when I'm not drunk, and I know she wanted to have fun that night so I didn't want to be a buzzkill. Towards the end of the party, I smoked a joint outside. I was still thoroughly fucked, but she told me that one of the girls at the party put us on a list to get into a club afterwards. I was around maybe 3AM by then? We went to the club. I only knew Aly and Brianna, and it was a lot of older adults rather than college students because most of them had gone home. I was passing out on the dance floor, and she'd just slap my face slightly and tell me to wake up. Aly started grinding on this guy for what seemed like forever. At this point, she was not acknowledging me at all, so I danced w Brianna. She was really good at occupying me, but I was still passing out. I remember feeling so helpless, because we were so far from my dorm and everyone was preoccupied.

I was dancing with a guy in a red shirt. I realized I didn't want to be dancing with any guys, so I kind of left and stuck close w the group that put us on the list. Brianna would pull me in every once in a while. This guy came up to me and started whispering into my ear, something like, ""I know your friend is going to pull you away but listen to me,"" and he was grabbing me everywhere. I had to wrench myself out of his grip. It was fucking terrifying. I asked Brianna if she could take me home, she asked me if I could go by myself. I was in tears and still really disoriented and I think Brianna took me to Aly. She snapped at her and told her she can't go home w the guy she was STILL dancing with. I was within a few feet of her with no people in between us and she didn't notice what happened with the guy at all. She started complaining, saying ""Why not?"". Without knowing what had happened to me, she was going to leave me at the club by myself for this random man she just met. I think I blew up and yelled at her and ran off. She caught me outside of the club and kept asking me what was wrong while she called the Uber. We got home and I don't think I stopped sobbing until I fell asleep.

It was so hard to talk to her that following day. When we got home from college, I couldn't bring myself to text her all day. I finally did at night, telling her everything that happened and why it hurt. She genuinely apologized, and I know she feels bad, but I just can't forgive her for it.

During the apology, she said a few things that just made things worse. She told me she wasn't that drunk, and it was just her fault. It was her being honest and owning up to her mistake, but that made me feel even shittier. She wasn't even drunk and she couldn't afford to keep an eye out for me? She also said that she hopes I would still go to parties with her, but she understood if I didn't want to. I didn't even want to think about partying again. I told her we can, if it's with a group of girls I choose. However, the more I think about it, the more I feel like being with her in that setting again would greatly upset me. I can't stop playing back the images of her dancing with the guy and remembering the feeling of me passing out and feeling like nobody cared. 

It's been a few weeks since. We text about every day things all the time. Recently all she ever texts me about is guys, what they're saying, how much she wants to fuck them, etc. Today I tried to vent to her about a friend trying to talk me into breaking quarantine, she ignored it and sent me a screenshot of a guy's texts to her. It just makes me feel like I'm always going to come second to guys to her. And when I needed her so desperately to care about me more, she didn't. And now I've been thinking more about my prior experiences. Everything just hurts a lot. I'm not in a good place right now."
262,Do eating disorders cause long term side effects?,"TW// Anorexia/starvation

Hi everyone, I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to be posting this but I thought it would be a good place to start?

For a bit of background, I started starving myself at 14. I had body dysmorphia and would literally fall apart if I ate anything. I just felt ugly and a disappointment to myself because I would get hungry and eat. It took me years before I could step on a weighing scale confidently and not fall apart. I don’t know if you could call it anorexia. I wasn’t properly diagnosed. My parents never took me to see a therapist. They just kinda tried to deal with it as best they could but honestly all they would do is panic and freak out at me for not eating. I also didn’t get very very skinny— like, I was but not skin and bone. It was like this until about 18/19. I’m 23 now. I don’t think it’s fair to call myself anorexic without being properly diagnosed so I just say that I starved myself. I don’t wanna be disrespectful to actual people going through this. 
 

I wanted to know if there are any long term effects with starving yourself during those prime teenage years? I know it sounds stupid but I’m convinced it’s stunted my growth and I’m shorter then I’m meant to be, fucked up my metabolism and messed up the way I digest food. I’ve never brought it up with a doctor but would like too. I just wanted to know if people have gone through the same thing and that I’m not crazy?

I also never went to therapy to recover? I ended up getting really sick one day and would vomit anything they put in my mouth. Until I was vomiting bile and it was like that for a week and a few days. I was never sent to hospital. Slowly after that, I started to eat more and more.

264,"I think I need an in-patient facility, but I could use some advice (sorry, long post)","So, 40 year-old male, USA. I think I've reached a breaking point that probably requires in-patient care. Can anyone direct me toward the cheapest services available in the US? I'm beyond broke with no real assets or resources. I have Medicare or whatever the super-poor-person insurance is called.

Backstory, just to get off my chest and in case it's relevant. I've had pretty severe anxiety for as long as I can remember.  It got a little better after HS (pretty bad time for me), and I lived and worked pretty normally for most of my 20's, other than avoiding almost all human contact, whenever possible.

The anxiety began getting worse in my later 20's, and by very early 30's it had turned into severe anxiety, panic attacks, deep depression, and agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my room (and later my own place) for days and sometimes weeks at a time. I started self-medicating with a large amount of pot and booze. That worked for a while until it didn't.

A roommate at the time convinced me to see a doctor (quite a few, actually). I tried every SSRI I've ever heard of, nothing worked. Finally Klonopin helped with the panic attacks, and eventually that, along with Prozac and Gabapentin, and still the weed and booze let me rejoin the world on a small scale.

I tried talk therapy along with seeing a psychiatrist, and more doctors. Talk therapy didn't work for me, unsurprisingly with my avoidant personality. I never felt like any of the doctors took me seriously because I don't self-harm and have never attempted suicide, although I was diagnosed with severe anxiety with panic disorder, severe depression, agoraphobia, and an ""unknown"" personality disorder. 

That brings us to now. I'm the kind of drunk that drinks every day, heavily (two periods of sobriety for less than 2 weeks each in the past 8-9 years), often to the point of blackout. I'm feeling the effects of that on my body pretty seriously at this point. The depression is worse than it's ever been; I don't want to be here, I hate myself and my life, and I don't blame anyone but me for it.

I've been isolated for so long, I don't have anyone to reach out to, and out-patient treatment doesn't work for me because I just lie about my drinking and I can't fully describe how I feel. I also don't really trust doctors at this point, and I'm more scared of being poked with needles or getting locked up than I am of dying.

I know I need pretty serious help at this point, I just don't know how to get it with no resources, even if I could overcome the fear of doing so. Any directions would be greatly appreciated, just please no sympathy, it just makes me feel more pathetic. Thank you for reading if anyone took the time, and again, sorry for the long post."

He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Until now, he would break things in his room, smash stuff and go on a rampage every now and then. I don't know what I should do.

267,I think i have a mental illness.,"It's been about a year since i'm sure that i might have a mental illness. Information is entering slow in my mind. In rare cases when i really struggle in high pressure (rare) moments the information enters my brain fast. When i have lucid dreams or dreams in general, it's very hard for me to control them, i can feel the struggle days after the dream like it happened in real life. My brain is quite slow, i lose concentration very easy, also i'm not the brightest. My mom has schizophrenia and i heard that it's possible to transmit it to the children. My mom's symptoms got more severe through the years. I don't like interactions with other people, even with my mom, because of her illness i even sometime shout to her to leave the room , she has an obsession with cleaning and doesn't leave my room until she doesn't clean it. I even feel disgusted about her. . .  .Also i'm addicted to games and tech stuff when it's something about it i can remember it very easily.

271,"Anyone else find it incredibly hard to open up at all, and feel like even though you have people to talk to, you have no one?","I feel like I have a lot of things I need to get off my chest personally and that I'm not appreciating that I have people to talk to in my life. It's like I have no one to actually discuss with. Especially with my particular personality.

I can't talk with my parents because my father is sort of a manly guy, from a country where men don't talk about their feelings much, our relationship is more like two male coworkers than father and son, we talk about sports and current events and sometimes my university work.

I've been much closer to my Mum but whenever I used to tell her about how I'm feeling she would end up making me feel guilty, she'd end up crying and saying I'm scaring her when I told her I was feeling suicidal so I just pretended I was okay.

I can't talk to my younger sisters as although the one closest to me is quite mature. I feel as their older brother I need to be more protective and not show them how damaged I'm feeling, I need to be stronger. 

I can't talk to my friends about it cause I feel so ashamed I don't know why. It took me a year to even tell one of my closest friends anything that was up with me at all. I feel as the sort of ""cocky funny guy"" of the group, showing vulnerability will just make them think less of me.

I even can't even muster up the courage to commit to any of help I need to recieve, such as therapy, I thought my friends would find out so I stopped going, I've been to many mental health helplines and online outlets and I always give a fake name cause I don't want it to be traced back to me. I have made multiple posts on this very subreddit but I always delete them after a few days. I can't help it but Idk why, I'm so goddamn ashamed of how I feel

Anyone else feel this way as well? There's so many places I can go to but for some reason I can't accept any of them"
272,anxiety relapse due to being back home due to colleges switching to remote learning,"Background:

During my senior year of high school i struggled with depression and anxiety that caused me to form a habit of twisting my hair till it fell out. I was medicated which helped the problems, however going off to college was sort of a solution. I stopped the depression and anxiety medication because i simply did not need it anymore and my anxious habits went away. 

Fast Forward to my second semester, and my school cancelled in person classes due to COVID-19(I attend school in a different State). My anxious habits (not depression) have relapsed slightly. Pretty sure they are just bad habits.

Any suggestion as to what I should do? Maybe meditation?"
273,I wouldn’t mind if I died,"I always told myself that if the world came to a point of something like this, then I would rather kill myself than live through it. Now that stuff like covid-19 is actually happening and there’s no real end in sight, I can’t help but think about all the times I thought about that. I don’t actually want to kill myself. I am excited to work in a career that excites me and I want to spend time with friends and I want to fall in love and have a family and all this stuff that will happen in the future. And even though I want all that, I also just think about how I really wouldn’t mind if I died. I’m staying in quarantine, but I also don’t mind going out if necessary because I’m not afraid of the virus killing me. Just confused and needed to get this off my chest."
274,Is there something wrong with my sis?,"
Is there something wrong with my sis?
I have a older sister who is one year older than me. Throughout my life, I experienced bullying from her and made me miserable, she's the reason why I have low self-esteem and got insecure of myself, she called me disgusting and 'ew' whenever I'm there and made fun of my removed mole everyday. I had a mole when I was a kid on my cheek and for some reason my sister has this weird obsession with moles and bullied me to the point to request my parents to have it removed but it still kept on going. She called me ugly several times and even changed my password in Facebook that I couldn't access it anymore.

My parents knew about this and they tried scolding her in every way they can but she got worse and even hitting my head with a charger and other violent stuff. I don't know what it is up with her and she even accused me of something I didn't even do. She would laugh out loud for no reason and would mock my actions.

I learned that it is okay to have a simple teasing between siblings and stuff like but what she did to me was already too much and in need of help.

Whenever we have a social gathering within a family and I am asked about my achievements, she would embarrass me and talk me down and how that I'm a 'weirdo' in front of every one. It made me feel uncomfortable and ashamed.

One time I had enough, I was asleep and she kept teasing me about my moles and how ugly I looked. I snapped and broke down in front of her. I cried and I angrily scolded her for what she did to me all those years and I even confronted her what the hell is her problem with me, I reached to the point of violence where I kicked her multiple times. All she replied was how embarrassing I am and that I'm going crazy, she even called me overreacting and said that I hit our baby cousins instead of her (who are also there watching) and she would tell everyone that I hit them, she laughed at me afterwards. I tried fighting back after all those years and even confronted her about it, she never said sorry and laughed at me.

Several days past the incident, she grew worse and kept teasing to me how horrible I was and my moles and shit like that, I tried avoiding her a d kept on going like that for weeks, my parents and relatives knew about it and told me to never mind her. It was hell, I noticed that there could be something wrong with her. Is there something wrong with my sister? If there is what's the mental illness does she have?"
275,A lot of people are talking about “surviving” quarantine and it kind of makes me feel bad that I’m happy I have to quarantine,"Everyone’s situation is different and trust me it’s not lost on me that a mandatory quarantine is hell for lots of people for lots of reasons. But my circumstances make this quarantine honestly heaven sent for me. 

Please don’t take this as me saying I’m happy about the circumstances. Because I’m not. I feel immense fear of losing loved ones to this, and I feel fear for the economy, and I feel for the tons of people this is hurting in any way. 

I am 21, I have a full time job that I’m grateful for but hate beyond words. I have ptsd and I’m in intensive therapy for it. It’s hard to manage that, being a rather low functioning depressive. I also am incredibly grateful to be living with my father who doesn’t make me pay rent. I pay for my food, phone, car and medical expenses but he offers to help still. I am privileged to have this. To be short, I’m not exactly worried about my financial situation - though I’m sure I’ll be eating my words, because god knows how the economy will be even after this blows over. 

But the point is I’m beyond happy to not have to go to work. I’ve been doing really well mentally. It’s given me time to clean my space and even work on cleaning the attic which comes with more emotional baggage than I’ll explain right now. I have been getting enough sleep. My body needs 10 hours and that’s obviously time consuming and so I rarely get that much. I’ve been doing my makeup which sounds silly but it makes me happy, I feel more put together and it’s a creative outlet for me. I also take better care of my skin when I wear makeup. I’ve been taking better care of my teeth (I have braces so it’s a process.) I’ve also been making my bed which also seems silly but again makes me feel better. I know a lot of people feel isolated but honestly I didn’t see anyone other than my bf to begin with and that hasn’t changed. I’m not bored at all. It makes me sad to see so many people are bored. I am elated to take a breath and lay in bed in the morning without guilt. Right now people are still getting outside, and I’ve been taking walks when the weather permits and honestly that’s the main thing I care about. Time outside my house makes me feel better, it doesn’t have to be a store or a restaurant. It’s usually better for me to just be outside in nature anyways. 

To know so many are suffering is awful, but I can’t say I want to go back to work. I wish more people could see the benefit in having more time to oneself. I wish 40 hour work weeks weren’t a thing. I wish we cared more about ourselves than our jobs because all our employers care about is making money anyway. 

Like I said I feel sad so many are bored or hurting just by staying home. (Excluding the people with toxic environments) I wish people would see they’re so bored because they dedicate 1/4 of their time in a week to their unfulfilling job. (Seems like a small amount of time but there’s things like transportation time and sleep and eating.) Do the little things you’ve wanted to do but never had time for. 

I know this isn’t possible for everyone. I don’t mean to sound privileged though I know I do. I just want to make it abundantly clear that I’m saying this only to those that it’s realistic and possible for which I’m sure is a small amount. But I know there are people out there. 

My point of this was just to vent about the positives I’ve experienced, but also recognizing the cost and feeling guilt for it. 

Hope that makes sense."
276,Any tips to get through self-isolation?,"TL;DR: Stuck at Home with People I hate, desperately wanting to see people, knowing that it'd probably kill me.

**An Introduction**

Hi I'm 19 years old, I'd had a history of anxiety, depression, and a lot of problems related to self-image.

I'm currently living in Toronto ON, which is currently being hit decently (by Canadian standards) by COVID-19. With nearly 426 new cases every day and way more than have been unreported. As a Diabetic who had a surgery involving steel-bars being put into my chest back in June. It's unlikely that I would survive COVID-19, so I've been isolating myself for nearly 3 weeks now... With a house full of people that I hate who are self-isolating because I'm a liability.

**My Family**

My Mom is alright, we get along well, but she often goes through a lot of my things which makes me super uncomfortable. Besides that tho, she has a go-getter attitude who always needs to be doing something.

My Step-Dad is relentlessly cold to me, always shutting me down for no apparent reason, and generally just is more distant from everyone.

Then there is my Step-Sibling, who honest to god is the worst person I've ever met. They seem to take anything that's good and completely ruin it for me by belittling it or making me feel like shit because of it. I don't really feel like getting into it here, but the amount of bullying I've gotten from them in the past has been relentless in both physical and mental departments. Someone as they've gotten older, they've only gotten more juvenile, and despite being 23 they're a highschool dropout with no job, no aspiration in life, who deals drugs, has made deals in the middle of the day during the pandemic, acts like a 13-year-old, has no voice-volume control, and is generally a smug asshole.

I also have a younger step-sibling, but they've since moved out and are a different basket case.

**My Relationships / Personal Life**

I don't feel the need to state them further, but currently, I'm in a relationship with people with 2 people one of them being a boi, and the other being Fem/Emby, with both of them being aware of that fact. How I got into this situation was actually pretty weird and accidental, but I love them with all of my heart and would do anything for the 2 of them.

I also have a nonessential job that I love, and Co-Workers who I got along super well with. I'm also still being paid despite not working

**My Question**

I moved back home from College 2 days ago, and while I spent 11 days at home a month ago, now I'm officially living back in this space and already I feel like I'm losing my mind. My older sibling is unbearable and generally a massive asshole, I'm stuck at home with this over-powering person, and I don't really know what to do. I feel like if this virus doesn't kill me, then my lack of will-power as a human being surely might.  

I miss my partners, my friends, my job, the people I interacted with, the sense of importance I got from doing work and being apart of a team. But now that this entire pandemic has happened and I'm stuck in a house with people I make, working on projects that look like complete garbage for school. Even though I am a 10-minute drive away from my Boyfriend who is also self-isolating, and feel like I could REALLY, REALLY use a hug. I know that for the sake of my health and the health of other people I can't really go out and do that. I video-chat with him and text my other partner every night. But that feeling just isn't the same as going and being with these people in person. 

How on earth do I manage to stay positive while being stuck in a living situation with people I dislike immensely?"
277,The Coronavirus itself is depressing :(,"People are panicking because of it. Yes it’s real and deadly but we would hope not *that* many people die from it. I don’t know the relative death toll, how it is. Compared to war, how bad is it?

Also it’s sad and frustrating my friends and I can’t get together cuz quarantine. :("
278,Would getting a goldfish or small rent friendly animal be a good idea to help me get out of bed every day?,"I struggle with getting up when im at my worst. When this happens I miss school and then my grades tank causing a downward spiral. Usually if I can just get up I can get to class and be functioning. 

I took this semester off to work on mental health. Switched meds and am feeling better maybe. Havent been sad yet. 

Thought a cat as like an emotional support animal would work, but I really cant afford a cat. I have a cat at home with my parents who doesnt like others. It would be irresponsible for me to get a cat or rabbit or hamster. But i figured a goldfish would serve the purpose of there being another life i have to take care of. 

What are your thoughts?"
279,I've been using alcohol to help with the shakiness that my medication causes but I don't know what to do about it,"I'm on Latuda which causes me to have Parkinsons-like tremors and shakiness after I take it and my doctor has prescribed propranolol to help with that. It helps some but I still feel shaky and restless for a few hours after I take the latuda and the only thing that seems to genuinely help is alcohol (though the propranolol makes it *much* more manageable than before). Maybe it just makes it less annoying but I don't know what to do, I don't want to become an alcoholic but I know from experience that if I stop taking the latuda I will get very depressed and possibly try to kill myself. I already had alcoholic tendencies before this but they were manageable but with the shaking I don't know what to do, I physically can't ignore it and I can't find any other option that works."
280,Am I stupid?,"Can someone help me explain what is going on in my head? So I'm in college and I have a few stressful classes. One of them is chemistry. I have a study group. In this group, I would literally teach my friends a topic like I'm a teacher or something. Then, 15 minutes later I can't understand the topic one bit and completely forgot the whole topic that I was just teaching to my friends. In classes, I can study for many hours and not retain a single thing. Also, every word my professors say goes in one ear and out the other. I just can't retain anything. Can someone help explain what is wrong with me?"
281,I'm afraid my online friend will pass if I stop talking to him,"Warning: suicide reference and S/H

I'm keeping my friend alive

We have only been talking around two weeks but very consistently. It was clear we completely clicked on a lot of opinions and ideas. Though it's still interesting to talk. He began to open up maybe a few days in but very gently.

Last night he told me he asked me what was up I told him what I was doing. I asked what is he up to and he said he's writing his suicide note. I'm really scared he's going to kill himself. He has told me I'm the only one in his life. I feel this immense pressure all of a sudden. I'm still trying to recover from depression, a suicide attempt, an ED and PTSD and grieving my mother of which he knows some about and this is undoing all the work I've put into getting better. I don't think I'm ready to literally carry someone's life in my hands. I know that is selfish but our for this past week I've been getting worse and I'm slowly slipping it's scary but I feel awful how selfish that is.

He says I'm the best thing to ever happen to him. He only does things other than go to work and entertainment because I asked him to (like talk to his parents or shower etc) I'm keeping him alive. He says I'm the only reason he hasn't killed himself. I'm the only reason he's still here I'm so scared I can't just let him die but I'm getting more ill and loosing weight he keeps monologuing these thoughts that I've had for years and it's bringing everything back. I can't let myself get any worse.

What do I do? Please help
Please also tell me if I'm being selfish I need to know if I'm in the wrong"
282,when you’re the friend they always forget,"I’ve been feeling so shitty lately about my friendships to the point where it has been hindering my mental health. I am currently 24 years old and I have had the same group of girl friends since high school. We all ended up staying in the same city right after we graduated so we stayed really close. One friend ended up moving to the east coast for school (were all from the west coast) but when she came back, nothing changed. Another friend enlisted into the military, and every time she’s back home, everything stays the same. 

Then when I move away for college (mind you I was only 3 hours away), it seems as though they had all forgotten me or maybe just stopped caring. Moving away to college made my depression/anxiety ten times worse so maybe I just changed. But it seemed as though they stopped hitting me up, stopped reaching out... I don’t know. Maybe it’s because I got into a relationship, but I always made sure to make time for them. I never wanted to be that person who falls off the face of the earth as soon as she got into a relationship. 

After moving back home last year, we all would meet up occasionally but then it all stopped suddenly. We all stopped talking to each other, or so I thought. I tried to not be on social media as much but for awhile I though we were all just growing up and getting busy with jobs and lives... but it seemed as though they all had just moved on without me. They began to constantly post photos of just them going out on the weekends or taking short trips together. I never got a call or text.

I tried not to take it personally but it’s so hard too when these are the people I though we’re going to be in my life forever. Mind you I’m not in my teens, I’m about to turn 25 and I feel so childish having these feelings but it honestly feels worse than a breakup. I feel heartbroken. Like my presence never mattered to them. 

It’s been even harder now with social distancing.. they are constantly posting screen shots of their zoom meetings and I’m just in my apartment feeling fucking sorry for myself.

I don’t know whether or not to address them about how I feel or just move on..."

But my senses are fully alert. I can hear static, I can taste the minty residue of toothpaste, I can almost feel everything that my skin is touching with detail, if my nose were not clogged I'm sure if be able to smell what my pyjamas smell like, and my actual eye itself does not feel tired (typically when I'm on my phone my eyes shake when I'm tired. Or start to close.) It's a very odd sensation, and I've never noticed if it has happened before. Has anyone else experienced this?

288,Weed use and Severe Depression,"Hi all. First time posting here. Not sure if this is the right place but I figure it is worth a shot and could help lead me in the right direction.

So I'll start off with saying that I began smoking weed when I was 13 years old (22F now) and used it basically everyday up until I was 19. I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety shortly before I started smoking weed. I started taking Prozac but hated the idea of taking medication so I stopped before I could feel an effect. Later on I was prescribed Clonazepam, but never took it because of fear of becoming addicted to it. Not long after I tried weed for the first time I started experimenting with other drugs (mushrooms, ecstasy, cocaine) but never really had a problem with any of those. But still was obviously horrible on my developing, already sensitive brain. I had a few other traumatic experiences that may have lead me to feeling how I do right now (mostly involving sexual experiences/relationships.)

 I stopped smoking for a few months because I started post-secondary"

290,Bad things just keep coming and i'm losing it,"This year has been the absolute worst for me, like for many others.. 
the most important person in my life left me in january and i've been going crazy about it since. i have wrote about it on reddit before so i dont want to tell the whole story again.. but basically it's hurting me alot and everyday is a big big struggle mentally. i started to self harm again and i have suicidal thoughts.

now couple weeks ago my dad lost his job, we have to sell our home and everything and i dont know where to go. i'm stressing about school because i get nothing even started. i quit my job too in january because the anxiety got bad. so i've just been sitting home since(i have online school).

my dad is an alcoholic and he is now going to a hospital and he almost didnt even tell me why he was going first, just said he'll tell me later. he never talks to me about anything anyways. 
he's been abusive to me and my mom when i was a kid so i'm just not close to him and we always fight if we speak to each other. 
cherry on top, i dont have any friends anymore. it's pretty complicated. the only person who cares for me is my mom who lives away from me.

my psychologist was supposed to call me yesterday but didnt, and i really needed to talk. i was ready to kill myself last night. mostly because i cant live without him(the guy who left me)... also cuse i'm so lonely and no one would care if i was gone. 
i'm just waiting when the bad things stop crashing onto me. i try to think that this is just part of the plot and i must get through it, and good things will come.. but it's really, really hard. sorry for the long post i'm just happy i can vent this somewhere."
291,Would you consider this ptsd?,"My earliest memories are of me and my dad(my bffff,notnow tho) he would tell me that if I talked to my mom about anything he wouldn’t b my friend again. He left me &amp;his dog&amp;him in a running vehicle which killed his dog from poisoning but my sis saved me. My parents would go in their room and lock us out alll day. We had no heat/windows/hella bugs n shit,so I would sneak in her room and wrap up in dirty clothes on the floor bc I would be so scared. We ended up going to Iowa for my dads job offer,within the first week(I was 5–6 I think) and my dad told us kids to go inside but I stayed out there bc I thought something was fishy going on. My dad ended up putting a gun to my moms head,I luckily begged Jim&amp;he didn’t do it bc I was there.she soon left him after that(and a couple other thingsss. So all 4 of us pack up and move into a tiny travel trailer for a few years. I got made fun of for being dirty,not dressed or groomed. My mom did the best she could w her mental issues…I think. She was in the police force,passed the tests and everything,things were looking up! But then depression hit. She wouldn’t get out the bed I would have to make her food and feed her. At the age of 7–8 she met my step dad. Who is bipolar/ocd/depressed/idfk 😂 but he and my mom got involved in hard drugs. Had crazy ass fights, pulled guns out on me. I had to obey everything. Bc I was literally scared for my life. I lock doors&amp; keep knifes on my night stand. He smashed a kitten in front of us. Plus living in this city I’ve had multiple people try to get in my vehicle/rob me/pull out guns. There’s a lot more that’s happened. But this is what I can remember right now&amp; what sticks out. I forgot half of this happened but my family filled me in on a lot of info that I blocked. I now barley leave my house or go anywhere. Bc I think people are out to get me. Has anybody else felt with childhood trauma that’s caused this? Or am I just assuming that’s the reason why I think like this. And comments appreciated. Thank you so much!!💛
Also sorry for getting so fuckin deep on here. I’m uncomfortable w/professional help,but will be going in a few weeks. Just need some outside perspective‼️💛"
292,What ways can I keep my aging parents healthy?,"I live across the country from my parents and have noticed since all of their kids have moved out they are less and less ""with it"" if that makes sense. Since the kids moved out my parents have pretty much retired and moved to a much more remote location so I don't think they are getting the same mental stimulation as before.

I was wondering if anyone has any advice of things I can do to help keep them stimulated and healthy as well as spend more time with them remotely?"
293,I Have Serious Homicidal Thoughts,"TW: Murder // Hey Redditors, for as long as I can remember, I have had homicidal thoughts and obsessed with death. I’m a 19y/o male who’s grown up in a loving family, had no past trauma or anything notable that could contribute to these thoughts. I’m on SSRI medication which I take daily.

No one takes it seriously. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it and my girlfriend. They either just think i’m trying to be “edgy” or “dark”, or just write it off as a phase. I’ve had these thoughts for as long as I can even imagine. They’re so real to me. The irresistible desire to claim someone’s life or my own.

I often contemplate what would bring me to kill someone. I usually think of things like, if I got a disease and only had a certain amount of time left to live or even my life being so unbearable I would kill someone before killing myself. 

Sometimes I’ll see someone in the perfect position and my body begins to feel indescribably strange and a sequence of how I’d kill them flashes in my mind on the spot before I come to my senses. I’ll see a man having a smoke late at night and all of a sudden it feels as if I’m about to lunge at him with a rusty piece of metal. 

I don’t know what drives me to think this shit, honestly, I don’t know. It’s very very real. To me, it doesn’t feel like a matter of will I kill someone, it’s a matter of when I will kill someone. 

I just wanted to post this cause no one believes me and I feel like someone will have experienced this same tendency as me."
294,Quarantine is making me delusional,"Even though we've been in quarantine I still have had the fortune of spending time with my bf at his house. However, he's had weird stuff going on recently and it's made my paranoia flare up again, even on medication. I've been losing my shit when I've been by myself, to the point where I can barely touch my phone cause I think someone is recording my every action. 

I had therapy earlier today and my therapist kept telling me to keep up my reality checks, but it's getting difficult to be by myself again and I'm scared that I can't be alone because I'll keep stressing out to the point of hallucinating again. 

Any advice helps, even just someone to talk to. I just feel really alone and it doesn't feel good"
295,Some Questions on Seeing my Doctor about anxiety,"So I'm going to see my doctor about my anxiety in a week. Some back story (if it matters) I was a really outgoing kid up until grade 10, grade 10 I became very quiet in social situations, unless I was drinking or doing drugs. (I was doing alot of different drugs on weekends during my school years) I've always had a good idea that I have bad anxiety, I have random mini panic attacks while overthinking and sometimes in social situations, eye contact makes me uncomfortable when talking to strangers people I don't know. I graduated highschool a bit later then I could have, due to focusing problems. Anyways after highschool I had no plans, Ive been working in factory envirements since. Anyways I've been self medicating with xanax for about a year and a half now. I also aquired diazapam tablets, someone told me it's less sedating then xanax.I don't abuse these pills in the sense of I'm not looking to get high of them I use them the same way doctor's prescribe it. 10mg in the morning 10mg at night. If I tell my doctor I've been self medicating for awhile now with these pills and they do work as I take them responsibly. Would me getting a prescription for any kind of anxiety releif meds be out of the picture? Doing this without a prescription is hard financially as I'm paying 5$ per tablet. 1mg Xanax or 10mg Vallium.

If you wanna get straight to the question:

if I tell my doctor I've been self medicating for a year and a half. In a responsible manner, is there a good chance that getting a prescription is out of the question?"

297,Seeking help for mother,"!!SCROLL TO BOTTOM FOR POST - FIRST 5 PARAGRAPHS ARE CONTEXT!!

Hi everyone, I hope you are all doing well during this time of uncertainty. I will try to make this as short as possible while still giving all details so if what I am saying seems generalized that is why.

Since I am now back home 24/7 due to ongoing world circumstances after being away for 6 months due to college, I have had a lot more time at home with mom and dad. Like... a lot. Even more than before I went away.

During this time I have noticed that my mother's mental has been declining. She has had issues with her mental wellbeing long before I was born, so for her to have issues is not abnormal, although I have a feeling that this is just different.

For a little bit of context she was diagnosed with bipolar about a decade ago and has had issues with alchohol abuse, with a number of other things before that, according to my dad, although I didn't want to find out more information.

During the summer of 2018 she was abusing alchohol BAD. Up to the point where she became suicidal and had to go to rehab. During this time she was also taking some sort of medication, which with combined with alchohol made it so that she would pass out and start seizing. ON 3 SEPERATE OCCASIONS, I would come home from school (at the time I was a senior in HS) and I would find her sitting by the kitchen table, seizing, not responding to what I was saying, and having to call an ambulance.

Ever since that time her mental health has been on a decline, and it seems to have gotten worse recently.

She is constantly rambling and she will randomly say stuff that makes perfect sense to her but doesn't to myself or my dad. For example, she will start talking to me but will already be mid sentence, and what she says is something completely random and incoherent sometimes.

She is also very irritable, for example, recently she has been falling asleep while standing up, so to say she will just stand at the kitchen counter nodding off, and she will do this for as long as someone talks to her, and when my dad or I express concern, she gets very defensive and angry.

Just within the last few hours, she asked if she could use my computer to file tax returns, at 12 in the morning mind you. She is sitting there for about 2 hours, while 80% of the time she is either staring at the screen or going about her usual rambling, she seems incapable of having a strong enough thought structure to do work. Sometime between 2 and 3am I asked her when she would be done, and she got defensive again. Screaming and yelling at me, saying how she hates living in this house and that I dont even do anything lately so there is no reason I should want sleep.

I don't know what to do or where to even post this, I thought stopping by here first may at least give me a lead. Thanks y'all, especially to those who read the whole thing and will comment. Much love. &lt;3"
298,Suicidal for the first time in years,"I’m quarantined with my narcissist ex who psychologically tortures me everyday and has for the last month. I’m moving in less than a month but idk how much more I can take of being reminded how unlovable and fucking worthless I am everyday. My ex moved on instantly, didn’t care after she dumped me, and wasn’t phased by it. I have to look at her being happy and content every day while she fucks with me psychologically. I loved this woman more than anything too, she lead me to believe that we had a future together and called me her person and said we would get married and then just broke up with me out of nowhere, gave no reason, and then jumped back into a toxic relationship with her ex.

Meanwhile, I get to go to work. But my boss spends the day undervaluing me as well. They fuck with my schedule and tell me to accept it or I don’t work there anymore, then gaslight me and say that I wanted this schedule change to begin with (I don’t and never did, it puts me at home with my ex who is fucking with me).

I can’t see my friends or escape my house aside from work because of social distancing. I have a therapist that I see weekly via video chat and I take medication. I do everything I can to be okay but I just can’t shake the feeling of being so fucking worthless and unlovable. My ex faked our entire relationship (or so it seems by the way she treats me) and I can’t trust anyone anymore.

For the first time in years, dying seems like my only option. I don’t have a plan or anything, I just feel so fucking hopeless."

300,unorganized writing I'm sorry,"for about a year now I've progressively gotten more and more depressed, it started last feburary when a person I trusted and believed to be a friend turned their back on me after I went to them for comfort after my cousin who was living with my family committed suicide. I took a week off school and during that week I tried messaging them at least once a day and they just ignored all my message, once I returned to school and saw them they greeted me by telling that they had a fun weekend spending time with a friend of ours that I didn't know much at the time and I asked why they didn't respond to me and they responded to me telling me that I was an annoying and a needy bitch. They continued to ignore me whenever we agreed to talk or work on homework together and then get people to lie to me when I wanted to talk to them or someone that we knew, around summer I just stopped talking to everyone I knew, and during the summer I didn't talk to anyone I knew I just slept and played games with online friends. When the school year started again I was in a class with a person who was friends with the person who treated me like garbage and told me that they were running a discord server with everyone that we spent lunch with at school and I asked them to invite me to the server to which they said they would after school, so after school I got home and took a nap to which I woke to messages from the server owner telling me that I'm not allowed in for things I did to the person who treats me like shit and another person telling me that everyone was talking shit about me, and that really hurt me since some of he people I've known for years, people I cared for just deciding to go against me based on the lies of a person who is just actual human trash, come october I just stopped attending class and haven't really been out since then I've been in my room about 90% of the days since october. Now I'm just feeling completely empty, everyone I talk to online feels artificial and I feel all of them are starting to be annoyed by me, I feel completely alone and I just want it all to stop I hate it. I just want to be happy."
301,Hindsight &amp; Composure,"I'm running out of amusement anymore.  A lot of the bullshit in this world isn't amusing.  We're going into a another era of bullshit instead of a Golden Age.  Propaganda, propaganda, propaganda, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.   Parties constantly instigated feud and more horrible war in this world.  Taking out their own bigotry and hatred and loathing on others instead of pacifying themselves.  Folk, I do not stoke suicide.  That's just the level of demoralization this world is coming to.  You must survive, because these fiends do, these villains and tycoons that run this world in Oligarchy.  

We've reached the state of economic and financial disruption, people should grasp the level of bullshit in this world.  The Lower and Middle class just got shut down.  The propaganda, bullshit and deceit is more evident, as the pandemics are used to compensate.  The Government may try and compensate, but the rich stay rich, the poor stay poor.  You think we have all the same opportunities and rights in this world, you do not.  

Democracy and our Constitutional Rights in the US become more hypocritical as the PR provides.  The States and City States want to go back to running their towns their way.  Whether it's Federal Crime or Treachery in various cells and cultures.  This is a norm in society, we would see this type of development happening in hindsight.  
 
I to am threatened by Religious, Cultists, Nationalist and Separatists, regularly hearkening back to the Old Norse Kingdom.  It's bullshit to deceive people of their instincts.  I have hormones, they take me to there, like all animalia.  Psychiatry and most health care would amount to an abomination in the future.  It's in a strong sense of argument we will find many practices, particularly radical one's in psychiatry.  Shock therapy, Transorbital Lobotmy;   https://www.britannica.com/science/transorbital-lobotomy  

Fuckin' Trans-orbital Lobotomy, now that was some rad shit to do to a person..  Someone brought it up recently.  It was just something to throw on the table as a possibility of shit they will do to you in the loony bin should I gain character.
The bullshit in this world out aggravating.  Not as bad as it was in the past, over the last century we've reached some milestones in human atrocities and liberty.  Private policy, spooks, GMen, really don't come after you these days, very often.  I'm unaware if I'm on the radar, I've tried to work with the authorities in the past regarding my experiences.

I am supposed to rise to the occasion, be a big dick.  I am not trying to demoralize people with Bible thumping, nor am I stoking Demons.  I was trying to be diplomatic in forming my views, got to dusting of the bibles, bullshit.  Organized religion and Dogma's are archaic, I have modern views, politics and law.  The Nobility and Aristocracy had been awry for ages throughout the coups, Vikings, Crusades.  I've mentioned my own Clan and the atrocities they had endured in the past.  The Great Pilgrimage to the New World, legions of people being banished, rufegee's, coups.  

People have to fend for themselves, I've mention the conflicting ideologies, dogma, bullshit.  Some of these parties rely on subterfuge, lies and deceit, it disgusts me.  It's their way and sense of survival in complete cowardice, but they will survive.  I'm not arrogant or one to heark on bravado, I like to know what I'm talking about.    

Not everyone considers communion with each other a necessary thing.  Politics and social reforms, ethnic cleansing, would carry on in subterfuge.  I do not believe in such heinous abuse of peoples competence.  The propaganda and paranoia stoking is enough right now, I am not a sorcerer that can tell you what's going on around the world.  Kingdoms and Politics and diplomacy and chivalry would continue.   

Enjoy the Solar Minimum while we try to avoid spiraling into Barbarism.


I'll think of something to compose my presentation better.  I didn't want to compromise my identity.  I was trying to re-enlist to the end of days.  I am not at one with the civilian world, I'm a born a bred warrior and soldier.  My boyscout ways aren't getting me anywhere in this broke fucking world.

302,Hi all I would love an opinion here,"I’ve suffered from anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder now for around 7 year’s. I’m a 23 year old male and I need help. Around 2 months ago I started experiencing this, basically my external occipital protuberance (ball on back of head) felt tender to touch it has never been right for a while (I fell and smashed it on concrete at a young age) anyway due to my OCD I’ve been constantly touching it for 63 days straight now and last night something happened. I was touching it usual and it’s if one side clicked like it always does but this time it was like 3 clicks. It didn’t feel like bone anymore it felt like a crushed monster munch. After that I’ve felt horrific and been physically vomiting. Now I don’t know if that’s just down to my anxiety or not as I do believe this is going to kill me, like I’m scared it’s bone cancer or something. I’d love an opinion on this and please keep the negative comments to yourself as I’ve had a lot of those for posting this same thing on a doctor subreddit. Many thanks"
303,I have a fear of foot steps and letting people know I am sleeping.,"I have no clue how to explain this but I will try my best... since I could remember i have always struggled with anxiety relating to these 2 problems. When I hear someone approaching my room I IMMEDIATELY begin to panic inside and my hear beats a million miles an hour. The same thing happens if I am laying down to take a nap and I hear someone, I snap up and act like I wasnt trying to nap.. my heart is pounding out of my chest and the last thing I want is for anyone to know that I was sleeping... why is this?

304,I've forgotten how to communicate,"I've been overthinking and depressed for so long that I've forgotten how to communicate.

305,Sudden-onset depression?,"DISCLAIMER: I am not looking for medical advice, I have some amazing professionals that I work with but they're not scheduling right now due to COVID-19. Therefore, I'm wondering if you guys here can point me in the direction of materials/studies that are relevant to me so I can bring it up with my psychiatrist and therapist once they start scheduling again! I've only been working with them for 2\~ish months and so there's always the possibility of another diagnosis. 

18M

I guess I'm not entirely sure where to start with this since all my regular professional support groups (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, etc) aren't working because of COVID-19. Their offices aren't open for appointments and so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see what's happening on r/mentalhealth.

I'll start by saying that I'm a senior (Gr. 12) in high school. My junior year (Gr. 11) was all that I could ask for. I had a 3.7 GPA and I was on a roll. I was certain about going to university and all that good stuff. Fast forward to the fall of 2019 and I'm starting my senior year of high school. I was off a bit of a bumpy start but I very quickly stabilized and got into the groove of things. Towards the middle/end of October, I noticed that I didn't feel motivated anymore and lost my 'drive.' Like the drive that you need to get up in the morning, get to school, eat, do work, etc. I was also sleeping significantly more than usual. Now, backtracking to the summer of 2019, I went to my general practitioner to see if he could help me with all these odd feelings that I had and became hyper-aware of thanks to reading up on what OCD and GAD are. I told him about it and we sort of narrowed it all down to OCD, and then I was put on Prozac for it. Now, This was also when I had been upped to the highest dose of Prozac I'd ever been on. Which was 70 mg. This led me to do research at home into what these symptoms mean and I sort of narrowed it down to me having ADHD. I sort of found it a bit of an odd self-diagnosis because I didn't really consider myself as having ADHD. I didn't have trouble sitting still or any of the other stereotypical characteristics that a person with ADHD would have — and to be honest, I'm still not quite sure if I have it, even after seeing the professionals and being put on a prescription for ADHD. It's been about 2 or 3 months now since starting on the prescriptions for ADHD, and I still don't feel particularly different. My psychiatrist also told me that it would be fine to stop taking the Prozac altogether to see if my symptoms change, and so far, nothing. I still feel unmotivated, despite going on week 5 or 6 of not taking the Prozac. 

So then, my question is, does any other diagnosis fit my situation? I'm thinking perhaps depression has something to do with it, but I'm not entirely certain since depression and ADHD/ADD aren't things that happen suddenly. I did well in school the previous year and didn't really suffer too much from attention/impulsiveness. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated! All of you guys here are amazing people and it truly feels so comforting knowing that there are other people going through it as well!"

309,How can I help my brother?,"Background:
My brother Luke Skywalker was diagnosed with both sever depression and anxiety 6 months ago. I witnessed him even try to take his own life. He has gone to therapy and been given medicine and is in a lot better place than he was back then. However, he recently told me that he does not take the medicine that the doctors prescribed him. He tells me that he was directed to take it “as needed” but I know that is not the case. 

Today I woke up to a text at 4am from my youngest brother, Lebron James, saying he heard (in his words) a “terror scream” come From Luke Skywalker’s room. Lebron ran to Luke’s room and was yelling “what happened, what’s wrong?” And Luke said “nothing, give me a sec” and proceeded to take a little bit before opening the bedroom door for Lebron. Lebron and Luke both went to the family room to watch tv after that and Lebron asked Luke “what happened?” Luke’s answer was that he “thought a spider was crawling into his mouth.” And that he thought that because he was “hallucinating it.”

I’m a bit skeptical of the story but I don’t know. Regardless I just worry about Luke Skywalker. I don’t think hallucinating is normal if true, but I also don’t know what happened. Any advice? I don’t even know what I’m looking for but writing/typing this up about it makes me feel better, sorry."
310,Compulsive Lying?,"I'm a teenager and I've realised today after my entire life that I may be a compulsive liar. I've done a little bit of research and ever since I've been little, my mum, dad, brotjer and even myself notice that I lie a lot. Sometimes I lie for no reason at all. It wouldn't get me in trouble if I did or didn't lie. Like have you brushed ur teeth? Yes or no, it wouldn't matter but I say yes anyways. Now of course, that isn't the only incidents there's thousands more but I don't wanna tell my parents about this issue because they despise lying and would give me loads of religious mouthfuls. 

In conclusion, I may be a compulsive liar. What do I do? Is there something wrong with me?"

But with this quarantine im stuck in this house. And the quarantine is making both me and my family members...irritable. im away from my girlfriend. Away from my friends and support group. And i been checking in on them and they are having breakdowns. And me...its a struggle to not be irritable. A struggle not to be triggered. Its a struggle not to turn to porn.

317,"Has anyone else experienced a ""Care-Coordinator"" that doesn't care? PSYCHOSIS","Hi, I am a 21/F who has been struggling with my mental health for around 4 years now. I got in touch with the University mental health team who then referred me to a 'Talking Therapies'. From there, I was referred to the Psychosis team and thus diagnosed with 'First Episode Psychosis'. This isn't an epsiode, it's been ongoing for nearly 4 years now - I've constantly been hounded by people in my head, it's only when they started showing me things is when I wanted to get help.

I was with a Care-Coordinator for several weeks, she was absolutely useless. I don't want to go into detail, it isn't relevant but she just didn't care. None of the hours we spent together were focused on me, rather other people's experiences of voices - which I told her don't work and she argued with me regarding this, ""evidence shows blah, blah, blah""... So I changed to a different Care-Coordinator. Who seems to care about my condition the same as the first, basically she doesn't. She told me she'd ring me twice a week, 3 weeks ago, nothing still! Everytime I ring, I'm told to leave a message and she'll get back to me... Nope!

My question is, are they all the same? I seem to be forgotten about at every turn? It's driving me further down the dark path and I contemplate suicide most everyday. I know that there is a pandemic, but why tell me something to then not do it... That's what bothers me the most. They're working from home FFS!!"
318,Need help/advice or just another pov than my own,"So I'm kind of a depressed person. I'm diagnosed with a mild depression which is actually not as bad as it sounds I can socialize and do all the stuff everyone else does but something I noticed during this quarantine time is that I have no interest in caring for myself.

I should clean my room.
I should shower.
I should brush my teeth.

What ends up happening is that I have no interest in doing these things if they are not necessary.

Like it's not that I don't do that all the time just sometimes when I should do it I choose to not do it for  days and sometimes even weeks.

When I do it I feel amazing I have this great feeling of accomplishment and it's really just a good feeling but then I don't do it... For days... Weeks and then I'm upset with myself for not doing it and instead of changing it by myself I just sit on my computer and play my games again and I don't even enjoy playing then because I'm mad at myself for not doing what I should do...

I mean I don't even play that many videogames I'm more someone who likes to watch his shows.

I just want to be a normal self caring human being...

It would usually start with a fight, then we would resolve it, but I was never 100% happy with the outcome. There was always some little aspect that would irritate me.

Maybe I'm in the wrong but the loved one was giving me attitude the whole time because they knew that they were right. Stuff like that, it doesn't matter wether I'm right or wrong. It irritates me that I do this and I do not know what to do.

320,Anyone else's mental health really taking a beating right now with this self isolation? I really don't know how I'm going to cope with 6 more months of this,"I suffered with anxiety and depression before this but now it feels like it's increased ten fold. My kids constantly want and need my attention, I hardly sleep at night, I'm just a lack luster sack of potatoes slumped on my couch not useful to anyone right now. And I'm trying to constantly hide back tears from my eldest and trying to stop my mind from going to the darkest of places."
321,Who are dopamine and serotonin killers?,"Those two neurotransmitters are the most important for good mental health. Who are their killers? Junk food, fap, porn, late fall asleep, reading bad news, spend time with toxic people,...? Who are they?"
322,"as stupid as this sounds, i need help destroying my positivity","basically, i was suicidal a while ago and someone talked about how its a good idea to work on getting a positive mindset, i realized that was true and when i woke up the next morning i had one, the issue though, is that how it did it was by giving me an emotion that makes my mood positive, only thing is is that emotion fucks everything up, ill list why:

1) i cant stand the emotion itself, 2) its stopping me from feeling anything else, im too positive to feel happy from anything else cause my mind thinks im happy already but im too positive to let me cover this emotion with bad emotions, i assume this is because of my numbed emotions but, 3) this isnt the type of emotion that just goes away easily, nothing works, venting, openly expressing how much i want to kill myself, triggering my trypophobia with the worst things i know about, none of that works

im just scared im never gonna be able to be happy with this happening, i cant feel happy, i cant even feel bad, i cant enjoy being alive more than just a neutral feeling, i dont even enjoy being positive, its not a me thing to do, it makes me feel uncomfortable, very uncomfortable, i want to crawl out of my skin leaving my emotions behind"
323,Sertraline/Zoloft interaction with Nytol,"So I've been on a dose of 100mg of Sertraline for one and a half years. And recently, thanks to stress about the whole coronavirus situation, I've been struggling to sleep. Even though I'm currently working from home, I'm constantly tired and this isn't very good for my productivity. I want to start taking Nytol to help me sleep, but I don't know if it is safe to take with the medication that I'm on. Does anybody know if it is?"
324,Hey guys me again kinda need some help,"Right so recently been thinking I have ADHD pretty much all the symptoms are there I tried asking on the ADHD sub but got no reply so imma try here and also I’ll use this as a way to help remember all my symptoms and experience so it’s going to be long.

Anyway to the point a few days ago I had a few people complain about me with listening and making mistakes so I google it and got ADHD popping up so I was like nah not me I don’t have ADHD what ever let’s look and almost everything related to my day to day activity constantly misplacing things can’t concentrate especially with noise I can hear the voices of people but their words sound like gibberish until I block out other noises and distractions. I’m impulsive I buy things without thinking of the bad things that could come from it like debt which I have a lot of I’ve been working on removing some of it but then I just keep buying things on credit and then end up with more. Buy now regret later seems to be my motto. I go on tangents in conversations very easily well to my they’re related but to everyone else it’s very loosely related. Pretty much always need to be fidgeting like with pens tapping moving me legs just playing with things. I can’t finish jobs it’s impossible I try to make music but I just hit a brick wall constantly and can’t carry on no matter how hard I want to try. I skip from hobby to hobby luckily I can keep a job down but that’s because my boss is really nice and won’t fire me without me punching someone so this job is safe I’ve made a few bad mistakes but luckily they’re in the past now I make little errors but they don’t get picked up on most of the time.

Thats a small list there’s more but my memory is really bad I can remember lyrics to almost all my favourite songs but I can’t remember things said to me 3 seconds ago like names names are the worst I can never remember them I try so hard to remember but I can’t. 

Anyway so I’m scared to get diagnosed.. my only option is to go private because of the corona virus I found a cheap.. ish place £350 for the diagnosis 150 for the medication trial. I’ve taken so many only tests to make sure I have it and it always comes back yes go get diagnose but I just don’t want to waste money if I don’t have it. I know I do have it but I just don’t have 350 to lose I could go through the nhs but they told me t come back in 3 months as of the virus and even then that waiting list is like 6 to 12 months long or something I can’t wait that long. I’m losing hope and starting to feel like just accepting that this is my life and not bother to get diagnosed but then again I need to make one song for my grandma she’s closed to the end I know it and I don’t want her to die without hearing my music she’s always said I can sing and would make a good musician and I want to make her proud and if she dies before I can I won’t forgive myself and if I do have ADHD and all this could’ve been prevented I’ll be so angry I’d probably be susicidal I’m 21 I should be capable of doing all this shit but everyone treats me like an idiot"
325,Medication !,"Ok so I've been taking wellbutrin for about 2 years
I used to take mehhh maybe 3 other meds (2 for anxiety, one other antidepressant) but I took myself off those 😂😂😂 i took myself off the anxiety ones because they were take-as-needed and I decided I should probably begin to start dealing with any anxiety myself without medicating and just becoming super fucking tired (bc they make u tired) &amp; anxious at the same time.
I took myself off the lexapro because it simply didnt work. The wellbutrin was the miracle worker. It did everything! And it was great!
So yeah the reason I began on wellbutrin is because the previous 284893 (jk it was like 2 or 3 maybe) meds didnt work. I had a very bad episode 2 years ago which led to overdosing on expired trazedone. I was super suicidal, but did great the next day after the OD, and then i was put on meds (honestly i may have been put on wellbutrin at the hospital i was in a few weeks before but i think it was after the attempt) again obviously. And yep, wellbutrin seemed to help! Honestly after the overdose i found an insane anount of inner peace. It's like the pills killed some chemicals in my brain. Not likely but i like to think about it that way. Ever since, my mind has been so blank but so peaceful.
Either way I'm still motherfucking depressed. I'm just not suicidal. I think there was a trigger to my suicidal episodes though so maybe I didn't need medicine. Maybe I just got over what was bothering me. 
But yeah..still depressed! I mean I'm a pro at it now so it isn't as bothersome. When you've been through this stuff for many years, it's like meh whatever - unless you go thru suicidalness...that shit is no joke. I have no real sympathy for people but I feel SO fucking bad for suicidal people. Like I actually get sad. Whack

ANYWAYYYYYYY SO YEAH (TDLR I GUESS) IM WONDERING IF I SHOULD GO OFF WELLBUTRIN OR NOT. ITS THE ONLY REMAINING MED IM ON. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I ALSO HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ON AND OFF WITH MY MEDS (take 2 days,  dont take 2 days, forget for 3 days, etc) and I'm not doing bad I don't think??? Also obviously im aware that i should ask my psychiatrist. Of course I will! But I also want yalls genuine opinions! Did you take yourself/get taken off meds that worked for you for years? What happened?"
326,My “friend with benefits” got annoyed with me for talking too much and too late and now I’m super embarrassed and feel like I’m a annoying and self centered person to everyone,"
For context: The relationship we have is casual and pretty new. Fun, largely sexual, not lots of emotional talk, and vague and undefined. we’ve gone to movies and dinner, and he’s taken me to gatherings with his friends and started to incorporate me into that. But it’s also very much based on sex and he doesn’t say a lot so he’s kind of hard to read. He has always been kind to me though and tries to make sure I’m having a good time. He’s very laid back and naturally confident, but in a subtle and slightly aloof way, rather than a cocky aggressive way. While I’m clearly the passive, inexperienced and insecure one. I often get really nervous and insecure around him, not because of anything he says but just the fact that he’s 33 and I’m 23 and he has way more life experience and just general knowledge about random things. Even though I am technically more educated, and people who know me think I’m smart, I always wind up sounding and feeling stupid. It is sometimes hard for me to keep up in conversations about sports and politics and drugs and TV and popular culture and I end up feeling and sounding dumb, boring and quiet. At least that’s how I see it.

Anyway, last night I went to his home and stayed the night (and morning). He did tell me he was pretty tired, but when I offered to reschedule he said no, that he was going to be up until probably 2am. We were both sober and had great sex almost right away. He even went down on me, for a really long time, which I didn’t ask for and which he has only done one other time and seemed to be trying extra hard to please me, especially The  watched a lot of TV and talked. I kept asking if he was tired because of what he had texted me, but couldn’t get a clear answer and he seemed to me like he wanted to talk. Also, I was bad, and had abused my meds by taking one extra 10mg adderall pretty late, which I had told him about beforehand. I thought he’d be happy I’d be energized for sex and in a good mood, but that’s when he texted about feeling tired and told me not to take another one.

 Anyway it got late, later than he told me he’d be up, and the convo seemed be to flowing and I thought he was enjoying it (in my mind at least). Eventually though I got the hint that he was tired and so we went to bed. 

Well in the morning, I stayed and watched tv for an hour of so and more casual talking but eventually I got the hint to leave. He took me home and when he got out of the car he told me to text him. Well I text him random shit about my dog and he is pretty nice and asking questions and stuff. But I was way overconfident about how the night had gone and later that night did what I thought he meant by “text me”: I asked him if he wanted to do it again, which I know is way too soon to see a fwb, but I thought he had wanted me to ask him for some reason.

Anyway, he didn’t reply for like fifteen minutes and then he said he couldn’t because he “needed to catch up on sleep.” And then adds “yeah and lay off the adderall, lol, watching tv is not the time to be sped up and talkative. It’s the time to be stoned and out of it.” And the thing is he DID say he was tired but I just expected him to tell me when he wanted to go to sleep, or if he wanted me to chill out, and I honesty didn’t realize I was being annoying and that he was tired. But I guess I was kind of talkative and a little rambling I’m sure. And he HAD been mountain biking earlier that day. I just kept asking if he was tired and he said no...

Back to the text message exchange. Well I’m mortified to realize that and I become crazy and desperate. I start groveling and pathetically apologizing and saying that I’m mad myself for blowing my chance. And he replies that I’m overthinking and there is no use dragging up the past. 

Then I tell him that I hope he will give me another chance, to which he replies that he will, as long as I don’t take/abuse extra adderall on weekdays which I immediately agree to. 

But by this point I felt tremendously embarrassed, insecure and confused about where I stand so I ask him the question I’ve been avoiding, and vowed never to ask: “if you want this to be a purely physical thing, that is cool for me. I just want to know. I’m not looking for anything super long term or serious but I’d like to be friends, if you are up for it.” to which he replies: 
“I like doing things going places with you and having fun, and also the sex, but we don’t have to see each other all the time”

Idk I guess we are on the same page then, but I just keep thinking about last night over and over and now that I look back I see all the little cues that I misread, or didn’t pick up on at all. He was responding and seemed engaged to me. I only kept talking and asking him questions because I genuinely thought he was into it. And I think I vented a little about my mom. And rambled at one point about my best friend. I wish he would have just told me he was tired or not up for talking, or wanted to watch the late night TV. 

I’m very embarrassed and hurt even though he didn’t do anything really wrong. 

I think it’s just that I was trying so hard to be the cool, collected, chill non clingy non crazy girl, and not act desperate and weird, and the thing is, I thought I was doing a good job. In fact I thought I was almost too aloof! And I got confused because he let me stay over, and I started to let my guard down just a little bit, I’m apparently annoying and boring and too talkative. And once my mom said the same thing. And my ex once said he liked “sleepy me” best. And the thing is I was suppressing myself so much that night, even though I was talking, I can be way worse and more crazy weird talkative, emotional and hyper. 

And now I’m worried that I have spent my life annoying almost everyone whilst I think I’m fine. In fact while thinking I’m cute, and bubbly, and interesting and charming and inquisitive. 

I’m having a full blown breakdown over the tiniest thing and I KNOW this is obviously not an ideal or special relationship that is even worth fighting for but for some reason I care. I don’t understand how women can date casually and not end up feeling like shit."

I've met a few wonderful people, learned a bit more about my family and clan and some of our history.  Shame and humility is not something I would bring to myself or my clan.  I brought up they were changing our names and some people mention this as well.  I am aware of these anecdotal elements to my story.  I'm not expressing my ego here.  I wanted to disclose those atrocities as well.

332,Does mania solely derive from bipolar or could it be something else?,"Hey everyone,

My ex-girlfriend suffers from depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (plus potentially some others) and recently went into a manic episode last month. 

My most immediate thought is bipolar, however, I have never seen a manic episode within her for the last three years and there appears to be no constant seasonal cycle or yearly cycle.

Can mania be caused by disorders other than bipolar? Could extreme stress and anxiety cause mania? Does menstrual cycles cause severe mood swings?"
333,Why do people mainly think of boys when talking about mental disorders?,I realised that when people talk about mental disorders like adhd or autism etc. they seem to subconsciously refer to the hypothetical person as a boy.

334,Coronavirus - Stages Of Grief,"The coronavirus and efforts to manage it worldwide have created tremendous grief for me. I lost 13 people last year and went to 11 funerals (of those, my husband and I either ran or helped run 7 of those funerals). A grief counselor told me that ""grief compounds"" when you have a lot of it at one time - and I agree. I wanted to share my experience here to help others: I've written an article about the stages of grief: [https://astrologeranne.com/893/coronavirus-stages-of-grief-covid-19/](https://astrologeranne.com/893/coronavirus-stages-of-grief-covid-19/)   


I hope others find this article helpful in making sense of this challenging time. We're all grieving, all at different stages - and the stages aren't linear. I find myself bouncing around from one stage to another, depending on various triggers and even whether it's sunny or cloudy outside. I'm going more gently these days because I must. I wish everyone else the same gentleness as they make their way through this time in human history."

336,"[Documentary] ‘Bedlam’, dir. Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, 2019","""An unflinching look at the mental illness health crisis that is ravaging the United States in a documentary made by a practicing psychiatrist who has encountered mental illness in his private life""

WHAT IT’S ABOUT: During Kennedy’s term as president, the American mental health institutions, notorious for harsh conditions, were dismantled, to be replaced by a holistic, community-based approach, and their patients let to roam free. Then, starting with Raegan, came decades of neoliberal rule, which restricted funding to mental health programs further, and saw the mentally ill kicked further to the curb. Today, severe mental health issues can be a death sentence, especially if the person in question doesn’t have the vast means to afford comprehensive healthcare. Those with caring families and those left to their own devices alike are under constant threat because medical help is rarely available. Unlike the physically manifested illnesses, their diseases remain less understood and considered shameful. “Bedlam” is narrated by Dr. Kenneth Paul Rosenberg, a psychiatrist who has experienced policy failures regarding mental health in his own family. Through his own story, as well as three other examples—a homeless and disabled middle-aged man with a manic disorder, a young woman with bipolar disorder who had to drop out of college and a man with schizophrenia who has just been released from prison—Dr. Rosenberg explores the absolute catastrophe of the country’s mental healthcare and makes an urgent plea for change.

341,Sad,When I have an anxiety attack /breakdown it causes tension with family members and it makes me depressed even more so because none of it is intentional . lately I have been feeling like I have to be an adult and bottle my negative feelings up because that's what emotionally strong people do . The problem is that I always end up having a much bigger breakdown than I would have done if I had just been upfront with the way I was feeling . I also feel pressure from other people to just get on with things but given my current mental health situation that's just not realistic right now
342,I conciously (sry for bad english) block my emotions,"So let me tell you something about me.. As a child when i was around 6 - 11 years old i couldn't manage to talk while i was in school, was sitting on the school desk the whole day and was really shy, barelly had any friends and loved playing on my pc and listening to music. I was raised in a neighbourhood where there weren't many kids to play with and if there were, they were much older or much younger, so me and my sister were playing together most of the time (i had two to three friends that i was very comfortable with). So while i was in school many older kids were bullying me because at the time i was 10-11 years old and was short and a little obese, so from then i believed that if i act tough, kids would stop bullying me and as a result i became really easily frustrated about anything. After a year or two i realised that the angrier i looked adding to my shortness i was looking kinda cute and not as somebody that people would fear. At that time i couldn't explain how but i got a lot taller and lost all of my obesity and people started telling me that i was too skinny, still some a little older kids bullied me a bit, but when i became 14 years old everybody started treating me different and many people told me that i changed completely.. however i changed physically but in my mind i was still easily frustrated,  but i can't explain i tried to put that inside me because i felt like i looked like a complete asshole so i started numbing my feelings, that was when i was 14 and now im 15 years old i tend to still numb myself a bit,  but for the most i can feel and show emotions, i just feel like i'm numbing them from time to time, like i can't manage to chill out and i think that my childhood has something to do with this, but i don't know.. Any opinions? Also i feel totaly free around my classmates now, still a bit awkward and shy but when compared to the time i was really young, now i trully feel confident in my looks, height and weight."
343,Books that teach to control your emotions?,"I realized by thriving in quarantine, that much of my discomfort in life is based on my encounter with others, and my relationship with them.

I feel everything, and sometimes even feel what others feel (thanks quarantine, I thought I had no empathy, happens to be subconscious) which makes me upset. 

I was a very shy kid, and being more open about who I am in recent years made me an emotional wreck who feels like everything is a catastrophe, *do you have any suggestions on books/videos/anything to ""calm down"" my reactions to daily struggles?* 

At the moment I'm reading ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns and it's helping me recognise the thought patterns that bring me to despair over little things. 

Example: I thought my nails were ill (which are from psoriasis in the hands) , so I was about to break down crying when I realized it was only the trasparent nailpolish getting off."
344,Does anyone know of any non shady online pharmacies? Or just looking for advice on cheaper pharmacies -_-',"Hope everyone is safe and well, any advice or suggestions are appreciated."
345,I wish I could bring myself to tell someone about my experience getting molested as a kid.,"Hi guys, I (19f) was molested by my babysitter when I was around the age of 4. Well, technically it was my babysitter's teenage brother, but he would help watch us when she had to go get groceries or something. I'm not going to go into many details, but I don't remember everything super clearly. I remember two specific memories pretty clearly, but then other times all I remember is him reaching into my pants and then it goes blank. I don't remember if it ever went beyond touching, but I don't think I want to know. I also don't know if I was the only one, but I remember him singling me out a lot. Like, when nap time would roll around he'd ask me to stay up and help him play video games  (I obviously wasn't actually playing) because I was his favorite. Things like that. 

For years I didn't really grasp what had happened. I remember he was handsome and he always let me do what I want, eat what I want. It wasn't until I started going through puberty and the topics of sex, consent, sexual assault, etc became a topic of conversation. I was around 12 when it hit me. I'd pretty much forgotten about him and I don't remember what triggered the memory but I remember just laying in my bed and crying. I didn't tell anyone because I was embarrassed but I started acting out. I became a huge asshole for a couple of years and one time when I was around 13/14 my mom &amp; I got into a bad fight because I'd wanted to hangout with this older guy and she basically told me she didn't want him to hurt me and I said that wouldn't happen and she said, ""you've never experience assault. You don't understand why I'm doing this. I'm protecting you."" I got really angry for a couple reasons. One, this poor guy hadn't done anything wrong so I felt bad that my mom was assuming he was a creep without meeting him, but also I HAD experienced assault. And it was by someone I, and my parents, had trusted. I remember wanting to tell her so bad what had happened, but I was afraid she wouldn't believe me. 

My parents, as much as I love them, were very manipulative &amp; emotionally abusive growing up. They'd find ways to make me feel ashamed, even if I'd done nothing wrong, and so I kept my mouth shut. I physically couldn't bring myself to say anything, and so I went to my room and that was the first time I'd self harmed. I didn't self harm consistently, only when I thought about when I was 4, or when I was frustrated because I couldn't just say it. So, in the past 15 years I've only told a couple of people. A couple of my friends, but usually I'd just brush over it and I wouldn't tell the full story. Mostly I'd just say stuff like, ""yeah, he was a creep."" 

I struggle with intimacy &amp; relationships a lot. I know that my experience &amp; how I've tried dealing with the trauma are part of it, but even though I logically know I need to calm down I still have physical &amp; emotional reactions to things that aren't a big deal. It exhausts me and I just wish I could bring myself to seek help, but something holds me back. I don't trust my family enough and I'm afraid of telling any guy I'm seeing, and I don't want to put that burden on my friends. I know the logical thing would be to seek professional help but every time I try any of the online/free things I panic and just turn it off. I just can't afford to see someone in person &amp; I don't want my family to find out, which they would because of insurance.

 My mom doesn't agree with me going to therapy because despite my doctor suggesting I see a therapist due to depression &amp; anxiety &amp; my chronic pain, my mom still thinks nothing is wrong with me. And the sad thing is part of me agrees with her. I doubt myself a lot, and I tell myself I'm overreacting, and I think about how the experience with my babysitter was SO long ago, and I need to just move on. But I can't. More things are starting to trigger my memory and then I'll just think about him for a hot minute. It's driving me crazy and I feel so alone. I don't talk to anyone about anything. I've dealt with everything by myself. Being molested, having an eating disorder, I even deal with my chronic pain alone 99% of the time. I thought I was able to cope just fine but as time goes on it gets worse and I get into my head and spiral into a deep depression, then I'll get out of it and feel great and like nothing is wrong and I can do anything and I get super motivated, but then I spiral again. It's a cycle and I'm tired of it.

 I've tried googling resources &amp; all, but like I said, something always holds me back. I just wish I had support, and I know I would if I told my sister and my friends, but I'd feel weird. I don't like feeling vulnerable and as the person who always listens, protects, gives advice, I don't want to be one people worry about. I know this is a long read, and I apologize, but I just  needed to talk. Even if no one is listening."

But I’ve been through anorexia twice and have had bulimia and binge eating disorder. I’m finally over all of those and I’ve made a lot of progress since then. I’m not the weight I want to be so I want to just lose a little bit of weight. I’m just afraid that I might relapse again and go through everything again. I don’t know what to do
348,No real answers given to me,"While I understand that it isn’t everything and it isn’t the important part, how many people are being treated with a proper diagnosis? I’ve seen several different psychologists and now a new psychiatrist and I feel like they are treating me but not looking at the big picture and explaining things to me to tell me what’s going on."
349,I feel like a part of me has died. And not in a disassociative way.,"I wont go into full details, but within thhe last month it became evident that I was truly alone.  As in, if I were to try to end my own life, there is nobody in my personal life who would 1) be affected 2) truly care.  I dont want to die, let me be clear.  But nothing has changed, it became real when some stuff happened.  And I am... a very unique person.  Love and understanding. Well, was. Maybe.   I would say my ability to love and understand is in no way compromised, but I am a shell of what I was.  I feel if anyone of my ""friends"" came to me and needed help, despite their never going to return or show it back, I would in no way differ in my response. However, I dont carry happiness or emotion anymore.  I eat less, I talk less, I dont reach out to anyone.  I get asked if Im using meth all the time, if that means anything.  

I feel as though a part of my soul is missing, but memories and beliefs and sanity remain fine.  I dont feel sad, I feel like a chunk of me broke off, but it doesnt come back.  I feel this differs from most dissassociation in that I dont feel ""apart"" from myself more less I recognize there is just no longer a piece of me.  It doesnt scare me.  But I was wondering if I could be pointed the path of what disorder or something I might be on or near.  I dont have the money or time for ""help"". This lockdown isnt changing my life either, its unchanged pretty much.  I am a very introspective person, and I want to learn more about it. I have dealt with anxiety, depression, etc for years but this is new.  In the past, feelings of this were smaller, temporary, and you could feel the temporary.  They made me sad. This does not make me sad, more curious."
350,What should I do if my friend wants my help but I myself am broken??,"I have a question that I'd like someone to help me with.

There is a friend of mine that needs my help because he's in a state of mind that is fragile..and I myself have a lot more mental problems of my own that are in my opinion too much for me to handle that I can't even describe here..So he wants my help but for me to properly advice him I'd have to tell him about myself and I absolutely definitely don't wanna do that..Sometimes I think I don't even wanna help him..Am I being selfish here?

 I don't think I am capable of helping anyone if I can't even help myself.I have nothing else left to give. And even if I could help I am not sure I wanna..and lets say I do help him,I really don't want to tell him anything about my own problems..

I am conflicted..Am I being a bad friend or a bad person??? Is it morally wrong for me to think this way?? what should I do?? maybe try helping him as best as I could without mentioning anything about myself,right??"
351,I don’t how know concerning/common this behaviour of mine is...,"I don’t know what it is or what happened to make me like this (maybe it stems from my dad having an affair on my mom?) .. 

I have somewhat obsessive/stalker behaviour of new guys I date. I made a fake social media account and if I see he befriends or follows another girl, I add that girl to see who she is and if they interact (like if he likes/comments on her posts)... I’ve done this for years, even with my last long term relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. I don’t know why I feel the need to do this!!! Jealousy? Insecurity? I check these accounts multiple times a day and right after doing so get a sense of relief or calm.. until a few hours later I feel the need to do it again. 

I don’t know if it’s severe trust issues that I have, or what it is... I don’t like feeling this way, and maybe I’m not the only one who does it, but I’d like to stop."
352,"People who use social interactions as a distraction from depression, how are you doing while social distancing?","It's been almost 3 weeks now that I've been social distancing and my mental health is sliding downhill very quickly. 

My depression stems mostly from never truly feeling as if the people in my life care/love me and I used social interactions to prove to myself that the people around me care just enough that they remember to invite me.

More than ever, I feel alone and have felt more detached from reality and myself. Work is light since I'm working from home but that just gives me more time to think. I thought about taking an online class just so I could be distracted during the day.

How are you doing with your mental health battles during this time?

Any tips on how to keep working through depression when you're self-isolating/social-distancing?"
353,Feeling so low today,"I don't know if it's the lockdown/self isolation finally getting to me or what. I felt really anxious earlier with no trigger, the covid numbers have been in the back of my head, i just feel so drained today, i keep crying over the littlest of things, my head feels foggy and to top it off i've started my period. Feeling like shit mentally and physically."
354,How do I handle escapism?,"My excessive escapism is killing me. I don’t do anything any more,just sit in front of my pc playing games or scrolling through social media. I can’t even take out 20 minutes for meditation. I don’t even have a normal conversation for days ,recently I have started smoking weed. I think i might also be addicted to porn. I basically reaching out for every bit of gratification I can get.

Fuck fuck fuck. 

I don’t think i can recover from this now. I don’t even have the will to think there is a future where i can be better again. :("
355,I'm (19F) Afraid My Ex (23M) Will Hurt Himself If I Cut Contact With Him. How Can I Convince Him It's Best To Move On And Let It Go?,"I dated my ex for about a year. We broke up about 3 weeks ago, and we haven't been handling it very well (I own up to my mistakes in this situation as well).

He was a really good boyfriend, I was head over heels for him, he treated me really well and is overall a wonderful person. A few months into our relationship, it came to light that he had depression. It wasn't so bad that I was concerned, but bad enough that I told him that he had to see a doctor and get on antidepressants.

When his depression kicked in, he was a completely diffent person. He had horrible mood swings, the smallest things could be the end of the world to him. When he was mad or sad, he said really hurtful things to me. I always respected his moment of being sad, but when he went back to being ""himself"", I made it very clear that I did not tolerate being treated that way, and that if he didn't seek help, I couldn't take that relationship any further.

Seeing the man who treated me like a princess suddenly treat me like a stranger, shutting me out and lashing out at me for things I didn't have anything to do with really got to me, and I couldn't stand that, it hurt me a lot.

But I was stupid, and I put up with that for a good 3-2 months.

About three weeks ago, I finally had enough of it when he snapped at me when I told him I couldn't see him because I had to study for college (I'm in med school, shit is real).

So, I broke up with him. I just couldn't take it anymore.

After that, the threats came. Threats of him hurting himself and doing something stupid.

I got legitimately terrified, I didn't sleep for a week. I was so scared he was going to hurt himself, I'd blame myself for the rest of my life. So, I made it very clear that we are not together anymore, but I still keep in contact with him.

This is hurting me so much. It's stopping me from getting over him and just letting him go. I'm far for being mature enough to handle this properly, can I please get some advice?"
356,My girlfriend is having a lot of trouble coping with quarantine and I need help/advice,"From Western Australia where a regional lockdown has been put in place, effectively quarantining my girlfriend and locking herself from all of her physical social contacts (including myself). Just got off a really late night call with her and she was basically breaking down the entire time and I couldn’t help but feel helpless. (Writing this down already makes me feel better)

She has a history of self-harm and the prolonged isolation exacerbates her loneliness to the point where she’s scared of herself. From what I’ve gathered, her parents aren’t the most supportive when it comes to mental health and help. Her location is very physically isolated (borderline rural), making her fears of isolation all the more realised. This is well out of the scope of me being able to just provide emotional support and I feel helpless. She needs help but I don’t know where to start - I’m hoping this subreddit can point both her and I in the right direction."

360,Eating disorder,"I think I’m close to having an eating disorder/on the edge of an eating disorder. It’s creeping up on me. That’s all I had to say, byyyee"
361,Weird uncontrolable inner monologue.,"It happens most usually when I play video games for too long. I cannot explain it well enough since even I can't really comprehend what's happening and it's been happening for years. 

I know it's me thinking but i have no control over it. It feels like my brain is going on autopilot thinking to itself and explaining what I'm doing in a game. It doesn't feel relaxing it's more anxiety inducing and I can't really explain it beyond that.

I usually turn the game to silent and put on podcast to make it stop but recently it started popping up while I make music and I can't just turn on a podcast while trying to make a song.

I was wondering if anyone experiences the same thing as me or even knows what is going on inside my head. Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated."
362,[19M] Help. Negative emotion drains my energy and motivation,"This is rather a recent phenomenon. I've most of my life been in control emotionally and fairly stoic to an ample extent. Until a few days ago I would be able to effortlessly brush off any heated argument and laugh at any insult. But lately, any interaction or confrontation that gives rise to negative emotions (verbal quarrels, snide comments, being roasted etc) seem to leave me drained. It's strange really, after an argument with someone not only do I get sad but I also feel like there's not one reason in the world I should continue on with my tasks of the day. You may say I lack a ""why"" but I assure that's not it. Even if I see definite reasons to accomplish my tasks I've lost all drive and energy to do so. ** It's like I'm wrapped inside a dense barrier of fatigue and sloth, with sadness and intense anxiety vibrating beneath the surface** . Not even fun things like gaming or sex interests me, all I do is lay on my bed and breathe away the hours (I'd probably even find a way to slack off from that if I could because at times even that feels like a chore).

I don't know what's happening.

I've been mildly depressed and actively suicidal for a year now. But this has only been going on for the last few days."
363,Getting back on my feet seems overwhelming.,"First day here, hope this is the right place. 

So what's happening, my wife had a nervous breakdown in January, her second. She suffered a psychotic break, schizophrenia, horrendous anxiety, the works. We got her the right meds, and the help she needed but we have a long road ahead. The entire process took about 2 months of essentially 24 hour care, every moment keeping an eye on her to help her get back on her feet and then adjusting to giving her more space as she was more and more capable. 
It was the worst month of our lives but in different ways. I will never really know how it felt for her but she also doesn't really know how sick she was. Allot of what happened she doesn't remember. 

In my own life, I have been doing night classes for a diploma in computer science and have pushed myself very hard and got great results. It was a great sign of my own recovery from depression and social anexity after attending therapy for about a year. I will return  to therapy after covid and fully expect that to be what really helps me, but in the meantime I throw myself atthe Oracle of internet wisdom. 


I had to defer 2 of my 3 modules since my wife was so  unwell. But one course was maintained  and I'm finding it very, very hard to get back to work on it. I also lost my job due to covid and am under lockdown, so I have all the time in the world. But all I seem to want to do is vegetate at home, play games, stay up late and close the world off. I've managed to do a few hours here and there but mostly from a sense of guilt when I see my wife sitting down to study something herself. 



So what can I do to get myself back on my feet?"
364,Wondering if I made a mistake and how to get back up,"I've been thinking, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps I should go back there and finish my studies, because right now I have nothing and I'm so ashamed of myself. 

It was barely two semesters, but it was the worst I've ever been. I've had periods where I felt a little sad and out of sorts, but going to uni was a different level. Going to campus, roaming through campus to get to classes, then to sit in those classes were almost always fear inducing experiences. Me, a weird awkward person, was thrown into a world where cool people were hanging around at every corner, so for me it felt like I had target on my back without legitimate reason. If my stress level wasn't turned up to the top it was at least always there under the surface.

I think several factors led me to slowly spiral downward and every day I felt like I wanted to die. But now I'm wondering if I should have just pushed through. I know I wasn't disciplined enough, so was it wrong for me to just give up? Now, I'm not as miserable as I was back then, but I have nothing to show for myself. My peers are all working hard to make something of themselves, while I'm still at the bottom. 

I've fallen and I can't get up."
365,What do I do if I can’t afford a therapist?,"I know I have depression, bpd, and ADD. I don’t take pills and I don’t go to therapy because I know for a fact I can’t afford it! I’m not suicidal like I used to be as a teen. I’m 22 and I just feel numb. I just push myself everyday. I sleep, go to work, eat, sleep, wake up, then go to work again. That’s it. I work at McDonald’s soon to be a manager but I want more. I want to go to college, I want to lose all this weight, I want to run marathons, i just want to become a better version than what I am. I don’t think I could ever be able to change myself if I’m not even receiving therapy or medicine. It sucks living a sad life.,"
366,I just wanna get killed somehow . I hate myself so much.,"Idk man, I have such a nasty inner critic, it tears me apart into pieces..I just cannot stop criticising myself over and over and over again. Absolutely no one in this world empathises with me, not even myself. For every mistake that I make, I’m made to feel so horrible. I cannot shut up this voice inside of me that hurts me all the time and makes me feel soo horrible about myself. I’m just a weakling"
367,What’s wrong with me?,"It feels like I’m switching perspectives all the time. I don’t know how I actually feel about anything. It’s like whatever perspective I have at that moment determines how I react but it could be different at other times. I don’t trust myself anymore and sometimes I replay situations over and over and I start to question if it really happened the way I remember or if it was really said like that or if it even happened at all. I am truly scared of being close to anyone and I question every word I say to people. Sometimes I remember my conversations and as I play them repeatedly in my head the story starts to change and I become unclear of exactly what was said or what the intentions were when it was said. I’m constantly doubting myself and questioning my own judgement. To the point where I am seriously suffering in my work performance and relationships. I have no friendships, and no family... I have been diagnosed with BPD and Anxiety and PTSD. I just have never been able to put into words this feeling of switching “perspectives” all the time.. Can anyone else relate?"
368,How can I help my dad cope with the death of his friend?,"About two years ago my dad and his coworker/friend were road biking. A typical action taken by  cyclists is the head of the group will quickly look back and tell the rest of the group if there is oncoming traffic that they see. My dad was the lead and saw that there was an SUV coming towards them, so he turned and alerted his friend. However, his friend hit the end of my dads bike when he saw the suv around the bend, and fell and hit his head, and was hurt really, really bad. He was in the hospital for a few weeks, and recovered to the point of being able to walk and put together simple sentences. During that time, my dad took it really heavily, and he couldn’t shake the fact that it was an accident. He got back to normal as things went by, but A few days ago, we were told that his friend was put in hospice care. My dad reverted back to the quiet and mourning state that he was in before.Today, he told me his friend had passed away. From the way he described it, he said” it seemed like he had just given up, concerning the current circumstances(implying quarantine and corona). I don’t want to assume that he took his own life, but I think that is what my dad was trying to convey. He told me that if he seems moody that is why. How can I help him cope beyond” it was an accident, it wasn’t your fault”? I am worried about him, and I want to make sure that he recovers from this. He has never had problems with depression or suicidal thoughts, but I feel like the incident may be a trigger for that. What can I do?"
369,My ex-bf (20M) just broke up with me (21F) because he didn’t want to see me break down anymore.,"We had been together just under 7 years. He decided that he wanted to move out and break up with me at the same time. 

When I asked him why, he said he didn’t want to see my break down anymore. He is tired of what I make myself believe (I feel like I’m a bad person, and I’m not good enough). He said he didn’t want to deal with it anymore but that he still loves me. He also said he didn’t see himself with me or even settling down in the future. 

He really hurt me and I’m just so sad and upset. I could use any sort of advice or conversation. I feel so lonely."
370,Urge to hurt a dog - becoming a monster. Why is this?,"I'll begin by saying I resonate strongly with [this guys thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6gqxyo/i_want_to_hurt_my_girlfriends_dog_and_i_dont_know/). And [this guys thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7713d5/extreme_urge_to_hurt_girlfriends_dog/), but to a lesser extent. 

Preface:

I have no mental issues to really speak of. I am a very isolated individual. I have a small circle of friends and have no desire to ever really be social. I spend most of my time on the internet, studying, lifting weights, and working.  I also have a dog of my own who I love and would never, ever harm. I've had several dogs before him all of which I've loved just as much. He's one of my best friends, easily.

The issue:

Throughout my life I have dated several women with small dogs. I won't go into details of them all, only the one I have now. But, know that the situation was similar for them in the past.

My girlfriend has a small raggedy old chihuahua dog. It's an old dog and has back issues, but its still fairly healthy. It acts very pompous and spoiled. It will snap at you if you don't give it food. It will snap at you if you pet it the wrong way. Well, at first the dog didn't mind me too much. But now I am filled with rage when I am around the thing. The fact it's so fucking ugly and acts like a spoiled brat... I started doing things to it, slowly. I'd pull the carpet out from under it so it'd hit the floor. I'd smack its head. Well, it started to yelp when it did that and I didn't want them hearing so I've started to ram my hand down its throat while I continued to fuck with it.

I'll spare you the details. But I fucking love every second of it. I don't know why. I feel like a freakin schizo writing this. But I have an image gallery of it on my phone that I stare at sometimes for an hour straight, just seething with rage and imagining all the torturous things I can do to it. It feels really really good. I've thought about pulling out its teeth and other things. 

I don't get intrusive thoughts or thoughts of violence aside from this one thing: the girlfriend's shitty small dog. 

**Do not comment ""you need to get help""** because I probably won't. Obviously I'm not alone, I found two threads exactly like my situation. The only thing that can prevent this is if somehow a connection can be made from my own insecurities to the thoughts of abuse I get. But I've tried. The whole ""do you see yourself as the dog"" thing. Nah. I don't know what it is at all. But that's why I'm making this thread. 

Please don't get mad at me. I don't want to stop, but I also *want to want to* stop."
371,How to stop crying when I get shouted at,"Hi there, hope quarantine is going alright for you &lt;3

Recently I've been doing a lot of things wrong- I keep burning food, can't cook, wake up too late etc. Because of this, I send my family up the wall (especially my dad) and so they shout at me. Without fail when I get shouted at I end up crying, either in front of them (horrible) or when I go back to my bedroom. I just wanted to know if there was any tricks or things I can do to stop myself from crying? Thanks for reading."
372,[19F] My self esteem and mental health are getting worse since the quarantine,"I guess this isn't really all that terrible, but it has been leaving me feeling really bad about myself in every single way these past few days.  
I was always struggling with self esteem, though I kept it under control for the past few months. I guess using social networks, waking up at 1 pm and not going anywhere (well obviously) for these past few weeks gradually deteriorated my overall mental health.  
It seems to me that everyone is way more connected to each other, while I'm still alone. I feel really unimportant and I dismiss every accomplishment I've made in the past. Whatever I do, it's never enough for me. I feel like I could always do better, but I never actually do. I can't see my improvement in whatever I do, it's really demotivating and depressing. Besides feeling like a failure, I started developing issues with my looks, weight, and especially height. I'm just hoping I can feel better about myself. I feel like a stranger in my own skin.   
Also apologies for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language"
373,Of you need anyone to talk to with your problems!!! ⭐,"If you need anyone to talk to my insta is @ flaming.gnome I'll try to be as much active as possible. I'll try to be your therapist and I'm a good listner. I'll be able to write, not videochat. I hope I'll be to help (:
And don't be afraid to say anything wrong cuz nothing is wrong for me, trust me I'm the weirdest person ever everything can come out of me haha. and don't be afraid to open up, I won't share your problems with anyone, it Will be between you and me only."
374,I am Contemplating Suicide,"It's around that time of the year again, when I am reminded by friends and family that I am the monster that ripped two individuals from their plans and dreams simply by being alive.

I have tried killing myself through various methods, but I either lacked the courage or skill necessary to successfully pull off the attempt, or the method used simply wasn't that effective at causing my demise.

This year is a bit special, though. I wasn't able to plan ahead and buy a bit of rope, I don't have the prescription to purchase the necessary bottle of pills, and I simply have no way to get my hands on a gun—by far the best of the three.

I am left with simply a razor—not the most effective, and certainly one of the most painful ways to go. But I have no alternative.

It won't be the cleanest way to go, maybe. And I'll have time to regret the stupidity of trying to off myself once again. But, what choice do I have?

I probably won't do it, *again* (a few shallow cuts wouldn't hurt, though) but it's been a tradition for over a decade now, and I'm loath to not partake of it this year.

But, whew! That took a load off my chest. I guess I'll see everyone when I'll see everyone."
375,I (M26) need to break up with my boyfriend (M24) but he says he will kill himself or turn into a ho* if I ever break up with him.,"We've been together for 10 months, and about three months ago, circumstances put us in a temporary long distance relationship in super stressful environments. He suffers from depression, self confidence issues and severe anxiety. Since we started the long distance portion, I've started to feel that we are not meant for each other, and it has gotten to the point where when we talk each day it is all just super negative stuff from him about how he hates where he's at, he hates everyone around him and how nothing about his life is good right now.

I have had my own issues with mental health in the past and one of the ways I coped with it was by forcing myself to be positive and optimistic about as much as I can, and hearing such negative things every day from him kind of takes me back to that depressive state I used to be in. I love him very much, but I am convinced that we are not meant to be together as a couple and feel like we need to step away from being together romantically. But he has told me many times as side comments when we've talked, things like there's no point in going on if we aren't together, if you ever broke up with me I'd probably kill myself, I wouldn't want to live anymore if we weren't together, or that if I ever broke up with him that he'd never date or love again and would just be a ho* instead.

I feel like it's super manipulative of him to say that and I don't know how serious he is, but I'm also very worried if he is at all serious about it. He's in a super stressful work environment right now (military) and that adds to his mental health issues and I don't want to be the cause of him having a breakdown or worse, breaking up with him during a time where he's going through a stressful time.

I guess I'm hoping some of you might have some advice or recommendations on what I should do? Am I being selfish in wanting to put my happiness and mental health ahead of his? Should I wait to break up with him until he's out of the stressful work environment, or would that just be leading him on? I'm stuck right now you all, I care so much for him as a person and don't want to hurt him, and I most importantly don't want to be the cause of him doing anything to harm himself.

Any help here, I would be so so so grateful for."

He's in a super stressful work environment right now (military) and that adds to his mental health issues and I don't want to be the cause of him having a breakdown or worse, breaking up with him during a time where he's going through a stressful time.

I guess I'm hoping some of you might have some advice or recommendations on what I should do? Am I being selfish in wanting to put my happiness and mental health ahead of his? Should I wait to break up with him until he's out of the stressful work environment, or would that just be leading himon? I'm stuck right now you all, I care so much for him as a person and don't want to hurt him, and I most importantly don't want to be the cause of him doing anything to harm himself.

Any help here, I would be so so so grateful for."

379,I don't know how to live normally anymore.,"Hello all who read this, I just want advice to get rid of this. For the past 5 weeks I have been over thinking things nonstop. I feel like nothing is real anymore like it's an allusion, but I know that everything is real. I keep questioning everything in life and I can't live properly any more it feels like non of action lns are controlled by me and that my body is on autopilot and I'm just stuck here with these thoughts. I would really appreciate for any help please."
380,My main objective for going to college is committing suicide,"For me, getting a degree is on the side. My main reason as to why I want to go to college is to move out and eventually end my life. I managed to acquire extremely bad grades so far in high school. If I actually cared about my future, I'd be going to a community college to better my chances of transferring to a good college. However, I couldn't care less about earning a degree or getting a job. I just want to move out because I hate being at home. My main focus is to end my life. 

Suicide at home is embarrassing. Suicide far away is less embarrassing, and I know everyone is gonna find out either way but it's more embarrassing at home. Also fuck everyone in my hometown."
381,Today I joined the Bipolar Team!,"So I finally have a diagnosis!  Yippee!! But the diagnosis is also a bit of a turd burger.  I have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist today with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and rapid cycling Bipolar 2.  The bipolar has been causing psychotic episodes recently too.  For a support system I have an amazing husband and lots of friends.  I meet with my doctor to get my meds and such next week.  Anyone have any advice? Tips &amp; tricks to manage this beast? Anything I should ask my doctor or watch for?  I am both terrified and excited!"
382,I [25F] haven't had an interest or pleasure in an activities feeling very lost,"Hi, Im F25. I realise that I have no interest/motivation/pleasure in doing/ to do things. For example, I cannot physically bring myself to put on a tv show that I used to watch or a new movie or something despite the fact that this was one of my favourite things to do and discuss and I have felt this way for years. I was depressed at uni for 2 years but I'm still here. any advice how to get out of it?"
383,I want the privacy to cry,"I have multiple counts of sexual assault in past relationships and generally more emotional abuse (romantically and from my mothers former toxic-behaviour), and the PTSD it’s caused still affects me everyday. I’m going from 2 nightmares a week, to nightmares everyday of being stuck in those relationships like I’m there all over again. My fiancé understands but it’s hard for him to hear things about ex’s and that’s valid and I don’t want to put that cloud over his head. The house is full due to quarantine, there are no rooms free and I just need to cry. I need to stick on the saddest film I know and just cry. On my own. I don’t need any support per se, I just need a meltdown in my soft bed. In the dark, with a pizza. I just want to live, and I just want to cry in peace and have my time alone. I’ve worked so hard to survive, and I just want this please."
384,What is happening?,"I [17F] have really bad anxiety. College usually helped as I was always distracted by friends or by classes. But now that the coronavirus lockdown is happening I can't stop thinking about my future. Like my first year of college is effectively over and I only have a year left until I go university. And a majority of my thoughts surround the topic of friends, I'm scared I won't have friends in university because I have such bad social anxiety. But that's not my issue, my issue is that after crying over this topic and having a panic attack I was happy. Like I saw something that wasn't even funny but I was laughing because I felt like laughing but why am I so happy after I've been thinking about something that can cause a panic attack. 

Tldr: why am I so happy after having a panic attack"
385,How to deal with feelings of inferiority and questioning of one's identity as a male individual?,"So there is this acquaintance, calling him John, whom I've recently met and we been speaking now and then and just getting to know each other.

I will endeavour to keep this back story as brief as possible. John is very much into cycling and mountain biking as a professional, almost to an obsessive degree in my opinion. Please note that this is merely my perception of him. He comes off as rather arrogant, but not to the point of being an a**hole. He also tends to project an insane amount of confidence in himself.  Unfortunately though he has become toxic and I don't know how to process the situation. 

Here are some examples of things he's said: He was saying at one point how he is so straight that he makes pole dancing poles look bent. Another one where I asked him what are his plans during our lockdown, he replied saying how he is going to work out doing all manner of push ups and work on his abs that by the time the lockdown is over, he is going to have abs strong enough to grate cheese. He made other comparisons but I can't quite remember what else he said. Also, I inadvertently came across a post he made on Instagram where he is doing the typical Superman pose next to his fancy bicycle dressed in his cycle gear.

This next part might seem very awkward but I feel it's necessary to mention. Another aspect of this whole situation is how can someone who claims to be so straight, he makes poles look bent, be so comfortable and willing to squeeze himself into skin tight outfits and even pose for such a photo which is potentially so revealing.  I just can't seem to understand that, perhaps there is something I'm missing? 

Apologies in advance if I offend anyone, it is not my intention to.

So I hope that this whole thing makes sense but I will happily elaborate further if necessary.  


Any advice is greatly appreciated."
386,Every emotion is exaggerated,"Every emotion I experience is exaggerated. When I'm happy, I'm very happy. When I'm sad, I'm distraught. When I'm angry, I'm furious. I also think extreme thoughts easily, if I have a bad day, my brain goes into sad mode and makes me want to die. If I'm angry, I get vivid thoughts of whatever making me angry getting destroyed. I also cry for no reason and have issues controlling my anger. Any possible illness I might have? I will not take any suggestions as absolute, but I will take them as a possibility."
387,New concern (not what you're thinking lol),"I guess this does impact me and my husband indirectly, but it has nothing to do with my mental health for once. I am concerned that I am hearing rumors (from reliable sources yet) that school is probably not going to continue for the rest of the year. Now for our 10th Grader, our 7th Grader, and our 4th Grader, this is mostly just an inconvenience. Now, we have a HS Senior...who is supposed to graduate in June. I am worrying about how this is going to affect that, not only for our son (who is marginally affected either way because he isn't planning on going to college so it really isn't an issue when he graduates) but for the other students who are Seniors this year too. I mean, I want our son to graduate so he can start his life (he does have some goals) and I feel bad for the Seniors that have college applications in and are supposed to start this fall. I dunno, I guess in a way, it does impact me, but in a very small way. I am just worried and upset about this. 

Hmm...otherwise, I am struggling with my urges (I actually burned some paper last night or I would have done something really worse) but that is nothing new. It isn't too bad right now anyhow. I will survive today, anyway. :)

Thanks for reading. I guess this is just a vent."

389,Worried about mental heath,"I (16f) am worried about my mental state- I don’t think it’s just hormones. I’m not constantly sad or anything, I can be happy often. It’s just awful mood swings- one week you may be the best person in the world, I’d do anything you ask, I feel like I’d die for you. The next I hate you, I never want to talk to you again.

I know I’m unreasonable, but I want to have friends, I don’t want to be lonely- no one does. Yet everything I do pushes people away. Am I just a normal teenager with mood swings or do I need help?"
390,I’m concerned about my mental health,"So I’ve been writing every week just rambling about what I’ve been feeling and it doesn’t make much sense and it’s really just bits and pieces but I need some advice so I’m gonna post my most recent one 



It’s almost like an addiction. Almost every thought I have is about food or the calories in it or binging and then making myself vomit till veins pop in my face. When it happens it’s an endless cycle. Eating,purging, eating then purging. And it doesn’t stop for at least an hour. I can’t help myself from doing it. And I feel so horrible about eating that the anxiety of not throwing up is way worse than actually vomiting. Seeing numbers drop on the scale makes me so happy that I don’t even want to stop. I’m so embarrassed. I just wish I had a normal relationship with food. I can’t eat without overthinking it anymore and it consumes my thoughts. I have little to no motivation for anything. All I want to do is sleep or just stay in bed. I cry a lot. Too much. My boyfriend is worried. I made him cry for the first time in years bc I was seriously thinking about ending my life. Seeing the way it affected him made me realize that I need to get better and live a better life not only for me but for him. He’s my everything nowadays. I can’t see a future without him and it’s so scary. My ex boyfriend was also my life. And I also couldn’t see a future without him. It feels like it’s almost a matter of time till we break up or something and I’m terrified that is the case. Because I have no purpose without him. I don’t see any reason to live without him bc all of my goals and future is with him. I want to get married and have a family. I realize that I’m a very family oriented person. Maybe that stems from me having a really rough family situation my whole life but it seems like the things that make me happy is my relationship and the future of things. I want to love myself and feel comfortable and confident for once in my life. I cry about taking a picture. I can’t even look at myself most of the time without breaking down. 


I know it’s a little rough to read but I’ve been struggling really hard lately and I’m looking for something to help. Thank you!"
391,Quarantine Couple's Tension - A technique to help.,"Some couples and loved ones are experiencing a bit of added stress, anxiety, and heightened tension living in such close proximity through this quarantine. It's difficult to manage but here's a little technique which is sure to help put things in perspective for those of us struggling, I call it the Cinderella Effect. Good luck and be well.

.

\-The Cinderella Effect-

Pick a day, one whole day that you will give this scenario a try. The evening before I want you both to pretend that you are going to live your last day on earth, together. You’ll die at midnight the next day... like Cinderella having to leave the ball. I know... I know, it's morbid right? Just hear me out. For the entire day I'd like you to treat yourself, your partner, and your children or other loved ones as if it was your last day on earth.

.

Throughout the day, ask yourself if it's worth being angry over a disagreement? Is it worth being upset? Is it worth being impatient, frustrated, stressed, anxious, resentful, guilty, regretful or annoyed? Is this how you want to spend your last day?

.

Every moment you experience a negative emotion is one last moment and opportunity for you both to experience beautiful ones such as gratitude, compassion, patience, humility, joy, appreciation, empathy, sympathy, grace and love.

.

So each time you feel that negative emotion bubble up… remind yourself, “This is the last day I have left to live… I am not going to allow this negative emotion to steal away any moments from this final and important day,” take a deep breath and flush out the negative emotion, “I am going to reside in patience... I am going to anchor myself into gratitude and be extremely present for all the gifts and all the beauty that I have in my life... and I am going to celebrate each moment of each day with every breath I take... and I am going to focus my senses; my  sight, hearing, taste, touch, and feeling on experiencing all of the blessings and all of the beauty which surround me in every moment of every day. I am going to clear my mind and remain mindful of presence, of awareness, of my true reality. I am grateful. I am humbled. I am loved. I am love.”

.

Make an agreement to try this out for one day and observe how much it changes how you treat one another throughout that entire day. Then after I want you to ask yourself something… “Have I been promised more than one day of life on this earth? Am I wasting what could be my very last day on earth being upset? What’s to prevent me from dying at midnight? Am I wasting time on unimportant bullshit? Could this be the very last day of life I have to live? Could this be the last opportunity I have to live… to breathe… to celebrate my gratitude for all of the blessings which have been granted to me and my loved ones? Can I make a permanent change… can I begin living each day as if it were my last? Can I live one final day filled with love and not fear? Do I have time to make this change? Can I start now?”"
392,My fiancé is the only thing stopping me from suicide,"This might be a bit long and convoluted so feel free to ignore it, and I'm also on mobile, so formatting. 

I (30F) have a history of self harming and suicide attempts. My fiancé (30M) and I live together in the flat he owns with our 2 cats and 1 dog. He's still allowed to work at the moment, he's a student but classes are cancelled so he's working with his dad who is a landscape gardener, I got laid off a couple of weeks ago. I'm also supposed to be on holiday with my BFF at the moment, and we were just starting our wedding plans. Because of the coronavirus, everything got cancelled, and my mental health has never been worse.

My fiancé and I have been together for nearly 2.5 years, engaged since October 2019 and living together since April 2018. In the last few months, I've been getting more and more resentful toward him for little things and for consistently doing things he said he would stop/work on not doing. At the moment, I feel like he's expecting me to do all the cooking and cleaning because I'm not working, even though I never really expected the same of him on days when he was off from college. 

I have a rocky relationship with my dad and step-mum, although it has massively improved in the last 18 months, a very strained relationship with my mother, and no relationship with my sister (she is the main reason the relationship with my mother is so bad). I moved to live with my fiancé, his family are the only people I know round here, but because everything is on lockdown, the only time I can go out at the moment is if I'm taking the dog out.

I have a small group of friends but everyone has their own mental health issues and stuff going on, so I've not reached out to any of them about how I've been feeling.

My fiancé has been off with a stomach bug the last few days and I'm pretty sure if he hadn't been, I would have overdosed by now. I'm on a host of different medicines, for depression, anxiety, and a long term medical condition, plus I get prescription strength painkillers for back issues. I recently got all of my prescriptions refilled and it's very tempting to take everything at once.

I feel more lost than I think I ever have done, everything was falling into place a couple of months ago and now it has collapsed spectacularly, and I just don't want to do it anymore. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I'd even settle for catching the virus and not getting medical treatment for it at this point, but that would never happen, because let's face it, this is me we're talking about."
393,Steadily declining mental health,"Ever since COVID-19 has started to change our daily lives, it’s drastically affected my mental health. I found a way to cope with my depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. through my hobbies, daily rituals and a structured schedule. My world’s been shaken upside down and I know a lot of other people are struggling, and have it worse. I’m thankful I still have a job, thankful I’m still physically healthy, but every waking day feels like I’m dying without the sweet release of death. And I dread waking up having to go through it over and over again. I’m having a difficult time finding meaning, a purpose, something to keep me going. I normally reach out to the suicide hotline once every few months when things get incredibly difficult to handle. Just this past week, I’ve reached out 4 times. I’m struggling and I honestly don’t know what to do..."
394,I can't record myself for my band,"Now that we are in quarantine, a member of my band suggested to make a video showing all of us playing a piece from home.  
I agreed, because I am an idiot who can't say no to anything. The worst part is they picked the song that's hardest for me and I agreed to do it anyway because I thought I could make it.

It's not technically hard. I'm a keyboard player and this song consists in a lot of sections overlapped.
So I'd first have to figure out what kind of sounds they are, then figure out how to split them in the keyboard.

But it's too complicated and it makes me not want to do it. Hell, it makes me not want to be in a band. I am classicaly trained and play in a band mainly for the people, gigs, a little money and fun.

I have stressed myself a lot this last week for this stupid crappy video that won't even make us money. I have anger management issues. Sometimes I'll hit my wardrobe and myself.

One band member told me that I don't necessarily have to do it, but I don't know if he was just being nice. Plus, everyone already sent their part. They probably got the hint that I am not going to do it but I'm not sure. I just told them I'm busy.
I don't know what to do. I am more inclined not to do it because it's causing me so much mental damage, at the same time I might feel like a loser because everyone already sent their part. But as I said, I am more inclined to not do it, and if they complain I might instantly leave the band, that's the type of guy I am.

This thing has made me suffer more than it should have. In fact, at times it made me consider leaving the band for allowing myself to allow them to let myself make me feel this way. Makes sense? No? 

I'd just like to tell them ""hey listen, I know I told you I'd do this thing, but as things are right now, I'd rather eat shit than do it. Also, because I'm feeling like a loser, I'm considering leaving the band too, that way you don't have to deal with a loser."""
395,I'm very lost (help me),"Hi, I won't say my name cause I value my privacy.

I'm 17 years old right now and I have been diagnosed with ADHD and ADD at a very young age. I always had problems concentrating, I never had amazinh grades but I wasn't dumb. I loved computers and everything around it and I was very sporty aswell, I would hang out with my friends playing soccer and stuff all day.

Growing up I always had problems with my concentration, I couldn't keep my eyes or ears focused for even a minute, even if I really wanted to. Because I had so much trouble concentrating, my grades were awful. I thought I looked stupid, so I became the cool kid. Make alot friends, never pay attention and only come to school to make some fun. Not to learn.

Of course, this didn't work very well... Long story short, I got kicked out of multiple high schools and to this day, I haven't started at a new one.

Because I was ""the cool kid"" I hung out with the other ""cool kids"", tho these kids came from very different backgrounds. They already had older brothers who were criminals or had grown up in thougher neighborhoods. I didn't. Even tho I'm pretty tall and can come up for myself. I was some times a little scared. So what did I do? I became one of them.

I would start f*cking around on the streets, just messing with people, throwing stuff, yelling, screaming, intimidating ect. Gradually I became older and started seeing the need of money in my life. I started planning with my friends to rob people and I became more interested in guns and violence. 

One day I broke into someone's house with 2 friends and I got caught. This changed my life forever. I never had any problems with the police before and I got restricted from being and talking with those friends.

Because I couldn't be with my ""bad"" friends anymore, I would go back to my old friends. Tho I soon realised, I had become very different than them and we just didn't match up anymore. 

I was feeling quite depressed sometimes but I was making new friends... They were totally different, they all had fun in a nice way, just messing around but without being violent or bad behaving in any kind of way. That did do somethings that you'd probaly considering very bad tho. Drugs. Many, many drugs.

To keep this as short as possible (just realised how long I've been typing -_-), I started smoking weed. Gradually starting using XTC. Then 2CB, Ketamine, LSD. You know the drill...

I was only focused on doing drugs, every single day. I woke up, I'd think ""what am I going to do today?"". Drugs, I'm not addicted to a specific drug I can assure you. But I'm definitely addicted to escaping reality with the use of drugs.

Even tho I was always looking for a way to escape reality, it recently became inevitable. I was feeling like I was on LSD while I hadn't used it for months. I felt extreme anxiety on random occations, hard time thinking and stuff. I noticed it, sure. But I didn't know what to think of it. I had always have mental issues (not like this tho) so I thought it was kinda normal or something.

But I now realise it is not, I came across a YouTube video about the early signs of schizophrenia, and I was to my surprise shocked that I could relate to every single topic...

Lets evaluate what I experience:
Room turning (like I'm upside down)
Increases or decreases of light indoors
Color shifting (mostly like a yellow tint snapchat filter)
Weird thoughts (can't explain :( )
Depression
I don't want to go outside
Scared of shadows
Random movements in normal objects like doors and chairs.
Constant anxiousness.
Weird voice like sounds (unlocatable)

I experience more than I just listed I just can't seem to get my mind clear enough to write them down.

I'm really lost right now, like actually right now while I write this. I've forgotten my subject about 4 times now while I'm writing this. So I'll stop before I make myself crazy.

I've never posted before, so I'm no expert or anything on reddit.

But please give me some advice or help me. Any kind of help is appreciated.

Regards N."
396,"Sleep Inversion Help (Autism, sleep disorder)","*I am sorry in advance for the long text. The main subject is in the 3rd paragraph.*

Hello. I just made this account because I am honestly desperate to find some help to a problem that has persisted for half of my life.

I am a 22 years old guy. I live in Brazil and my life was pretty turbulent since I was very young. Only when I was 12 we finally discovered I had Asperger Syndrome which was the core cause of most issues such as anxiety, internal overwhelming by outside pressure and turbulent social relations with others, as well as a terrible educational development and complete absence of discipline and schedule. Since then I managed through a lot of hard work and help of 2 professionals to relearn much of what I didn’t as well as become very self aware both in how everything works around me and myself in order to seek methods to improve the shortcomings of some limitations I have. Such as executive disfunction and extreme anxiety as said previously.


Despite all this a problem that was starting to lurk since I was younger and solidified when I was 12 and onwards was the inconsistent sleep schedule and eventually complete absence of it reaching now an extreme state in which it is completely inverted. Me and my mom are not in a good financial situation for the past few years and I’m trying to earn money through my craft as well as keep with my studies at college but this sleep disorder is ruining everything for me (being that there are already enough problems I have to deal with). I got to the point that I sleep around 6~7am when the sun has already rose here and wake up around 5~6pm when the sun has already set.


I would like to know anything I can about this disorder and what I can do about it. I am honestly desperate and although it goes against it, I am willingly to try to fight it heads on."
397,If one more person tells me...,"If one more person tells me that all I need to do to cure my mental illness is:

-Exercise

- eat healthy

-do yoga

-go on a walk

-go in a forest

-pray

-accept whatever god(s) into my heart and soul

-do some weird alternative medicine practices 

-stop  taking my perscribed meds 
Etc...

I'm going to lose my shit. If any one of these helps you that's amazing and good for you. Yes, some of these things are better than others and are quite healthy. I also know that taking care of your body is important for your physical and mental health. However,people treat some of these like a miracle cure. I'm already trying to do some of these things, but my depression makes it incredibly difficult to even get out of bed. I try to exercise and eat healthy, but most if the time I just feel even more worn out. Most of the time, when I hear people saying this, it ends up sounding quite dismissive towards those suffering from mental illness. As if just doing 'x thing' will cure you."
398,"My girlfriend needs help, and Im not sure how to convince her.","My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now and I couldnt be happier with her. In fact Im planning on popping the question in a few month's time. But she suffers from bouts of severe depression, anxiety, and more recently she's mentioned hearing voices in her head. Im terrified she might be suffering from schizophrenia, but more so that she might follow through on the suicidal thoughts that have plagued her since she was 14 or so. I know there is help she can get, even now with COVID raging through the world. How can I try to convince her that she should seek professional help? She has a will to live, I know that much from how long she's coped with her own mind and the way she talks and acts in her low moments. But how can I phrase my words to try and convince her to seek the help she needs?"
399,I (18F) need advice on how to help my boyfriend (18M) get through his depression.,"I myself am a sufferer of mental health issues, though I feel as though I cope as best I can. I remind myself of how lucky I am, whilst also not dismissing how I feel. I take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health. I have routines and resources to look forward to , I also have outlets to vent to in times of despair. I’ve dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering . My brother attempted suicide when I was 12, and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues. Though going through that, I know suicide is an option I will never consider, whilst even feeling suicidal. The lasting damage is too painful on those you love and I’ve learned how precious life is through this. In conclusion, I’ve come to terms with my depression being apart of me, and I’ve tried my best to adapt.
I’m glad I’m growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised, if not I don’t think I would cope as-well as I do. Though my boyfriend on the other hand, struggles to see the light, and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts. These depressive thoughts have become darker. He doesn’t put the pressure of suicide on our relationship, though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts, and finds it hard to see past these thoughts. With everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day, he is getting worse. Also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot. I feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but I’m still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay. If I didn’t think this way I also would be cracking up alike him. But he can’t seem to take on this ‘it will be okay’ mindset, which is important right now. But it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesn’t think this way, because that’s an element of depression which he has, negative thoughts and feelings of despair.
I have voiced that I think he needs professional help, as have his friends( he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends, and have they also in return). He’s aware it isn’t fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels(regarding his suicidal thoughts), though he can’t come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents. That would be the first step in getting towards professional help.
I can’t help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up. I don’t know how to react. I’m not a professional. My advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary, and that I myself go through bouts of depression. I get out of them. I’m okay for a while. I fall back. He has never experienced depression up until 2 years ago. I have experienced depression for the past 6 years. Hence, my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms. He can’t come to terms with why he isn’t like his old self, why he isn’t happy all the time. We all have our breaking point I believe, when childhood happiness just fades. Though he often thinks back to when he didn’t feel this way. But I don’t know how to help that. 
With my experiences , and relatability to how he feels in ways, still doesn’t help. I never turn things on myself ,I simply resonate. I’m aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them. I give advice as to how I deal . How I think he should approach things that will help him. But I can’t help him. I don’t know how to help him. But all I want to do, is to help and be there. I believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on, and I don’t know where else to go for advice. I myself will probably only worsen to, I feel we all will. But how do we keep sane in the midst of a pandemic? How can I help him keep sane and halt his worsening thoughts? I’m trying my best and advice is really what I need right now."
400,I want to be happy again,"I already have a lot of home issues, so adding the whole no school thing has been hard. I am a senior in high school and have busted my ass to get to senior year. senior year was supposed to be fun, not taking care of your mom the summer of senior year as she was laying in a hospital bed thinking you weren't going to have a mom anymore, and when she finally came home you were the only one who would take care of her, or when you finally thought that this was over you find out she has cancer after you get back from a vacation, knowing you would be the only one who would take care of her then too. January your birthday is finally coming up, its your 18th birthday, it was supposed to be so special, and your mom is in the hospital because your family went to a family party, and someone got her sick so you have to spend your birthday in the hospital thinking you were going to lose your mom yet again. everything turns out okay. you constantly get belittled by family members for things you didn't even do wrong and have been dealing with for 12 years now, and therapy doesnt quite seem to be helping at the moment because you can't figure out how to help yourself. I felt like I was going in a downhill spiral, until march 13th. march 13th, the last day of my high school til god knows when. I was supposed to have a good senior year. my whole life I have been fighting everything life has thrown at me and almost giiving up my life two different times. my senior year has been stripped away not even just because of cover-19, but now that its here I won't have prom, I won't have graduation, I won't have my senior wall that I have planned since my freshmen. that senior wall was the only thing I cared about, and it was taken from me. no senior week, nothing. I have nothing right now, or at least that what it feels like, and I have no-one to talk to that will actually listen to how I feel about it. I try to tell my mom how I feel and she doesnt really listen to how I feel, instead her and I get into arguments, I don't get along with my moms boyfriend either, he and I haven't gotten along for a while now, my dad is not in my life. I haven't seen my boyfriend in almost a month and he's the only person in my life who I can really depend on to comfort me when I go through my bad days and I can't even really talk to him. right now I just feel like I'm burdening him, and the worst part about it is, I apparently have accumulated jealousy issues. we have been dating for 3.5 years and now im magically jealous when he talks to his friends and not me and I hate myself for it. I can't explain why this is happening, but its been happening for two or three months and I hate it. I just want to see him happy. I want to finally be happy. I really really really want to be happy, because to be honest, I haven't genuinely been happy in a long time."
401,"I am 24(M), And I feel like a complete failure","It's been a while since I feel as if my life is a complete failure, that I have gotten too old to do anything worthwhile with my life. It demotivates and discourages me on a daily basis as a thought and feeling. 

After I got my master's in about one year and a half ago, I have been living kind off-grid for ever since. Raving and backpacking across my country, I took a lot of drugs, lived different lifestyles,  took up roles I never thought I would like selling drugs,  selling banana bread for a living for a while, farming, I went through being a beggar and a homeless for a while.  I went through a lot, however I decided to turn things around after I had a wake-up call in a rave during the last new year's eve, I packed up my stuff and returned home to my parent's house. 

However, the thought of returning home gave me a lot of motivation and came with lots of expectations. Now after three months almost, I feel like a complete failure, and I have a lot of self-loathing and remorse. It gets to the verge of suicidal ideas at times. I managed to quit weed, alcohol, hard drugs and a lot of destructive habits I have had over the years. I keep looking for jobs and opportunities, but I keep comparing myself to others the whole time, and I feel really bad and insecure about myself, sometimes I don't apply to stuff just because I think  I would never get accepted or if I got accepted I would utterly fail at it, I feel like an imposter. 

I am trying the best I can not to slip into the old lifestyle and in the numb comfort zone of temporary pleasures. I am also in a very nice loving relationship and all these emotions of being a failure sometimes make me feel like I am not really worthy of love."
402,I hate that I'm loving this quarantine,"It's been two weeks since I started working from home. I live alone in a small apartment, and in my country we're only allowed to go out for essential stuff (groceries, doctor etc) so I go out maybe once a week for less than an hour.

I'm anticipating the anxiety of having to go out again.

I'm an introvert and don't have any outdoors hobbies, I don't have any friends left aside from my coworkers,  and I'm kind of wishing I could stay home forever..

 Obviously I want the situation to get better, I'm just discovering it's so much easier for me to live this way. No anxiety, no social gatherings to make excuses for, nobody asks about your weekend and so on.. 

I just wanted to get it out of my chest because I feel so alienated and guilty, everyone I know is having a really hard time."
403,Remember,"You didn't come this far, to only come this far.

Be proud of the pain and suffering you were able to endure, that's what makes you tough. Keep pushing"
404,"I (20f) just realized i might be the manipulative, emotionally abusive one and i don’t know how to handle it.","I’ve had severe depression anxiety and adhd my whole life. my parents were extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive to me. i haven’t spoken to them in 2 years but that really fucked me up mentally. about a month ago something happened that really opened my eyes and made me realize i need to change some things in my life. i spent a lot of time working on my self and about a week ago something just clicked and i’ve been feeling so much better. i truly believe this is the first time in my life i haven’t been depressed. 

with my new found mental health i’ve been more receptive to the things people say to me and last night my boyfriend told me he doesn’t love me the way he used to because i treated him so badly for so long and he was scared to tell me because of how i would react. i took a step back and realized he’s right. all i can think about now is that sometimes i’ll do something to make him feel sorry for me so he stops being mad. i would tell him my actions are a response the way he treats me and would refuse to believe his actions were in response to mine. 

i’m so ashamed in myself because i know first hand how hard it is to deal with manipulative, emotionally abusive people, and how detrimental it can be to your mental health, and now i’m that person?? the person making others feel how horribly i felt for years??? 

and the worst part is, it took me a very long time to even realize i’m doing it, what if i keep doing it without realizing? how do i know i’ve stopped being that person? how can i know in the moment i’m in the right to feel this way and am not subconsciously manipulating the other person? 

any advice would be appreciated but really i’m just so ashamed in myself it’s all i’ve been able to think about and i need to get it off my chest."
405,"I'm 32, live at home w/ parents and haven't had a job/gf/sex in about 10 years, don't AMA, or do, IDK","My situation could be worse.  I could be in a hospital on a ventilator, but I'm here at home with all of my basic needs met and I'm not sick, at least not with any kind of coronavirus.  This life isn't what I expected it to be.  I've made many mistakes in my life.  I hope that this post helps some of you, especially the younger folks on here who may be dealing with this current world crisis on top of internal issues.

Some important background information:

\- I do my own chores, I cook, clean, take care of the house, etc.  I do have some disabilities which have hindered me from getting where I want to be, but they're no excuse.

Again, my life could be worse, but it's far from ideal.

My message to Reddit and the rest of the internet is this basically:

I love my parents, but the current situation has made me realize that if this world gets bad enough to see a societal breakdown/world war, these may be the people I spend my last moments on Earth with.

Live your life knowing that this is a possibility.  Don't let fear, embarrassment, low self esteem, or pressure from others keep you from living the life you want to live.  I know this sounds like b/s self-help crap, but it's not.  It's real, hard, brutal life and I'm living it.  If nuclear war breaks out and you have minutes to live (doesn't seem like too far-fetched of a scenario in the times we live in), will you be happy with the people you are with?  I'd like nothing more than to be with a wife/gf/possibly kids in that moment, but I'm here with my parents.  There were times in my life when I had the opportunity to change that.  I still can, but it would have been much easier at 22, than 32.

That is all."
406,Anger issues.,"I don't understand why I get angry. I get frustrated, then I get frustrated for being frustrated, then I get angry about that, then even angrier. I don't know why, and I don't know how to be better about it."
407,Looking for good online counseling services that aren't incredibly expensive,"  I've always struggled with my mental health, but have been able to manage. However, I've been without a counselor for some time now and was wondering if any of you had any personal recommendations for services."
408,Feeling too relaxed and unmotivated all the time.,"I am 23 years old and I've been having a this problem for like 5 years now. I used to get stressed a lot when I was in 12th grade and preparing for college admissions and stuff. The competition that time had driven me nuts and I lost my will to do anything.

Now it's so bad that I don't even feel interested in talking to people. I have minimal friends and I don't go out at all. I feel uninterested in learning anything because I keep forgetting stuff. I don’t feel emotions at all. I see people of my age having girl friends and getting married and I am not even capable of making friends. People have hours of conversations while I have trouble keeping up a conversation for a minute.

Sometimes I manage to get it together and feel better for a day or two but then I relapse back to my apathetic state. It’s like it has become a way of life for me and I feel really helpless.

I am only trying to push through because of my parents as they always wanted to see me in a better place. But I am totally fucked right now…

I don't want to be like this and am searching for something to jerk me back to a normal life.

Is there something that can be done for this?"
409,I don’t know what’s wrong? Kinda?,"I got out of a super toxic friendship, like boarderline abusive but I don’t wanna say abusive because I don’t think it was bad enough to be. It’s been about 3 months and I was very angry for the first two, ungodly angry.

I moved on since then but ever since I moved on, I’ve noticed whenever I think of my ex-friend I get shaky and a feeling of dread. I was talking to my therapist about the time I went to a school dance and ended up throwing up solely because of that ex-friend and even when talking about it I was shaking and I felt like throwing up. Even now as I type this I’m shaking.

Occasionally I would get nightmares about them, it would be a fine dream and then they would show up and ruin it all. Occasionally those dreams are good dreams but they’re far and few between. 

Honestly I don’t know who to ask because I tried asking my therapist and I couldn’t explain it well and she didn’t answer my question :(.

TLDR - old toxic friend I no longer talk to or see still makes me panic 3 months later"

I’ve been waiting months to be seen after re-referring myself and now the wait is going to be even longer. I’m struggling enough without the isolation on top of this. I’m not much of a talker in terms of friends and I don’t have any family so there’s not many places I can turn to for emotional support. 

How are people within the community coping with the isolation and not having professional support? I’m feeling pretty damn low at the minute. I’ll take any suggestions I can get as I’m fighting urges but it’s starting to get too much."

I want to be castrated, I really don't want to suffer this anymore, it is very disturbing to battle your brain every waking moment to not think of those images and urges. If you are going to insult me please just save it, I need real advice"
413,How do you cope with intrusive thoughts,How do I deal with them? They're horrible and ruin everything and tell me to do horrible things to people or hurt myself or even just impulsively break something.

414,"I was in a toxic relationship, where I was stonewalled, gaslit, ghosted at any sign of conflict, my self esteem is ruined. Yet because the relationship was only a few months it was honeymoon so I can’t think of the bad side of her. Just feel terrible, I need advice","As I said I was in a toxic relationship, it was a brilliant relationship until any sign of conflict came up. I made mistakes, and hurt her, which I take responsibility for, but I tried to work out conflict I caused. However since she wasn’t openly horrible to me, but would ghost me, ignore me, tell me horrible things like I make her sick and she feels bad about me, I never had any serious discussions with her because she would always ghost me or go away when she was upset. One time she didn’t talk to me for a week and when she did talk to me was extremely cold and distant, and I felt like i wasn’t getting anywhere. I felt unbelievably low, and now she dumped me, she’s trying to use revenge tactics on me, even though I wanted us to work out and put so much effort into the relationship. I feel like my feelings are being spun against me, she called me the victim because other people said they think she didn’t deal with something maturely and gaslit my feelings. She said she tried to work through things when she didn’t try at all and avoided any conversation like that. I know she has serious commitment issues and she’s very avoidant but I just can’t move on because of the guilt I feel. She moved straight on from the relationship and was talking to, messaging other guys, kissing other guys, was on tinder and even tweeted before I muted her social media that she was on and off with a guy before and after seeing me and said she’d been on dates and only stopped being serious because she went to university but they both had feelings for each other which makes me feel used and abused. Despite all these signs because she was never nasty to me I feel as if it’s all my fault. It has ruined my self esteem and mental health, I’m trying to rebuild it all now, I’ve started therapy and trying to work on myself but I feel not good enough and like I’m all to blame for everything. Can you give me some advice please? Thanks"
415,I don't feel like me.,"I don't even know what it would feel like to be myself fully. I don't like who I am right now, but I don't think I hate who I am either. I am working on becoming someone I would admire, but the more I work on that the further I feel from both myself and the person I want to be. I feel a little lost.

I have a handful of mental disorders that have been diagnosed in the last 10-13 years, but I want so badly for my mind to be strong enough to pull me out of them. At times I am very strong, but other times I give into the comforts that hold me in a perpetual state of self pity.

I don't know what I want to achieve by posting this. Just nice to put it out there I guess."
416,I want to know what's wrong with me.,"Ok, so some details, for context. 

I'm live in the UK, male, 34, married, two kids. I own my own house and work on the regional Police murder investigation team.

I have been on medication for depression and anxiety since 2014. I am currently on Citalopram (40mg daily) and Mirtazapine (15mg daily). I am currently working and haven't taken time, due to my mental health, since 2017.

I don't even know why I'm posting this, but I haven't really got a clue what to do. I hate myself, I actively despise myself, I think about killing myself on a daily basis, although I don't think I could ever do that to my family. 

Things have got progressively worse over the last 5-6 years. I overthink everything, I can't stop going over and over things in my head and then I get angry with my wife and kids when they interrupt these thoughts. In the last two years I've developed a physical reaction to these thoughts where my head will jerk in a no motion and I will swear, almost involuntarily. My mood.swings are to one extreme to the next, no middle ground and it's exhausting. 

I've had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy but to be honest, the whole experience felt like a bit of a conveyor belt. At times it made me feel worse, like I was the problem and that I had to make excuses for the people that did things that bothered me, but who do I get to blame when I am an asshole? It's got worse since last November when my GP, the only person who I ever felt actually understood me, emigrated. I find it very hard to trust medical professionals and after a run of bad experiences since, j have now moved to a new GP practice but of course, current events mean there is no way I'm getting an appointment. 

I think I know the cause of some of my issues, perfectionism being one that I think I can trace back to my mother and my upbringing, but I don't even feel able to help myself. I over eat, have put on nearly 3 stone in the last 12 months, I barely exercise, I hate my job because of the way many I work with make me feel and the way I am treated by the institution. 

I think the overeating is part of some sort of self destruction thing, just like picking fights with those in authority is another. I feel trapped by my job financially but also because I can't even read a job advert without it making me feel angry. All the bullshit, ""we're looking for people who want to go above and beyond"" fuck you!

I'm worried I am damaging my kids, maybe like I think my mother damaged me. I don't know.

It may be obvious to some of you that this started with some structure and has quickly turned into a garbled mess, and that is kind of me down to a tea. Start off with the best of intentions and then just go off on one. I just haven't got a clue what to do and how I can get motivated to help myself and get out of this viscous circle.

I'm going to leave it there and just post this. Maybe I can come back to this at a more reasonable hour and try and word it better."
417,is something wrong with me?,"Hi. i dont know how to word this, but i'm noticing a manifestation of things ive dealt with internally that seem to have gotten worse as ive gotten older. im 19 and have felt these since i was maybe 6:

\- lack of motivation. my outlook on life is pretty pessimistic and i used to think i'm lazy but i think its just lack of motivation. i cant focus on schoolwork, such as reading , taking notes, or writing papers. i have trouble connecting concepts together in my classes

\-trouble focusing - i have HORRIBLE time focusing for any extended period of time. it affects my schooling, i do have good grades (i am going into my junior year of college) but i have extreme difficulty doing work. i often have to Chegg answers or ask friends for help because i feel like i cant get my brain to think for itself. i find myself repeating things a lot. i have to plan everything i do out. i often look very far ahead in life like 5 years ahead and try to plan everything out ahead of time to avoid stress in the future

\- emotional issues - i had a shitty life and i dont want to get into it but as a result i have abandonment issues, anxiety, i have trouble sleeping and often wake up early, i have nightmares, and i have a lot of emotions i have to sort through like anger, sadness, and worry

change of interests/personality - i feel like i have a million interests and nothing is consistent. i lose focus easily . i feel like theres distinct sides to me that come out depending on the environment im in and who im with

triggers - i have triggers relating to traumatic things in my life and the way ive dealt with and continue to deal with things is through distraction and isolation. so any reminder of things that bother me lead me to basically have an emotional episode, usually with anger or crying and lack of functioning

\- other - compared to other people, i feel like i get over things very quickly, such as heartbreak. i cut off people a lot.  just cut off half of my family. ultimately i want to live life by my self i dont want to get married or have kids. not that i think something is wrong with that, but my thinking is that i am destined to be alone . i want to live a simple lifestyle with no stress because thats all ive dealt with my whole life.

i feel like this was very rambly but thats the best i could do to explain what im dealing with i dont know where to go for help or if i even need help but i just feel like im not okay.."
418,My girlfriend left me and I don’t know what to do,"I was in an amazing relationship with this girl for almost a year but there were issues. I made mistakes which hurt her but I always owned up to what I did and she said it was alright. We always made up or so I thought. Whenever we would have an argument she would bring up things that I thought we were over. Whenever we would get in an argument she would always post a passive aggressive paragraph on her Instagram story and tell her friend all of our businesses but she would get onto me whenever I would tell anybody. Eventually she broke up with me and said that her mental health was is really bad and it was hard for her to commit to relationship. She said that she would still want to be friends and that we could possibly rekindle our relationship when she gets better. She told me over text btw. After that happened I felt good for a day then I went into a very dark place. I felt extremely depressed a started to not talk as much. at this time we still talked but it was really dry. Then eventually I snapped. Three months ago I couldn’t take all of the emotions and I just started cutting myself. I would cut up arms all the way from my wrist to elbow. What made it worse was that I destroyed most of my friendships with other people in an effort to keep the relationship going. But today I went even further. She made this post on her spam account about how she came out as lesbian and dated her friend who she always vented my business to and always lied to my former girlfriend to make me look bad. When I found out I just lost it I cut up my entire left arm and even my chest. I want to tell someone but I don’t think I could tell her because she would think I’m trying to manipulate her and I can’t tell my parents because I’m too embarrassed and they don’t believe in mental illness. I don’t know what do I just miss her so much. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
(Sorry for the rambling)"
419,"So, these symptoms may be weird.","
So, this is my first ever post! Let me start with, if you get to the end THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart as this was a long read.

I was wondering if anyone recognises these symptoms to be anything. I’m not asking for a diagnoses. I’m asking so I can research these conditions and go back to my doctor. I went to my doctor in January 2019, where I tried (badly) to explain my symptoms, she asked me if I wanted to write a letter and give it to her in a few days time. I chickened our and she obviously never received that letter. I’ve never been back. But now I’m sick of this so will be going once this virus is under control.

My symptoms:

Very bad depression along with numb, harmed myself etc. Started around 12/13 years old.

Find no joy in anything, such as my horse riding. Cannot remember when I was ever happy. 

Bad state of numbness/emptyness (along with the depression) since I was around 13/14

I tried to act happy and normal in everyday life to trick my mind into being happy, didnt work😅. I did for about a year believe it worked but now I realise it didn’t.

Feel like there are cameras around, first episode happened in a history lesson in S4 (2 years ago). Now I feel the cameras are put on me via my coats/jackets by people I know. I know truthfully they aren’t there but I always “act” normal in my room in case. 

People are watching me from my kitchen window by standing on the grass outside, only when it is dark and I’m up at the kettle or sink.

I buy unnecessary things, just bought a cat gps tracker, a bunch of clothes I’ll probably never wear too, I think I done it as I can get a little bit excited about deliveries and opening boxes. 

Extreme anxiety, cannot go into shops alone, cant walk alone unless I’m looking at my phone or it is in my hand, need to count my walking steps so I walk normally, feel like everyone is staring at me outside, never act myself in front of anyone but my household family, feel like everyone thinks I’m lying at normal things (they don’t) but my mind makes me think they do. 

I cannot maintain eye contact. Never have been able to. I’ll always look at them for literally a second and have to look away.
 
I also get very attached to certain people, not obsessed, I don’t stalk them or anything. It’s normally people older than me but I want to be around them all the time and be them when I’m older.

Anger/irritability to my mum, been told I skip from one subject to next too quickly, I “flick” my moods very fast, one minute I’m on my phone next I’m arguing if she coughs.

Not sure if this is relevant, but I have absolutely no interest in relationships. My past relationships only happened because I was bored and wanted to pass the time, as horrible as that sounds. They obviously didn’t last long, longest was 4 months.

I get bursts of energy where I have to clean everything, it will be 1/2am and I clean the whole kitchen. Not just wash dishes but bleach the cupboard doors, paint the shelves, wash the walls. That was my last cleaning episode haha."
420,I just can't love normally.,I.. why cant I just love normally why do I have to hold onto the person I love with a death grip and push them away.. I just want to be normal but my negative thoughts and insecurities  scream at full volume all day. I cant be happy. I feel like I want to shut the door and never come out..
421,Why can’t I cry anymore?,"Alright I know this sounds dumb, but I used to cry a lot when I was younger. So like when my mom went on a business trip I would cry, if I talked about my dad I would cry, if my cousin said something mean to me I would cry. I was pretty sensitive and always cried. However, I just don’t cry over things anymore and this sounds stupid but I kinda miss it? Like it’s kind of frustrating to me that I can’t cry when I feel sad. A part of me thinks I cried so much I got used to it and I just don’t do it anymore. Is something wrong with me 😣"
422,"I'm probably going to delete this later for privacy. I'd rather kill myself than work a ""real"" job.","It's getting to a breaking point. I've tried for the last year and a half to find a job that I could handle, both online and locally. And nothing has panned out. I'm 22 and still live with my parents in a small town in new mexico where the nearest walmart is over 2 hours away. There's basically no work opportunities here, let alone one I would actually be able to handle. and now it's even worse with the virus. I have minimal work experience and didn't finish college due to health reasons. The pressure is building on me to get a job and move out. I have (undiagnosed) pretty severe depression and anxiety. Not a day has gone by where I haven't thought about killing myself, but it's been getting much much worse lately. But, no matter how bad it's gotten, the thought of spending a majority of my life going to a job I'm going to hate, spending every day with people I most likely won't like, having to deal with the sick feeling my anxiety gives me for 8-10 hours a day makes it so much worse. I've done it before but I could never make it past a 3 months before it becomes too much for me and I have to quit. I'm getting to the point where, even though my family is the biggest reason I haven't done it yet, Killing myself is feeling like the best option. It'll tear them up for awhile, but at least I'll no longer be a burden. They'll move on eventually, I won't be a burden anymore, and I won't have to feel the pain I feel at work. I've only been this close to going through with it once before. I'm probably at the lowest point I've ever been at right now. I'm too much of a chicken shit to talk to anyone about it. I just don't know what to do anymore."
423,I fucked this one up bad.,"Hey fellas, i want to share a story with all of you guys. Last fall my mental health problems became clear to my parents, i got on a waiting list at an psychiatrist and started treatment about 2 weeks ago. My diagnose i social anxiety. Because of this i struggle with a whole lot of for other people normal stuff. Meeting my girlfriends parents and her family etc, i want to focus on her in this case. I dont feel worthy as a human being, everything i do seems wrong and whatever it is whatever someone says i feel like im a total piece of shit. Its never enough. The pressure of a relationship and my feelings of worthlessness made me break up with my gf, i felt to guilty about my mental state. It feels like im dragging her in my shit and because if this like i said i broke up. I fucked up bad you guys. After all of this i see that with breaking up with her my problem is not her or the pressure of my relationship it is me and the pressure i put on myself for almost about everything that i do, say, think, or acchieve. I feel even more awfull than i already did and i regret it a whole lot, by being scared that i might be hurting her i hurt her a whole lot. Im analysing a lot of things that is part of my problem but i feel like the biggest idiot that i could not see that i did not need to break up or something like that. I really hate myself, i cant sleep and feel like i threw away the best thing that ever happend to me. Thanks for reading you guys."
424,Is there any way to find a therapist and get an appointment within a day?,I need to find someone right now.
425,4 months clean from cutting,"I'm feeling depressed and am planning on talking about it in a bit, but I wanted to share something positive. I'm trying to feel like I'm worth enough for this to be an accomplishment.

426,Does anyone need a friend?,"Recently I've progressively been feeling very lonely. I dont really have any friends and really need some. I dont have anyone to text apart from family, which live in a different time zone than mine. The quarantine has been straining my mental health and it feels way lonelier than before."
427,I feel like I'm always disliked,"I want some kind of advice or comfort... maybe that's wrong to ask for. If it is that's fine if anyone wants to tell me.
I try to ask for help when I'm sad. I've gone to friends and said I needed to talk, made sure to check up on them and see how they were, but I always get ignored or brushed off latley. It makes me lose faith in myself as a person and the people I love when I ask for help and get turned away.
I lost my health insurance and therapist, and now this virus is here and no one wants to talk to me about how I feel. My partner seems exasperated with me. Am I so insignificant that if I disappeared no one would notice at all? There's a quote somewhere about existing but not being seen. That's how I feel. It's empty and lonely. I feel sadder everyday. I want to feel better."
428,Im too scared to call suicide prevention hotline,"This is really hard to put out there, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to keep this all in. I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few years, and back in October I had a failed attempt after my boyfriend called me and talked me out of it. It took him a long time, and I was not going to listen, but he was able to pull me away, but now I’m afraid I’ve scared him to death, whenever we talk about my depression and thoughts he gets really sad and I don’t like causing him pain. I’ve been having the thoughts so frequently that they drown out my senses, I’ve started taking antidepressants prescribed by my therapist of three years. They just make me feel fake, I don’t like them. I also don’t want to think like this, I don’t want to die, but at the same time what’s the point of living anymore..? I the thoughts have been destroying me tonight, and it hurts so bad. I want to call the suicide prevention hotline, to just tell someone how I feel, but I’m scared they will call police or I’ll get baker- acted again. I feel lost. I feel like I’m losing."
429,Adjusting to home life,"I don't post at all, but I just need advice or something. I'm in Canada, and can't seem to find free counselling, so if you have any suggestions or cheap or free counselling please let me know! I am not working right now because I need to finish up the semester first.

I'm a 22 year old female college student. I grew up with an abusive father (who has since left), and my siblings and myself have picked up bad traits from him (mine are anger issues). 

When I moved away to college at 19, I started counselling to heal from everything I had experienced, and gain coping skills. Moving out of my mom's house had helped me see the toxic problems I had since I no longer lived in the space that gave those to me. I started taking action to change my mental health and take it seriously. I had my anger issues diminished, my depression was at bay, and the anxiety too. I decided last summer I was going to stay in the city I went to college in because I had deemed my family to be toxic to my mental health.

Well with this COVID 19 break out, I had to move home again because I do have a job here (I used to come work on Christmas breaks and what not). I had to move home because I have no money, and my mom isn't going to charge me much rent to live with her.

The problem is though when I come back to my mom's house, I immediately go back to my old habits because everyone here is still stuck doing the same things. I get way more snappy, I get extremely depressed, and anxious. I feel even though I try to be the better person in a lot of situations (using my coping skills, using my ""I feel this way when _____"" statements) people will fly off the handle at me. Nobody here deals with their emotions so everyone blows up on one another constantly. I feel like since I have allowed myself to deal with my emotions I have become more sensitive to all of it. Nobody knows how to have an adult conversation, so they turn to talking shit about one another behind one another's backs.
My mother's boyfriend is always making unnecessary comments about my siblings being lazy or something (no hate to anyone who is unemployed, I know people cannot work for mental or physical reasons). My mom's boyfriend is of sound mind and body, but will not get a job. Everytime we say something about it, my mother immediately defends her boyfriend. My mom tells my brother he is JUST like our Father (and granted in some ways he can be, but he also is better than him in many ways too). My brother has expressed wanting suicidal thoughts when my mom says this but she doesn't seem to care.

I know my sister has an extreme attitude problem (18 year old). And my brother doesn't help much around the house, but he still works. But I feel as though if people would actually thank one another for something they did, or acknowledged the good in someone, we wouldn't have nearly the same issues.

I'm so exhausted already, and I have only been home for about 1.5 weeks.. I have to be here until September when I go off to University. I'm tired. I feel like I'm going nuts."
430,I hit myself when I'm mad at myself [copied this from my ReachOut post],"Hey everyone, 

I just wanted to write about this as it's been a huge issue for me and wanted to see if anyone else comes from a similar place in regards to this issue.

\~\~\~

I have this idea that I need to portray perfection and always be on top of everything, so when I mess up in the slightest, I get so so mad at myself and fall into the trap of thinking I'm worthless, a complete idiot, a total waste of space, and so on and so forth.

To deal with my frustrations, I will often hit myself as a sort of 'self-punishment' for being stupid. This happens quite commonly, as I frequently disappoint myself, however, one of the worst 'sessions' was this morning (only in the last hour or so).

To offer some context, after a lesson yesterday, myself and a number of other peers hosted our own Zoom conference and we were just mucking around, being funny. I decide to change my name to *'big dick peen 69'* which is stupid the more I think about it. Well anyway, it was funny at the time but when we finished the call, I forgot to change my name back. So, when I had an *actual class* today, my name came up as *'big dick peen 69'* in front of my class, and of course in front of my **teacher.** 

I've since offered a genuine apology via email regarding this incident, but I was so mortified by my own idiocy and forgetfulness that, after class, I took my lunch break and spent that (plus more time) just hitting my head over and over again. I would find anything I could to hit myself with, (without hurting myself to the point of bleeding or brain damage). A heavy book, the wall - I'd just *punch and slap myself* if that would suffice. All the while, I called myself a number of names over and over again to remind myself that I'm *'a f\*cking idiot',* or 'a *complete f\*ckwit',* and so on. 

Because I have this idea that I must be perfect and present myself as such at all times, it hits me really hard (literally) when I make a mistake. I'm normally a confident person but if ever I feel I've jeopardized my image or relationship with someone - *especially* a teacher - then I feel as though I'm a complete failure and a total idiot.

\~\~\~

That was all I had to say regarding this issue. Does anyone have any similar issues or ways I can overcome this? I don't want it to get to the point where I hurt myself with *the intention* of bleeding out or causing brain damage. Anything you have would be a huge help.

Thank you,

Bella"

434,Schizophrenia and weed,"Hello everyone, I hope you’re doing well

I have a weird question, and I honestly don’t know where else to ask this but can drugs dispute or trigger schizophrenia in a person?

I know it sounds weird but my mom tells me that and tells me that she had a friend who was completely normal and just for doing drugs ONCE he developed schizophrenia, is that possible? 

I don’t have schizophrenia but I’ve had family members with it and I have OCD so maybe it could be easier for me to get it. Idk what do think about this? I wanna try weed (and get high) but I’m scared because of this"
435,Advice help,"The thought of life crushes me everyday. I can't picture a possible future, I only live day to day. The thought of having to be an independent person with financial responsibilities and also having a personal identity and goals is crippling. I don't want any of it. I didn't sign up for this. It's no ones fault but it is what it is. If there were just a place where I could go and be taken care of and have the internet and entertainment I would waste away happily. My days success is ranked according to how many hours of tv I watch. If I don't watch a sufficient amount I feel like I wasted the day. Which is so warped because logically it's the other way around. I'm wasting the day by watching tv but I can't do anything else so I use the tv to escape. I'm a non functioning waste of space. I can't do anything nor do I want to. What do I do? It's not like I can stop time. The future and all the things I'm afraid of are coming. The only way I can see to avoid them is death."
436,What’s wrong with me?,"I don’t know why but sometimes I get heavily frustrated for no apparent reason and I suddenly feel the urge to declutter everything around me. I constantly find myself throwing things away. When I throw stuff away I feel some sense of euphoria almost...? It’s not just average cleaning either, I get tunnel vision like I NEED to throw stuff away or else I’ll loose my mind. Does anyone else do this?"

438,"not educated enough about DID, friend has it?","Hey all! Hope you're having a good day! :)

My friend, let's call them W, says they have dissociative identity disorder. I know it must be different for everyone, so I don't want to jump to conclusions, but they don't really show any symptoms of it. Their alters are fictional characters, but I didn't think that sounded right. Please excuse any ignorance, I really do want to understand! I know DID is a real, serious disorder and I do not mean to belittle anyone at all.

Thoughts? Am I completely wrong?"
439,Do these count as suicide attempts?,"Quarantine has been hitting me real hard fellas. I (16F) was diagnosed with type 1 Bipolar Disorder one year ago but I’ve been dealing with what I now know is this illness since about 5th grade (8-9ish) after my grandparents died. 

Summer of 7th grade I nearly overdosed on sleeping pills but my best friend called me just as I had slipped the first one in my mouth (hadn’t swallowed yet) and talked me out of it.

This past Christmas Eve I had been developing a dependency on alcohol which rendered my antidepressants useless and after intoxicating myself I got myself ready to down all of my prescriptions before my girlfriend called me after I texted her goodbye.

And just last night, after going through a month of this covid-19 hell, my own personal purgatory, I nearly left work early to walk down to the highway next door to let myself fall off the overpass.

This quarantine took away all social interaction, and at this point my life has come to a state where about 90% of my happiness comes from making other people happy. I hadn’t received any hugs or physical affection in that time either (affection is integral to my mental health) and everyone around me had become emotionally unavailable or busy. 

Just before my quick three hour shift I sent a short ambiguous (I love you, I won’t mind being someone’s ghost story) to my brother, who laughed it off. But when I sent a little more heartfelt and apologetic text my girlfriend immediately began blowing up my phone. And long story short she got me to go home from work as my mom came to pick me up. If it weren’t for the fact I promised her to always make her happy, I don’t know what would’ve pulled me out.

I have ambition, I want to live life, but when my medication is off (quarantine + my terrible memory hasn’t helped this) I become unstable. And the whole situation which spanned the duration of my shift, and got my sister (best friend who I have a sibling like friendship with) got involved too. They got my mom to show up early to watch me.

I know that wasn’t my brain talking, just the sick parts. But I have this terrible habit of imagining other scenarios for things that have happened. And I don’t want to think about it. But the stress and overflow of huge assignments from online school is driving me up the wall.

Do these count as suicide attempts or just ideation? Also, how do I stop myself from traumatizing my girlfriend and take care of myself so I can stay around to be with her?"
440,I just realized how much my mom has fucked me up,"Iv'e struggled with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder for a long time. but before all of this, from about 7-15 years old, my mom was an alcoholic. Now, I didn't consider her an alcoholic until she wasn't one anymore, I was just so used to her being drunk, on our couch, or spending nights at her friends house drunk. There were so many things me and my sister wanted to do when we were little that we couldn't because our mom was drunk. of course my dad was amazing, dont get me wrong, but there are three of us ( kids ). My dad used to tell me she started drinking around the time I was struggling with my mental health around 7, so Iv'e felt very guilty for a long time. Now she doesn't drink, but it's so hard because she just acts like she's been there forever but she really hasn't. everyone thinks shes this super cool mom, but she really isn't. she's rude, and bitchy now that she doesn't drink. I have so much anger because of her, it's so hard to process. I have this hatred towards women around 30-60, or just moms, Not because they did something wrong at all, but because I'm so used to feeling this anger towards my mom for taking herself out of my child hood to party, and drink, and be selfish and rude.

I don't know if anyone has experienced something similar"
441,When ever I am not being exited or being distracted with gaming I want to kill myself,"Every time I start to think I think about why we are alive and why we matter then think of myself in the third person then think about religion then think about my problems who for some reason aren’t a problem at that moment and I’m just angry for no reason then I get some work done after a nap and become very hyper then descend into violent madness, then finally i go to bed lonely. So I don’t know what to do or how I can change my view of the world and this pattern. Feeling joy and hope and peace feels weird now and I like feeling sad and lonely because I get emotion out of it. When I play games I get extremely toxic. Is there something wrong with me? How can I improve my emotions and mind set?"
442,How do you help?,"How do you help someone suffering from suicidal thoughts? I'll tell you how my friend was helped after self harming and attempted suicide. He checked himself into an emergency room to get stitches and seek mental health help. After being treated they baker acted him. Transported him in a cop car, hand cuffed and given hospital clothes for the hour long ride. He stayed 2 nights where he was treated like an animal. Did everything right to leave as soon as possible. My heart was broken for him, I felt like I had no way to help him, he didn't want to be helped, the help made it worse. After that he tried helping himself by changing things at work, buying his dream bike. Things were looking up for him and I was relieved. Thankfully the hospital was there to help, right? $5,000 bill shouldn't give anyone anxiety right? Atleast there was insurance. All you have to do is fill out a form about your injury. Okay fill in the blanks.
Describe your injury: cuts to the wrist 
How the injury came about: self harm

He never filled it out. Could you blame him? 
I still get the mail from that hospital addressed to him to our house. 

I never knew you were suicidal and I wish I would've known because I miss you so so much every day. It's almost been 3 months since the last time I heard your laugh. 

Please if you feel alone you're not. I know it sounds cliché but it's so true. Please don't hurt yourself and please please stay alive.

I think about you everyday.

So the question remains, how do you help someone that suffers suicidal thoughts? I don't have the answer but I wish I had."
443,I need some help,"My relationship with my girlfriend ended about two months ago. We’ve been dating for almost a years but near the end I was overwhelmed what she was doing. She became more distant and started telling her friend all of our personal details. Once she left me she said that she still loved me but I doubt it now. The whole weight of it all caused me to start cutting myself. It started off relatively small and the episodes occurred less frequently but it’s gotten to where I’m doing it multiple times a day all over my left arm and my chest. So I’ve been wondering if I should tell her about it. I mean we’re still sort of friends, but don’t talk about it as much. Now that I’m saying it it’s kinda stupid but should I even tell her and if so what should I say?

Any help would be appreciated"
444,"Is this PTSD, where should I go for guidance if it is not?","I lose few sources of joy in life due to over association with past events that give me a lot of grief.

Let's say that I was triggered badly recently by something. If I do something too soon, my mind will associate that new activity with the past traumatic event. That new activity will re trigger past traumas if I try to enjoy it next time and I lose yet another one of my few sources of happiness. I want to tell my mind to stop thinking that my past trauma is associated with the current cope that I'm trying to use.

I wanted to say that forgiveness/letting go is impossible for me. The things that give me grief are unforgivable to me and I don't think I would ever be able to forget/forgive those past situations. They go against the core of my own morality and I don't want to ever accept these things that I deem morally wrong. I don't want to change my morality but stop my mind's habit of over associating things so I can cope better in life.

Is there anything in PTSD literature that talks about dealing with over associating traumas with things that make you happy?"
445,I hate being socially illiterate,"Hey there all, so i'm pretty sure I have some social problems, probably some social anxiety, and socially i'm borderline mute.

So I walked downstairs to see my dinner being fed to the dogs, not all of it, there's still a decent amount left, but it pissed me of a lot, but as said i'm kinda bad socially and I find it hard to confront people. Idk, i'm also like that at other things like I do a drama dance class, and I also do some sports but my ability to socially engage with people is bad, I can with some sports though, cause i'm decently competent so I'd give tips if they're doing something wrong, but generally its not like a friend vibe I give of which is eh, people aren't my forte I guess :p"
446,I am going insane.,"With the lockdown and curfew going in my country due to the current pandemic, I find myself in some sort of twisted dilemma. For around seven years, I have become more and more socially awkward, which was worsened by the bullying I suffered through elementary, two years ago I tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital for a couple of months. Over the past year, I was fine, enjoying my classmates as we were the only class in the school, as it was about to shut down. When this year kicked in, I entered school and ever since my anxiety just got worse, as I shake and sweat without any real reason at any time of the day. For example as I write this post I am shaking so badly I have to erase a word twice to get it right along with excessive sweat. In my new school, I encountered something rather curious, that some personality traits of my new classmates are the same to those of my first school, where I was bullied, something that has made me uneasy. Along with this, the fact that the last school I attended was all male, I can not interact with my female classmates, something that has left me in awkward and depressing scenerios.  


The dilemma I found myself submerged in is that I do like the lockdown and the curfew, as I am in my house doing all I want without facing some aspects of my poor social life but, this isolation has left me with the only thing you'll always have, your own thoughts. My own psyche, which is off the rails now, has been forcing me to do too much introspection about my life, a filthy sack of lies that has been on fire for years. My loneliness has been pushing me to an edge, I can't sleep properly at night, being awake at 5AM just remembering and realizing how much I crave for something I will never find. Even though I have not even reached my twenties I feel as if I have wasted all of my years so far, with no friends, no significant other, just a conflicted, awkward, ugly and inacceptable mess.   


All these sleepless nights have shown me how insignificant I am, the idea of death has scared me more than it used to do, as my loneliness says it right: if I die, there will never be someone to see it. Some people say the best in life comes later, that with the time I will learn and grow through trial an error, but I am simply tired, I am not patient enough to wait for more years to come, I have been hurt in such a way that the thought of carrying on causes disgust in me. I wrap myself in so many blankets to feel at least some warm as I just stare into my nightstand, hearing all those memories that haunt me. I am trapped in my past and can't get out. I never accomplish anything I propose to do, I am just a waste of space and should just be laying 6 feet deep."

449,I need help,"To put it simply I hate myself. I have very intense paranoia about everything from things happening to myself and to other people. I have OCD on the compulsive side and do repetitive actions to make myself feel better. Now what brought me here is I am with my girlfriend of two and a half years and we were talking on the phone and I said something that reminded me of someone I used to talk to on a Minecraft server when I was younger. I do not remember when I talked to this person in terms of date but I think it was before my girlfriend and I were dating but I keep thinking well what if it wasn’t? I have messaged five people I used to play Minecraft with and Skype with and none of them have responded but while looking on IG for a response I saw a dm I had opened with a kid I used to play Minecraft with around the time I played Minecraft with the others I had messaged on IG (the others as in the ones who had not responded to my message) and I had messaged him the word “Justin” that being his name. It was dated back to 2015 which was before my girlfriend and I were dating. I am thinking though what if I had talked to that one girl on Minecraft after that which I may have but my girlfriend and I started dating in 2018 and I don’t think I was talking to that girl on Minecraft at that time. I looked on my IG and looked at some of the dates on the pictures I had posted and they were around 2018 a little before my girlfriend and I started dating. So that had calmed me down a little bit but the thought of that could have happened while my girlfriend and I were dating is making me feel horrible. I don’t know any way to really relieve myself and I don’t know what to do. My girlfriend said she would be very upset if she found that to be true which is completely understandable but I don’t think that this happened at the time of us being together which in currently and from Feb. 14, 2018. I don’t know what to do and she helps me with a lot and I love her so much and do not want to lose her."

I'm just wondering now if it had any subconscious effect even if I don't feel like it did. 

Does anyone have a similar experience? And I don't mean a relationship/encounter with narcissistic manipulative people, just perhaps something in your family someone said. Does is still stick with you?"
451,Honestly don't know what to do anymore.,"To start this off I'm sorry but im going to ramble on in this post and I dont really know how to ask for help/advice.

 Just to give a sort of run down on what my issues are, roughly last year I dealt with many different stressful situations that are completely new to me. This included moving away from home (on the same day my gran died), trying and failing to help a suicidal friend back home (luckily he survived and is in a better place now), almost losing another close friend to suicide (this is where my mental health first started to become uncontrollable). Helping me through this time (April 2019-Oct 2019) was a sort of ex of mine, she was the first person that I felt close enough to talk about my problems to (I am aware that I have attachment issues) she was the person that convinced me to tell her about what I was going through. When this first started we were just friends but as time when on we would frequently go on drives alone and talk about our problems during which we became a lot closer. In July of 2019 after us spending all of our time together for a few months straight she left for someone else. This again hit me hard but we remained friends. After about 2 weeks that relationship ended and she started spending more time with me again as this time went on she slowly started cutting me out of her life, and even while I let her know that I was seriously at risk of doing something serious she would ignore my messages and then in October 2019 she used the information about my mental health that I had told her against me and also accused me of rape (I have proof from other people present that night that this wasnt the case) and completely cut all contact with me. After this happened I completely cut myself off from others emotionally and stopped going to classes for my course. She also told me that everytime that I was going to her for help I was causing her harm. After a few months of going severely downhill mentaly I opened up to the close friend of mine that tried to commit suicide that I previously mentioned, she helped me a lot and is probably the closest I have ever been to someone in my life, she convinced me to seek out counselling from the uni counselling service. After doing this I deferred my course until next year so that I could try and sort myself out mentally, since I have done this I could feel myself improving mentally. I thought things were starting to look up for me and I had even managed to sort out a summer job for myself. This sort hight point didn't last long though as I found out one of my flatmates was moving out of the flat with almost no warning and not giving us time to find someone to take her place (everyone we know has already sorted out flats for next year), then I was hot with the bombshell that my close friend was also thinking about moving into a new flat without me, which I wont lie hit me harder than it should. Just after this COVID started and I lost both my job as well as access to my university counsellor (I should add that I need to speak to people in person or at least a video call otherwise I dont get anything from the sessions) and could no longer meet up with my close friend to talk about my mental health as she is quarantined at her girlfriend's flat. I have been trying to reach out to her recently to facetime to just talk and get things out in the open which she had agreed to do, but never actually would do them when I asked. I have been worried recently that something was wrong with her but didn't know what to do about it. She told me today after me asking for help that she was dealing with her own stuff right now and that she cant talk to me about things anymore. This has brought back my fear that me opening up and becoming close to someone hurts them and is bad for them. I am also feeling guilty for not doing enough during the time that she was struggling and dont think that I have done enough for her.

I know that I'm not great at writing things out but I hope I've explained things fairly well and probably more than I needed to. I just want advice on how to go on from here as I am lost right now and dont know what to do. And sorry if you actually read through all the shit that I've typed but I didn't know where else to go for help."

455,New friends please?,"Hi everyone, this quarantine really has me feeling lonely and worthless. I’m stuck at home all day with nothing to do. I have school online now so it’s not nearly as engaging and I have a short attention span anyway. I miss my friends . My new mom works from afternoon to night so I’m home with my new dad and cats which is fine but I’m still very lonely because I’m normally reclusive and hide in my room. Idk what to do with myself anymore and this will go on in my area for at least another month"
456,Was I groomed?,"When I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I had just met the neighbour’s teenage son. I think he was 15-16, but I’m not 100%. He was nice to me for 99% of the time we were together, and he gained my trust, then when we were alone we started play fighting and he brought me to a place in the lake covered by trees so we couldn’t be seen and he held me down and molested me. Does that count as grooming. I only saw him for that one day."
457,Being ok for someone else.,"So my best friend has pretty severe mental health issues, same as me. I try my best to be there for her. But I'm finding it extremely hard to be ok enough in my self to give her the help she needs/deserves. She is the literal world to me, but I don't know how to help when I'm in the state I'm in?"
458,Struggling to support my schizophrenic brother,"So the title pretty much sums up why I need help right now. My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago after multiple hospitalizations. He attempted suicide last year and was hospitalized for about a month. He has since gotten treatment and is currently living in a group home near my parents. I live in another state and talk with him nearly every day because he has only a small number of people who have continued to reach out to him. He was getting better but then COVID happened. Quarantine has left him extremely isolated...he isn’t able to leave his house at all. Things got bad this weekend for him and he ended up getting hospitalized again for hallucinations and paranoia. The state he lives in has a notoriously fucked up mental health system and they basically had him sit in the ER for 4 hours and then released him with no way to get home. My 60 year old father had to pick him up from the hospital yesterday and according to my brother he said it was the scariest experience he has ever went through in his entire life. I am just starting to recover from the grief of his last suicide attempt so the news of this completely wrecked me. To complicate things further, he has been relying on my parents to bring cigarettes, food, necessities, etc to him. I have offered to have an arrangement made to send things to his home but he has refused. He is also not participating in any group activities right now due to quarantine. And because of the nature of his mental illness, he is afraid to talk to a therapist. 

Multiple family members, including myself, have been diagnosed with PTSD from previous events in our lives and this whole situation is completely overwhelming our ability to cope. I love my brother so much and I hate to see him suffering. I just feel so helpless and let down by the mental health system. I am desperate for some guidance."
459,Any advice on this subject?,"I really dont like myself and I hate that I constantly feel humiliated because of things I do. What do I do??

I feel like I was taught to look down on people with anxiety, and all kinds of different people, due to my emotionally unhealthy mom, and an abusive relationship I was in. Whenever i get upset over anything or start to show that i am stressed out i just start thinking that it would be better if i killed myself because I'm a stupid peice of shit who will go nowhere in life. I think this is something that my abuser said to me. How do i override these thoughts? It literally gets so overwhelming i self harm because i want to punish myself for acting in a humiliating way (crying/panicking)"
460,I’ve been sober for almost a year and I haven’t touched a cigarette in months,"Ever since I graduated college, I thought that my addiction and depression would get worse, but surprisingly it hasn’t. 

I have two jobs that I look forward to everyday, at least before the quarantining began. I had kept busy going on runs and bike rides at least five days a week. Everything seemed settled and I finally had a consistent routine with steady habits. 

But now that the lockdown has been extended for another month, I’m starting to get antsy. It’s hard to fill the time when the days are so long. I’m trying my hardest not to pour a shot or light a cig, but my resistance is slowly diminishing. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to fill the time? 

It’s difficult for me to fill the time when the days are so long"
461,My sister has the worst case of OCD and depression I've ever seen or heard of and my family is in need of help,"Okay, so I'm not entirely sure how to start this but my thirteen-year-old sister has what the psychiatrist at her school is saying is the worst case of depression and OCD she has ever seen in her twenty years at her job.  Her problems started out a few years ago as not wanting to spend time with our family as much and being protective of certain possessions. We initially dismissed this as normal teenage girl behavior but it only got worse. What it has evolved to lately is her being in a complete state of insanity. Whenever she does anything with our family she gets provoked by pretty much any comment about herself and goes into yelling a ritual like set of phrases until we leave.  Sometimes this continues and she follows us around continuing the rituals. She spends the entire day (literally 17 hours) either on the couch or in her room and refusing to pretty much anything else.  My parents monitor her screen use and there are some nights where she does not sleep.  They've tried taking away / limiting her screen use but when they take it away she relentlessly harasses them until they give it back. She has been on medication for the past few weeks but prior to this, the rituals would go to the extent of her going into screaming fits in her room yelling at absolutely no one late into the night. Also, she refuses to wear any other clothes besides one outfit and has a behavior of switching it to inside out and backward in the evenings.  She only wears one pair of really beat up shoes and hides them, along with her other possessions, in random spaces throughout the house.  If any of us go near one of her possessions she absolutely freaks out. The one slightly weird thing about this is she is able to function fairly normally at school and attended sports practices until the recent covid-19 events.  

The one (slightly) positive side of this is that she has shown fairly little evidence of any form of self-harm.  However, being forced to live with her has basically ruined the lives of the rest of my family.  My nine-year-old brother is emotionally scarred from being tortured any yelled at by her every day and my parents have gotten to the point where they are so fed up with her illness that they completely ignore it. I had never seen my dad cry until one day where he sat down after arguing with her and realized she mentally was no longer there.  

I am making this post as a genuine ask for help.  My family has no idea how to solve her situation.  We've been matched with a psychiatric doctor but the appointments were doing very little and are no longer possible due to covid 19.  We have tried to get appointments with psychiatric doctors, but since there are so little in the area (we live in Southern Maine) the estimated wait times are over six months for an appointment.  The only available doctors are multiple hours away in Massachusetts but making regular appointments there is not feasible for my family.  Also, being in this current situation where we have a stay-at-home order has caused her behavior to get to the point where it's impacting my mental health as well in the few weeks I've been home (I'm a current college student)."

463,My kids are my anchor,"Over the last few days I have had some sincere thoughts about killing myself. I'm depressed, my marriage is falling apart, I cant make money at my job because no one is buying anything, bills are stacking up and bank account is running low. I'm at a new low and I dont see the point in going on.

I wont kill myself for 3 very important reasons: my kids. I would rather be miserable and hate life every day than abandon them and ever have them wonder if they were the reason I chose to kick it. I cant do that to them, but i cant live with myself.

I need help. Possibly medical, but we dont have health insurance yet...hasnt kicked in from my job. I feel hopeless, I feel trapped and worst of all, I feel like a failure. I've never felt this small."

465,Mental health &amp; relationship,"Hello everyone, I'm at a loss of what to do.. My boyfriend of 7 years sees a phycologist and has been since I met him. He used to be very sweet and caring. Here's the problem we moved out of state 4 years ago and he no longer could see the Dr he was well established with, so we've been trying to save money for years now to move back, but a few months into living where we live now, he's been doing drugs and recently almost 2 years ago he's been going through this thing where he believes now just randomly that I have other woman come and take my place that look just like me, to make him go crazy, he believes none of my photos are the same on Facebook and that I look different in them all, or if my attitude changes even the slightest or if I can't remember something right away he starts to believe I'm an imposter. I don't know what to do, he won't address it with his Dr now and won't let me address it to his Dr either. What do I do? 
 
Please and thank you"
466,What are my options?,"Lost on what to do.

I’ve been looking at options to treat my feelings of anxiety and depression and there doesn’t seem to be many options. 

The price of CBT where I live at least the cheapest I found was €65 per ( I’d have to go for 6-8 weeks) it’s very expensive not only that but I’m unemployed and have been for a while now. Let’s say I had a job it have to find time to go to CBT but on my days off I’d be to tired to get on a bus for over an hour there and back. 

I’ve thought of taking Antidepressants but I’m completely against taking them because of the side effects one of the most notable ones I can remember is that the longest recorded case of sexual disfunction from antidepressant use was 18 years. 

I’ve though of taking CBD but that’s also stupidly expensive for 1,500mg of cbd it would cost me €125 and that would last 30 days before I’d have to go out and buy more. 

I’d spend roughly around €1,200 on CBD if I were to go that route. 

I have no idea what I should do"

468,"How do you tell your mother, who you’re not on good terms with, that she may be mentally ill?","I moved back home after college. My mom had always been one to be easily irritated but has grown to become (and I don’t mean this lightly) a raging bitch. I thought it was just me that felt this way against my mom but seeing that the rest of the family has created a barrier against her has me questioning her mental state. My 17 year old brother has stopped talking to her because of her irrational emotions for 4 months now. To her understanding, he’s the problem, not her. My dad‘s level of patience allows him to sit through her yelling at him. 

I work with patients who are hospitalized for their mental disorders and have learned a few counseling techniques. Motivational interviewing has gone out the window. Any goal oriented discussion or open ended questions angers her. My mom perceives any questions to her outbursts or decision making as me judging her. I question for understanding but she does not see that. 

On top of it all, she acts pretty normal in the public’s eye.

469,"Cost of Therapy (Kansas, US)","Here lately it feels like I've been in a slump, like really down. At first I thought it may have been just the usual seasonal blues, but it's persisted long past what it usually does for me. I don't know if it's just general repition in life or something more serious. Either way I think therapy would do me some good. I live in Ottawa, Kansas. Ive heard that there are some good therapist in town, and my girlfriend says they're very good (she got free therapy due to a personal incident and due to being in foster care for some time). How much would a therapist cost and how could I go about seeking out mental help?"
470,What is ADHD actually like?,"I made a post a while back about being completely unable to focus on anything, and someone suggested ADHD. I feel like I've seen really really mixed experiences with ADHD though, so I wanna hear from people who have it on what it's actually like so I can try and figure out if I should actually get tested or not. 

If this is against the rules, please let me know and I will remove it. I'm just not sure where else to go with this and sometime I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I basically just have a lot of trouble focusing on one task. If I have to complete something that takes multiple steps, it'll take me way longer than it should because I have trouble doing the steps in an order that makes sense. 

If I go to make a bowl of oatmeal, I say ""hey, I have to put the water on"" I walk over to the stove to put the water on and then I say ""wait, the bowl I want I need to wash"" and then I forget to put the water on and I walk to the sink. I then forget about the bowl and I say ""oh, I should get my packets ready for when the water warms up."" I then remember that I never put the water on, and then it starts all over. 

It'll take me a good 30 minutes to do something that should take me less than 10. I do this with other things too. I'll go to do something super simple and I'll completely forget because I can't focus on getting it done. Sometimes it's really not that bad and sometimes it really effects my ability to complete basic tasks. I get things done eventually, but I just can't focus on them long enough to get them done in a reasonable time. 

Does this sound like ADHD or something else?"
471,Birthday alone during quarantine,"It’s my birthday tomorrow. I’ve been dreading this day because I knew it would be really triggering. This quarantine has made me realize just how alone I am, and thinking about my birthday makes me so anxious to the point where I can’t breathe.

I’ve never felt as lonely as I have in these past few weeks of quarantine - I live in a house with random people who have no interest in socializing, all of my friends are partnered or with family and haven’t been too responsive when I’ve reached out, I can’t rely on family, and I’m newly single - making these feelings of loneliness even more pronounced. I feel like an afterthought to all of the people I care about, and I’m scared that tomorrow is going to confirm this. I’ve been circling into a depressive blackhole where I start to feel really isolated and worthless, like I’m not worth anyone’s time, no one cares about me, and I don’t have anything to live for at this point. Who will even care if I’m gone?

I’m sorry if this post is in poor taste or seems out of touch given what’s going on in the world right now. I know there are a lot of other people going through more serious stressors, especially due to covid. And what I’m going through pales in comparison. I feel really guilty and angry at myself for even being bothered by something as stupid as a birthday.

Anyway, thank you for this group. I’m grateful to have this place to let all this out because I don’t have anywhere else to turn to. Hope everyone’s staying safe."
472,Is it possible to have body dysmorphia over a body part that is deformed?,"22 M. I have a tarsal coalition in my left foot which has resulted in an extremely rigid flat foot deformity. It causes me a lot of pain to walk around on it and I have to wear a brace for it for daily activities like long walks or prolonged standing. Thankfully, my right foot is normal and is pain-free. Lately, I’ve been focusing a lot on this defect and I it feels crushing to me. I can’t run at all and it’s painful to walk around. I know that in the future and when I get older, people will probably have to take care of me as it gets arthritic and worse. Every time I look at it, I feel those feelings of not wanting dependency on others and the feeling of inadequacy. I feel like I have body dysmorphia because I’m very fixated on its appearance, but is it possible to have body dysmorphia over something that is already malformed?"
473,Bipolar 1,"Hi Everyone,

I am currently going through a really difficult time, having recently gone through a manic episode which turned into a traumatic pyschotic episode which has followed with a very debilitating depression. The past 2 years have been horrific.. I feel like my sense of self has dissolved. I have recently been discharged from hospital and I am feeling completely like my sense of self has gone. I have no confidence, feel like I'm never going to be that bubbly and easy going person I once was. I regret a lot of my choices throughout life.. the paths I have taken and mourn for the person I feel I have no chance of being ever again. I don't know what to with myself or my life, I don't really have anything left, have drifted away from social circles and friends, I don't have the confidence to meet new people or socialise anymore (used to come to me with ease) I feel like such a boring person now and am losing hope. I just want myself back.. I am feeling really over life and don't see much point."
474,That one time I dreamt about one of my personalities cheering me on.,"I almost woke up crying. I'm still in quarantine so I know that if I cry, my parents would freak out. I couldn't really grasp what happened in my dream but I really had no one in mind who it could possibly be. I slept late at night thinking I should go to sleep instead of letting my parents know that I'm still awake early in the morning again. 

I forgot what my dream was about but it felt like real, I'm struggling at life in it, it feels too much. A random guy, shy yet good looking, looked at me in the eye and uttered the most comforting words my heart needs to hear. I woke up crying. It feels sad yet it seemed that it's okay to be sad. I don't think I have split personalities but this is my first time to meet the most reserved personality I have. I've been having internal conflict for months now and this was the first time someone (inside me) cheered me on.

478,Tw: rape. My rape ruined my life.," Tw: rape, depression, PTSD

I’m a 26 year old female and my only sexual interaction was a rape. Went to the hospital, had a rape kit, and went to court. He didn’t get charged but did have to go to therapy and anger management. I had to be escorted to class due to death threats. I was not allowed to be alone in my residence. I had constant flashbacks and would disassociate during lectures. Cutting was the only thing that made me feel human. I hardly graduated college. 

That was six years ago. I want so badly to have a relationship or even just have sex but get uncomfortable when people look at me. I put on weight and when I lose it, I feel nervous when people compliment me. I want someone to be with me but at the same title I’m too insecure with my body. I don’t understand my feelings or how to control them. If my feelings are all valid, why do they change so much day to day? 

I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I hate not being in control of my body. I can’t even go dance because I’m uncomfortable being around so many people who might try to touch me. I dated someone for four months, but he was too pushy on sex and said he loved me within a month and scared me. Now when I am on a dating site or meeting someone new, I get sad knowing I have nothing to offer them. I’m inexperienced and overweight. (30 pounds) I am terrified of everything. I can’t sleep next to anyone, even my best friend since middle school. 

Now I have realized this has been going on for a long time. I go to therapy. It’s not helping. I am maxed out on my antidepressants. I’m not sure what my next steps should be. All I know is that I’m tired of being tired. 

Others have gone through so much worse and came out fine. I’m at the point where I don’t know that I will ever be okay, and that makes me mad, considering it was only this one event. 

Thank you for listening."
479,Don't let the fear of your own mentalhealth stop you from feeling,"Me, 29, have been seeing mental health professionals from psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors since I was 11. A total of 11 in patient stays, with at least 10 different diagnoses and over 60 different medications. In all this time I spent my whole life trying to mask my mental health and instability with a face that I felt was 'normal.' It brought me to a point where I became unable to cry, empathize, sympathize, and experience happiness - among other things. When I stopped trying to mask myself for others, I began to feel. Emotions are strong. Some hurt and some heal. You take the good with the bad because one is not without the other. A mask is needed at times, but don't forget to take the mask off. Don't let it define you. Feeling is a necessity. Feeling is wonderful. Godspeed and best wishes to every single one of you and don't forget to feel!"
480,I need to know how can I help my girlfriend who I love dearly," I   (27M) have been with and known my girlfriend(25F) from past three   years, I have always known her as an ambitions, confident and live life   king size kind of person but things have started to change a while  back.  Both of us are in US right now, she is originally not from here  but  only came here for grad school, we have been together since she  started  her grad school in 2017, she is an amazing person wouldn't hurt  a fly,  but would fight with the world for her friends and family. She  faced a  lot of challenges during grad school getting used to in a  different  country and adapting to a whole different education system,  its fair to  say it was a rough ride for her and I have seen her break  down and cry  multiple times over the academic difficulties she faced at  school - she  was a research assistant and was definitely under a lot  of pressure to  deliver but couldn't and she ended up losing a doctorate  offer that was  previously given to her, things got so worse during her  final semester  (due to academic pressure and expectations) she used to  have mental  breakdowns almost every day and cry incessantly and became  suicidal at  one point. That's when I suggested her to go to a doctor,  she didn't, we  fought over it and I secretly ended up contacting our  schools  counseling and psychological services and told them about her  academic  struggles and her need for help. They contacted her and she  ended up  having counseling sessions with them, she broke down in the  first  counseling session and cried, counseling didn't help her much.  Fast  forward to few months she graduated amidst all that and landed a  job in a  different state. Now we are in a long distance relationship,  she is 4  months into her new job and I am noticing the same type of  events  happening to her all over again. Here is how she puts it into  words:

""I am so tired""

""I need a relief from all this""

""Whenever I try to do anything I start spiraling""

""Why am I here I don't know, the day I figure that out I'll have a purpose""

""Constantly   constantly fighting and losing and losing, I feel like I am not   disciplined and I can't help it, I wish that I could have figured this   out when I was a bit younger so that I could have came up with a better   coping mechanism, not its gone so worse. I am just tired and done with   it""

""I feel like my life is not   organized, I don't have discipline, I am a fucking mess, I monumentally   messed up, I am trying to pull myself out of it... I don't know I am   going to cry again.""

She has told   me that she has had major sleeping disorders dating back to when she  was  12 years old and she can literally sleep anywhere any time, she has   once slept in rain, she fell asleep once standing in a public bus,   basically stressful events that happen in her life her coping mechanism   is sleeping it out. Now that coping mechanism is costing her dearly,  she  has been stressed out a bit about few projects she is working on  and  its getting hard for her to keep up to them as she finds herself  passing  out. I have been begging her to go to a doctor from last 1 year  but she  wouldn't listen to me. I have tried everything that I can  think of to  help her, but at this point I feel that its not enough and  she needs  professional help. It breaks my heart to see her become this  person from  what she was 3 years back when we first met. I do not in no  way want to  lose her as I love her dearly so much, I cannot see her go  through this  one more time. I have myself never sought any therapy or  counseling  services so I do not know what to recommend it to her or how  to handle  this. Please recommend me what would you do if you were in  my shoes, how  can I help her out of this ?

She   has never had any therapy other than the counseling sessions at the  grad  school. We both are pretty sure she has ADHD, but she never  officially  diagnosed."
481,Any tips on how to stop focusing too much on breathing?,"Back when life was normal, I was a pretty busy guy. I would sleep well, work from 9 to 5, workout and watch NBA games. How I breathe wasn't something I thought about in years. 

Now that everything is either closed and cancelled, I have too much time in hand. I have started to constantly focus  on how I breathe. My once under-control anxiety attacks came back years later since 3 weeks (when the lockdown in my town  started)  and it  manifests itself as a scary coronavirus symptom where I feel like I run out of breath/lightheaded for a couple of minutes. 

I know for a fact that this is anxiety- related because when I watch movies or play  video games , these thoughts are non-existant unless I multitask by focusing on breathing again . Surely, I can't watch movies or play games the whole day. 

What can I do to stop focusing too much  on breathing? Also, do you guys know any breathing techniques and or tricks  that would lighten the panic attacks?"
482,i want to die but i can’t bring myself to do it.,"hi, i’m not super familiar with reddit, so i hope this is the right place to post this.

i feel like i have had great opportunities and privileges in my life, yet i want to die. of course, i’ve had things happen in my life, but nothing really caused how i’m feeling. it kind of just crept up on me over the years.

it often comes in waves. sometimes i’ll have a great day (sometimes suicidal thoughts will creep in) and then it feels like most of the time i will feel down or i am thinking about suicide, but with no cause. 

i always bottle it up. i have people who offer their support, yet i push them away. i don’t want to put how i’m feeling on them. i don’t want to cause them any negative feelings. i’d rather deal with it alone than have them suffer.

but i’m beginning to not be able to deal with it anymore. yesterday i kind of just broke down. i cried 3 times. i am not one to cry, so it was kind of surprising to me. i tried sitting down to do schoolwork (i’m in high school) but i ended up just writing a suicide note. i didn’t think i would ever get to the point of writing one.

i haven’t gotten to the point to harming myself. i don’t know if i have the guts to do that. yet i still just want to die. i think about how easy it is to just swerve into a ditch or the shoulder when i’m driving. when i’m chopping fruits or vegetables, i think about how i could just slit my wrists or stab myself. i know i’ll feel some sort of regret at the last minute, so i can’t myself go actually do it.

a part of me thinks that what i’m feeling/experiencing is just an exaggeration. that i should just suck it up. that it’s nothing. but at the same time, i’m struggling making it through the day. every time i dip back into a low point, it progressively gets worse every time.

i want help so bad, and i have people here for me, yet i push their helping hands away. i talk to them less so they don’t have to worry about me. i act like everything is fine. i feel like such a bitch whenever i talk to people. i feel like it’s better that they don’t talk with me, so they don’t have to deal with me. it’s just easier to push everyone away.

i don’t really know what’s wrong with me though. i don’t want to self-diagnose, but i know that mentally i’m haven’t been doing the greatest.

i feel like i have no reason to feel like this. i have friends to talk to, a boyfriend who has also gone through the same thing who i can empathize with and who supports me, a roof over my head, and many other things i should be grateful for. it’s so selfish of me to want more - to want help when i am so privileged. i can’t bring myself to reach out and get help for myself.

this is really out of the norm for me. i’m really driven to help others, but i feel like i don’t do enough anymore. i’m pretty self-motivated and will get things done, but nowadays i’ve had so much trouble doing simple things. i’ll also rely on a lot of activities to distract myself from thinking. with covid-19 going on, it’s pretty hard to keep myself busy because i’m able to just not do anything.

i’m not really sure what i’m trying to get at, but basically my mental health is getting worse and i am thinking about dying/suicide. i feel like the only thing that’s keeping me from doing it is not being at an intense point of emotional pain, fear and my boyfriend. i know that it would be selfish to kill myself because it would hurt him too. i don’t really know what to do.

thank you for reading."

I don’t know how to deal with these thoughts and emotions because I usually like to keep to myself and not talk about my feelings to anybody."
484,Why am I crying when I have no reason to be sad?,I recently got into the program of my dreams at a college I applied too. High school doesn’t really matter anymore so I don’t have to stress about grades. My gf finally said she loved me and life’s been pretty great. Recently though I’ve just been scared and unsure like there’s a void in my life that I can’t fill.
485,I just flushed all my pills,"I just flushed all my pills down the toilet. A lot of the pills I’ve kept “just in case”. I’ve struggled with feeling like I need a pill to make me feel better. A pill to get up, a pill to relax, a pill to sleep. I had bottles of them... Adderall and Xanax being the ones I used most recently. I felt like I needed an Adderall to not eat and be disgusted with myself. I needed a Xanax to relax and sleep after I took Adderall that day. I didn’t realize I had taken 1mg of Adderall almost every day for over a month. I never took it because it made me feel good. Always to combat the feeling Adderall gave me. I’ve never abused my prescriptions by taking more than my actual dose but I’ve abused them by taking them for the wrong reasons. Adderall isn’t for losing weight, Xanax isn’t for “come downs”. I hope I don’t feel any side effects from stopping the Xanax cold turkey. But I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow so we will talk about it. I had a panic attack tonight. It was bad. I realized I’ve been lying to myself. I don’t need medications... I need to face what’s going on in my life. There’s not a magic pill, but I’ve been searching for one. I’m done. I’m over it. I’ve handed it over to God. I flushed them because they were always going to be in the back of my mind as long as they were in the back of my drawer. I needed to set my mind free. I don’t recommend anyone flushing their medications especially if you’ve been taking them for awhile since you should always taper... But a lot of my medications were just there... waiting for me to come back to them. Xanax has been hard. 1mg is the most I’ve taken in a day but my anxiety and panic disorder make me think I will die and my brain is already dependent on it or something even though I don’t actually feel that way at all. I’m so confused. I don’t know why my mind is the way it is. I don’t know why I can’t just calm down. But I know I’m not alone. Whether it was the right thing to do or not, I felt a deep sense of freedom when I flushed the toilet."
486,Rough day,"I had a very rough day. I’m really missing my best friend, and I’ve texted and called him. He responded with his dealing with a a lot at the moment. But anyway I went through my camera roll and found s pics and videos of fun times with him. I broke down and tears. Why am I like this? Am I weak for doing so?"
487,i am going to start hurting myself right now,i want to die so badly i hate living no one cares about me i need help but cant afford so i will hurt myself maybe then i can get some fucking help if im bleeding
488,Murder/suicide,"I have to kill her. 
I have no other choice. 
This has to happen.

The presence in my mind will not cease to leave me be until she is gone. 
I am tortured, visceral agony.

I am merely a useless vessel of clear instruction and violent intent.
They are playing with me.

Fucking MK-Ultra II bullshit and V2K. 

They’ll never leave me alone. 

Since we are in a simulated matrix of lies and code, why not commit murder? I have nothing to lose.
Nothing is real and I am numb.

They are making me.

But will I do it? I’d kill myself after of course. Maybe I’ll just stick to spilling my own blood? 
I’m a coward.

So commence the downward spiral, or is it the upward ascent?"
489,i keep finding myself looking back at old messages,"In highschool i was involved in a pretty large friend group but i wasn't that close to any of them because i basically spent all of my junior and senior years on the cusp of an anxiety meltdown.  Things were shitty at home and i hadn't ever seen a psychologist or therapist despite showing signs of depression and anxiety since before age 10, and by the end of senior year i was having weekly panic attacks and just overall felt like shit.  That added onto the fact i was a closeted trans guy in a conservative christian school.  So all this basically meant i was an emotionally numb shell of a person who couldn't really get close with any of the people around me despite desperately wanting to.  

Now, almost two years post highschool, I've been in therapy for over a year and a half, have a laundry list of diagnosed disorders in my record, and i'm way closer to being out of the closet then i was back then.  Life isn't perfect, i'm still stuck living under the same roof as my emotionally abusive father, i'm still pre-transition and will be for awhile, and i'm still working on getting a job and doing all the usual young adult stuff that got delayed because i had a fucking mental breakdown after graduation.  But i'm so much better than i was.  Medication and a fantastic therapist has made so much of a difference.  I feel like a person after so long of feeling empty.  I'm actually able to be *happy*.

I've changed so much for the better but now all of the people i wish i had gotten to know in highschool don't recognize me anymore.  The shell that they knew finally became a person but now they just... don't know me anymore.  I haven't talked to some of them in months, and i'm not sure if i should.  I'm in two different group chats with these people and i see the messages but dont interact because i feel like a stranger.  To make matters worse, I've got a total of two friends at the moment, the one friend from highschool who was also closeted that i reconnected with, and my current partner who lives a nine hour drive away. 

I'm just.  I'm so lonely and it fucking sucks.  And these people that i wish i had connected with are right there, one message away, but i can't do it.  I'm a complete stranger to them now, and i think i'd just be hurting myself by trying to reconnect, especially since a lot of them are still stuck in a toxic conservative mindset that did a lot of damage on my mental health.  I've struggled with making new friendships, i have aquaintences from college classes and people i see regularly but nobody i can hang out with and share my interests with.  I know i need to try harder to make new friends, and i'm working on that, but friendships take time and i am so fucking tired of being lonely.  Lonely's been my constant state of being practically since i was in kindergarten and i am so sick of it.  I want people to care about and listen to, i want to be out of the closet and treated like a guy, i want to just hang out with friends doing random shit like an average college student.  And now i'm just rambling so i'll end it with this:

What do i do? Do i reach out to them and reintroduce myself? Do i risk coming out to them? I have a feeling it's a terrible idea but i'm also worried that if i don't take a chance and talk to them i'll regret it for the rest of my life.

TL;DR:  Had a mental breakdown after highschool and lost touch with a lot of people that I wish I'd gotten to know better.  Now after a lot of therapy and a lot of growth as a person, I have a chance to reach out and talk to them again, but I'm not sure if any of them would even want to reconnect because of how much I've changed since they last knew me.  Do I just let the chance go and possibly avoid a lot of hurt, or do I try to reconnect and potentially gain a few friends back?"
490,One thing I learnt today / Never give in to your obsessions.,"I suffer from anorexia nervosa and mild anxiety and depression.
I have an intense fear of gaining weight and also I have been suffering from mild anxiety and depressive phases.
A few of my obsessions include frequent washing of hands, restricting my calorie intake and checking things againa and again (if the window is closed, what's my weight? Did I do that or that and so on)
But today, I decided to take a plunge and not listen and give in to my obsessions and OCD thoughts.
Yes, it was tough at first but I recited God's name again and again while stopping myself from going back into the obsessive hand washing and etc. 
I felt utter anxiety but later, I felt better and now a bit even more. 
I feel I can do and not give in to these things again with less anxiety and issues.
First time it sure will be tough but that's the thing I learnt today, it will be better with time and not giving in can make you feel better later on.
I wish my health improves soon enough and all the anxiety vanishes but since I didn't let the OCD take over me, I feel a bit better :)"
491,Getting frustrated Dr.Google cant help,"When I'm in that first phase of sleep (i think its the first?) Aka when you are half way awake and half way asleep, I keep getting these almost nightmare things almost everynight.  Like I'll be almost asleep but then I get a scary image/clip of a face or demented being and I jolt fully awake again from being almost asleep.  It keeps happening repeatedly until I finally fall fully asleep, probably either from exhaustion or smth else, idk if that makes sense.  I had been researching on Google about what this is occasionally, for the past few weeks and I still havent figured out wtf this is which is frustrating me.  It doesnt seem to happen to anyone else i know and I've been having these things for a few years at least.  Any ideas would be appreciated"
492,Please I need help,"Hello all who read this, I just want advice to get rid of this. For the past 5 weeks I have been over thinking things nonstop. I feel like nothing is real anymore like it's an allusion, but I know that everything is real. I keep questioning everything in life and I can't live properly any more it feels like non of action lns are controlled by me and that my body is on autopilot and I'm just stuck here with these thoughts. I would really appreciate for any help please."
493,Emotionally tumultuous and my husband is making it worse?,"My husband thinks I don't deserve him and has told me that he's not attracted to me anymore. The former of these he revealed to me today while I am still suffering extreme negative emotions from withdrawal of an antidepressant I was taking (which I stopped taking because it was contributing to me being less attractive). I asked him if his job (working with the mentally unstable) made him incapable of dealing with my issues, and he said yes. Having just finished my favorite show (yes, this did serve to make me even more depressed, thanks) where the message was ""depend on the ones you love when you can no longer help yourself,"" I'm sitting here crying and crying... am I right to be so torn up? He wasn't rude giving me any of this info, he simply was telling me the truth."
494,My mom,"So basically for as far back as I remember my mom has always had a bad temper, she would yell throw things around call me a bunch of stuff and just always try to put me down in any situation. Family outings she would throw the blame on me for doing something wrong, like spill liquid or outright just yell at me informer pf friend sand strangers, then she would be all happy again talking to friends. I’m now 16 and all of that stuff has really fucked with my brain so whenever I do something right or make a minor achievement my mom would praise me, in response I would get really angry and feel like anything I do that relates to her is meaningless. I don’t have a proper relationship with her and I’m just waiting for a time for her to abuse us in a physical sense so I can just beat her up. I’m barely holding it together."
495,Having a hard time.,"I don’t know where else to post this, hope it’s ok here. My husband, myself, and our son just moved across town and not even 2 weeks into living in the new place it burned down. We lost everything, and we are blue collar paycheck to paycheck people, no savings. My husband has been told to stay home from work for right now (he will get paid 75% of his pay), but he’s bipolar and I think not being on his set schedule is taking a toll on his mental health. On the flip side I’m working and the constant human interaction is giving me anxiety (fear of contracting COVID-19). We just got into an argument and it felt like we hadn’t argued like that in such a long time. I hated it. We just experienced a serious trauma, our poor son lost all his toys, books, and games, he’s not in school. Everything is just a big cluster fuck and I am trying so hard to keep it together. I’m just going to cry myself to sleep."
496,Coronavirus Blues,"I’m having a really difficult time adjusting to being quarantined. For some background, I am a teacher so my routine has me around hundreds of people every day. I also am a very social person and like to spend time with people. Unfortunately for me, I broke my leg back in February and was forced to stay home from work for a couple weeks so I could have surgery and it could start to heal. Just when I thought I was almost ready to go back to work, my school shut down. So now I am working from home, which is ok, but it means I am away from people for even longer. So far it’s been 5 weeks and I’m going insane. It doesn’t help that I am going through withdrawal right now due to prescription opioids which makes it insanely difficult to sleep or that my leg is really uncomfortable, often with sharp shooting pains. I do currently live with my fiancé, but he is deemed essential and is often at work for long hours. When he is home, he is usually sleeping because of this so I feel alone all the time. To top off all this crazy bullshit, our wedding that I have been planning for years may have to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. I know I could have it a lot worse and I could literally be dying right now, but I just want the world to go back to normal. All of these issues and this stress is eating me from the inside. I really don’t know if my mental health will survive this virus, even if I do. Does anyone have advice on staying positive? 

(Side note: I cannot go very far because I am in an apartment upstairs. So walking around outside is not really possible. Also, my leg is broken and I can’t put weight on it yet so I couldn’t get up and go anywhere even if I wanted to.)"
497,I feel so insecure that I have nightmares (25/f),"Hi everyone. When I like someone and I have seen them giving someone else more attention in a flirty or romantic way, I feel really insecure about it.

I dated a guy in university who used to like another friend of mine in Freshmen and Sophomore year. We started dating in Junior year and even though she was no more a part of our lives (due to a fallout we all had towards the end of Sophomore year), I had recurring nightmares. I would dream that we were in situations and he chose her over me. It drove me insane.

Now this is happening again. I like a guy at work and we initially hit it off, but then he started flirting with another colleague of ours. And even though we aren't even dating, it has affected me so much that I am having similar nightmares about it. I woke up in sweats last night and I don't know how to get out of this.

Background about me: My parents hate each other. My father is a terrible person who feels nothing for his wife or children. Basically I've grown up seeing a very fucked up couple first-handedly."
498,Could I be a psychopath?,"I am a 17 year old female and have felt like I could be a psychopath. I have felt this way for the past year, and slowly feel myself becoming worse and worse. I do not really care for others, and if I get really angry I feel like I could seriously harm someone who is “close to me”. I don’t get that sad when people die, all I think is that its not me so I don’t care. I have crazy thoughts that people are NOT supposed to have. I know you guys aren’t therapist or doctors but if you could try and just give some advice with what it might be would be great. I have been to 3 psychiatrist over my lifetime about anxiety, but now its not just anxiety, its anger as well. Mood swings to where I can be happy one minute and wanting to hurt someone the next if one little thing goes wrong. I do not know what to do. I don’t want to one day just snap and something to happen where my whole life will be ruined. So I am coming here, for just a little advice of what is wrong with me."
499,Insanity again,"I'm dealing with some insanity, I do not mean to say absurd things.  Blasphemy, scrutiny or insults.  I try to maintain my composure but it is aggravating at times.  I am trying to reason with my experiences with humor and all.   I don't just disrespect people usually.

It's very frustrating as I'm typical Insulted and taunted by people. You inevitably lose control, and people just tell you to chill out.

So.many peoples craven behaviour is hard.  I'm typically confrontational and I'm the one that's wrong when I get upset.


I'll try to put some thing formal together at a better time."
500,How to keep it together till I’m available to see a therapist? Any tips?,"I need help, asap. But in-person sessions are not a thing right now where I am. I can’t do them online because I need an evaluation first. 

Anyways, my mental health is awful. I’m having episodes constantly where I lose full control. I’m scared because when I get in these mindsets, I’m not thinking straight at all. It’s like fight or flight overcomes me. I’m not suicidal but when I have an episode, I’m so beyond irrational that suicide comes to my head as a way to escape it all. I don’t want to end up hurting myself or other when I’m freaking out. I just can’t control myself during these episodes. I need to keep it together just a little longer,,,"

502,Looking for advice or to vent?,I’m scared I’m going to do something to hurt myself. I’m stuck at home with my family during quarantine and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’ve been away at college all year and haven’t been home for more than a night in a long time. I forgot how unbearable it is to live with my mom. Idk if it’s the typical Asian mom that’s always strict but deep down love you but she keeps yelling and screaming. For example she spent 20 minutes yelling at me to go to sleep while I was trying to finish an assignment. I’m frustrated because I’m a grown adult who really doesn’t need a bed time. I considered smashing my glass lamp and cutting myself to just make it stop. I don’t know what to do since I’m stuck here until August. I’ve been doing so much better mentally and emotionally away at college but I can feel myself regressing. I don’t know what to do.
503,I need help,"As you’ll see from my previous post I’ve suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder for a while now, a long with depression and anxiety. I need to know something, I can’t stop touching the back of my external occipital protuberance convinced that it’s moved and it makes me feel unwell, or when there’s a crack there I panic. I touch it easily every 5 minutes of the day until I’m sleeping. What the heck can I do with my hands to stop them from going to my head cause it’s seriously causing a problem now from the repetitive trauma to it as it’s been two months now I’ve been doing it everyday every 5 minutes. 3 times at once and then again 5 minutes later"
504,Me and my friend group,"I feel like I’m drifting apart from my friends.
For context I am a highschooler.
Of course we don’t hangout because of corona right now but we rarely do anyways. My friend group is basically partitioned into smaller sections of closer friends and I feel like im in none of them. Everyone has their place you know? Even my best friend of 10 years pretty much removed himself from the group. I always feel so fucking sad for no reason when I see my friends doing stuff without me. It’s stupid I know, but I can’t shake it. Sorry...I just had to get this out somewhere, probably gonna delete it in minutes."
505,I Need Advice,"Trigger Warning: suicide, physical &amp; sexual abuse
I need help. 
My family recently moved away from our abuser (my moms husband, my stepdad, my siblings father) he molested me when I was 10 (am now 15) and beat my mom for like 10 years. He got in a car accident (karma) and my mom has been letting him visit our house, eat her food and use her and sleep in her bed. I don’t understand this because he put our family in so much pain. Because of the corona Virus, my mom wants to move to where he’s living because theres not as much cases. This means I’ll have to be with him every day until the virus ends probably. At this point, it hurts so much that I feel like there’s no option other then to kill myself. I’ve been self harming for a while and it’s the only coping skill I’ve kept up with. 
My mom says to ‘forget’ about what he did and that he’s there but it’s not that easy. I don’t really know why I’m sharing this, but if you took the time to read it... thank you."
506,This is long and I'm sorry,"I had the best roommate freshman year of college. I'll call her Sophie. We were both similar in so many ways. So many things in our lives paralleled, from our childhood interests to our favorite foods and everything in between. We also shared similar mental health problems. We both struggled with severe OCD as kids, and depression and self harm in high school. The only thing we didn't have in common was that she had a boyfriend since high school, and I entered college having never even been kissed. Because it's semi-important later on in the story, Sophie's boyfriend was a pretty nice guy. He went to college very far away from us, and honestly, both people in the relationship had very unrealistic expectations for each other.

 Anyway, Sophie and I had such a good experience freshman year, we decided to room together sophomore year too. And the icing on the cake was that our mutual friend/acquaintance, Bridget (again not her real name), was going to be living on the floor below us. So cut to sophomore year. I'm in all my same clubs and activities, same group of friends, plus now Sophie, Bridget and I are becoming close. Bridget and I even had a class together which was fun. Sophie only had three friends outside of me and Bridget. They were all boys, which was a point of contention with her boyfriend, whom Sophie had broken up with for a week at the beginning of the summer and then immediately gotten back together with. 

I hadn't had a great summer either. I had a job and an internship all summer and hardly got to see my friends from home. Plus, my mom and I had gotten into a huge argument before I moved back into my dorm and she refused to take me back to school. 

I had started seeing a therapist my second semester freshman year to talk about the problems I had with my mother that eventually lead to that breaking point. I had also started self harming again freshman year because I was very depressed. Sophie had encouraged me to see a therapist and get help. She offered me so much comfort. There were hugs and tears on both ends. We helped each other when we were down. Sophie offered to hold onto my scissors that I self harmed with so I wouldn't be tempted to cut. And it helped so much. I went months without cutting because of it. It felt so wonderful to have someone who knew that I cut and didn't judge me for it. Not only did she not judge me for it, she actively helped me stay safe more than anyone else. 

Back to sophomore year. I was cutting a lot again because of my whole mommy problem situation. I was hiding it from Sophie because I didn't want her to know I was doing it again. Sophie, Bridget and I were doing well though. We were having fun staying up late talking about celebrities and doing homework. Bridget wasn't the type of person I would usually hang out with. Sometimes when she spoke I got flashbacks to the mean girls in high school. She would nonchalantly tell me how she bullied other girls in middle school and high school. And I saw some of these behaviors in her, but I figured she was older and wiser. She also had drug and alcohol problems in high school and her mother committed suicide when she was young. I didn't think it was fair to judge her for her behavior, since she'd been through a lot. And she wasn't always mean, of course. She is genuinely one of the smartest and most charismatic people I have ever met in my whole life.  

When Sophie finally decided to break up with her long distance boyfriend, Bridget and I were by her side. Encouraging her and wiping away the tears. We told her it was for the best. And even better for Sophie, one of her guy friends had just professed his love for her. Not three days after she broke up with her ex, she got together with her now boyfriend. I was extremely skeptical. In retrospect, I should have been more supportive, but I saw how hurt she was by her ex. I saw her mental health was going down the drain. I knew how much she sought the love of boys for validation. I knew if I had a boyfriend I'd be doing the same thing as her, but I knew it wasn't healthy. I also knew her eating disorder was getting worse. She was eating less and less. I tried to get her to get help, but she was resistant. I didn't push it because there were certain foods she would eat frequently enough and I was hoping her new boyfriend would encourage her to eat more or help her if she needed it. 

Soon I was barely seeing Sophie once a day. She slept over at her boyfriend's place most nights. I was never a big fan of her guy friends, including her boyfriend, because they had always been cold toward me. They didn't like me. They never invited me to hang out or do anything with them. They were all in love with Sophie. I mean she's gorgeous and smart and fun to be around. I'm sure if they had seen me in the same way I would have felt differently. And I'm sure jealousy played a role in me not liking them as well, but the feeling was mutual between us. Now I was more upset with her boyfriend because I felt like he was taking my best friend away from me. 

Bridget tried to be supportive of both me and Sophie, but I could tell I had vented about my feelings toward Sophie's situation to her too much. She felt like I was trying to divide us, but I really just needed someone to talk to. One night Bridget left me alone at a party and I had a panic attack. Not really her fault, I mean it was kind of rude of her to leave me, but she's not responsible for my anxiety. I texted Sophie, hoping somehow she would be in our room waiting for me with a pint of Ben and Jerry's and a hug. At the very least, I had hoped when I told her I was having a panic attack, she would come home and work through it with me. She didn't. 

But the next morning I got a knock on the door from Bridget. She was pissed to say the least. Sophie hadn't come home from her boyfriend's apartment yet. Bridget cornered me in my room, and I'm not exaggerating here, she screamed at me for over an hour straight. She told me I wasn't allowed to speak until she was finished. She told me I was judgmental and insecure. She told me I was a shitty person. She told me that I was a bad friend to Sophie. I couldn't take it. I bawled the whole time she yelled at me. I tried to apologize to her, to tell her I would try better in the future. She wouldn't hear it. As Bridget left my room, Sophie walked in. I apologized to Sophie for how I treated her. I told her how I was feeling and she told me she forgave me. She even apologized to me for not spending enough time in our room. I thought everything was okay. 

The next day I tried texting Bridget to apologize again. She scolded me and told me I didn't get it. I asked her to explain it to me and she wouldn't. She blocked me on all social media. She stopped responding to my texts. She told my RA I was in trouble and I had to talk to an on-call school therapist. I felt like I was the worst person on planet Earth. Like all I was capable of was ruining other people's lives. 

A few days later I got a message from Sophie telling me we needed to have a mediated conversation with our RA and our dorm supervisor. I didn't want to do it. And I didn't understand why she was suddenly mad at me. When she was actually in the room, she wouldn't even look at me, none the less speak with me. We had the meeting with the RA and supervisor. Sophie bawled her eyes out. Saying that she couldn't deal with my self harm or depression. I didn't bring up any of the things she had put me through. I didn't bring up her eating disorder. It wasn't fair to her. I felt like I was being attacked. I was already depressed from Bridget telling me how awful I was and Sophie ignoring me. And now my friends were telling everyone the personal details of my mental health struggles, when I really didn't want to share. And I was seeing a therapist at this time, I was trying to take care of myself and make myself better. I really was trying. I just needed a minute to be sad. Sophie sobbed and said I was making her out to be the bad guy and that she was thinking about moving out because she couldn't handle me anymore. She said that when she had held my scissors for me freshman year that it was too much for her. Even though she was the one who offered to take them, I never asked her to do it. The dorm supervisor told me I needed a new therapist because obviously the one I had wasn't helping much. Which wasn't the truth. 

After that meeting, Sophie said she was going to stay at her boyfriend's for the weekend. A week or two passed by and I was basically living by myself. Sophie was never home. I was depressed and angry and it was one of the loneliest times in my life. I was still self harming, though not as much as before. I lived in fear that Sophie was going to move out on me. And most of all, I just wanted her to be my friend again. I wanted to have movie nights like we did freshman year. I just wanted to feel wanted and loved again. 

I received an email later that week telling me I was offered a position as an RA in another building. It was my dream. I wanted the RA job since freshman year, and the only reason I was fine after not getting the offer the first time around, was because I knew I had Sophie. But Sophie obviously didn't want to be my roommate anymore. She had threatened to move out. So I figured I would do the hard part for her. I took the job. She told me it was for the best, since we hadn't been getting along. She offered to help me pack my stuff, but she never followed through. She was always at her boyfriend's so I knew she wouldn't be around to help. She wasn't even there the day I took my last bag out. 

I moved into my new dorm. I had my own room. Sophie texted me once to ask how my move went. I said it was fine and she never responded. Bridget stopped sitting with me in class. She wouldn't even look me in the eyes. Sophie would post pictures of the two of them going out and having fun together. And I sat alone in my room looking after 35 freshmen. I made new friends in my RA position, and I was becoming happy again. I was spending more time with my other friends. I was cutting a lot less. Life was looking a little more bright, but every time I saw Bridget in class I wanted to throw up. She joined one of my clubs that she knew I was in, so I was seeing her even more often. And every time, there was a knot in my stomach and my heart started to race. Every time I thought about her or Sophie, the anxiety became overwhelming. 

Sophie sent me a text over Christmas wishing me happy holidays. I wished her the same. I sent her a happy birthday text the next month. She said thanks. But that's all we've spoken since. This girl was a sister to me, and that's all we have now. Four lousy texts between us. 

I still follow Sophie on social media. Mostly in the hopes that one day we'll be friends again. And horribly, because I want to see what her and Bridget are up to. Today, she posted a picture of her and Bridget. It said ""Happy Birthday to the best roommate and the most amazing friend in the world"". So haha, the jokes on me. The minute I moved out, Bridget must have moved in. 

The post itself would have been enough to put me over the edge. To give me a gush of anxiety. But finding out that Sophie replaced me so quickly was a big blow. The fact that I'm just a distant memory to her now hurts more than I think she'll ever know. And I'm a shitty person, because deep inside, I wanted her to get assigned some random roommate. I wanted her to feel some of the pain I felt. I'm glad she didn't have to suffer, and I'm glad she's happy. She has the boyfriend of her dreams. A best friend she loves. She never had to move out of her room or get a random roommate. I hope she's happier than she's ever been before. 

I'm hurt. I'm definitely hurting. I've been hurting for months since this happened. I'm happy I'm an RA now and I have some good friends. I'm on better terms with my mom and we get along very well now. I had to stop seeing my therapist right after I got the RA position because it was too expensive and I had gone so frequently, my parents were starting to think something was up. They know Sophie and I had a falling out, but they don't know why. I guess I don't really know why either. It all seems kind of dumb in retrospect. And originally, I had felt like this was all Sophie and Bridget's faults. I thought all the pain was because they abandoned me. But, I'm starting to feel like I was the shitty friend Bridget had claimed I was. I'm starting to think I've deserved all the pain, depression, anxiety, and self harm I've gone through. 

So, I don't know why I'm writing this. If I'm being honest, deep down inside, I want someone to tell me I wasn't a shit friend. That I don't deserve the things that have happened to me and I have the right to feel upset. But, I don't know that any of that is true. I guess it would feel good just to know someone knows my story. I want someone to know I'm struggling. And with everything that's happening in the world right now, my petty problems seem pointless. I really don't deserve help or attention or advice from anyone. But I really do want it. 

If someone out there has read this far, thank you. Thank you for making me feel better. You've done more than I could ever ask."
507,"16, ADHD and struggling with school","i havent been diagnosed with ADHD because i didnt really wanna add any more burden to my family and maybe I dont wanna admit that I actually have ADHD. I have major depression and GAD for 2 years now. However, I cant really keep it to myself anymore and I think Im going insane. I cant even go to a therapist and ask about it because of the lockdown. December 2019 last year, I was given a leave from school until January 2020. Its a big school in my country and I have a scholarship so its really hard there. Due to my leave, I missed a lot. I tried to catch up with the things I missed when I came back on February. But even then, I was constantly absent due to my depressive episodes which lasts for days and I can't even get out of bed. Now, its April and while we are in lockdown, we have online classes. My teachers are trying to reach me and gave me works to do. I was given a deadline on two requirements days ago and I havent submitted it yet. But it was really really hard for me. I cant even start doing the task. Before doing it and just thinking of doing it, I panic a lot and my brain goes bersek and I just cry for hours. What I do to distract myself? Ive been hyperfocused on a video game thats all I do for the whole day. Its like an escape from reality its such a huge relief. But when I am out of the game, my heart hurts so much and I just cry and panic I dont know. I get severe mood swings. Its like Im being slapped with the reality that I actually am in. Sorry I know Im being selfish and a coward about this. My teachers messaged me earlier and my mom asking about the requirements I didnt pass on the deadline and I dont know how to tell them because theyve been very supportive of me ever since and helped me through things and I am so ashamed this is what Im doing to them now. Even if I get to start to do a task like readings, I tend to get distracted a lot. My brain just gets very noisy it keeps talking and its so difficult for me to focus. Whatever I do, I cant get myself start a task. I cant focus on one task and get it finished. I know ppl will mostly say JUST do it. I know that Ive always been telling myself that but Im the fear is eating me up I do not know what to do. Im sorry this is all over the place I dont know if anyone will read or understand what Im saying. Maybe I just wanna know if Im not the only one who suffers from this kind of .. whatever this is"

509,I’ve been feeling shit and have no idea what to do. Help.,"So basically, I’m the kind of person who has no real life friends. Where do I start with my scenario. I’m 16, and I know that there’s a lot to life but right now I really need help with this. 

So there was this girl I really liked who was a great friend of mine. After she got to know back in November that I did, she ghosted me, then apologised for what she did before cutting me off without reason and asked me to not act oblivious to what I had done (I have no fucking idea about what to do). She blocked me from everywhere after that. I spent all of December to February thinking about what I might’ve done and when, in March, I was finally getting over it, she called randomly and after a bit of weird chatter she said “you know what happened. Right?” “No” “X didn’t tell you?” “No” then when I asked what happened, she said it was a long story and that she’ll tell me later. She blocked me again after that. Now I think I’m back to December, if not worse 🤦🏻‍♂️.

Second thing, one of the people I know started spreading rumours about me dating someone. One of my close friends who was also close friends with the rumour spreader, told me. I decided to confront the person who was spreading the rumour. This strained my friend’s friendship with the rumour spreader and her group, as well as, with me. She’s very pissed and disappointed at me and I don’t know what to do. 

These two things have had me feeling like shit for a week now. I feel nauseous all the time, don’t feel like eating, always tired and no motivation to do anything. I know that I can’t do anything about either situation now but some comforting words might help. Have a great day everyone :)"
510,sitting in a pool of sad and I need some advice :(,I’ve been home since my university shut down a couple weeks ago. My best friend lives in town and since I’ve been here we hung out everyday. everything seemed normal until the other day. I logged onto her spam account and she wrote this really mean post saying she was done with me and tired of living in my shadow. I felt really hurt and tried asking if she was okay and what I could’ve done to fix it. She didn’t answer any of my calls. Now she’s hanging with our mutual friends and it sucks because my anxiety is telling me that they must hate me too. I don’t know what I did. I’ve just been myself and I’ve been nothing but kind since I’ve been here. I’ve been running through my head every little action I could’ve done that would’ve caused a problem in such a short amount of time. I just keep hating every part of myself because I just don’t understand what I did wrong. Im trying to tell myself that someone who ends a friendship like that is immature and probably not a good friend in the 1st place but it’s just really hard to not beat up on myself. Anyways guess I’m just asking for advice and fishing for some love. ✨
511,"Touch... I realized tonight, I miss physical touch. TW: brief mention of past trauma","Sometimes, it's the little things you forget about that have such a huge impact on your life... At least in my case.

I have been going through a lot recently.  Lots of deleted suicide watch posts, etc. 

My best friend lives 300 miles (482km) away, soon to be about 1000 miles. (1609km) and aside from him, I have no one I have been able to allow to touch me.  Currently working on getting out of a bad (not abusive.. Just bad) relationship and I don't touch him at all. Actually, I cant even look at him.  Waiting for this current world situation to pass so that I can safely leave him..

Once, years ago, before I was completely burdened by PTSD and depression, I went to school for massage therapy (never practiced after because of sexual trauma shortly after graduating, among other things.) But in the school I learned how important good physical contact is, even for those who are not touchy feely.  I have never been much of a hugger, but when I love someone and can actually (rarely) trust them, I need touch. A back scratch, a short cuddle, foot rub, or mostly a shoulder to cry on.

I realized today that I have not had genuine touch in a very long time.  My cat is at least something.. But God, do I miss my friend.  I hate not having someone I trust enough to touch me.  It has been way too long and I feel very alone."
512,Just a lot of little troubling thought I'm having,"1. Do people really understand other people's emotions? 

2. I guess so because I emapthize with people too, but why can they describe and place emotions on others that I can't? 

3. Why am do I feel so wrong? Like I'm in the wrong place and the wrong time, but every time It try to leave something good comes my way, and I have to stay (ex lower tuition)

4. Why does my mom make me feel weird about not being able to multi task? I can't. Please stop asking me to. 

5. Will I be able to go to the gym again? I miss it so much. 

6. I wish I would have been quarantined alone. I don't want to be with my parents right now.

7. I don't want to be weak. Please don't see me as weak, redditors. 

8. I can't join the coast guards and I really wanted to. All my friends are going into the military and I can't join them and I feel like a faliure. 

9. I wish I would have had the childhood I (and every kid ever) deserved. I would have liked true boy's childhood with friends and everything. 

10. I wish my dad didn't call me a girl all the time and hung out with me like he does my brothers. 

11. Why can't I make eye contact with my dad? I can do it for most other people, usually. 

12. I am worried about the future and what it means to me. I honestly cannot see a future with me in it. I don't want to die. I am not suicidal, but if you asked me to imagine my future, I couldn't. 

13. I wish I knew what was wrong with me. I think there's something wrong with me, but I'm not sure what I'm worried I have a hidden mental Illness that I don't know about and everyone else does but is too scared to tell me about. 

14. I am very null and don't want to do anything. It's not sad. It's bull and I miss the gym because that's when I didn't feel null."
513,"[M16] I already take meds but I depersonalize on a daily basis, what can I do?","Title.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, ODD and clinical depression.

I take Adderall and Sertraline daily in the mornings  to treat my ADHD and Depression.

A problem I have had on an almost daily basis for the past few weeks, is I depersonalize. This tends to happen when I think about stressful topics (As that’s a trigger for the problem). But now it just occurs on a daily basis (usually at night) without a lot of reason, and it’s agony to be stuck in that state of mind until I end up going to bed to reset the timer, to when tomorrow night I’ll inevitably have another “episode”.

I’m already going to therapy, and I’m not sure if this is a side effect of growing up with the medications/conditions I have, or it’s a possible foreshadowing of a much bigger mental health issue I have. I’m honestly tearing up just writing this because I really don’t know what to do, or how to move forward when this has just become the norm."

I think I have a lot of mental disorders I don’t want to self  diagnoses but I really do believe that I have more than one mental disorder 

 when I was in 7th grade (I’m (15f) in hs now ) I was pretty sure I was depressed looking back on it now I’m certain that I was . Anyways my sister could tell that there was something wrong so she told my parents that I was depressed and they just said “ she’s just moody ,it’s just a phase “ anyways I just don’t understand how you can see your child in pain ( my mom saw my cuts ) and not do anything about it

So I’m 29yo female. I have two boys 7 and 2. I am REALLY REALLY struggling to cope/deal with them. I come home from a full time job, pick the kids up and do the night time routine. Some times my partner is home some times not, depending on work. As soon as I pick them up they don’t listen, they are loud and drive me absolutely batshit crazy. I’m angry, resentful and self destructive all of the time. 

I’m currently finding that I HATE being around them, I don’t want to do anything for them, feed them etc. I still do as I know I have too. How ever I would rather lay on a bed of rusty, piping hot razors than be a mum/responsible adult. 

The covid lockdown has exacerbate these feelings. I no longer have respite from them in the form of family helping out or being able to take them any where to wear them out. 

I spoke to my psych about it and said maybe my antidepressants need to be upped. She said she “could drug me to the eye balls and it won’t help at the moment”. I see a psychiatrist once a fortnight.

521,Am I making excuses for myself or is something else going on?,"Hi everyone,

A little background, I’m a Canadian (Ontario) second year university student in a moderately challenging biological major. I have a lot of big ambitions and the intellect to get there but find my self struggling to keep up academically. In high school I was the kid that could just go to class and skip the homework but end up with the high 90 mark so I really never found a grove for studying. 

Since starting University all of these problems have surfaced, I’ve been diagnosed with situational depression on two separate occasions in the past year. I know the work ethic is an issue and I often leave things til the last minute and then once I sit down (slightly panicked) I get it done in one sitting or decide I won’t do well with the time I’ve left for myself and just give up. I also have struggled with sleeping for the past year, often staying up for 24+ hours until I pass out from exhaustion (melatonin does nothing for me). I really struggle to keep up with every day commitments, even ones that I’m excited for. I especially struggle with going to class or some days even opening my laptop to do work. I’m always late if I do show up. I make schedules, lists, plans to keep myself organized but I’m only able to stick to it for a week at most (even that is hard) and then I revert to old habits. I genuinely want to do well but find it takes huge amounts of energy to just sit myself down to work on something as small as a discussion post, always racing to the last minute. Overall I have a hard time regulating myself and my time. 

I have tried vyvanse a few times(not through a prescription) and found it worked well for me, I didn’t feel daunted by the idea of doing work and was able to sit and focus like never before. 

Anytime I bring this stuff up to my parents they insinuate I’m making excuses.

Is this all a combination of poor work ethic and insomnia working in a vicious cycle? Am I looking for excuses for myself? Or should I try finding some better resources (if so, what?)? 

Any advice at this point is greatly appreciated."
522,I don’t know what I have,"I guess the best way to describe what I feel, is a near constant state of being on edge, constant intrusive thoughts, constant overthinking, constant dissociation, constant feeling of worthlessness, no real enjoyment of anything, insomnia, dpdr, awful anxiety attacks, irritability, scary thoughts, no emotions. 

Idk what’s wrong with me. No medicine I take seems to help, except for xanax, but I can’t take that because I refuse to get addicted to it again. 

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Weed helped for a while, but I think it started to make it worse."
523,An Interesting Title,"I dont know what's happening anymore. I cant tell if I'm overreacting or I'm lucky that I dissociate 24/7. I dont know WHY I DISSOCIATE 24/7.

The funny part is I dont even think its psychosis but the doctors are the smart ones right? I doubt that. I dont have any delusions at all. I only see hallucinations, and the prominent ones only happen maybe once a month. I only have a few psychosis symptoms. I am becoming worse, uhm.. what's that called? Idk I'll say it later. I'm starting to have to break away from the important people. I want to leave everyone so I stop hurting them. OH my personality is getting a lot worse. I dont take people's feelings in consideration, but also sometimes I ONLY take their feelings in consideration. I dont trust people, and I feel like they lie more. Help?

Part of me is like yeah you’re gay. Other part is like okay whatever. The person is a girl and I know if they were a guy they would get called gay. Seems like a shit double standard.

You can check my post history. It was extremely bad reddiquette, unproductive and super selfish. And I didn’t even have the decency to respond to all the comments yet (I will, I must.) 

Anyway it’s true. I have posted the same post, asking for advice about a situation with this guy, in 20 different subs. That is not a hyperbole. You might have seen my post. Probably you did.

I’m afraid there’s something very wrong with me. I wish I wasn’t like this. I’m not proud of it at all. I don’t even have a therapist. My regular doc prescribed my psych meds and she knows nothing about my mental health."
526,I completed my first year at university!,"As a male rugby player the expectation is high, coming into a university setting is meant to be the making of you, that you become the best of the best, and that nothing can stand in your way.  Living with mental health issues makes this ideal borderline unachievable. I am unable to motivate myself, the smallest task feels like an accomplishment, however from the outside in it doesnt look like that. Im a happy, if not socially awkward 18 year old, pretty standard stuff from a uni standpoint, however trying to reach that expectation is almost impossible, seeing that getting out of bed and talking to uni mates ive convinced myself hate me are tasks that I could spend days overcoming at a time. Because of this, the idea of finishing a year of university being an achievement is mind boggling to them. I cant count the number of times ive considered and made moves towards dropping out or a lot worse. I dont really know how to write this kind of stuff, as its not exactly what im used to. I guess i just wanted to see if anyone feels the same kind of external pressure, and what they did to overcome it; how they reach out to people who seem to care (movember and other mental health campaigns are big in the club) but dont know what its like to get help, and selfishly, i guess such for someone who can relate or even be proud of me for finishing this year.

•Nervous tics whenever I think about intestines (related to past trauma)

After ending I tried to quickly finish eating and thought that I didn't really wanna think those things. At times , It would   talk about darker things and sometimes it scares me.

537,i think i was abused in the psych ward,"trigger warning!

last year when i was still 12 i was admitted to a child psych ward after attempting suicide. there were many problems there. i live in mississippi in the usa. i think i was abused

1) there were no therapists we would talk to just 1 on 1 at the ward which is really strange. 

2) the first day i was there they kept telling me things like that it was “my fault” i was there

3) a boy the same age as me would harass me and they wouldnt do anything about it. be would make sexual comments about me. 

4) i would cry for hours everyday and would receive no emotional support. actually the nurses would yell at me and tell me if i kept crying i would have to stay longer.

5) i literally tried to kill myself on multiple occasions and they didnt notice????!!!! i would cover my mouth and try to cease my breathing in hopes i would die

6) this one is more just in april. the nurse would flirt with my older sister who was 18 every time she would come drop stuff off for me. he was married and had kids...

7) twice i was crying too loud at night and woke up another patient and instead of comforting me they put me in “time away” which was an empty room with a police officer. 

these things have caused me trauma. i believe i have developed symptoms of PTSD"
538,"I lost a family member this week to the same mental illnesses I have, and I am terrified","Hi guys,  
My aunt took her own life this week. I found out today that she struggled with OCD, which I found out I have (just within the line of the severe category) in July 2019. She also had realllllly severe depression that was treatment resistant, and was in and out of inpatient all of the time. In terms of my recovery journey, I am only in the early stages really, given that it hasn't even been 12 months yet. My depression and anxiety has been around since 2011ish, but it wasn't severe. I worked and studied mostly fine. While I had suicidal thoughts, I was never actually close to taking my life that I recall. Self harm was an issue. I am a little more depressed now, which is secondary depression because of my OCD. It's still not intolerable, though. 

I don't want to die. I don't want to waste away to this disorder. I don't want to break my family's hearts. I don't want to suffer for many years. I don't want any of this. I am scared that I will feel the same desperation and leave my family behind. She was in so, so much pain, and I don't begrudge my aunt's choice at all. I am glad she's at peace. But there was a lot of life left for her. She was only 50. I don't want the same fate for me and I'm really scared. I know people will say to just not kill myself, but my aunt wasn't in her right mind and it took a lot of illness to get to that point.   


I'm young. I'm not as sick as she was. She also grew up in an era where mental health help was pretty hard to come by and not well studied. I have already been in therapy previously and am in therapy for my OCD now, as well as trying medications. So i'm on the right track. My therapist thinks I have good odds of recovering because i'm only 24 and committed to therapy. So the logical part of me is like well okay, I seem to be in a better position.   


Does anyone have any advice or something they can say to help me?"
539,Am I “normal”?,"I’ve been meaning to seek therapy. I’m almost positive I’m suffering from depression, anxiety, and maybe depression or even a personality disorder. I’m a college student, in my 20s, on birth control, and have been dealing with trauma related to abusive relationships. An underlying issue could be the fact I have an absent father. There are a lot of things that could have made me the way I am today, and I’m trying to cope. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. I struggle to maintain hobbies, to be alone, to feel light, to enjoy the world around me. One moment I feel like everything is okay, and the next moment I’m not. I’ll be ready to go out with friends, then immediately lose the energy after confirming plans. I don’t deal with stress very well. There are many things I can do to feel better about myself, but I can’t seem to get out of this hole. I don’t trust anyone to pick apart my psyche and tell me what’s wrong with me, but I need it. How do you go about these feelings?"
540,It's always hitting first,The very 5 seconds i wake up in the morning those feelings fill me up before i even get out of bed
541,Don't know if I'm psychotic or not.,"Hi, I am 16, and wont disclose my country because of the subreddit rules.

I have had this growing feeling over the last 6 months that everything I do is being tracked, monitored, and all my life is is just a simulation run by the government to understand the mind of someone like me.

I am very narcissistic evident by this entire post, and often think of my existence as some sort of legacy, and my thinking as unique and extremely individual, but I am also sure everyone does. This sometimes makes me wonder if my individual way of thinking is being put in a simulation to test it and examine it by scientists working for a government that is examining people like me through a ""Brain in a vat"" type method.

The fact that I live in a fairly wealthy family and have no obvious issues or diseases, as well as being mentally (supposedly) sound, is very concerning and makes everything feel more like a simulation to test my, the subject's, way of thinking in a somewhat controlled environment. The bare fact that the Sun and Moon just somehow happened to allign and look the same size from their distances from Earth seems fake and fabricated in this simulation world, once someone pointed the significance of this out to me, i panicked and realised it is scarily fake and impossible.

 And I feel like even just writing this feeling on reddit is serving myself to the government who is trying to examine me. But i don't care anymore and I am tired of living like this. Fuck you you simulating pigs and death to your colleagues, families and friends.

I want to die, and I hope you or your scientists will just pull the plug on me. I live in a seemingly perfect world yet hate my existence as I have no valid reason to be sad or distressed, as well as being crippingly narcisstic EVIDENT BY THE POST NOW THAT I READ IT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.

I want to love and I want to feel loved but I also fear that everything is simulated and will end and my rememberance as a human is synthetic and even if it is real is wrong.

I don't know, sorry for posting this in the first place, I am young and narcissistic and have very stupid self-absorbed young person opinions, but I really want to know if I am just stupid or psychotic or if this whole thing is real or fake, and if fake, well done scientists, clap clap clap."
542,I think I need help,"I'm not sure where to go with this. I've tried talking to my boyfriend. He just keeps telling me everything will get better, but I'm getting worse. 
A bit of back story, I've always struggled with my mental health. The first time I was baker acted was at around 5 or 6. I really don't even remember it, my mother said it was because I was trying to kill myself. I struggle with severe depression, and bipolar personality disorder. Those where my last diagnoses at 17. I haven't been able to get any kind of help since then. I've been on and off different medications my whole life basically up until I hit 18.
My mental stability is starting to break, and now with this quarantine I'm starting to hit a low point I haven't been at in a very long time. I've tried to maintain my grounding techniques, and outlets like drawing, writing, taking my dog for walks. But I can't bring myself to do them, I can't concentrate long enough to ground myself, I hate everything I write, and draw. I'm having a hard time telling the difference between my internal dialogue and what my illness tells me. I can't keep my thoughts together, my brain is in constant chaos always screaming these awful things at me, there is nothing positive in my head right now. I keep reliving things, and thinking about things I've suppressed, and haven't thought about in a long time. I'm snapping, and getting irrationally angry over minor inconveniences, and things I should be understanding and used to. Like my daughter not being able to fall asleep, my boyfriend correcting my stutter, or just talking too much, my dog or cats trying to get in bed to sleep with us. I can't control myself, and my anger. I'm concerned for where my head is at, I don't want to hurt the people around me, nothing physical. But being screamed at isn't pleasant, and I'm just losing my mind constantly. I broke down in frustration over a pen yesterday. A fucking pen. It's ridiculous, and besides there being a pandemic going on, I can't even afford to go seek help. I'm just at breaking point after screaming at my daughter for waking me up, I feel like such an awful, disgusting excuse of a mother. Person. My daughter was the best thing to happen to me, and she makes me so unbelievably happy. I don't understand why I'm like this, and why I can't just stop, and be fucking normal. I'm exhausted, and drained of everything that made me happy, I feel like a hollow shell, with nothing to give but frustration. I don't feel sympathy or remorse until hours after. I feel so disgusted with myself and I just want it all to go away."
543,I can never sleep anymore,"Just as the title says, I can’t fall asleep. I stay up thinking or I’m just not tired. Or I can’t fall asleep no matter how hard I try. I just can’t sleep. I haven’t gotten more than 4 hours of sleep in at least a week. I’m tired all the time (what else is new) and I have to take a cold shower some mornings so I don’t fall asleep before I get coffee. 

All this is really taking a toll on me and I feel like I’m feeling worse and worse every day. The less sleep I get, the more sleep deprived I am. And the less reasonable and logical I am. I mess up with basic, everyday tasks now and I barely have any strength. I‘m not even diagnosed with insomnia or anything and with what’s going on now it’s not really a good time to go to the doctors to get it sorted out. 
Thanks for reading, I just needed to vent a little."
544,Trouble in paradise? Here’s what you can do,"Relationships are complicated. Two different individuals coming together to form a companionship wherein both of them want to maintain their individuality while letting the other one into their lives. Add marriage to it and the dynamic becomes even more complicated. That is one of the main reasons why the concept of a “perfect marriage” is fiction. Every relationship, every marriage, is bound to go through patchy phases. Every now and then, a conversation around [couple therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) will crop up and yes, sometimes, that is the only way you can fix things. But it truly is about two people who fight for their relationship that survive that patchy phase and come out a stronger couple. It is worth noting that therapy for a couple is not what societal conditioning teaches us. Couple counseling is a great way to ignite that lost spark and get a more objective view on your marital problems. Often, a new person, with no previous history and their view can make a huge difference. 

However, therapy is not an option for everyone. Some couples live in smaller cities where therapy is either frowned upon in their society or it’s not affordable due to huge demand and less supply. While for [couple therapy Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) has a lot of renowned psychologists, smaller cities may not be as well equipped with therapists. Hence, for couples going through issues who cannot afford therapy, reevaluating the reasons you are together can be a good first step. Sit down, reminisce over the days you were happy and above all, talk about the day that made you decide this relationship is it. Sometimes, in our current problems, we forget the reasons that made us choose our partners. Hence, talking about those reasons, laughing over the inside jokes and discussing your initial goals as a couple can be a great step to get closer in the present and get a grip over your future plans. Couple therapy is also a great way to get this started. When you go for therapy, some of the techniques are to just make sure that you are communicating again. 

Another issue that crops up between couples is the lack of interest in each other’s lives. A lot of the times, issues in a marriage either crop up due to mental health issues or the marital problems can lead to mental health problems. If your partner needs [depression therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) or you believe that you might need counseling, it is worth noting that until both of you deal with your personal issues, your marital problems will continue to escalate. Hence, it is imperative for you and your partner to show interest in each other’s lives and continue to communicate about problems you are facing. Only once you have taken control over your own life will you be able to sit down, talk to your partner and look for a way to fix your marital problems. Remember, therapy is a great way to spark that lost fire in a relationship when all else fails."
545,What is wrong with me..?,"Let me start off by saying that I don't know of this is where I should post. I feel terrible and I just need a place to vent.

I had a dream last night that i was madly in love with someone. I woke up today feeling genuine loss for that ""person"". I feel like I've lost them, I'm genuinely so sad and emotional about it. The kicker is that I'm in relationship. I don't understand why this is hurting me so badly. I have no idea why I feel this.

546,"[help] My dad needs some answers about the coronovirus, it's giving him nightmares! =[","Hey all!

Isolation is a difficult thing, and i'm sure we all have someone stubborn in the family you really worry about, who is just so easy going about everything, even though you know they have had some really bad cards dealt to them. 

I don't live with my dad (live in another city)He called me today asking if i could ask the internet/world/somebody important because he's been having recurring dreams 3 nights in a row referring to the ""Cure"" for corona and prevention methods for PPE (Technophobe born in the 50's, stuck in his ways) he said this could save lives and so on!

now i know this is common stress related/anxiety/being at home alone and a lot to think/worry about, and i'm going to keep supporting him through this difficult time, keep his mind busy from thinking about it.

But he was insistent that i write this down! ""sulfur powder + Copper powder mixed together to a boiling water vapour"" now i'm sure there are plenty of people out there that knows the effects sulfur and copper can do to the respiratory system, but i'm asking people to just take a few moments to explain/theorise what effect this chemical compound could do to the body and A virus.

So when i call him later i can say that I got the word out and everybody shared their thoughts. I just want to put his mind at ease and let him have a restful sleep.

He's said 3 nights in a row it's exactly the same, and it's my cousin who passed who is telling him this over and over again.

Sorry for sharing such random info! I just wanted to help my dear ol dad!.

take care everyone"
547,What is the next step that I should take for my mental health? I think I might have ADHD.,"I want to say right off the bat, I firmly do not believe in self diagnosis, and I recognize the damage that describing yourself with a serious mental health disorder can do to the people who actually have it.


I am so worried about being wrong, but ADHD would explain so many things for me. When I was younger, I remember my Mom and my grandma had a fight about it one time. My grandma was convinced that I had it, using her experience as a teacher to recognize the symptoms. My mom on the other hand refused to take me to a doctor saying that I could focus when I wanted to, she always complained about my tunnel vision.


I didn't think about it much after that, though I had people in my life ask me if I had it a handful of times. About 2 years ago, I recognized that I was probably depressed, and finally got around to seeing my pcp, to get her to point me in the direction I should go. After I described what I thought was making me depressed, her first response was that it was an issue with my focus and told me to seek out a psychiatrist.


I did as she said and my psychiatrist at the time was very convinced that I was bipolar. The funny thing was though, that he prescribed medication before telling me that he thought I was bipolar. I googled what seroquel treated and spent a weekend scared out of my mind that I might have schizophrenia. I switched medications a few times, and I was very bad about remembering to take them to his frustration. He moved away and I had to find a different psychiatrist. 


The second psychiatrist didn't believe for a second that I was bipolar, and instead described me as having depression ""with mixed features."" He was even more frustrated with my inability to take medication, and I would leave appointments with him feeling worse than when I came in, so eventually I cancelled my next appointment and never scheduled a new one.


Whatever my issue is though, it hasn't gone away. And the more that I try to do my own research, the more convinced I am that I probably have ADHD.  


My memory is terrible, I frequently walk into rooms and don't remember what I went in there for, I also have a hard time remembering to do things, (like taking out the trash on a certain day, calling someone at a certain time or taking medication.), I can't trust myself to do anything because I'm worried that I'll procrastinate and put it off, I'm late to everything (even things I'm excited to do), and I'm constantly getting mad at myself for being lazy *while* doing the thing that I'm calling myself lazy for. I felt like such a shitty person that I felt like it was better for everyone in my life if I would just go and jump off a bridge, which is why I went to my pcp about depression in the first place. I'm astonished by the fact that I'm able to lose my train of thought mid sentence, have to stop, apologize and remember what I was talking about in order to continue. And that's just scratching the surface, I'm sure if I continue I could describe executive dysfunction to a T.


I asked both psychiatrists if I might have ADHD, and they both said that these could all be symptoms of bipolar disorder or depression and that we should treat those first before moving into anything else. I'm willing to accept that I might not have ADHD. I trusted them when they said these things because I don't want to diagnose myself, but whatever it is that I have, I want to get better. 



What should I do moving forward? Currently I'm thinking of maybe seeking out counseling or a therapist, somebody who can't prescribe meds and try to treat this, whatever it is that I have without medication. That way, I don't run into the issue of struggling to remember to take it. Is that a good idea, are there better options? Should I mention my suspicions about ADHD? Or let them come to a conclusion on their own?


Thank you for any advice or help in advance."
548,I (19M) am numb and my libido is out the window. I need advice.,"Hey guys. I have suffered mental illness in the past, but I recovered pretty much completely. I was happy almost constantly, my self esteem was through the roof, I loved myself and life itself. However, in recent weeks, I have returned to a numb, bonerless robot. I used to cook from scratch almost every day, I used to go to the gym all of the time.. life seemed perfect.

It could be due to my job. I'm a support worker, working in mental health. All I hear from my colleagues are complaints that all the praise is going to the NHS, as we are getting no recognition. FYI, this does not bother me, but the constant complaining and negativity is getting rather draining.

Has anyone experienced a sudden crash like this? What could be the reason? How can I return to my former mental state?

549,"Constant breakdowns for years because I have no friends or family, no one cares.","Hello.

I just... have no one. I'm completely alone. I'm financially supported by a parent, but that person doesn't support me emotionally. I don't have a job. I tried to get a job, I had a breakdown after 2 months. I doubt I'll ever be able to get another job, because they'll know I only lasted 2 months before, and they won't hire me because of that.

I can't make friends. Just... everyone I know is always rude to me. If I scroll down my ""friends"" lists on any app, or contacts lists, or anything, I think about trying to reach out to those people but every time I do, they're just rude.

They don't even think they're being rude.

I just... have nothing in common with anyone. Every time I meet people, I try to look for common ground, but I can't find any. So I listen to them talk about the things they care about, and I smile and nod and try to be polite, but when I try to talk about anything I care about, they kick me down. 

Yeah, there are topics I like, but when I try to find people online who like the same topics, they just kick me down. They ignore me, because I'm different from them... 

Anyway, I've been having constant breakdowns for years, and begging for help everywhere I can find to go, but no one has ever cared. No one has ever even tried to help.

I did find a good therapist, but they couldn't do anything for me. They couldn't tell me where to find friends. They just told me my ideas are valid and I'm smart, but I can figure that out for myself. I don't need to pay someone to tell me that. 

I just feel so sick. I can barely move, I can barely get out of bed most days. Trying to do anything, just... I collapse. I vomit. I can't do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

And no one will help me. No one cares at all.

&amp;#x200B;

And don't tell me just to cope without having anyone who cares about me. Humans need friendship the same as air. Telling me to cope with complete social isolation is the same as telling me to cope without air and water."

So for background I have pretty bad depression, anxiety, bulimia, and possibly anorexia (not diognosed with it but pretty sure I have it..)
Basically like a year ago I started cutting it started off small like one on the side of my wrist like once every 2 weeks or a month. Gradually it has gotton alot worse- about a month ago now I had roughly 60 fresh cuts (from the night before) on the tops of both my thighs, anyway my friend noticed n contacted my mum all the sharps were taken out of my house (I'm only 14.so I can't acsess much more) but the cuttings such a bad addiction I can't stop and I go insane if I do (I've tried to explain to my mum but she just tells me to stop). I've started to get so bad I've been creating my own razors, it started off pretty standerd like taking apart sharpeners but it soon has moved to me creating razors from pencil tins bulling apart food cans and this morning using the plastic that pills are kept in...
I don't know what to do because its like there's two sides of me I get so proud of myself when I do it and I want to do it more, see more blood, I'm a failure if I don't do it, same goes for my bulimia. I couldn't cut for a while cause I couldn't work out what to use. I went so insane I tried to hang myself with a rope in the bathroom, I still kinda feel like I'm a failure for it not working, I have around 10 suicide plans, planed out notes been to hospital twice for suicide scares. I'm just so broken and I make everyone around me sad and worried I just want to be normal or at least them to feel normal-
I can't even eat if I do try I can't swallow it. I'm ashamed if I do eat so I only eat at dinner cause otherwise my family gets worried. I try to eat the smallest amount as possible, then immediately shower and erase what I've eaten. I want to see the numbers drop I know I'm not overweight I'm actually an extremely healthy weight but I want the numbers to drop to extremely unhealthy amounts.

Today we look at the Coronavirus ( COVID 19 ). I interview Jayne Roberts, a fully qualified nurse who shares her knowledge regarding the sources of reliable information with regard to our questions on Coronavirus.

My wish is that this interview brings a deeper understanding of the virus and some release from our stress &amp; anxiety associated with it.

This is evident in where I came from which is the Philippines and India, Southeast Asia, etc. People in this part of the world don't seem to understand what abuse is. For them (or us), an abusive parent is unimaginable.

Who's the Asian, Middle Eastern etc. here? Do you have something similar?"
555,Quarantine is killing me,"I have a very rocky relationship with my parents that reached a turning point when I was in my last year of high school. I think I haven’t forgiven them and vice versa.  
It’s been two years but I moved hours away for school and only come back at Christmas and summer. 

Now I’ve been quarantined w them and my siblings for about 3 weeks and I’m falling quickly into something and it’s scaring me. 

I’m always ready to snap.  I’ve been in a mad/sad mood for about a week now. I make a snide comment almost any time someone talks to me and I feel bad but my emotions are always so strong and I’m losing control over them. 

I don’t want to destroy my relationship w my family but I also don’t know how to handle quarantine.  I feel like I’m in prison and I’m always on edge. 

On the other hand, my siblings are telling me to get over it and get a hold on my emotions and I understand that they are right but I literally cannot control my emotions. I see red when I talk to my parents sometimes. 

I don’t know how to handle months of this and be okay. 

I feel like I can’t even fully explain it to my friends bc I don’t want them to see me this way. But I literally feel like I’m falling apart and if it continues I’m going to destroy my relationship with my family. 

Literally any advice will help. If you are in similar situations please let me know how you are handeling it."
556,How to deal with an anxiety inducing job?,"So, I work at Lowe's, which is a very large corporation/hardware and home improvement store basically. I've worked there for about a year part time, and since January I've been looking for a full time job, but have kept working there as I have to. It hasn't been a terrible job, management is not bad, and most of my coworkers are fine. The reason I'm looking for a different job is because I want a better schedule and better pay, so I've been applying at different banks. 

Well, after the coronavirus happened, and everybody went into a panic, work literally became hell. Not only is it twice as busy as normal, nobody is following the guidelines for staying 6 feet apart. My head manager tries to enforce it, and even put up ""sneeze guards"" in front of the registers, but nobody does what they are supposed to. Not the customers, not my coworkers. It's so stressful every time when I work that I literally dread going into work everyday. Two days this week I have not gone to work when I was scheduled, the first time I called out, and today I just didn't show up. I wake up in the morning, and I just stay in bed anxious because I hate the idea of going to work. The customers are insane, and there's usually five or more online orders to put together whenever there's only one or two people at the customer service also trying to do everything else. (I work customer service). 

I had a second interview with a bank earlier this week, and I think I have a pretty good chance of getting a job. I've never been one to just not show up. This is the first day I've ever just not showed up to work in all the time that I've been working. I can't continue to do this both for morality sake, and my paycheck. I'm just not sure what to do."
557,I (18M) don’t know what I want. I don’t know what to do. I just feel helpless,"I’ve had feelings like these on and off. I usually push the feelings down and out of the way to focus on things and it usually works, I usually had college to distract me. But since lockdown began and I couldn’t go to college or a friends place I’ve have a lot less distractions and I don’t know how to handle this anymore.

I’ve felt like this for about half a month, I’ve felt worthless and like a failure. When I have nothing to do the word failure just keeps itself in the back of my mind.

I haven’t felt like myself, but I don’t even know who I am, I put on a face and smile because I don’t want people to worry, but I end up annoying them so I stay alone in my room, but that’s not helping.

I am behind on college work, making excuses so I can have more time but I never end up doing it because I can’t stop thinking about how wrong everything will be and how much I’ll fail.

I don’t know what to do, I can’t tell my family because they always call me an stupid or over dramatic when I always try and open up, and the only friends I can contact will say either “oOf” or make it about themselves, saying that their life is so much worse.

I try and help people and even in this state I still try because it distracts me from my own issues, but it’s getting harder and harder to the point I just don’t want to talk about anything with a flaw.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to think, I don’t know who I am. All I know is that I’ll end up being a failure. What’s the point in trying anymore? Why am I even doing this?"

And he wants to make sure I know all about ""our faith,"" and ""what we believe."" Which i refuse to participate in. is some sort of new Hebrew-speaking sect of fundamentalist Episcopalianism/Anglicanism (I think... I'm pretty sure its just something his former parishioners made up... I'm Catholic btw, so there is no ""we"" in the statement for me). Aside from some things hes memorized though, he doesn't speak Hebrew or Greek. I keep getting these books in the mail about Jesus. But they aren't readable. They're like doctorate level and beyond books on Jesus. Because I'm in the military and have an interest in international affairs and politics, he sends me photocopied sensationalist pieces on China and asks for my thoughts on them. He has yet to read any of the actual credible books on China I've sent him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's sending my sister books about how to deal with her abortion (which she's never had, but he's decided that statistically speaking she probably had one and is just dishonoring him by covering it up). Recently he sent her some essay he found on the internet about how Yoga and martial arts open you up to possession by demons. He is very much into demons. Not like old demonology texts, but the modern ones where missionaries go to Africa and decide that the reason a kid has a deformed leg is because of demons, and then they pray over him until the leg heals itself. Stuff that somehow in 2020, nobody takes a fucking video of. Anyway, unnamed friends of his (I think he says it this way because he knows I don't believe him) know all about demons and ""spiritual warfare"" and they go to the airport to pray for returning soldiers they find who are demon possessed or infested (I guess there's a difference). Also apparently Hillary Clinton smells like sulfur.

So what. I guess I just have no clue how to deal with this. He's lost his shit and won't go get meds because ""all"" the doctors out there are ""anti-Christian perverts."" He saw one a while back who diagnosed him with ADD after praying together. Seeing as he's pretty bipolar, it makes me question their competence. So I dont know what to do. I dont want him just languishing there, I also don't like the effect its having on me and my sister. My brother doesn't give a fuck and noped out of our family years ago, which I cant totally fault him for. My sister went from being an Episcopalian to totally walking away from religion. Every interaction with my dad on something religious and I feel myself drifting further and further away from the Church as well. All in all, it leaves me really concerned with my future mental health."

562,I Don’t Know How to Talk About This,"Trigger warning : suicide
(She lived, read with peace of mind) 
So. Last night one of my highschool friends tried to kill herself by ODing on pills. Me and her both have tumblrs (remnants of 2014) that we occasionally use for art and photography blogs. She posted what was more or less a suicide note to me, as I’m the only person who follows her on there. I wasn’t “supposed” to see it for another few days, as I was up way past one, and I’m usually out by 11 but for whatever reason I couldn’t sleep and decided to check tumblr on a whim. And saw the post 
Of course I called her. She tried to act like everything was fine and she didn’t know what I was talking about. A 15 minute phone call ensues. She breaks down, I tell her I’m driving to be house. She tells me I don’t have to, she’s going to get her mom and go to the hospital. I drove anyway just to be sure. 
They pumped her stomach in time. They admitted her to the ward. She’s okay. 
My problem is this. I live in a small town. people are already talking about how I “saved her life” and it makes me really uncomfortable. I just did what any normal human being should have. But I feel like the deflection only calls more attention to it a lot of the time, and makes people insist how amazing you are for not letting someone just... die. 
Does anyone have any idea of how to shift the attention of my “heroic deed” without making it seem like I’m just trying to play humble? Should I just ignore people when they say that? 
Any advice is appreciated, thanks"

565,Issue with uncontrollable Hatred,"Hello people of reddit,

I'm a 20 years young man from Germany (Sorry for my bad English) and have serious issues with extreme and uncontrollable Hatred during phases of depression. This is realized in the urge to destroy and kill everything that even mildly annoys me, including myself. Currently, my moral conscience and self-control restrict me from doing such things but the urges are there and are getting worse.

It usually starts with a depression after being (continiously) let down or disappointed by friends and/or family or even myself. I start to focus on negative things and memories, including previous instances of being let down and/or disappointed, which worsens each following instance of depression.

During the first severe depressions (16-18 years old) I only developed the urge to kill myself, but later, I started to see all the bad things in other people and things and began to switch from depression to extreme hatred for everything including myself and loved ones. I was often used (financially and through ""favors"") or treated like trash by so-called ""friends"" and colleagues during my age of 16 to 19 years.

I have loving and nice parents, a happy nice little dog, no kids or girlfriend and a dozen really nice friends, but sometimes I feel extremely misunderstood and left behind or treated like the ""last choice"" or excluded. I informed friends and family about this issue and my phases of Hatred and that I'm sorry and they seem to understand and apparently forget or forgive everything that I do in my hateful actions and messages.

Yet still, I have the feeling that I grow more and more distant to everything and everyone. That I'm treated more and more excluded and sometimes unfortunatly, that really is the case. In my worst bouts of hatred, I even fantasize about how to destroy all life on earth in the most brutal fassion possible, It's just sheer unbearably painful Hatred and when I'm not raging, I'm considered to be the total opposite, being open-minded, nice and peaceful and usually I am even sorry for squashing a bug/spider.

I try to exclude my family from these issues as they have enough to worry about, but my closest friends start to suffer from by bouts of Hatred and me lashing out verbally.

I tried getting professional therapy but in Germany, as long as you have only state-supported health insurance, you are treated like a machine that requires fixing and not as a human with serious and painful issues. In short, I'm too poor (being an apprentice living on minimal social welfare) to be able to afford professional help from a specialist and take every sound advice that I can get.

TLDR: I'm angry without reason, need help. I'm thankful for anything."
566,Have had mental issues - not sure whether to raise with doctor after lockdown.,"Put this in another subreddit but want as many opinions as possible 

Every since I was a young child - I have always had troubles with controlling my emotions. I have constantly been up and down all my life and sometimes lashed out (violently). As I headed into my teenage years, the ups and downs got worse. For periods of time, I could be feeling great, feel like I’m active and then I would be really depressed, just my cut self off from everyone and blow up for no good reason. At the age of 15, I was in hospital after attempting to commit suicide, for diagnosed with early depression and I had to do counselling. I got a little bit better in terms of controlling my suicidal thoughts, but the emotional rollercoaster did not stop. Now (18F), I am starting to realise that my emotional moods are not normal and I didn’t just have an “anger issue” as my dad would say. Even now I am struggling and am in a depressive slump - making it hard for me to want to do any uni work at all. I had been in a good headspace about two weeks ago so I am very confused.

Another example of my unpredictable moods. I decided to cut 4 of my closest friends out of my life because I was really paranoid that they didn’t need me anymore. A few weeks later, I back tracked and apologised.

Wondering if I should go see my doctor and bring this all up? Should I also say something to my parents about all of this? Does anyone know what may be wrong?"
567,Need input regarding my search for a psychologist,"Hey, folks!

So, even before this COVID-19 madness started, I've been searching for a psychologist with the usual hurdles (location, insurance, timing, etc), but now I have a new ""hiccup"" I'm pondering.  I think I found a psychologist who handles all the stuff I'm dealing with involving a total lack of self-esteem, intimacy issues, depression, self-image, anxiety, and all the other lovely issues bouncing around in my head.

However, the psychologist is the opposite gender and really attractive.

And I'm nervous.  On the one hand, I've always been able to talk to attractive people fine, and in fact, NOT having friendships with attractive people go any further than friendship or professional relationships is a keystone of my entire life up to this point.  However, I never really talked about anything intimate with them.  I'm a pretty open person, and an open book to anybody who actually asks me questions, but I'm trying to figure out if being forced to out of patient obligation (plus the fact I'm paying them for the time) will help make it easier to do it socially, or if I'd be sabotaging my own experience by having someone who might spark the same fears and anxiety.

570,Tension Headaches / Psychosis / Dissociative,"Hey everyone,

I’m 28 years old and I have been a heavy pot smoker since I was 18. I’ve been depressed a few times (let’s say 4... all ranging from a week to 2 months) in my life and it always stems from isolating myself in my room, smoking all day and binge eating and binge watching movies, but I’ve always managed to get back out of it and get back to feeling not just normal but really freakin good. I always get myself out of it by exercising, eating very clean, back to work, healthy relationships, yoga and meditation and getting a lot of sunlight. 

This time is very different. Last month i fell into it again (it lasted about 3 weeks). After the 3 weeks i snapped out of it and got back to my normal healthy routine. 2 weeks went by and I seemed to be doing really well. I didn’t stop smoking but was just smoking a lot less, until 5 days ago happened. I smoked at night and my thoughts were uncontrollable. I thought i was going crazy and I was talking to myself all night long. It went on for about 4 hours and then i finally feel asleep (thank god). This has never happened to me before so I’m in bed freaking out and just going bat shit crazy. 

I have not touched weed since and I NEVER WILL TOUCH WEED AGAIN. I have no craving for it all. I have no cravings for it bc of how intense and how painful it has been for me these past 5 days. It fluctuates a lot but i have a ton of tension headaches (which idk if this is the right term but sharp pain near my temples) I’m thinking in my head a lot of the day uncontrollably, and my symptoms seem to match being dissociative/ psychosis. It’s a bit scary for me to be honest guys. I told my dad and he said go see a psychiatrist. Fuck that. I’m sorry i don’t believe in taking anti psychotic meds for my situation or for me i should say. I refuse to believe that i need to take these types of meds bc i put myself into this weed induced state of mind. I’m not saying everyone shouldn’t take it I’m just saying I won’t and I don’t believe in them for myself. 

So, yesterday i went to the store and bought $200 worth of supplements and mood enhancers from  Nac to  ashwagandha.  I figured I’m going to try everything in the world before i going to see a psychiatrist   Since we are all being honest here I’d rather commit suicide before taking anti depressants or antipsychotics. And i have no judgements to anyone that takes these meds but i just seen what they do to people and i would never (my mom is also a  pharmaceutical rep and sells these drugs so i know a lot about the side effects and about how they switch up drugs like candy and most people feel like non human when they are on them)

I am not suicidal at all i just want to say that but it’s just been so hard for me these past 5 days guys...Like so tough and I have a couple close friends that I’ve spoken to about this. One said to micro dose shrooms and the other said it will go away in time. I want to tell and talk everyone in my life about this but i feel ill be judged or just told to “go see a psychiatrist” and i believe that’s the last option here. 

So i have hope. I think this will go away one day just with being completely sober and goal oriented and doing all the normal things that i tend to do to stay fit and happy.  It’s just so real right now and I’m so scared right now.  

I don’t feel depressed at all. I’ve felt depression in my life and this is just different.  I actually love where i am at in life so that’s why it scares me. 

Anyway i think that’s it. Thank you so much for reading and getting through all the typos and mistakes lol 

Peace and love everyone. I hope everyone is trying to stay positive through this virus thing. It hasn’t effected my family or job or anything and i have no aniexty from it but i can only imagine what’s happening for people that live paycheck to paycheck. 

Any and all comments are so appreciated 🙏🏼"
571,How do you speak with someone after they've said you're obsessed with them and depend on them too much?,"im [22/f] here because my mental health is not okay and i dont know how cope with the problem above. my SO told me in a fight that im obsessed with him and that i depend on him too much. he said that our relationship isnt what he thinks about all the time. ive been dealing with the consequences of childhood trauma all my life and ive been dependent on people all my life. i have trouble opening up and trusting others.

 when i hear that im not ideal to someone in a relationship i immediately go to full on negative thoughts and lock up. i cant talk to the person, in this case my SO. i feel like im too much and that more talking will only be worse.

now i know that this isnt an advice sub but i guess some of you that maybe feel the same, mentally, could help me a bit. i want to feel like not an overly dependent piece of shit."
572,Parents think having a kid makes them entitled to not paying him and getting him to work for free Is that alright? (warning this post contains talk of suicide),This is not my own story. Im helping a freind that is growing depressed. Together he and i have written  a story that he cant post himself because he wants to remain anonymous. Rest asured he will be reading the comments. Whats written is now his own story.  Basically i live in a country where im the only agnostic i know of and the country is 100 percent religious and that makes it so that i cant really let anyone know about it or else my life could be in danger so i need a way to move to another country where atleast non religious people are tolerated      I have to go to university to complete my education but that's where the problem gets worse ive had mental health issues since i was a kid and on top of that things havent really been ideal. Im almost 20 now and ive passed college and my dad wants me to work at his store which i do and i dont get paid a cent for it. I dont get any pocket money he thinks since hes my father im free labor so they wont let me continue my studies plus i cant get a job because you dont get a job just from passing college in my country.(edited)***\[*****6:04 PM*****\]***I need money for education which requires a a job which requires an education (nasty spiral). So that means i dont have a way out of anywhere ive lost touch with my irl friends  because my phone broke in highschool and they never got me a new one so i cant even ask my friends for help. I get told that im worthless by my parents everytime i ask for something or in general too. So today after id finally had had enough i decided to end it all and took out all the Aspirin i could find at home. Did some research because id have one shot at suicide because if i survive it will make things a lot worse than they already are but it turns out there is a high chance ill survive using aspirin or any other way for that matter so i didnt go through with it and decided to talk to friends (mental health is taboo in my country). My online friends helped me get my head straight today and calmed me down enough to not do it. The reason i made this post was because my friend said there's probably gonna be people out there that have gone through similar situations so i should make this post and here we are. If you've got any advice please do say it im desperate for advice.
573,How do I help a friend who’s mental health isn’t the greatest?,I really want to help her and be there for her
574,Anxious today. Need words of encouragement (really badly),"TL/DR I’m feeling particularly anxious today. I’m not totally sure why. I woke up feeling like there was an elephant sitting on my chest, my heart is racing, and I can’t focus on anything for more than a minute at a time. 

I don’t think it helps that I checked my phone first thing in the morning and saw that a certain girl liked a post of mine of FB that I posted on Monday. I have absolutely no evidence that this is the case, but I’ve long had a bad feeling about this girl. We went to high school together but were never friends. And when I first started dating my (now ex) long term boyfriend, and we first added each other on FB, this girl was our only mutual friend. I didn’t think much of it then, but once saw her out when I was by myself and she stared at me awhile. After that I finally asked my bf how he knew her. He had a story about how he doesn’t really know her but a friend of his knows her from the gym. I shrugged it off and moved on. But now that she liked my post, my heart sank and I started to have a wild theory that there was something between them now that he and I have broken up. I have absolutely NO real evidence to back this theory up but that hasn’t stopped me from obsessing about it today. I can’t shake this awful feeling. While thinking rationally, I can see that them dating is unlikely (her and I are VERY different and I know she’s not really his type. I truly can’t picture them together but that doesn’t really prove anything either!!). 
But, I’m anxious. I’m anxious about this, about work, about my house, about social distancing, about my sister who is feeling lonely, about some friends of mine who are having a hard time, about my family, about...everything....So essentially my anxiety isn’t fully wrapped up in this wild theory, it goes way beyond that. 

I can’t sit still. I can’t breathe. Typing this took forever and I know that this is all a stream of word vomit but my brain can’t slow down enough for me to type or speak coherently. 

What do I do? I so badly need some kind words of encouragement. Reddit, help me out!"
575,anybody mind helping me out?,"I've been feeling drained lately. I mean that I don't enjoy my favorite things as much anymore, and I've been contemplating s\*\*\*ide. on top of that, I'm extremely impulsive and I hate myself for that. I'm not diagnosed with depression but I do have Aspergers and ADD. can someone explain this? is it normal? thanks."
576,A bad childhood (venting?/help pls),"I've (19M) noticed that most of my issues have stemmed from my abusive childhood and I don't really know what to do about it. The most help I got with dealing with it was a school counselor was there for me to help sort my school things out and a little bit with my mental health.

I guess there's a lot of trauma stored up in my mind and I've never been able to get help because my parents don't seem to really want to help me get help. 

So growing up, my dad always kind of took his anger out on me. Smacking, hitting, antagonizing, and at one point, choking. 

I don't remember when it started, because I don't remember most of my childhood. I just remember the pain, the crying, the thought of ""why?"", and hearing my father continuously yell at me, telling me how worthless I am.

From what I heard, I used to be really outgoing as a child. I had friends I would play with at school, but after the abuse I became so afraid of people that I cried (like, more out of terror than fear) when I was told by a teacher to go to another classroom and help with something. I never asked for help with school work because I eventually thought it was ""wrong"" to ""bother"" people with asking for help. I had maybe 1 or 2 friends at a time and they would easily forget about me all together by the next school year. This all didn't start getting better until middle school, I guess.

There, a group of odd people (who I later found out had similar experiences as me) were the only people go accept me for me. They didn't forget me. They didn't treat me like dirt. They treat me with kindness. For once, happiness came and it wasn't until high school finished that I realized just how important they are to me.

Anyways, that's when my problems started to show. Well, they started showing in high school. I'd have bursts of anger, but when I wasn't angry, I felt empty. At times, I wanted to end my life and contemplated it several times but never went through with it. The most self harm I've done was just kind of... smacking myself around and stuff like that. I often have trouble focusing (not horribly, but I space off a lot) and I just have this self hatred boiling in me. The years of being told how worthless I am has consumed me to the point that I have almost no confidence at all. I have a hard time identifying who I am, at times. At one point I did see a doctor and was put on medication for depression, but I eventually just stopped taking it and never went to see the doctor again.

Now that I'm considered an adult, I'm starting to see these more as problems than just it being ""normal"". 

I don't really know what to do. With the pandemic going on right now, I don't see how I can get help. I just want to be normal, more than anything."
577,Anxiety and false symptoms?,"So I'm not always the best at wording my thoughts so please bear with me. As you can probably tell from the title I am one of the many with anxiety, generally I have it pretty under control, but these last few weeks have been trying to say the least. I am in a part of canada with a really low count of Covid-19 but seeing the reports and all the news has been slowly grinding me down. At the end if last week I found myself with a slight sore throat and cough, and that has caused my anxiety to rise back up. This causes my breathing to be a little shorter alot of the time. I'm without a fever or anything like that so I havent gone to get tested yet, I was just wondering if it's possible for my anxiety to give me some pseudo symptoms after reading so much about it?

Tldr: can my anxiety cause me to have psuedo symptoms of the sickness giving me the anxiety?"
578,I hate this,"I hate every day of my life. I hate falling asleep knowing that the next day will be exactly same as the previous. Waking up to a slightly hopeful feeling is even more agonizing than floating through every hour with the same hollowness because for one fraction of a moment I believe I can change something, until it all comes crashing down. 

Why do I even bother waking up and psyching myself up to accomplish something when all I end up doing is picking up a book/my graphics tablet/my laptop to write but end up instead scrolling through YouTube for about thirty minutes but even that does nothing for me anymore these days so I end up, after being all healthy and 'self-caring' for a whole half a day, eating a shit ton of sugar to spike my serotonin only to throw it all up because I can't even keep food inside of me. 

I'm sick and tired of wanting to die but immediately panicking in my mind when I say so because I'm beyond scared of death. I hate not knowing what I want and being caught in a constant dilemma of yearning to accomplish something in my life but having no motivation to do anything to work towards my goals. I hate watching the world move on without me and looking back to all the years I've lost to fucking nothing at all - to merely hating myself and pitying myself instead of making an effort to work and deal with life like a normal, functional human being. 

I hate thinking about young me, who dreamed of becoming an author or artist or scientist, and then noticing how many years have passed and how every day I'm straying further from my goal. I hate envying people much younger than me, who accomplish all I dreamed of with their hard work and dedication, because the fact that I, a damn adult, can't accomplish even a percent of what they can, is all the result of my own laziness and lack of self-control and extreme self-deprecation. 

And most of all I hate the idea that this might, just *might* be something hard-wired within me, whether it be in the form of a mental illness or innate uselessness, and I will never, ever get over this immense emptiness and failure that I've caused upon myself."
579,Help! My mental health became complete trash in less than a week!,"I have ADHD, anxiety and depression. I haven’t had depression symptoms in a few years and I mainly got my anxiety under control with very sparse episodes. I was feeling 99% normal. Well isolation kicks in and Im an absolute wreck now. Im extremely social and his isolation is my worst enemy. I live with my fiancé but he is a social recluse and I feel bad for relying on him so much. He’s fine being alone and im just crumbling and I don’t want to be needy or feel like a burden. 

My first week was good. I managed to keep myself really busy with art and cleaning and a ton of self care. This week im dying because I cant get to sleep or stay asleep. The lack of sleep is making me feel sick and giving me heart palpitations. I’ve completely regressed back into depression and I just want to disappear. Im so frustrated and hopeless that when I ask my fiancé for help it devolves into a fight. I can’t keep my emotions in check and this is the worst I’ve felt in years. I thrive on working a ton and now im unemployed. 

My fiancé wants me to be positive and be his rock but I can’t even help myself and I feel like I’m going to ruin this relationship by being a whiny weak bitch. I hate where I am and I don’t know how to get out because im not allowed to do the things that make my life fulfilling."

581,Not sure I can continue to be the supportive spouse.,"I'll make this simple in the interest of keeping your attention.

My partner is down in the hole again. Has been for about 2 weeks. I'm being as loving, supportive and optimistic as I can be. I'm not forcing them to fake being well, I'm telling them it's ok to not be ok, all the good, supportive couple-stuff. 

What I'm asking is, for the others in my situations or for the affected themselves I suppose, is how do I continue to be the rock that they need for support when every word I say gets twisted and manipulated? Or better yet, when I phrase something wrong, somewhat jokingly, and I mean NOTHING by it but it gets completely taken out of proportion?

I want to be there for them, but I can't keep getting chewed down and out as well. When it becomes less about ""I don't even care if it's a holiday together I cant be excited given my current situation"" and turns to more of a ""I don't want to come home to you tonight"" you aren't EVER there for me"" type of shift?

 If I do 100 things textbook perfect then slip up minorly on one thing, I'm the asshole for weeks. 

I'm only human. I can't be perfect all of the time, and sometimes I might shift from *deliriously supportive* to *frank and honest about life*, and if I say something real, I get destroyed verbally (not abusively but, you know, still not great).

I get what they are going through. It's been 24 years, I TRULY get it by this point, but when it shifts into my fault where life has taken them, I don't actually have the strength. I get down and out, and I'm getting tired of feeling like shit myself. I'm the only thing they have that they should be able to rely on, and yet, they push me so far away, hard enough that I can't rebound back immediately.

So, for the spouses, brothers, sisters, parents or children, friends of those who deal with somebody who fights anxiety, depression, dread and uncertainty in life... do you have any wise words? 

For those afflicted themselves, what do we need to do to get you back? 

I don't care if he is happy, I don't care if he is suicidal, I don't care if he spends 24 hours a day crying and saying nothing is worth it as long as I know that THEY know they can turn to me to carry them when they can't carry themselves. What terrifies me is when the last thing keeping them tethered, our relationship, doesn't matter anymore. What scares me is knowing that I'm not viewed as being supportive, that I'm not worth talking to or figuring stuff out with.

Yeah, I've been an ass in the past but we are just so far past that now, but it still comes back in the most obscure times.

I can't ****ing keep walking on eggshells like this. I can't modulate every absolute single thing I say 200 times in my head before I say it out loud.

I just don't know what to do at this point. So, any suggestions?

*Note there is currently minimal risk of a tragic outcome when it comes to life itself, but this relationship is about to fall apart. I can't stay strong when I'm being torn down for something that I might have said 8 years ago, or for being honest about the situation when they just need to hear happy lovey lies about where we are in life.

So yeah. I'll reply to every comment for the next few hours. Please don't recommend a doctor (not available currently) therapy (not available currently) or anything like that. It's me and him, that's what we have right now to work with. Note though we are both still working, both essential services."
582,Clean from Self-Harm.,"I haven't cut in almost 10 days. People often think cutting is the only form of self-harm, but that's so far from the truth. To stop cutting, I had to stop harming myself in other ways too. I'm slowly eating better, doing more things I enjoy, giving myself a break. 

I think for a lot of people who cut, they realize at some point that it's an addiction. To come clean from an addiction, you have to consider all the factors that led you to where you are, and all the factors that keep you stagnant. 

10 days to some might seem like nothing, but to other people who self-harm, it seems impossible. To anyone out there who sees this and wants to get better, I have so much hope in you. It will never be easy, but slowly you'll get to a better place, and you deserve it too! 

Stay safe and take care of yourself."

So to start, I suspect I have Depersonalization/Derealization during to the symptoms I've had since 14: feelings of not being in my body, or rather a clear separation between body and mind. I'm always existential, worrying about the future and reminiscing on the past, never present; like when I look in the mirror, or when I look at pictures if myself, logically I know that it's me, but I lack the connection to that ""version"" of myself, as if it is no longer a part of me. I'm very apathetic, nihilistic, and overall feel that nothing is important or has a point in the long run, other than creating a happy existence for ourselves

But honestly, I'm not here for that, just wanted to let everyone know since my mind can be very, very scattered. I apologize in advance; I had a thought just a little bit ago that...is strange, to say the least

I've always been fascinated by absurdism, always taking nothing seriously unless ABSOLUTELY necessary; and sometimes not even then. I feel as though making jokes about life and existence itself is a happy way to live. Instead of fearing dwath, laughing in its face and saying ""well shit man, where have you been?"", as of to greet it and anticipate it. Not in a suicidal manner, mind you, but something akin to meeting a huge corporate boss; I'd still be shaking, kn the verge of throwing up, especially as something as scary and uncertain as death itself, but keeping a smile on my face, knowing that death is the ultimate punchline to life or existence 

So I thought ""the biggest joke would be to work my entire life towards creating one song to sum it all up, become as well known as possible as to ger everyone I know invested into said song. Then on my death bed, or right before i die, i would reveal that the song was nothing more than 3:00mins of silence with a black screen""

And to me, it makes sense, but it just seems extremely unhealthy in nature...i just can't decide whether that was *really* okay or not to think, and if it should concern me or not (which to be fair, my anxiety has completely fucked what i KNOW i should be anxious about and not; i worry and stress every waking moment that I breathe, so I can't really trust myself here)"
584,How am I supposed to deal with declining mental health during the quarantine?,"I think my mental health is declining again like it did when I first got diagnosed with depression like 3 months ago. I've been taking meds and it's been going good, but now I'm starting to feel my mental health decline again, and I don't know how to deal with it because of the quarantine. Any advice please?"
585,Dealing with responsibilities,"So I am homeschooled (convenient for what’s happening right now) for my first and last year, as I am a senior. I basically manage all of my own schoolwork, tests, quizzes, everything. I’ve been slowly falling out of habit of doing my work. I know it needs to be done, but every day I plan to do something, I think “I don’t feel well enough. Maybe tomorrow.” It’s so hard to do anything. All I want to do is sleep."
586,suffering (tw? and long),"for years i’ve noticed there’s something wrong with me. the way i act the way i think..but the thing is, i don’t have any hope for it to be fixed. i don’t like to self diagnose, but there are some thing that don’t need to be diagnosed and it’s clear signs yet people still think i’m doing it for attention, when they *know* i isolate my room to avoid attention. it’s backwards and doesn’t make sense and i hate it. i’m also not big on labels but i don’t hate them enough to just downright refuse any labels. i do have some non related labels i am proud to have but for other things...everything’s murky.

ever since the end of january this year, i’ve been numb. my mother pushed me into running away to point i was up at like 1 or 2 in the morning half studying to a super important exam with tears in my eyes searching online for a greyhound bus to take me away from this house. i ending up not running away because, surprise, i’m became numb. 
ive found the experience to be rather nice actually. nothing gets to me, i tried to trigger myself but just ending up laughing because i couldn’t remember what having feelings felt like. there was a short period of euphoria because i felt invincible. but then i started getting stress rashes *all over* my body. like i still keep getting them today, they’re everywhere! but even though i couldn’t find it in myself to be stressed about anything, the patches kept appearing.
anyway, sorry i was getting off track.

ahem, so what i’m trying to say is, i’m tired of feeling this this i guess. i figure if i had a diagnosis for everything i had, i could get therapy (which my mother said she’ll let me go to but never did because that was damn near two years ago) and i could get medicine to help me cope with life. but the thing is i have like...two people who care and are supportive of me. my family is not one of them. at all.
my family tells me my thoughts are not important, my body is not mine to use, my feelings don’t matter, i do things for attention, im a bitch, no one likes me because of my attitude. the “attitude” *they* created. my mother blew me off when i called out my abuser and she forgives him even though the effects that it has on me is painfully clear. she practically told me she didn’t believe me and to get over it. those words weren’t used but it felt like that. 
hell, i was slapped when my mother was trying get me to unlock my phone after my friend called her when i told her i was going to commit suicide that night. she even knew i used to cut but wasn’t concerned at all. she was just mad i was stealing her box cutter.

my depression comes off as being lazy and stubborn. my adhd(or add idfk) comes off as a purposeful forgetful airhead that’s bored and still lazy. my tourettes comes off as a desperate need for attention. my dyscalculia comes off as an excuse to slack. my failed relationships comes off as me being a bitch. (again not self diagnosing but it’s better than just being lost in the dark about what’s wrong with me) 
anyway..i guess what i’m trying to say is that i’ll forever be lost and suffering in my illness because i don’t have the strength alone to be diagnosed but no one that has the power cares enough to help me get diagnosed. 
the only true medical thing i am diagnosed for is asthma when i was just a kid because i nearly died and went to the hospital. that’s the only reason why.
and sometimes it makes me want to do something drastic so i can be diagnosed again. 
i guess on the brink of suicide isn’t enough for them. my memory loss is not concerning to anyone. it’s a terrible feeling.
sorry for the vent or whatever."
587,"First job, not going so great.","I managed to land amy first job in Feb (software engineer) this year and the impact it has had on me isn't too good. It's my first job (corporate) but each and everyday, I go to bed and wish I never wake up because facing a new day is dreadful. It's really broken my self-confidence, spiked my anxiety to levels i never thought it could reach and to some extent even thought of ending it all. I've received talks from family and friends too. Tried making myself happy but the thought of work deprives it all. I've had trouble sleeping for the past two months and I'm honestly tired of being sad and the state I'm in and being in a third world country in Africa where youth unemployment is high and ""chasing your passion"" is usually disregarded, that's a whole other challenge by itself. Advice?"
588,Panic Episodes Get Worse When...,"So  does this happen to anyone else where you'll spiral but be quiet and almost quietly panic but it doesn't get awful until you realize it's affecting someone else? I swear this happens to me so frickin often. Like hey I'm fine hurting alone like I'll deal with it, but if it affects my s/o or my sibling in any way at all, I lose my mind and the episode gets out of control. This happened like 5 minutes ago, and i'm calming down but my head is throbbing and my jaws and hands are killing me. This has been going on for years and it gets better where I plateau at times then I'm back at it and I just want to get better.

Edit: Quarantine is not helping in any way. I want to go out but can't cause mum is always home of course and doesn't know about my mental health situation or what goes on with me. So every time I panic.. in my room I have to constantly switch moods as if at the flick of a switch. Losing. My. Mind."

590,Was this a mistake?,I have very bad anxiety and childhood trauma issues and due to the current pandemic I haven’t been able to get an appointment with the intern therapist I’ve been seeing sense last July. I’ve called the clinic twice sense my last session (March 5) and they have just simply told me that she isn’t available because of covid-19 and they would get back in touch later. Without going into to much detail I’m currently in a very rough environment and my therapist has been one of the few good points of my week. Things have recently gotten much worse and I’m really struggling to cope without the help of therapy. I’ve been really worried about the prospect of never seeing her again so I did the only thing else I could think of. I reached out to her on Facebook messenger but now I’m worried she’ll get mad or weirded out by this. Am I overreacting or was texting her a stupid move? God I’m such a stupid ass fucking mess right now.
591,"If I fixed my body,would I still feel like crap?","I'm a bit overweight, but nothing serious, but I have HORIBLE body image and self confidence issues. If I got into shape, would I still have body image issues? Would they be fixed or would I just be in shape and still be miserable. I try hard to eat healthy and exercise, but my depression is killing me and makes the lightest exercise extremely difficult. I've been at this for a month and I still feel like shit and havent lost that much weight."
592,Looking for Contamination OCD help,"So I moved to Quebec from Ontario (Canada) and I am couch surfing until I get a place. I need to get diagnosed and get help for my ocd as it’s been affecting me for 4-6 years now and I can’t fight it alone, I don’t know who to contact as I know healthcare isn’t free for Canadians in Quebec who aren’t permanent residents of Quebec. Will I have to go to Ontario or what can I do. I’ve been calling 811 for an hr and still haven’t gotten through."
593,"Work and corona virus, can't fix stupid",My frustration level is through the roof. I work in a hardware store and the store is doing nothing to help us. This store is NOT an essential service. They're paying us two dollars more per hour. Our lives are worth two fucking dollars. No one is respecting personal space. I watched a man wipe his mouth with his palm and proceed to touch a lot of fucking products. They decided not to limit customers or refuse non essential services. I'm at the end of my rope. I'm so scared and frustrated Im on the verge of crying and vomiting. But not going to work is not an option. I hate corporations. I hate humanity. How hard is it to just fucking stay home.
594,How To Tell My Coworkers I Had A Panic Attack,"Alt account because.

I work in software so I am still able to work from home during lockdown. I am very thankful I still have a job but working from home for a month has been killing me. I’ve been coping more or less well enough and I was able to get a reasonable amount of work done up until yesterday.

I didn’t sleep well last night and I had a panic attack today and I kinda just closed my laptop and rolled into bed for a few hours. I am worried they’re going to ask me where I was for 4 hours and why I wasn’t responding to email/slack and why I didn’t get anything done this afternoon and I won’t know what to tell them. I am not really close with any of my coworkers so I don’t really want to tell them straight up. I am the youngest of them by at least 15 years so I feel like there’s a pretty big disconnect. I trust my boss and I might start telling him about these things but I have not yet and I’m not sure if I want to start now.

What do you all think?"
595,Eternally stuck in-between: unable to do things I want without killing my interest and joy. Does anyone know how to get out of this hell cycle?,"I'm having one of these familiar moments again. I hope someone knows what I'm talking about and what to do about it.

In essence, I'm stuck really badly wanting to do something, but I know for a fact, the moment I really get into it and ""release"" that energy to pour into an actual project, I'm going to completely lose all joy and interest, like a switch that's been flicked. It's not unlike right between being extremely hungry and about to make food. It's very similar in the general experience; when I'm starting to get hungry (just a while before I start fantasizing about food) I feel amazing, just pure dopamine fest. I look forward to eating but as soon as I do the feeling is gone. I wish I could hold onto that feeling between the two, but it's such a small time frame. I can't do anything about it either. If I don't eat, I know I'll start feeling shaky and worse after a while, but if I do, I'll feel bad also. I just can't win.

The same applies to the feeling I'm talking about. I'll have a lot of ideas for a story, and the thought of making it reality excites me as much as thinking about food does when I'm getting really hungry. But the moment I let it out of my head, regardless of the quality or accuracy to my mental image, it's like the fire of passion is blown out in an instant. I have a histoy of getting obsessed with things and after a while like gum that's been chewed on for too long, it'll lose its charm completely. I'm not talking about shifting to a casual interest, I mean I completely stop caring and it invokes nothing within me anymore. I can't stand it. There has been something I've managed to stay interested in for a long time by limiting my consumption of its media, I'll take breaks in intervals but I have to come back every now and then or I'll also lose interest and wonder why I was interested in the first place. It's very hard to maintain. And it's one of the few things that make life endurable to me, and incidentally it's also what this is about. A project, a story I have in mind to write about it, but my greatest fear is I will kill my one joy by releasing it from my headspace. It's like I have hands made of knives and a dog that I love but no matter how strong the feeling I can't touch it, because I've already killed so many things in the past, I want this one to be around, but it will always feel like there is a distance I can't reach, I can't obtain the one thing I long for, winning and failing are in the same spot and doing nothing doesn't feel like the solution either."
596,Please help,"I feel like I have no more options. I’m afraid of what I’m going to do. I’ve spent all of 2019 trying to find a therapist and the first few months of 2020 and all of them haven’t worked out because of either money problems and yes I’m using benefits from my insurance but I have to have a certain amount of money put down for the deductible in order for them to cover 80% of the cost. I had a therapist all lined up for April 7th. I was suppose to get an email from her and never did. I called her and she didn’t answer so I left a voicemail two days ago. I never got a response. I then called again today and she didn’t answer. I’m tired of looking for therapist, I’m tired of praying and being told to pray because I do and it’s like I’m unheard. I feel alone and I don’t have anyone to talk to.
People keep suggesting that I talk to friends. I don’t have any because I graduated high school and we all went out separate ways. And in college I haven’t made any friends that I’m comfortable with. I’m also told to talk to family members and I’ve tried, but it’s too much for them. They don’t want to hear it. I have no one. 

I feel stupid when I pray because nobody’s listening to me. I feel stupid when I cry. I feel stupid when I try because it feels like nobody’s listening. I’ve been trying so hard and it’s still not good enough. I’m not sure I’m meant for this life. I don’t know what to do."
597,Realized something,"I have WAAAAYYYY too much time to think these days. I guess that's a problem for a lot of people here. 

We just got a large tax refund back, plus the kids' SSI checks and my SSD check all came in, so the balance in our checking account is quite...hefty. I am able to buy whatever I desire (within some reason of course) and getting food isn't an issue nor is paying our rent and bills. 

I'm not saying this to brag...I realized that having money is a good thing but it doesn't buy happiness. We have everything we need but I'm still as absolutely miserable (disorder-wise) as I was. I can understand to a lesser degree that saying now. I know a lot of ""Stars"" like Robin Williams had even more money than we do and ... Well we know how his story ended. I dunno the point of this post. I am so grateful things economically are okay for us (we are also receiving a stimulus payment from the government because of the shut-down due to danged COVID-19) so we are really going to be ok. This all will see us through til this is over I am sure....

I guess what I'm wondering is why I'm still miserable...suicidal...self-harming...

I have no reason to be depressed really. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense or if it seems like I'm bragging about having sufficient means at the moment.

I am truly baffled."
598,Depersonalization,"Not sure if it’s dissociation or depersonalization, but it’s this state of “%?&lt;&gt;,&gt;?&lt;€?%” (which is the best way I can explain it) 

I’m not sure what’s happening to me when I feel dissociation, but the first time I did I couldn’t stop feeling it for two weeks. I think it’s because I was 15 and still didn’t know how in depth the world runs. I can’t really explain it. It’s like feeling like nothing bad could possibly happen to your emotional state because it’s never happened before. You feel like the world is “easy” or something. Anyway I think I was probably having cognitive dissonance which confused me and shocked me. I was appalled at the idea that I’d ever end up feeling anything other than my emotions. It felt like I was experiencing an emotion from a different universe and it felt like this emotion wasn’t actually felt by any organism on earth before. Trying to explain it is like describing the way the color green would look like if it had never been seen before.

I used to think I was the only person who has ever felt this before. This whole storm in my brain was caused by a rumor about a girl I grew up with in my school doing something I never thought she’d do. Since I had no idea what was going on I associated myself with this girl. I started constantly trying to figure out how to become a different version of myself. Every time someone insulted the girl I felt angry at them. It got to a point where I stood out in the street and didn’t care whether or not I lived or died. Safety wasn’t a concern for me anymore. I had went from being content with my life to being miserable on an entirely different state of consciousness. Eventually since I couldn’t make sense of the world around me I started to get depressed. I had been admitted to a hospital. Then I was diagnosed with mild depression and I was put on Prozac. I didn’t actually have depression until I got out of the hospital. I start hating myself because my life, while seemingly normal, is starting to make less and less sense and I feel like I’m going crazy. I’ve been put on 5 different medicines in the past, each of them have their own negative effect on me. I start feeling a desire to control people, I start feeling like I’m probably just making everything up and like I’ve wasted 2 years of my life “pretending” to have a mental illness. I get diagnosed with C-PTSD which I didn’t find out about until this year.  Sometimes I feel like all my emotions are more intense than they should be. Sometimes I find myself thinking that either the world sucks or I’m just less than everyone. Either way it makes me feel like the world is against me.

Also this girl I know has been prominent in my life for years and I never noticed until I got into 9th grade. She might have started out as a crush that young kids have, but it turned into a much bigger thing to me. Not sure if it’s autism or something (There’s a good chance I have autism) but I feel way different about her than most dudes seem to feel like when it comes to a girl they grew up with.  I have no idea why I care about her so intensely and I creep myself out sometimes because I feel like it’s just not normal. I’ve been seeing her less and less each year and it feels awful, but I accept letting it go because I feel like I need to. It hurts a lot and I wish I didn’t feel this way."
599,How the fuck do I stop caring about people who don’t care about me?!,It kills me inside.
600,Throwaway as i dont feel comfortable to share from my original account..Fear of relapse,"So basicly i used to suffer from clinical depression,social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder.I am currently 18 and for last year i spent a lot of time on working on myself,healing from childhood traumas etc..I have come really far and i can say im no longer depressed and started enyoying [life.As](https://life.As) i used to supress alot of my emotions and generaly would runaway from any problem that came i decided to stop that..I have solved most of my problems but i spent last year almost constantly on thinking about it and solving it...And now when i start doing something and focus on my hobbies or doing something for fun i start having a guilt feelinges that im not working on myself and that if i continue to do to that il relapse and i am really really scared of coming back to that stage and basicly my fear of relapse is stopping me from going on and living my life to the fullest.Any advice would be thankful.."
601,I don’t really think I exist,"I always sought death since I was a child, now I’m a theoretical physicist and still don’t really think I exist and still seek death, life for me it’s just a fraction of experiences which it ends. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I don't really like people, don't like to be around them, they’re only distraction to me. I don't feel anything. I suffer from a severe identity crisis to a point that some days I don't even recognize myself in the mirror. I feel trapped, I look at the universe as an entire thing and the fact that I'm just teeny tiny part of it makes me feel that I don't really exist. no, not really."
602,It sucks having derealisation during a lockdown,"Lol It’s like what’s going on,  but x2"
603,Struggle with trusting others when wanting to open up,I have difficulty in trusting and opening up to people in my life. I describe myself as really quiet and introverted (always have been). However whenever i go through mental struggles i naturally want to talk to the closest person to me and let some things of my chest. Problem is im very sensitive because ive expressed my emotions to other people (family members) when i was a child and have gotten comments such as 'get over it' 'stop acting weak' continuously throughout my life. These comments were even made when i was having panic attacks or meltdowns. I always felt misunderstood and lonely. Whenever i open up to people it seemed my trust was continually broken. Writing this is even a lot for me. I would like to try and trust others with talking as i face my fear of judgement and lack of acceptance. Any advice how to gain trust back with people?
604,I don't know what to call this?,"I'm not sure how to start any of this so I'll just bring this up and work from there: I'm terrified of growing up. I'm 15 (turning 16 in a few months) and the thought of growing older and having to support myself always makes me feel sick to my stomach. I'm very dependent on my dad and my mom isn't in my life anymore (not like I want her to be anyway); I can't function without someone telling me what I should be doing, and I'm kind of dog shit at making and sort of schedule for myself.

This quarantine thing also really affects that because, now that I'm doing online classes and can work at my own pace, I end up putting everything off until last minute (Hell I'm doing that right now). I try to work on it, but I also don't like change all that much. I'm really lazy and I give up on things easily; I could probably come back to it if I wanted to, but I really only am able to work in short bursts.

Moving on from that, one of the reasons I'm afraid to grow up is because the realization that I'm going to be alone in the world terrifies me. I'm not interested in dating people and I sure as hell don't want kids, but the thought of being by myself in some apartment somewhere just scares me.

All of this just leads to me using other sorts of media to distract myself from all of these fears. Let it be a book, TV show, Manga, or anime series, I engross myself into their world and let all my worries slip away. Hell, I do that with my own story that I've created.The problem with this, however, is that it makes me slip into a delusion somewhat? I think I might be a Maladaptive Daydreamer (I don't know for sure, honestly). I daydream pretty much all day every day, and I often project myself into the main character of whatever I'm into (in this case it's the main character of my own story because I daydream about that the most). Sometimes, if I'm trying to do something else, I get distract and I just want to daydream for hours on end (I have before).

All of that daydreaming, however, leads me to some weird depersonalization-like moments. I look at myself in the mirror and I can't recognize myself. My face doesn't feel like my own and my body feels like it doesn't belong. Then I crash and realize that I'm a real person- a real\* person with real needs, memories, and people actually think about me and can see me. Then it dawns on me that, the people I'm surrounded by are real people as well. I realize the same things as before- real people with memories, personalities, and needs. I remember that this is reality- that I'm not any sort of character in a cool fantasy story, but I'm just an average 15-year-old girl living a mundane life and am indistinguishable from a crowd. It's soul crushing in the moment, honestly.

Every time I do that, I feel weightless- my head spaces out and I just feel weird- knowing that who I'm looking at is...me. I don't even feel like I'm looking at myself, but someone else; then the dream breaks and reality sets in, I think about my fears and what reality really is, and then I force myself to forget and move on.

Maybe indulging in the fantasy world via movies and shows isn't too good for a person like me, but without the distraction all I do is worry about the future, then I lament over the fact that I have no idea what to do in the future and how I don't know how to survive on my own. I know I'm still young and I still have time, but I feel like I should have at least the simple things figured out already, but I don't. I need the distraction of my own daydreams or else I just spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway this was really long-winded and all over the place, but I really needed to get this out of my system because I have no one else to talk to about this."
605,My thoughts are getting dark again,"3 months ago, I decided to seek help for my ongoing battle with anxiety and depression. I’ve had suicidal thoughts ever since I was a child. Something happened that sent me spiralling out of control and I decided it was time to try and get better. It was that or I would end up killing myself. 

I was doing a lot better until this covid situation. I work as a pharmacy tech so I still have to go to work and interact with patients. My boss tries to keep us safe but I don’t feel safe. I’m going crazy at home because I live on my own but at least I have amazing coworkers. I was told we would have to reorganize things at work and my new position would be the only one with direct patient contact which means I won’t be in contact with any of my coworkers. They’re the only people I can talk to. They’re the ones keeping me somewhat sane. 

I don’t want to be completely isolated. I’m terrified to be all alone at home AND at work. I’m terrified of being the only one interacting face to face with patients. I’m already going crazy thinking about it. I keep thinking maybe this is a sign I shouldn’t have gotten help. I should’ve just let it get really bad and I never would’ve had to deal with this cause I’d be dead anyway. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t know how to live right now. I’m so scared of everything and everyone but mostly myself."
606,Inability to socialize unless forced,"As the title says, I generally am unable to go out and socialize with others. I prefer to spend my time alone, in my room. I'm not afraid of anything, I just don't want to socialize. This has been consistent for over a year now. It's made me disconnect with friends outside of school. I don't reach out to people not because I dislike them, but because I generally don't want to interact with others. This includes instant family as well. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and my mother thinks I don't want to interact because I'm afraid of judgment. I'm not. I just don't want to interact. It frustrates me because I feel weird and 'not normal'. I also generally don't have any motivation to do things other than mess around on my phone, read, play video games, or just scroll through the internet on the computer. I feel that there's more to it than just depression and anxiety. I've thought about antisocial personality disorder, and it generally fits (not wanting to interact, irritability and irritation, repeatedly failing to complete any work, poor relationships, irresponsibility), but I also have doubts about it as well, because I don't have problems understanding others(I can actually read others pretty well), I don't do any risk-taking behaviors, and I've never had problems with the law. Is there something else to it other than depression and anxiety, or am I just reading too much into it?  
Edit: To add, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety five years ago. I don't think I really have any anxiety anymore. I don't get worried about anything. I'm also on depression/anxiety medication, but I've been constantly switching them because of a variety of different things (unable to concentrate, sleeping a lot, eating barely anything, no improvement of depression)."

609,Need help with understanding new bizarre behavior,"Hi there, I suffer from anxiety, depression, BPD, and Tourette’s (it’s a great time lol). I am fairly comfortable and familiar with the symptoms but recently I am experiencing new symptoms. Over the past few days at least about a half dozen times a day I find myself getting this sudden massive burst of energy where I grit my teeth and flex want to yell and not hit something per say but want to release this feeling of pent up energy. This usually lasts about 30 seconds and then I am back to my normal mild mannered self, it’s almost like I’m hulking up or something. Obviously this has been pretty concerning but I can generally get it under control quickly, if anyone has experienced anything like this or has any advice please let me know. If it helps I can post the medications I’m taking as well."
610,I think I suspect something,"So, this kind of behavior of mine has been going on for as long as I can remember. I've only started to take notice of it though in the past 2 years.
Since early childhood I've always had an issue with skin picking. It's a bad habit, yes, but I never had any idea what caused it. It still goes on, sometimes more severe sometimes less. It's this overwhelming urge to remove any little area of dry skin or imperfection. It used to mainly happen on my fingers and toes (I also had a big issue with nail biting), though now it has moved onto my face, causing scarring. But my mind won't let me stop. I know it's bad, it's just not healthy, I just don't know the cause or how to not do it.
Another strange symptom I encounter is, no matter where in my house, if there's a mirror or reflective surface, I pull up my shirt and stare at my waist. I've always been on the heavier side, but always in the healthy range. And I pinch and prof, and it's just a reflex at this point. Same thing with my face, I'll stare at it for several minutes. This also happens really frequently throughout the day, too many to count.
I don't know if this is an issue. But it does seem to take a toll on my mental health. Does anybody else do this? Should I see someone about this? Could this be some kind of OCD or BDD? It's just that it's been going on for so long, and I never knew why, and I want to stop. Thank you for reading this post! I appreciate it a lot"
611,Overwhelming crisis,Please help
612,Feeling exposed,"I had a very hard upbringing. There are things that happened in my past that I never want to discuss. My partner of 15 years came from a very privileged life. I have done well to contain my past, move on, and do very well financially. Covid 19 has my partner very concerned, which I understand. It’s a bad situation. However, this is far from the worse I have ever experienced and therefore I’m minimally concerned. I own property, have a stable secure job, life insurance, building insurance, employment insurance, no dependants and good health. My partner feels I’m not sympathetic to what’s going on. I am sympathetic but feel worse things happen and continue to happen on a daily basis. I feel that he is being selfish just because this is just something that is affecting him personally. I don’t hear him worrying about the starving children, war, poverty, homelessness, animal abuse, child abuse, domestic abuse, suicide, mental health, pollution, cancer and everything else going on on a daily basis all year round.

I guess what I’m asking, is there something wrong with me? The fact that I don’t care? I always knew my upbringing would effect me. Until now I never knew I was so emotionally switched off. I don’t know what I’m trying to say. This recent situation has made aware of how disengaged I am with other people’s emotions.  I have this ability to switch off and just not care about things. I don’t think this is normal. I think my partner has started to notice my lack of emotions. I’m not depressed, I’m content with my current life. I have achieved more than I ever thought I would. Emotionally I just feel numb most of the time. 

I don’t know what I’m trying to say. I just think there is something wrong with me emotionally and I don’t know what to do."
613,if you wanna hear abt a healthy friendship i suggest you read this,"so, my friends mack and i have been friends for about 2 years now.  he’s very self reliant yet extroverted and full of confidence, and i’m pretty kept to myself, anxious in many areas, reassuring to others but not to myself.  

to make it into smaller words, he’s perfectly everything i’m not and we seem to balance each other out.  

ive definitely become more confident in my being since i met him and more dependent on myself.  he’s become more understanding and comfortable in opening up. 

there’s times when i feel like i’m at the bottom of the abyss of life then he just pops his head over and we talk through it and things are good.  

he’s a senior and i’m a junior, i’m not as nervous as i was in the beginning of him leaving and me being on my own, but i’m going to miss him so much."
614,What can I do for ailing friend,"Hi Reddit, i am struggling with what sort of mental support I can provide for a friend who is not doing well under the circumstances of self isolation. 

I am often good at supporting friends while they have depressive/anxiety episodes, but I feel that I am also dealing with these things myself. To be honest, I find it very difficult to provide help in the form of company because of my current struggles with depression/anxiety (though I would not say that I am suicidal). She is on Lexapro, has reported having difficulty sleeping, and has expressed having suicidal thoughts today. I don’t think she is taking care herself very well at all, and I am at a loss as to what to do given the limitations of COVID-19 and my own abilities. I have suggested that she get a therapist (even Betterhelp.com), go outside, take less naps, and drink less. I don’t think she’s really doing those things. Do you all have any suggestions?"
615,Just needing support....,"Anyone else been taken advantage of by everyone you know and then abandoned just to be by yourself?? Had 26 people close to you die in the past 17 years?

Just because I'm mentally Ill doesnt mean I'm not a responsible adult. Just because it's called a sickness doesnt mean I'm sick. Just because I may not see the ways you could manipulate my generosity doesnt mean you have to use or take from me. Just because I'm ""autistic"" it doesn't mean the world needs to shun me and doctors need to ""cure"" me or give cause for scientists to  manipulate the genetic combination so that another being like me isn't ever created again....

616,Help with an undiagnosed bipolar family member,"I am new to this sub reddit, but I feel like due to the current pandemic I am out of resources. My brother is 25 years old, and showing all the signs of being manic for the last few weeks. He has had 2 psychiatric evaluations, both voluntary and one in an ER after my mother and I begged him, and they both concluded he only had anxiety due to him using his manipulative behavior and lies. I have just graduated nursing school, so I am well aware of what bipolar mania looks like, and I fear for my parents and brothers well being having to deal with this for so long without treatment. He stays up all night, lacks impulse control, spends excessive amounts of money on alcohol even though he is not currently working and has no income, and has aggressive mood swings. He often chants loudly to god, and has shaved off his eyebrows and dresses very out of the ordinary, for example wearing 2 hats around the house and an American flag. He starts fights with my family almost every night, and after 2 misdiagnoses with psychiatric evaluations we are at a loss. Due to his age, the people performing the evaluation will not take my mothers reports of his behavior as a primary source, and instead believe my brother who is lying about his problems and symptoms to seem like there is nothing wrong. Obviously I understand his illness is not his fault, but the lack of treatment due to misdiagnoses is weighing heavily on the whole family. Does anyone have any experience with this or know what we may be able to do? Any help is appreciated!"
617,Does your mental health improve if you stay off social media?,"Does anyone have no social media and find that it’s helpful at all?

618,"I’m scared,am I developing schizophrenia?","So I have had dpdr (be diagnosed with dpdr disorder)  for a while it’s about a year and since having it I have had a fear of schizophrenia. In the beginning the fear was crippling, it’s calmed down for a few months till recently. Most of time I’ve only had to deal with dr but dp has hit me hard and made me question if I’m developing schizophrenia and being back the fear of it. I’m looking up what onset schizophrenia is like and watching people’s videos on how it started for them and it gets me scared cause I experience some of the onset symptoms but a person said that it’s nothing to worry about yet cause those symptoms all go along with the beginning of other mental disorders like depression and anxiety. I’m scared that any second now I’m going to start hallucinating or any second I’m going to hear a voice, I get pictures in my head hallucinating. Something I also get like a thought  of where I’m hallucinating in my current environment and check and nothing is happening. Adding to that is I keep on getting these what if question like what if there are cameras or what if people are using me, cause I saw that these are types of delusions I don’t believe in them but they just pop up and they scare me. I’m able to get reassurance for a short time before before I’m back at questioning my sanity. I can’t get back to my old psychologist because we can’t afford it rn. Any thoughts would be very much appreciated."
619,Question about getting help,What is the difference in getting medicated by a psychiatrist vs. a physicians assistant?
620,13 years of the same treatment,"I’ve had 13 years of my life with the same treatment.
I think the happiest time of my life is not being in the education system which for me is until you’re at the age to go to nursery.
In my first nursery I was locked in a dark room for 2 hours for not wanting to share with some other child.
I was later switched to a nursery which I was happy at and thought was a good nursery which keyword is was because as I found out it wasn’t due to the people there.
I found this out on my 3rd day in reception where I was getting attacked by another child for playing with Lego which the teaching assistant then proceeded lock me in a supply closet and from the start of school which was 9 am to Lunch which was 12.
When I told my parents they went into school and complained.
Somehow the reason the teaching assistant locked me in the supply closet is something to do with the fact that the nursery past over information of me being apparently diagnosed with “autism” (which is a lie since I later found out I have PTSD thanks to the lovely treatment of The education system) which somehow made the teaching assistant think I (who was defending my self against another child) was having a autistic meltdown which somehow by her thinking skills made her think the right way to deal with it is lock me in a supply closet (filled with equipment that wouldn’t be very safe or good for my health if it fell on me). 
Thanks to the nursery passing over information of me being “autistic” I was placed in the lower part of the class which wasn’t even a part of the class as all the kids i was placed with either had Down syndrome, autism or some other learning disabilities therefore up until y3 since the teachers didn’t really care about the “special needs kids” education I didn’t know how to read and write (hence my really terrible handwriting that looks like something a y3 would write).
And thanks for me defending myself against another child attacking I started to get bullied which still hasn’t stopped.
When I got into y1 I was then starting to get bullied by year 2s and year 3s and even year 6s and it wasn’t just verbal it was physical which thankfully learned me to defend myself against all the years up until year 5 where I was easily overpowered.
When I defended myself though it would be straight back to my good old friend the supply closet.
Thankfully my parents made the decision to move me at the start of key stage 2.
Year 3 and year 4 are genuinely the only years where I think the education system was easy on me and thanks to having teachers for the first 2 years in junior year I was able to read and write and I was moved to middle set for everything and top set for reading.
Year 5 though they decided it was a good idea to implement the red book.
(So to sum up the red book in a few sentences it a book where if you did anything deemed “naughty” and “misbehaving” by the schools headteacher or your teacher it would be straight into the red book)
The first person to be put into the red book would be chosen as the class example and I was that person.
Why did I get put in you may ask? 
Well it was just because someone in my class decided that it would be a good idea to stab me in the leg with a pencil where I in shock after just being stabbed in the leg with a pencil shouted fuck across the entire classroom.
Somehow the person who stabbed me wasn’t told off at all even though there was a blatant pencil sticking out my leg.
Through the months I kept on getting put in for either A) retaliating or B) verbally abusing another student for verbally abusing me.
It was sometime in year 5 where I just snapped and one night I decided to hang myself.
It didn’t work thankfully but the few weeks I got off from my parents to recover from almost asphyxiating to death was a genuine relief and I was happy.
Year 6 came around and people started to physically bully me again.
I remember coming home with a broken nose after having my head constantly slammed into a fence for simply “hey that’s a bit mean” after hearing another classmate be mean to a boy in y4 ( who is one of my only true friends).
I came in the next day and the people who were constantly physically abusing me in blatant range of the teachers on duty were gonna physically abuse me all over again for one the many days on a ongoing streak.
But on that day I was honestly sick and tired of getting beat up for simply getting an education.
One of them came to punch me and I hit him over the head with my bag.
It ended up just like in the movies.
I had him on the floor and was kicking the shit out of him for trying to punch me until a teacher broke the fight up which somehow never happened even when I was getting a broken nose by having my head repeatedly slammed against the fence.
We were both subsequently put in the red book.
My last few weeks of year 6 were spent in the same repetitive cycle every day.
Wake up.
Go to school.
Get into a fight.
Go home.
Go to sleep.
Repeat.
The summer leading up to year 7 wasn’t like any other summer though.
I wasn’t constantly pissing myself over the thought of having to step foot in school in six weeks.
I went into year 7 and I was instantly ditched by all my y6 friends which subsequently want me back because I hangout with a crowd of people who are more popular than them but me I’m not really popular I’m just the quiet kid that hangs out with them because they took pity on me.
The friend group I’m with now in y8 is somehow much different.
In summer we all played Xbox with eachother and came back in year 8 and all they do everyday on and off Xbox and at school is just make fun of me for “being ginger” or “being less intelligent then them” (which recently backfired on them when I was put into the top half of the school and most them were in the lower half).
They make fun of me for being smaller than them even though I’m the joint 3rd tallest person in the group (if you go by shoulder height Im the 2nd tallest)
I’ve recently been contemplating switching schools to just have a fresh start at life in a school where nobody knows me but I have been pissinf myself over the fact that I’ll be lonely again.
I’m turning 14 in December and look forward to y11 getting over done with and this whole coronavirus lockdown of the country has genuinely been a massive relief.
I’m going to y9 after summer and all I know is that I’ll either be in the same rinse and repeat cycle of being made fun of but then being told “it’s banter” or I’ll be in a different school either a loner or with an actual good friend group"
621,What can I do please,"I’ve suffered from depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder for a long time now. I’m a 23 year old man, what is it is for the last two months I’ve been suffering more with my OCD more than anything. Basically I believe I have a problem with my external occipital protuberance (the ball on back of head) so I’ve constantly been touching it, 3 times every 5 minutes for the last two months straight. I had booked a CT to put my mind at ease as I feel unwell and believe it’s down to that but it’s been postponed due to the virus. I also can’t see my councillor either, all I have is my anti depressants and they aren’t helping my OCD as you can see. Touching it this much I believe is just making it worse as it’s repeated trauma to the same spot over and over, please someone anyone who can give me advice on what to do as I can’t stop from doing this ‘ritual’ I know I need serious help but it’s obviously unavailable at the moment. Any words are kindly appreciated"
622,I fantasize about blowing my brains out at the slightest inconvenience.,"I seem to have these periods where I just can't emotionally handle anything negative. If something goes slightly wrong I just feel completely overwhelmed with negative emotions like anger or sadness.

It always results in this downward spiral where I find pleasure in the thought of just blowing my brains out all over the wall with a gun.

I just can't control these floods of mental discomfort no matter how hard I try or how well I rationalise things. It's like my thoughts physically manifest themselves into full on bodily discomfort.

Sometimes just hearing background noise can drive me nuts, or failing at a task triggers a similar response to if I'd spilled boiling water on my hand. If I get pissed off at something I just irrationally have this urge to destroy shit. It's like this hot tension everywhere that I can't control and the only way to deal with it is to forcibly transfer it out onto something. 

I don't get this all the time, but when I do, everything causes me discomfort. I hate it, I don't want to feel like this and I know it's completely disproportionate to whatever triggered it."
623,"Possible eating disorder and depression is getting worse with the quarantine (f,21)","Hey (f, 21), so before every college basically shutdown I went to get help with my emotions. I had been feeling more and more sad everyday to the point where I didn't know if I wanted to be alive anymore. I say sad because I don't like saying I'm depressed because I know that it's really hard for people and I don't want to take away meaning from that title. Well anyways I went to get help with the school services twice, and each time I felt even worse. It was the most none constructive appointment I've ever been in. They cut me off the first session when I was about to get into my real problems and I just didn't feel I could talk to this person after that so the second appointment was just as bad. The fact that I couldn't even have THERAPY workout really didn't help my motivation and hopes for things. 

I started getting slightly better after these appointments because I was talking to someone close to me more but I know I still needed help. I have an eating problem where if I'm overly stressed, bored or you know just sad/numb I eat a lot and I don't feel like I can stop. It was in check while I was at school because I could rock climb and control everything that was in my house to eat (usually not much I made sure of that I just ate at the dining halls). I managed to lose 15lbs and was feeling good about my body for the first time. Well now being home for a couple weeks I've probably already put all that weight back on, I never feel like moving and I just numb myself with food, T.V., and video games. 

So I guess just to sum it up being home has made it really hard to stay happy even though my home life isn't bad. I feel like I'm losing control and I think I know how to get back on track but it feels harder than ever. I've even started to feel like I don't want to be alive again and I hate it . I've had more than my fair share of crap happen over the past few years and I don't think I've managed to deal with it all properly. If anyone has any advice please let me know. I'm going to try online therapy but I'm not sure how comfortable I feel about that. I am willing to give it a shot."
624,I have to make a big life decision and I feel like I'm not in the right place mentally to do so,"In a little over a month I will be graduating from college and I will have earned a degree in computer science. I like programming, however I can't stand the office environment. It feels so soulless and pointless.

I'm considering teaching instead, and have even been accepted into the college I need to go to in order to get my Masters in Education, I just need to accept their offer. But I struggle so much with self-doubt, I don't know if this is the right decision. What if I'm not a good teacher? What if I'm not an effective communicator? What if I'll be too mean? What if I'll be too nice?

To put things simply, I have been really unhappy for the past couple years, and I'm scared that it's just an inevitable reaction to the stresses of everyday life. I'm so scared I'm never gonna be happy again. I'm so scared I'm gonna end up in a job I despise, and I'm gonna continue to barely drag myself out of bed in the morning, and every night I'm gonna go to bed dreading the next day. I want so so much to have a purpose in life but I don't see one.

I'm 21 years old and I don't feel any different than when I was 15. In fact, somehow I feel even worse off. I'm still scared. I'm still horribly indecisive. I don't feel anything anymore apart from fear, anger, and hopelessness. Does everyone feel this way? Is anyone really happy with their life or are most folks just getting by? I genuinely want to know how others feel about this because I don't know if I'm cracking up or if it's just the reality of life.

I guess I'm viewing teaching as a way to make a positive difference in someone's life. But my doubts and insecurities are holding me back. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to find my purpose. I need to have made my decision in a few days time and I just feel so lost.

If anyone out there can relate to how I'm feeling I'd love to hear your thoughts on things."
625,Biiig biiiig trigger warning! Be cautious Redditors thank you,"I took a lot of diazepam. Not an overdose according to the BNF. I took the amount that they use for sedation. So it won’t kill me but I’m chilled af. Which is why I have the balls to type this. I wouldn’t usually have these steel balls but here I am! Thank yOU DIAZEPAM gods. Anyways
Back to the story
If you didn’t get the message before there’s a big fat old TRIGGER WARNING BELOW. K?
I’m having major big urges to set myself on fire. I’ve burned myself badly loads of times and had loads of surgeries but this time I want to fully set myself on fire. Like whoosh. Fire. 
If I tell people I could get sectioned or also they may tell me it’s my choice so go ahead (any mental health professionals on here? What’s your thoughts guys?) but if I don’t tell anyone then I’m going to be a raging fireball and cause distress to people and also burden the NHS if I survive. What the f*ck do I do. 
Just “not doing it” isn’t an option unfortunately. I already asked my brain that. It said no. It said fireball or tell someone. Maybe both. I need some serious help. But they won’t help me because they always just say it’s my decision! Which is true. But Jesus I’m in one big old depression spiral. Like the catatonic sort of type? I can pee and browse my phone sometimes but mostly just staring at the ceiling and that’s no good for anyone. 
Pls help reddit. I’m a bit lost. I swear I’m not arrogant or anything. Just real chill right now. I’m actually a smol 5ft 2” gay but don’t tell anyone I’m gay because that’s a secret ish.
I very much truly appreciate any help or advice and take it on board. Stay safe in these scary times people.
Thanks"

628,Social Media’s Energy,I haven’t been on reddit but for a few hours and I’ve noticed quite a few patterns of people being really rude to others and basically adults cyber bullying each other.

What could possibly be causing this behavior and making people think it’s ok to judge someone that they’ve only briefly encountered on some post on the internet? What can we do to stop this behavior?
629,I wish I could cry.,"Day 10 of social isolation.

Like many I've had to increase online/text based comms with my few friends due to a lack of seeing them.

Unfortunately, I've always really struggled with telling emotion/intent/meaning in texts and IMs and hate chatting this way. When I'm forced to do so, I quickly loose touch with my friends as I tent to give blunt or misguided responses and eventually the conversations run dry. Which is exactly what's happening with my friends now.

I know things will go back to normal, but how long will this take - and will my friends stick with me as they have to correspond with me on a social level that I simply cannot hack.

Additionally, not only do I struggle to read emotion and intent online, I struggle to portray it too. I made a bad joke that I now regret and it backfired on twitter, I understand where I went wrong but I meant it light hearted and thought that the recipient would understand, I don't know if she did but her friends certainly didn't and confronted me.

Furthermore, my best friend's father figure passed away from the virus yesterday. Although I'd only met him a couple of times he'd always been extremely kind, loving and accepting of me into his life. This virus can take anyone, it can take the nicest people and it's scared me. If this virus can take something so valuable from my best friend, what can it take from me?

I'm stuck with my parents, who although I love to bits - get on my nerves, especially my dad. I normally go for drives/walks to get away from them - they normally go out frequently so I get time alone, obviously, there is none of this now. I hate it, I just want a moment to breathe away from them for a while. And then I realise how selfish I am for thinking that, as they are vulnerable and this virus might take them from me.

My antidepressants don't let me cry - I wish I could cry."
630,mental struggles has resurfaced,"so i don't quite know how to start this, i've never really talked about these things with anyone.

i've been struggling with two ""subtypes"" of ocd for a while, dermatillomania and dermatophagia. that is skin biting and picking. i've been struggling with both of these since around 2015. the skin picking got better for a bit, or at least so i thought. i won't go into details as what i did is quite graphic, but instead of picking on my scalp, i started picking on my pimples (especially on my back). i started biting on my fingers, and thought i no longer had a problem. this continued for at least a year, until someone pointed out how damaged my fingers are late last year. since then it has only gotten worse. my face is full of scars, my fingers look disgusting, and my back is full of pimbles that has turned into bumps. 

i've also been struggling with depression since around 2014, but i've been feeling quite fine since the start of 2019, and i've stopped going to a therapist. i was doing generally very good, and i used to maybe only have one depressive episode a month. after online school started, i've been staying up till 3am every day, because i'm extremely restless and i have so so many thoughts. i've always been restless, and i need several things to focus on at the same time to manage. there has been little to nothing to do, and because of this i feel hopeless. i've had to be face to face with my underlying depressive thoughts. these include feeling hopeless, not being worth anything, never falling in love, and being mediocre at everything. there's so many things i wish i could do, but i don't have the money or means to. this hurt me especially much, as i've always had big dreams. realising i'm nothing special is never a good realisation. i feel like all my efforts go unseen, even though i try my best and work hard. all my friends are in relationships while i'm not even close to being in one. i'm gay and it's really hard to find other gay guys where i live. this a big part of me feeling doen, i think. i often dream about being close to someone like that. i've been close a few times, but every time the other guy just looses interest in me. this makes me feel unloveable, but i can't force them to like me either.

school is also a thing i worry about. i used to be a child genius, but like most child geniuses, i never learnt to revise, and now i'm below average. first semester and i've changed my major three times. i'm very happy with the one i'm studying right now, but i can't do well on tests and in class. i have a general learning disability, which makes me learn things very differently or not at all.combining this and my constant restlessness has made me pretty much fail in school. i'm an average student, but in the hard courses (math &amp; science), i do extremely bad. every one around me keeps tellign me that i need to revise more, or that i dont revise at all. that's not too far from the truth in some cases, as i've lost all motivation there is. if i'm interested in the subject, i'll do pretty good, though.

this has been all over the place, but i have so many thought trapped inside my head. i would like to point out that i don't want to die at all, i'm not suicidal. i'm just not content with my life. i feel like i can do better, but i physically can't. thanks for reading this, it truly means a lot to know someone is listening to me. (also please ignore any spelling misatkes, it's 1am and my keyboard isn't english)"

This year I started a therapy youtube channel and since there is such an emphasis on bettering your mental health, I thought it would be a good idea to post it here. Stay safe everyone!

634,my problems aren't that big..?,"i've had multiple friends self-harm and a few even attempting suicide. some have still been struggling with mental health and cutting, and i always try to be there and support them.

compare that to myself, who's never cut because i'm a bit of a venephobe, and never attempted to commit suicide because i'm afraid of the beyond. i have some weeks where i'm just exceptionally anxious and depressed (i feel like that's too strong of a word?) but i try to play it down since i know it must be nothing compared to what my friends have experienced.

a lot of conflicting thoughts go through my head (even while writing this post). sometimes ""i'm invalidating myself"" and sometimes ""i'm just one of those people who think mental illness is cool to have"".

i don't really know what this post was for. maybe it was to vent to something? or maybe it was for someone to tell me if i'm either valid or simply blowing things out of proportion. feel free to add your comment and input. sorry if i sound like i'm looking for attention."
635,AITA for trying to help a friend with psychosis?,"This got taken down from r/AITA so I've gotta ask it here.

My friend has struggled with anxiety and depression for several years. Recently she was diagnosed with psychosis, which she now uses to explain several things she does that I consider being a bitch. The best example of this is the one I'm asking about. She texted me, telling me that the voices in her head wouldn't shut up and she wanted to kill herself. I tried to call her but she declined it so I was texting her, trying to talk her down. She thanked me, and told me she loved me. I thought she was saying it in a friendly way so I responded ""love you too"". She then asked me if I wanted to come to her house to watch a movie. It was past midnight and my car had no gas, so I told her to raincheck it. She then lashed out at me, telling me that I was leading her on. I asked her what she meant, and she told me that she actually had a crush on me and that I was one of the voices in her head. She said that she and her mental-voice me were in love and dating, and so she decided to ask me for real, and me telling her to raincheck the movie was a rejection. She was really angry, so I told her that she needed to sleep, she wasn't thinking straight and we would talk it out around lunchtime. She wasn't having it. She told me that every time I showed any sort of care towards her, it convinced her more that I loved her back, and her imaginary relationship with mental-voice me grew stronger. So she was mad at me because she had built up this imaginary relationship with me and I accidentally gave her a reality check she didn't want. So she blocked me, and I tried to reach out through friends and through other social media accounts, only to find that she had shut me off completely. So was I wrong to try to talk her down from suicide multiple times and calm her down?"
636,"It's not that I can't sleep, it's that I don't want to","I tried looking into this but most searches are for people who want to sleep but can't. I even talked to my therapist about this but I don't think she quite understands what I mean when I explain to her. I really hate sleeping. No I don't have night terriers or anything like that. I really have no reason to dislike sleeping as much as I do. I just really don't like it. When I end up passing out I feel like a failed or something. Like ""shit I slept"". Maybe it's because I just like to have more time to do the things I want to do. Sleeping sometimes makes me feel like I'm wasting away, even though I don't do anything that productive anyways. And quarantine isn't helping. I stay up until 5 to 6 am and wake up at 11 to 1pm. Yeah I getting some sleep but waking up that late making me feel like shit. I really don't like it. But some nights I don't sleep and I don't feel bad. I actually feel like I did something good. I never really feel tired, though I can tell that I am. I tend to ramble more and I process things a lot slower. And when I'm rambling I'll just randomly forget what I talking about completely. My focus gets worse too, and I already have ADHD. Even though my lack of sleep is causing all things bad things I still try to stay up late. Though there are rare moments when I actually want to sleep, I end up staying up a lot later than normal. I do look at screens a lot, watch videos or draw really late. I've been told to turn them off and just drift to sleep. I can't do that at all, I've tried and it just makes things worse. When I have nothing distracting me, my brain wonders to places I really don't want it to go to. Every time I end up freaking out and crying for hours until I pass out. Which makes me feel really tired when I wake up. I haven't tried it in a long time but I really don't want to since my mom died over the summer. I just can't let my mind wonder or I'll end up thinking about her. That or I just end up thinking about the stories I'm making. Then I get ideas and get all excited and end up feeling really awake. I even drink coffee later in the day so I can stay up later. I know I should be sleeping, all my friends chew me out for it. But I just can't seem to want sleep or just let it happen. It feels like my only way to actually sleep is to just let my body force me into it, even then it's relatively late. I end up never remembering falling asleep, I just remember waking up. Which I hate and makes me not want to sleep. I really don't know how to like sleep. I've been A night owl for most of my life but I didn't start feeling like this until when I became a teen. I'm 17 right now. It just slowly got worse when I got into high school. I really don't know how to fix this, I feel like it's only gonna get worse from here. I only want to fix this so I can be better in school because I think it's been effecting my grades. I feel like I'm so weird for this, idk if anyone else feels this way. I feel like people think I'm crazy when I tell them. I do have anxiety, maybe that's effecting it? It doesn't feel like it is. If anyone has any solutions or tips I'd love to hear some please."
637,why can i only do tasks/ big cleans every so often,i literally haven’t cleaned my room let alone do school work / any self care for like weeks and today i suddenly finished everything i had to do and cleaned my entire room vacuuming and everything and ?? i wanna do a bunch of stuff and it’ll be like this for a few days and then i’ll go back to not wanting to do anything at all
638,"I feel like I'm deteriorating instead of developing and I want to change that. (warning - long, possibly boring)","I was thinking about how to start it in an interesting form and keep it short and I'm afraid I'll fail with both tasks. As you can see this is my first post on this account (I deleted one before) and for years I've been playing conversations in my head about how to talk about stuff like that. I usually came to a conclusion that I'm going in circles in self-pity and that I need to stop. There's also the chance that I'll be totally embarassed by this post tomorrow morning, but I'll let it stay here for ""educational purposes"", even if no one responds.


The main problem is, I think, my mother. I have a lot of holes in my memory from my childhood, a lot of allegedly false memories and I have trouble dealing with my emotions, but I think I had a bad childhood - and may even be abused. My parents are divorced, my dad cheated on my mom. I was about 11 when she learned about that and my father blamed it on her not paying attention to him since I was born and being generally mean. Tbh, I am not sure now if he loved me. Sure, it was fun to play computer games with him and goofing around, but he felt more like an older colleague than a father, however, this might be a false memory imprinted on me by my mom, because his ""Peter Pan syndrome"" was all she was talking about during the divorce process. However, I clearly remember him forgetting about me in a mall, in kindergarten, at school or leaving me alone at home (to go to his mistress probably) and saying things to me like ""remember to always dress nicely and be nice to your husband, not like your mother"". Now, last time I've seen him I was a teenager and I cut contact with him - because my mom wished so.
I have always been afraid of my mother and I always felt that I have to be cautious not to piss her off, which was fairly easy. She could get from being fine to a blind fury in a seconds over me being clumsy, saying something wrong, being too loud, not doing chores, eating too long, eating ""wrong"" (I had trouble swallowing), standing up to her, refusing something. She would also slap me across the face, which was very humiliating. I unconsciously learned to dodge and if I did it before she even tried to slap me and simply by making a sudden movement while yelling at me, this would make her furious and make her order me to come closer and then beat me. She never beat me to the point anything was showing though. This might also be a false memory, but I somehow remember her saying after somehow she caught me looking at myself if anything was visible that ""she's a doctor, she knows how to hit me and leave no trace"". I'm 60% sure it's a false memory though, such phrase might refer to sth different.
It isn't like my life looked like that every day. Far more often than not she was a caring mother, she encouraged me to be the best at school (I'm quite smart, forgive me the lack of modesty), backed me up, offered advice on some topics and generally be a good person. I used to fantasise that there's an evil Doppelgänger that somehow replaced my ""good mother"" and some day during her anger outburst a mysterious door appeares out of nowhere, my ""real"" mom steps out and the ""evil"" one dissapears, defeated. As you can probably imagine, I had (and still have) a whole universe in my head. I would retreat there every time I could.

I was ""trained"" to do certain things. I have this trait even now, that if you tell me to do a certain thing like that and reinforce it with a raised voice or authority or something similar, I'll proceed to do this thing like that from this moment until someone else tells me to do it the other way - which leaves me confused. One of this things is running to a person who waits for me to e.g. start a car. I was once or twice yelled at for being slow/retarded/lazy for walking slowly (I'm a phlegmatic) to her while she's waiting for me in a car while I went to throw away rubbish. I've noticed this and similar behaviors after one friend asked me, totally surprised, why was I running to him, when I went to throw away sth. The same thing is picking up things immediately after my mom dropped them, moving very swiftly out of her way (she got angry if she stumbled upon me), giving her tools with a handle pointing her way, doing certain chores before she comes home from work etc. Not doing some of those stuff now sometimes makes me uncomfortable, but I can easily make myself not do it. I'm still doing the chores though because - I want to help her and I don't want to piss her off.

And this is basically it. I moved out to attend middle school in a different city when I was 16 and since then I felt like my world has changed. I was bullied at school (my mom often said it was my fault because I was weak and let them bully me) and suddenly we were all too busy with school for such shit to happen. I made new friends and I've only came back home for weekends. I've never felt so free before. She missed me and was more often the mom I've always wanted her to be. Then I moved even further across the country to attend university and was coming home only for breaks.

The breaking point was when my only and best friend died. And, (please don't judge) - that was my cat. I'm crying while I'm writing this even if it was 4 years ago. Grief turned into apathy. Then I realised I was ""becoming more stupid"" - I wasn't thinking as swiftly as I used to, made mistakes in numbers, my memory was failing and this scared me. My mom said I'm overreacting, my friends were like ""if only I was as stupid as you think you are"" and I felt left alone. From this moment, it was getting progressively worse with brief moments of improvement. The breaking point was when I moved for a year abroad (which was fun but stressful, but in the same moment challenging and made my mind clearer again) - when I somehow got into my first relationship. I came back home and my mom reverted to her ""bad"" self - calling me names, picking on me, being generally mean. Then I went back to uni and realised that I have never ""loved"" this person, I was scared of this relationship and I was scared of telling him that. I had my first anxiety attack. It felt as if I was falling in a broken elevator, as if I was going to die and there was no way to make this feeling disappear. I later broke up with this guy (mutually, he also thought it won't work) and felt slightly better, but those attacks were now repeating. I started taking Lexapro and hoped it would work. It did, for 8 months.

This year I had one of my most wonderful holidays ever. I had a crush on my friend since a very long time but knew it probably won't work, so I never let it become anything more than a mild crush. Then, he suddenly started showing me this kind of affection that you simply can't mistake for anything less. Then, he admitted he has some feelings for me - and I couldn't believe what I just heard. That was the happiest moment of my life and I told him, that he's more than a friend to me too. We both agreed that we need to think about it, because we now live in different cities, I'm finishing uni etc etc. 

And three days later, after I asked him if he thought anything about it (too soon, I know, but I was too happy), he said he prefers we stayed just friends.
Oof.

We remained (a bit awkward) friends. I went back to my tiny room in my shared flat and started classes. I felt down and rejected, but I thought it was nothing serious. I was also off of Lexapro. And one day I was hit with a proper depressive state. I felt suddenly, that I'm already at the state of dying, there's no point in studying, sleeping or eating, because I as myself do not exist anymore. With the last bits of sanity, I called my mom. She somehow managed to pull me out of it, told me to take Lexapro again and after taking a bigger dose this time, after 3 weeks I felt much better.


Now, back to the topic of this post - what should I do next? I feel I'm getting worse. I'm now stuck with my mom due to corona (we live in a town and it's safer here) and she had a rage episode again. I don't know how to learn how to be in a relationship and love someone that I wasn't already friends with (I've trust issues and I'm not the Tinder type). I'm now 25 and I'm finishing med school and need to decide where to go afterwards - and I'm unable to decide. I lost my ambition towards medicine. I had a row of failures in scientific work and I feel like I can't make it work anymore, because I got more lazy and stupid. I simply have no idea what to do with myself now. I don't have time or money to go to therapy now either.

Please, if you have any advice and came this far with reading, help me."
639,My anxiety issues are health related?,"How can I snap out of this? 

Cure my anxiety? 

It’s all health related. Shortness of breath = cardiac arrest

I’m healthy. 

Today my HR got elevated quickly. Hit my usually max range after 1 single set of exercise. (180BPM), was a bit short of breath obviously this made me a bit worried 

I’ve had a cardiac workup"
640,Feeling shame for wearing a mask at the grocery store,"I made a recent trip to the grocery store to last for the next two weeks or so. My SO and his family has been really cautious and provided us with baggies filled with a package of gloves and a couple surgical masks they've had for a while. My family, on the other hand seems to kind of avoid talking about being cautious. I know they are a little scared but don't really want to admit to what's happening right now. So I feel simultaneously angry at my family for being in la la land and also isolated emotionally from them because they think im an extremist on some level. 

So anyways, my SO and I decided to make a list and head to the store, and since we had these protective materials we thought we might as well use them because it makes sense. We protect ourselves and others. But walking into that store was so difficult. It might have been that I was a little more self conscious than usual but I got quite a few looks from people. A lot of people just not practicing social distancing and an overall, a really intense feeling of defensiveness from everyone. I eventually saw one other person wearing a mask and felt really relived that I wasn't the only one. 

Which I find so interesting. Why is it that I feel shame around trying to take precautions to keep myself safe? Why, around a certain audience, do I feel like an extremist?  What about the US makes people not want to accept what's happening right now?"
641,Corona is making me breakdown again,"Before everything with corona happened i was actually doing the best i ever have with my mental health, then all of the schools in my area shut down. I had and now have no way of communicating effectively with my friends and they are my support system. It's not at the worst it ever been, but before all of this i had gone a long time with out impulsively chopping my hair off (its the thankfully safe but unhealthy coping mechanism i have used for a while whenever i break down) and i just did it again. My parents and family make fun of me when i do it and i'm stuck with them. I have two healthy coping mechanisms (happy/safe place and muscle tension and relaxation) but when my break downs build up they don't work. Any advice?"
642,Online Counseling?,"I’ve seen counseling apps on the rise lately and feel the strong urge to try as I can’t get to one in person (thanks corona) 
Has anyone tried them? Any you’d recommend over others? Pricing of them? I’m kind of desperate and appreciate the help 💕"
643,I don’t know why...,"So today I had my first two online music classes. It wasn’t really the actual class, it was just a sort of test and chat because we hadn’t seen each other in 3 weeks and we also had never done an online class before.

Anyway, I knew most of the people in both sessions because it’s music and I’m a senior so most faces are familiar. Now when I’m down, I isolate myself. I don’t like talking friends, and don’t participate in activities which are optional.  

So needless to say, I wasn’t looking forward to these sessions. I wasn’t worried, but I did not want to do it. I was just hoping that no one would talk to me, including my friends.

For some reason though, before I joined each one, my stress level skyrocketed. I suddenly got really nauseous, and I actually thought I was going to puke. It took a few minutes for it to subside, but it wasn’t fun at all. I didn’t have a reason to be stressed, yet I almost threw up.

Now I just dread having to do all my other sessions, and all of them start this Monday. Some I’ll skip because we can just watch the recordings later, but a lot of them I shouldn’t skip. I don’t want it to happen every time I’m about to join one."
644,Some Of My Miserable Life,"I feel miserable, so miserable I can't even put it into words. Since I can remember my self I was never truly happy. During all of my school years I was being bullied and I had no friend but from a point and after I didn't mind being alone. I was raised in a good family. My parents destroyed my dreams tho, even if they didn't intended to. From when I was a small I kid I was listening my parents talking about how everyone that has free time and have fun is just a loafer and a lazy person and they taught me that life Is working. When I was in high school and near graduation I told my parents that I wanted to be an artist. They told me that they wouldn't waste their money for me to do something so useless. After graduating I studied information technology. I was never happy with that but it wasn't terribly either. Growing older made me more and more numb. I have no will to live but I don't really wanna die either. I hate everyone, I never met a person which I liked and I had never a relationship. I feel entertained when bad things happen to people and I don't care about human lives, I don't feel pity even if something bad happens to an innocent child. I actually wish that everyone was unhappy, unfortunate and miserable. I care about nothing and yet I keep on living without a reason to. In the end there is no point in living."
645,This is just a rant I just need to get off my chance,"I'm a senior in high school and I'm a CNA at a nursing home and just honestly everything sucks. And I'm sorry and I dont want to contribute to the negativity that's already in the world but obviously I'm going to so no excuses. I'm just so tired of everything. Senior year was already not going great because of some other problems I was dealing with friends and relationships and family. And then this shit happens and now my senior year is basically cancelled and i know that's selfish and i shouldnt be complaining because that's such a selfish and stupid first world problem but i just want to see the few friends i have and value one last time before we each go our separate ways and never see each other again because I was starting to create more meaningful friendships and I just want to cherish what little time I have left. Work is so stressful, every one is on edge. Especially my nurses and because my nurses are on edge now I am too because I've never seen my nurses like this ever and we already had a covid scare and then my favorite resident died but whenever some dies there you just accept it and move on and essentially never tall about that person as if he/she never existed. Plus now I'm getting these migraines practically every day or every other day and it's frustrating. I'm so exhausted I just want to sleep all day but even when i sleep I'm still exhausted. I'm waking with night sweats again which makes it so i cant sleep well and i already cant sleep well, I have to take so much nyquil or benadryl or both to even feel tired. And school is obviously stressful because I dont know what I'm doing and my teachers dont know what they're doing and I just found out that some of the stuff I learned for my AP tests wont even be on the God dam AP tests and now the tests are 45 minutes long and open book so I basically took these classes for absolutely no reason and. 
I'm just so exhausted. 
If anyone read that whole thing I am so sorry and I admire your patience and persistence. 
Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
646,Someone please talk me out of going back to an abusive ex boyfriend,"Hi! I KNOW I shouldn’t go back but sometimes my emotions are overwhelming and I want to text this person and go back to them. I just need a little reassurance or someone to agree with me that I’m doing the right thing by cutting him off completely. My ex was so emotionally abusive sexually abusive controlling manipulating toxic and hurt me so much. He tells me he’s sorry and admitted to his behaviors but I know he hasn’t changed and isn’t truly sorry. 
The stupid part of me still feels like I have feelings for him and want to believe that he’ll treat me better and that we could work out. I left him a year and a half ago and haven’t seen him or gone back but I still talk myself out of going back to him constantly. I would love to come back to this post and have some support reading the comments the next time I feel like putting my emotions over logic. 
(I have BPD and split a lot so it’s hard for me to see one side)"
647,I cant do this shit anymore.,"I can't bother with living my pathetic fucking life anymore. I'm a failure and I never stop failing at everything. I want to die, but I can't bring myself to commit suicide. I'm a failure and disappointment in the eyes of my parents. I can't do university anymore I'm just not smart enough to compete. My life has no meaning I'm tired of it all. I've amounted to nothing and it's torturing me to continue, I just don't know what to do anymore."
648,Finding actual friends,"I’ve always felt like I’ve had friends, plenty even, always have people to chat with but they are all just .... like so casual? Like I can have causal conversations, friendly conversations about stuff I like, but never deep conversations about my feelings. I feel so alone in that sense, no one I feel really comfortable opening up with because even my closer friends don’t really seem like they’re considerate and understanding and I don’t wanna open up to thst. And I have this paranoia after people have switched up on me that I’ll never find a good friends, and I feel like I’m going to be this lonely forever :/"
649,**Trigger Warning**,"Labeling it that just in case. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question. Is pinching considered self-harm?"
650,Worried about hallucinations,"My only diagnosis is depression. i tend to dissociate and most ofter hallucinate then. Recently i was at a cafe with friends and i hallucinated one of my absent friends walk in, hang his coat on a chair, and talk to the people around him, going on for several seconds, even when i looked directly at him. At the time i didn’t even know he’d never been there. I only realized when i looked back a minute later and asked about it. I’m not sure what i’m worried about. I have no idea what this means for me. I don’t need more help than i have."
651,How can I vent without feeling like I'm a burden?,"I'm not a person that opens up to my feelings and usually keep them shut in, but sometimes I just want to vent my problems out to someone but when I do I keep feeling like I'm a burden, even though the person I'm talking to is being supportive, so I always think that I should stop which is what I usually do, how can I stop feeling like this every time I talk about my problems and how I feel?"
652,too scared to sleep,"when i was a child i was afraid of the dark, as most children are. i always slept with the lights on and my mom beside me, and i wouldnt let her go (which became very tiring for her as i had a single bed). i still am afraid of the dark, and there was a period of time when i actually succeeded at calming myself down. at night, i still have to light up the enitre fucking house to go to the bathroom, but it works for me and my family understands. but the dark has been generally not helpful in case of me getting a random panic attack in bed as im trying to fall asleep. i see the furniture in my room move towards me or shapeshift, usually into people. its like they're trying to eat me. i can almost hear their voices. my other issue is that every little sounds frightens me when i lay in bed, with the lights off. my neighbors walk around their flat, something from my desk moves due to clutter, my dogs starts going to my room and i can hear his little paws against the floor. i become stiff, my heart starts racing, i scream (inside my head, of course), i start crying, pinching and punching myself, i get so anxious it usually goes into a full blown anxiety attack. this has happened again now, and it's what drove me to post this. i can't look at the stuff in my room, even with my night light on. i start seeing stuff. it feels like it's gonna kill me. please tell me the cause of this. im actually going to throw up. this is too much on top of my daily struggles with mental ilness. i want to be able to sleep, its my healthies coping mechanism."
653,I went to therapy once ...lol..,.he said tonavoid drinking caffeine... I know its a bidy and mind stimulus... but why woukd he say to stay away from coffeee
654,i feel like i have a toxic personality i can’t get rid of,"i had a really bad childhood. you name it, i probably went through it. i got thrown out and beaten and sexually assaulted. i’m 19 now (female) and i feel like i never got the ability to talk to people. i don’t like people actually. i try to make friends and then i quickly get annoyed of them because they require my attention and i’m too much of an introvert. but i also crave attention i see people get from their friends... until i get it... then i get annoyed again. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. people think i’m great when they meet me and they think i’m funny. but i sUCK at maintaining conversations and deep friendships. i can only have like one friend at a time. when i get upset, i take it way too hard and the smallest things trigger panic attacks. i have a boyfriend (and i already feel like i’m a terrible girlfriend) and if he makes me slightly upset i go into shutdown mode. i don’t want to talk and i just huddle up and uncontrollably cry. once he told me that my tik toks are annoying to him and i had a panic attack where i heard voices from the past and locked myself in the bathroom. i go to therapy and i’m on medication but it’s not working. i feel like i’m too broken of a person and i consider suicide a lot because i don’t know what to do with myself."
655,Not looking for help just to vent.,"For the past 8 or 9 months i have been slipping into what i believe could be deppression. Ive had it like this before and i match a bunch of the symptoms i have found online. I would like to get a prescription for anti-deppressants if i can, but not sure as my government hasn't put anything in place for mental health that i has effected me (at least i havent noticed anything.) Also im poor as shit and the private sector of mental health is expensive as fuck so thats pretty much out of the picture.
If im honest, i can recall 2 times i nearly killed myself. Once via a train and second with a knife, mainly the train though. In the end im too pussy to do it and i only live at this point for the people i play videogames with, my dog, mother, father and half-brother.

If this gets much of a response i can post my story or some of it on here before i delete this throwaway.

Sorry for shitty spellings, grammar and punctuation if there is any."
656,venting,"So, I graduated early from highschool. Freshman year, I almost committed suicide, I didnt even think that me getting this far was a possibility. I still haven't mentally processed that someone like me was able to. I am extremely proud of myself for how far I've gotten mentally, but then they announced my graduation ceremony completely being cancelled. A lot of people are  really tired about hearing these things about Covid-19, but god. I worked extremely hard to get to where I am now. No celebration, no news on a future ceremony, nothing. I feel like I did back then, like this is all for nothing. My anxiety is through the roof now as it is, with not being able to leave my home, worrying about family, and now, not receiving any news what-so-ever about something I've looked foward to the past year. It may not seem like a huge deal, because its just another basic thing for people to accomplish, but its still so hard."
657,Is there any option for Canadians to have online counseling?,"I've been struggling with my.mental health for a few months now , with the constantly anxiety attack's, ED , depression.. ect
and I know I need help before I spiral downward again . 

It's been 6 years since my last relapse and I really don't want to experience that again. And with COVID-19 having everyone staying at home , Mental health resources are basically non existent. 

I'm not even sure where I'm going with this anymore but. If anyone has any suggestions with online private counseling or something it would be greatly appreciated"
658,Feel like I am constantly being pulled in two directions,"I don't even know where to begin typing this. I first went to the doctor 4 about my mental health in 2016 when I was 16. I didn't understand the full grasp of what was going on in my head at the time but I felt like I needed help. The doctor referred me to a specialist who wrote back and essentially said I wasn't depressed enough for treatment. It took a lot for me to open up like that and I was left so humiliated by the ordeal that I decided I wouldn't look for anymore help from then onward. 

Since then my mental state has grown significantly worse. I have no sense of identity whatsoever and I feel like robot that is going through the motions pretending to be human. I put on a front to the world and pretend to be a certain person but that isn't a reflection of who is inside. The problem is that over time I have grown so used to living like this that I don't even recognise a person within myself anymore. Sometimes I stare at myself in the mirror and I feel like there is nobody looking back at me. I just feel like an empty shell of a person. I think this all stems from the mental abuse from my parents growing up. As a child I was fairly effeminate and my parents took every measure possible to drill this out of me as soon as possible. My dad would regularly taunt me, call me names and remind me how much of a failure I was. My mum would either join in or else she would just stay quiet. Of course this was only one of the things ""wrong"" with me but I think it's one of the most significant. I didn't have any friends at school either. I think I just wanted to be accepted and so I made a conscious effort to repress every aspect of my personality, so I would be deemed more likeable. I always felt like two different people; the persona that I presented to the world, and the ""real"" me that was inside. Over time I got so used to living this way that somewhere along the line the person inside completely disappeared. 

Bringing us up to present I am more depressed than ever before, anxious, I have severe mood swings and some form of an eating disorder. Since I haven't told anyone about it I haven't actually been diagnosed with any of these things but the symptoms are all there. I am fairly convinced I have some form of personality disorder. For as long as I can remember my mood has always been temperamental but lately it has been extreme. I've been telling myself I might just be going crazy due to social distancing but who knows. For the past few days I've been bouncing off the walls, absolutely full of energy and unable to contain my excitement about the end of coronavirus so I can have fun and live my life. This feeling was like nothing I've ever experienced in life, I just felt completely elated. Obviously that feeling didn't last though. Now I am back on the ground wishing I'd never been born again.

I keep telling myself that if I just change my situation I can handle it myself. I really do think there is some truth in this but I think I've become too aware of my problems at this point to just keep ignoring them. I tell myself if I go back to the gym then maybe I'll feel better but I haven't exercised properly since before I developed my troubles with food and I think going back to the gym will just make it worse. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know that I desperately need help but can't bring myself to reach out for it again. I want to discover the ""real"" me but I'm so used to how I've always lived that I'm scared to get to know myself properly. I feel so let down by everyone I've ever confided in that I just want to keep it all to myself. But I can't because my head is one of these about to explode.

If anybody actually made it to the end of this then I can't thank you enough. I'm not sure what I'm trying to achieve by posting this but I had to get these feelings out somewhere before they eat me alive."
659,Why do I feel worthless when my niece plays the piano?,"Sometimes I put on earphones so I won’t hear her playing.

660,Questioning a type of mental illness,"Is there a specific mental illness that would cause a person to perform scientific experiments on themselves and other things? Ex: Someone who will do research about certain medications/herbal supplements, creating different combinations, etc and chart how they affect them just to be doing it. Or experiment on bugs with medications or substances. 

I'm not talking a child or teenager but like a 40 year old woman. Would it even be a mental illness or just a strange obsession?"

663,Why does everyone think I’m annoying?,"One of the the things I hate the most is when someone calls me annoying. I feel like I’m worthless and not deserving to live when someone calls me that. Before I say anymore I wanna let you know that I’m an introvert and I don’t have that much friends. I’m also in high school. But every friend I have except one calls me annoying. Hell, even one said that there’s just something about me and my appearance that makes me annoying. I don’t say much and when I do I get called annoying. I feel pissed and depressed at the same time. I try to text a friend of mine and they tell me to stop because it’s annoying. One picks on me and every time I talk he says that I’m annoying. One time I tried to text him on Snapchat and he gets pissed at me for “texting him out of the blue”. I thought that you’re supposed to text people but I don’t anyone. It feels like I never fit in with anyone  because of this. I never talk to my parents about this because they won’t take me seriously.
No wonder why I hate talking. I’m better off having my vocal cords getting ripped out of me. I just can’t take this anymore. I’m not suicidal (yet) but I just feel mentally hurt and tired. I don’t like the Coronavirus but I like quarantine because I don’t have to go to school and look at these “friends”."

666,I seriously need help for my girlfriend (15),"My girlfriend (15) is having serious issues with daily crying mental breakdowns that have only worsened since going into lockdown because of the pandemic.

She seems to have a really bad anxiety/depression mix and feels very negatively about herself.

I really care about her and want to see her get better, but I don't know how to help her. She has told me that every time she tries to talk to her mom about it, her mom either disregards it completely, or turns it around on her taking it as some personal attack, saying that she just doesn't love her mom.

I don't believe she lives in an abusive household, rather her parents are just ill-equipped to handle a situation like this and were not educated properly on what to do. and are a bit stupid too

Here's a quote from our messages

&gt;my mom has the mindset of ""well as long you don't want to kill yourself then you're perfectly fine.""

We both live in Missouri

Please, tell me what we can do to get her help."

668,I think I might have uncovered some form of trauma while experimenting sexually...,"So, long story short, my gf wanted to try some butt stuff on me (a straight male), and while I initially was really put off by that idea, I eventually got curious too and decided to try something with my fingers before taking any permanent decision.

Now fast forward to today. I decided to try some stuff in the shower by myself, and managed to actually climax just from using my fingers. And while it felt good, for some reason it also felt wrong... I cleaned up, thinking about what I had just done, and started feeling increasingly more sick with myself. I don't know, it just didn't feel right... It didn't take long until a strange nausea took over me, my whole body started feeling really heavy, and my vision became a blur. All while the sensation of disgust with myself intensified. I had to take a moment to sit down afterwards, waiting for it all to pass.

This was really uncomfortable to me, and now I'm afraid I might have awakened something and start experiencing this sometimes in moments of sexual pleasure... I am still curious, but won't be doing this again or anything else too out there until I sort this out. Idk for sure what it is, but it sounds like some kind of trauma? I'd like some feedback regarding this...

Looking back at what might've caused this, I remember mainly three things. One of which was an unpleasant experience I've had in elementary school that I don't think it's worth describing now, since I don't think that's still affecting me. The other two are the more relevant, I think...

When I was about 13\~16 years old I've had some annual sex ed classes, that when I look back at it, I'm pretty sure scarred me to some degree. Because at the end most of those classes we would be described and shown some photos of the really really bad cases of sexually transmitted infections. By the end of those classes, I always felt disgusted and nauseated a bit in the same way I did today. I was already sensitive to some stuff about our genital parts (mostly maybe thinking about how it is on the inside, and I had already briefly had similar feelings on some science classes, tho much less severe), and gore, and all that nasty stuff. Maybe I already had something going by then maybe it intensified it all. I don't know. But shock therapy on sex ed classes should be a big no, that's for sure.

Now the other thing is, since I was always very awkward and silent about girls (that elementary school experience certainly didn't help), I eventually had a friend or two poking fun at me about my sexuality. I knew for sure I wasn't gay, due to the porn I liked. Possibly bi in denial, but I don't think so, because I never really saw boys that way. But anyway, thing is, this eventually spiraled into intrusive obsessive thoughts about my sexuality. And at points, I experienced this kind of nausea because of it too. It was horrible... I haven't had that in a long time now, and I thought I was free of it, but after this experience... I don't know anymore. Gay sex was something I found a bit icky, and a big no, and I guess that's what made it feel so wrong now. I thought I was done for with this, but yet here I am now... Disgusted at myself for making me feel good in a way that I used to think I shouldn't.

I've read some time ago about a condition like this last one (can't remember the name) often being fueled by porn, but thankfully I got rid of porn a while ago, so at least I got that...

I think I had something more to add, but honestly, I can't remember it now, so I'll leave it at this. I know this is a weird topic, but any help would be greatly appreciated! And thank you for listening :)"
669,I have so much anxiety about having sent nudes when I was younger and idk how to help it go away,"I was bullied when I was younger and eventually I found that my only source of validation was talking to random men online I’d meet through Omegle and maybe sometimes sext with on kik and Snapchat. I never used my real name. I’d try my hardest to keep from revealing anything too telling about myself, and at the time I wasn’t thinking about the consequences of my actions but now I feel horrible. Thinking about it makes my whole body feel numb and it takes me a while to find ways to distract myself and make myself forget about it, but I know I never fully will. 

I didn’t always send pictures (sometimes would just straight up sext through story/describing sex acts), only did so and video chatted without showing my face a couple of times. I oftentimes avoided showing my face like the plague but when I first started I would do it sometimes. I look different now because I used to be a lot chubbier but there’s still an obvious resemblance. I’m moving into a stage in my life where I want to grow and improve and be better but I feel like this drags me down and holds me back so much.

The fact that I can’t take back my actions kills me. I have deleted all emails, kik and Snapchat accounts that I would do this with because I’d never use my personal since I was trying to avoid being identified as much as possible, but with the way the internet and social media work now a days I’m so scared that I’ll be found by one of these men that took advantage of my vulnerability and it will destroy my life. My hope is that none of them kept the pictures, but you never truly know. I feel so stupid and scared and I don’t know how to make myself feel better. I’ve tried talking to my friends about this but none of them ever did things like this so they can’t relate/don’t know how to make me feel better. 

I feel so so so dumb and scared. Has anyone here done anything similar and felt the same way? How did you deal with it?"
670,4 years later and I can't swallow pills.,"Massive TW for suicide and overdosing.

When I was 13, I was depressed and anxious to the point of hiding knives under my pillows. I'd had enough. I overdosed.
It didn't work, so I tried again a few months later. And again. And again. Four times I attempted, and many more times I took two, three, four times the usual dosage of sleep meds. 

Four years later. 17th birthday was a week ago exactly. The gel pills for my usual meds ran out so they had to give me dry chalky pills (think benadryl/advil/no plastic casing). I've been sitting here trying not to puke for the past 10 mins.

I think, eventually, it might go away. Or I can keep distracting myself with gel capsules like I usually do.

I survived PTSD from the mental hospital, stopped cutting, survived anorexia and bulimia, and the one thing that still takes me back to all those attempts are these pills.

Sigh. :("

I have an emotional problem. I can't identify emotions. I feel them. I don't have the words. Majority of my life I thought everything was anxiety. Just to find out there were way more than I could identify.

I couldn't take it and I cried. I told my brother it was just my feeling of hypocrisy. That how can I give advice to a depressive when I can't even help myself. But it wasn't that. Well it wasn't just that. It was a pain I'd never felt. This hurt, this hollow feeling, this emptiness over myself. I really do mean myself. I was always a mask never to uncovered. Emotionally I don't know me. Trivial, yeah. 

This my third rant on here, but it helps. And if anyone can help, please.

672,Sudden relationship?,"As we are in quarentine, I decided that to pass the time, I would read some webcomics. Eventually I came to this web comic called Heartstopper, that was about these two boys who meet each other in high school and fall in love. At first as I read I thought it was really sweet (and I still do!) how much they cared for each other and just how overall cute they were. But as I approached the end of the latest update, I felt increasingly aware of my own loneliness, almost as if I hadn't noticed it before and It all just snuck up on me. Even now its gotten to the point where it's almost incapacitating how much I just want to find my soulmate, and how alone I feel right now. After seeing someone who was almost like an ideal partner in one of the characters, my mind just keeps going to the fact that I'm never going to find someone like him. And I know very few people actually do find someone who is 100% right for them and the rest of their life, because relationships take time and work to really blossom but I just don't know how to deal with these feelings. I have never felt anything this extreme before and its really taking a toll on me mentally."

674,Family Help - Possibly Mental Health,"I no longer know where to turn and I need help, or guidance. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mom is either a drug addict, or developed some sort of mental health issue and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has macular degeneration and has for years. She messed her foot up and got surgery which resulted in a more messed up foot. She had a weight problem and was a waitress on her feet all day so she's got bulging discs. About 4 years ago she was up to 10 vicodin a day. She claims to have cold turkeyed that against my wishes as i've been around drug addicts and was one myself for quite a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to around October of last year. My mother lost control of the finances after gambling it away on a video poker game. My step dad took over and it became world war 3. She started losing it completely claiming my step dad was cheating on her, hacking her iphon/ipad. I work in infosec so i've tried pleaing with her that this is impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more you try to reason with her the more she refuses to talk to you and thinks you're just not believing her. She started going to a therapist around September of last year and her and my step dad started seeing this therapist around November. If the session didn't cater to my mother she would lose her mind about how my step dad lied to the therapist to get his way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: My whole life my mothers been a manipulator. She's like 5th degree black belt

&amp;#x200B;

So my step father has a hard time controlling his anger which this whole situation is going to come to boiling point which it did. A physical altercation I wasn't a part of got escalated and my step father went to jail for domestic abuse. I wasn't there to know but I can have my own thoughts and believe who I believe. I don't believe there was domestic abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and step father go at it verbally every single day. She believes something new every couple days. It's gotten to a point where she believe I flew into town, sent her pictures of me being at the airport, walk by her house to taunt her, and change her channels while she's watching tv. I live a good 18 hour drive from her and up until recently haven't had money to travel. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the drug problem. She was up to 10 vicodin a day I believe I mentioned that above. That was about 4 years ago. She got changed to non-habit forming pain meds which I can't recall right now. Regardless, she admitted to taking my little brother ADD meds, taking my step fathers diabetes and muscle relaxer meds, so god knows what else she's taken and when. 

&amp;#x200B;

The domestic abuse charges have made it so my step father is to have no contact with her except through my little brother. He decided it was in the best interest of the family to move back in against mine and his lawyers wishes. My little brother is senior year highschool and called me today to tell me they're back to yelling at each other every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health laws make it so we cannot force her to seek help. I believe she's got a drug issue that's underlying but also a mental health issue. The mental health laws don't help with getting her the help she needs, nobody in my family is willing to risk their safety to get her the help but they rely on me to vent to. I have no fucking clue what to do anymore. She needs help before she hurts herself."
675,"Recently begun talking to myself, would like to know why.","Hey all. Since coronavirus is a thing bringing the world to a halt, and a bit before that even, I have begun talking to myself. As a preface, I've had a recent breakup with someone who was amazing, however her anxiety and depression issues (ie not good enough for me, that sort of thing) made things rather difficult, and we ultimately stopped being a thing.

Onto the meat, after the breakup, I did lose a confidant who I could talk to about everything on my mind, as she would provide some amazing emotional validation which I really needed. With her gone, and other life shifts, (starting uni, covid), I've been finding myself in very bad habits, mental health wise. Not working on assignments early (not new, but something I was working on changing with uni), procrastination, finding very little motivation to get out of bed, and to do anything once actually out of bed. So a couple times, I've found myself laying in bed, and physically talking to myself.

One ""person"" in this conversation is the scared one, the one who doesn't want to do the work, who wants to hide away, watch youtube, and just avoid everything. The other is confident, giving the obvious pointers, telling what I should be doing, telling me to get up, to watch my steps, go one at a time, and Do. But he never gets ""control"", if that makes any sense. As an fyi, I haven't felt any kind of suicidal in 5 years, and I don't feel it now.

Idk, I guess I'm rambling at this point. I haven't told anyone about this specifically, but I do have support in friends and family. Any help from you guys would be nice, cheers."

I am struggling with this quarantine because I’m so secluded to either my dads house for a long period of time and my moms a long period of time. 

My boyfriend of almost four years and I decided social distancing between us should be taken more seriously due to the severity of the virus now. And I’m just having the hardest time keeping a good head on trying not to shut down my body and ignoring everything during this quarantine :/ I’ve always had a hard time being social when I’m alone and I just tend to push people away when I get overwhelmed and worried and I feel like I’m starting to do that with my boyfriend.

Any support could really help and would be very much appreciated. I love my family and boyfriend very much. I’m whenever I can I’ve been helping my older loved ones social distance themselves from grocery stores and public places. And on top of everything college is just a lot on my back right now.

I wake up every single morning with intense anxiety over what seems to be nothing I'm always stressed and since the age of about 10 I havent felt normal something always hurts sometimes physically but mostly mentally. I try and avoid large crowds they dont scare me but when I'm in a large crowd of people my emotions constantly change one minute I am happy and the next I'm as angry as I have ever been. I also have a major problem i lie and i do it a lot and i have tryed to stop my constant lieing but i can't i feel like if i dont lie people will leave me and that's another thing I'm in constant worry that my friends and family are going to leave me. I'm a very sarcastic person and so are my friends but sometimes when they say something even if I know they are being sarcastic it makes me paranoid. I also am really good at faking my emotions I can make my self cry within seconds and I have trick people all the time with my emotions I also really like drama I have the constant need to have to make my friends fight each other and if I'm honest I dont know what this is I honestly just wanna know what wrong with me I have been like this for years and slowly it feels like I have been drowning and I need help I'm sorry if this freaks anyone out or makes anyone sad I just dont really have anywhere else to go
680,unsafe and scared,"I had spent the last five months in a residential facility after overdosing in October. I got kicked out today, after two weeks of shit consistently hitting the fan. Last night was just the cherry on top of my depression pie.

My therapist told me that staff weren’t allowed to lay their hands on me. I believed him. When I went to go stand on the porch for a breather last night, I was restrained by a male staff (I’m a 17 y.o girl. weak and small.), he picked me up and turned me around and slammed me on a coffee table and then onto the ground. He had me pinned on the ground and wouldn’t let me go, even though I was in obvious physical pain and was having a panic attack. He only let me go after a female staff told him to get off of me.

I left that situation with a massive bruise on my leg, my hands, and my face. There are probably more, but I’m too scared to check. I’m at my dads house now, but I’m still freaked out and scared that something is going to happen to me. Feeling that powerless and weak was terrifying. I never want to feel like that again, and I don’t want that staff member to put any more girls through that again. What do I have to do to fix this? What do I have to do to fix myself? only rhetorical, of course. maybe."
681,I just want a mum,"Most of my problems are because I don't have a mum. My issues with self harm was because I had to internalise everything because I couldn't tell my dad. My 'obsession' with middle aged teacher was because I craved maternal affection. The hurt I'm feeling now is because the teacher I loved like a mother does not give a shit about me and she never will. I can't change how she feels about me and it kills me. She has kids and she knows how to be maternal and she knows that I crave a mum but she doesn't care. I feel so selfish. She has her own family and problems to deal with and I'm just *there.* I'm know I'm the student she dreads to see in the hallways because she knows I'll approach her. Sometimes for small talk. Sometimes for deep talks. I can't help how I feel about and I want to change it. She doesn't deserve the stress I have caused her. I'm like the ugly duckling, trying to find a mother duck again."

683,Bad Connection with Therapists,"I need to know if anyone else has this problem. I have seen 2 therapists (recently stopped seeing the last one). Sessions with both of them just felt like chatting... I felt like they weren’t helping me at all, they just wanted to “talk”. It makes me feel like crap because I can’t even do THERAPY right. I feel like i’m letting my family down... Does anyone understand what I’m saying? If so, what was your experience with a bad therapist like?"

685,How to cope with COVID uncertainty.,"I haven’t been suicidal in years but with the pandemic I have no hope towards the future, I feel lost and I just wanna die again. One of my best coping mechanisms is having something to look forward to and focusing on that but I feel like there’s nothing to look forward to when no one knows what happening or when this will end. I try to be positive and look at only facts but things constantly change and everyone in my household has been nothing but negative. My mental health is deteriorating I was doing good before this all started but now I’m getting worse and worse as everyday goes by. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to do anymore. I need help."
686,Terrified I'm developing schizophrenia,"Hi there, over the last few months, I fear that I am developing schizophrenia. I've always dealt with severe anxiety and hypochondria, but I had a horrible panic attack in January that made me feel like nothing was real. I stabilized for awhile, but to into periods of derealization. I don't experience any hallucinations and I take online Schizophrenia tests frequently, but I have concerning violent thoughts that scare me and for the first time, I had a fear about eating the dinner my partner had cooked me because I was afraid he poisoned me. The stress and isolation of the current COVID-19 pandemic certainly isn't helping and I'm often left ruminating on the fear that things will just continue to get worse. I cannot afford my normal therapy sessions and I'm currently on no medication. 

Can someone help me or give me some kind of insight? I'm so excited that I'm developing schizophrenia and will lose all the people I love if my condition worsens."

688,Hello,"The last five years I spent isolation myself. My anxiety and paranoia boomed 5 years ago. I am having regularly conversations with a therapist. Truth is I stay at home all day, cause then I don't triger my anxiety. I'm asking myself everyday. How will I ever be acceptable on paper to someoone? Will I ever worthy of someones love an affection? I know it is a process. I just feel very lonely, missing companionship."

But im having trouble finding info on how to be apart of it what its like if it costs anything etc. Or if there are other types of programs you know about that help people with mental illness find work id be interested in learning.
691,Overall struggling,"This is my first post on Reddit, so bear with me please. 

I recently had a child, and it’s been quite taxing mentally. I feel like I’ve lost myself. My current mental state seems to be taking its toll on my relationship, and it’s just kind of sucky. My libido has peaked(I’m thinking it’s my own way of dealing with the depression), while my partners has dropped, I feel like every time I pursue, I get shot down. It hurts, and I’ve explained this several times. I’m already not feeling the best about my postpartum body, I just feel like I’m at a loss. I’m to the point where I’m done trying to pursue because I’m tired of feeling rejected. I love my partner, I truly do, but I can’t stand feeling the way that I feel. 

I just wanted to vent a little bit since I don’t have anyone to really talk to about this. Much love, stay safe."
692,Does anyone else have days in which they feel like communicating is a lot more difficult (both writing/in person)?,"Fox example, today I feel like I'm having trouble putting sentences that make sense together and a lot of what comes out sounds weird. I've retyped a couple emails several times at work tonight bc what I type doesn't look right to me.

I suffer from major depressive disorder and general anxiety but I dont know if this is a side effect from those? I have been dealing with a very stressful situation lately. 

I don't have days like this very often but when I do have them, they are really annoying."
693,Moving Forward after a Diagnosis,"So these past few years have been rough for me &amp; I noticed a larger pattern that has presented itself in different ways throughout my life &amp; I decided to get assessed by a psychologist. 

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, &amp; ""other specified personality disorder with negativistic, avoidant, &amp; borderline features."" 

I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now &amp; I'm just wondering how you reacted when you were diagnosed? I don't think I was expecting such a broad diagnosis in the ""other specified personality disorder"" but when I researched the 3 disorders I had features of, it made more sense.

I've worked in social services for years &amp; have always heard of the stigma surrounding mental illness, but I don't think I understood it until the psychologist diagnosed me. I just remember all those times I tried to talk to friends &amp; was told ""you just complain too much"" or ""you just need to try harder to be happy"" &amp; even now I feel like I can't talk to them about these issues because they are mental illnesses &amp; not a physical ailment. 

Anyway, it just feels like a lot. I'm reaching out to establish with a regular therapist &amp; psychiatrist but I needed to get this off my chest &amp; I wanted to hear from others. It has me thinking about how I want to proceed with my career &amp; what I want to do with my life in general."
694,"F, 18. I just hate the way I am","I hate my personality. I’m so mean and I hate it. I’m always irritable and angry to anyone that’s around me. It’s gotten better in the past but with quarantine it’s coming back. For example, if I was in class and someone was bouncing their leg in my sight, I just had to close my eyes. I couldn’t take it. If I heard chewing or breathing, I had to cover my ears with my hands. Even people simply talking or whispering behind me— I’m covering my ears. 

When I was prescribed an SSRI, I improved so much. My misophonia was so much better and I was happier, but I feel like crap right now. I’m so unmotivated. I don’t want to do anything anymore. I used to go to therapy but stopped because it’s expensive and insurance doesn’t cover mental health. 

I cry knowing how I would treat my parents. I wouldn’t cuss them out or anything, but my tone was always harsh. Everything made me irritable. I feel like I’m the worst person on the planet. Am I that rude or is it my brain? I try to explain my irritability and I just get told how rude I am. I know it’s rude. I just can’t control it. I try so hard and I hate it"
695,"I need a place to rant, I feel like I am losing my mind and I have no where to go thanks to quarantine","This is just going to be a rant. I have been so angry lately and maybe screaming into the internet void will help.

I have major and persistent depressive disorder, and panic disorder. All of these have just been thrown into overdrive for the past month. 

At the very beginning of the month, I had to go to the ER for a bad tooth infection. I was in excruciating pain and crying non-stop because of it. They sent me home with antibiotics, oxycodone, and Xanax for my dentophobia. Turns out, I can't take oxycodone without getting horrible side effects. I was bedridden for a few days because it made me incredibly ill, on top of still having the infection. Exactly one week later, I got food poisoning, so I was once again sick with the infection. Finally, I finished my antibiotics and could go to the dentist. Only guess what, here comes a pandemic, and my entire state when into lockdown. No dentists are seeing patients right now. Everything is shut down. My tooth is still sore, but I know it will most likely be pulled out when all of this clears up, and I'm living off of ibuprofen for now. 

Dentists aren't the only thing though, my college is cancelled for the rest of the semester, so I no longer have my reason to keep getting up in the morning. I was taking a class I was especially passionate about and now it's been taken away from me. My chance at socializing with people who have the same interests is gone.

As if this bullshit wasn't enough, my husband is away for the army on the other side of the country. He was supposed to come home for good at the beginning of May, and now since his base is in quarantine, that has been pushed to the end of May. I have seen him twice in person (one time was only for a few hours) since August. That's one more month away from my husband. 

Being in quarantine is making my mental illnesses worse. I was promised a job, but that got put on hold until further notice. I live with my in-laws, and while I love them, I have no way to get a break from them that I desperately need. I am trapped in a house that doesn't feel like home with people who don't feel like family. 

I'm scared right now. I have no more refills for my antidepressants, so I don't know what's going to happen when I run out. I am feeling so overwhelmed right now. All I want is an escape or a break, and I can't get it."
696,Help. I'm stuck in my head.,"What can I do to stop the bad self talk, and stop focusing so much on my anxiety so that I can actually get shit done that's going to progress me towards my goals. I get so stuck in my own head that by the time I notice I haven't done any work, its 10 pm at night. God I'm really beginning to hate myself. I cannot trust myself and am not good for myself. Please help. I feel like I'm losing it."
697,Emotions are gone.,Hello. Over the past 4 years I lose my emotions more and more. I rarely feel happy or sad or pretty much anything. I’m at the point now where I move through everyday with fake feelings trying to believe I have them. Idk what’s going on. So if you have an idea lemme hear it (19/M)
698,It just feels like I’m drowning,"I feel my mind beginning to slip away from me, only just barely in my grasp, everything is dull, nothing brings me joy, and anything that is good for me I find myself second guessing. I trust no one, I leave the room and my mind immediately wonders to question not if they are talking bad about me, but what exactly the bad things being said about me are. I feel in fragments I don’t think even my own friends like me, I don’t think anyone likes me. I don’t think I even like me, and it’s not my body, I mean sure I have those same insecurities everyone does, but I don’t hate my body, I just, I hate me. I hate how annoying and clingy I am, I hate how in my head I can be smart but when I open my out only stupidity come fumbling out, I hate how I’m always the joke of everyone, whether it be family, friends, complete and utter strangers. I hate that I’ve never dated anyone, yet I’ve had sex with over 15 different people. I hate that the reason I’ve never dated anyone is because no one ever likes me in that way, they don’t want to get to know me, unless it’s in the bedroom. I just am so sick of it all, of the constant conniving jokes, of the looks I get, the things said about me and my body, the constant pressure to change from everyone. I’m too small, too scrawny, I need to eat more. DONT YOU REALIZE I TRY, I try everyday to change, change my personality, my style, my diets, I dim down my annoying ness, and nothing ever works. 

I don’t know what to do, and I’m just so tired."
699,I am so angry with my brain.,"I’ll be totally fine. Not a care in the world. Then something switches and I want to hurt myself. It all starts with me almost having what feels like a pity party for myself. “Oh no one wants you, you’re too fat” “your skin isn’t perfect anymore” “you’re going grey” etc etc. Then once I’ve beat myself up a lot mentally I’ll start thinking about everything I don’t have, never have and convince myself I never will get. Then the next thing I know I’m crying myself hysterically and wanting to end my life. 

Why does this happen? I’m on medication and it’s been helping but I’ve been slipping a lot recently and I’m sick of it."
700,Fuck I’m going crazy,"At this point I’m just waiting to die becuase I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself, life seems pointless, we are born in a world for nothing, waiting to die that’s are lives worth, and you never know when it’s going to happen. The point to life is to live it, but her I am sitting in a room, under quarantine and I feel empty, I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything, and I may never have the chance to. I mean fuck lets really think about it, there are 7 billion people on this earth, currently a virus is circulating, the u.s government predicts 200,000 victims, if they get there shit together, 3million if this keeps continuing, and I could be one of them. You could be one of them. If not then it’s something else. But eventually we’ll die becuase death is enviable, the only thing I have to show for this  experience we call life is our lives, and I’m basically going to die when I do knowing my life was unfulfilled.

That, or I’m just having a manic episode, becuase I’m cooped up in an apartment for 30 days, which I’m using as an excuse as to why I can’t accomplish anything in reality, I fucking can’t becuase I’m dirt poor, and to mentally unstable to get out of bed let alone make something out myself.

But disregard everything said, becuase nothing makes sense, I don’t make sense, and all my head is, our thoughts all jumbled together."
701,I just really want to someone to talk to,"I'm new to reddit I only really downloaded it to vent to someone cause I'm to scared to talk to a real person about it,lately I've just been depressed I've stopped eating I've been sleeping through the day and staying up all night and now to top it all off my girlfriend wants to take a break I'm just scared and have nowhere else to turn."
702,What could this be?,I know this is just me being crazy but sometimes I feel like a line on my arm. Like on my wrist and the inside bend of my elbow. They just don’t feel right and I think its because there beed to be a cut there or something. But I now am moving my left pinky around and it also just doesn’t feel like it needs to be there. Like right at the base of my pinky feels like I could chop it clean off.I think my hand would be better without it. I hate moving it around because it just is bothering me. I think I have pretty damn good self control cause I haven’t cut myself on those spots from before. But my pinky is messing with me a lot. While I’m writing this I stopped and started moving my fingers and all my other ones and they all feel different than my left pinky. Idk if this is ok or something that is crazy. I don’t know if Id sound crazy by posting this but I honestly debated on posting this because I thought id sound crazy because I’ve never heard of something like this but I want to know whats going on with me if there is.
703,Don’t become so obsessed with self improvement that you forget you who are,"I’ve been kind of a mess lately, especially with all the virus stuff. I’ve had this really strong desire for a while to make myself better, better better never stop improving. And that’s good and all, but...I didn’t realize until recently that I was essentially treating my current self as broken in my desperate quest to be this ridiculously perfect person. I could never be happy with how I was, constantly thinking “Can’t do this, can’t do that I’ve gotta fix this problem etc” Don’t fall into that trap. I couldn’t figure out why I was constantly anxious until this hit me."
704,I need someone to talk too,Recently I’ve been having issues with keeping a positive mindset and being able to maintain one state of conciseness I’ve also been feeling more depressed and disassociated from reality and I just need someone to talk to.
705,I need help for my friend,"So this is a very long story but I need help, and I will not accept ""block her"" as an answer. I am not abandoning her.
So I have a friend, I'll call her Ash for this but that's not her name. So Ash is a trans girl I met on discord last fall. We realy hit it off and dated for a few months. Things were great. We would send photos to eachother. Stay up late talking. Sext every now and then. Normal E dating stuff.
One day she broke it off with me saying that we can't date because she didn't love me like she did, but wanted to be Friends With Benefits. I told her no and then blocked her, but then I felt bad because she was trans and I know the statistic that 50% of trans people attempt suicide and 2% actualy die. That's higher than any group in history. I don't know why that is but that's not the point. 
So for a while things were ok. She would hit on me but I tended to ignore it. She also hit on a lot of other people in the server. Some reciprocated. Some didn't, but over all she was general well liked. That was until about 2 weeks ago. She had a mental breakdown and started doing things like spamming gore all over the server. She also spammed images of cuts on her arm that spelled out something like ""GRAT"" we thought that it might have been a guy on the server she liked named Greg and did it wrong because of her breakdown.We banned her but I still cared deeply about her. I needed to figure out what was happening.
It turns out she was having a mental breakdown about her ex before me. 
So Ash was adiment that she loved him and could never find another guy like him (ouch right) and that if she can't be with him again that she should just die. At this point she said the only way she couldn't kill herself was to call him. I called him 5 times rapidly because I was scared that one of the only people I ever cared about as deeply as her was going to die. Eventually we get him to join the server ""me and about 3 other people who were her friends where trying to figure out what to do"" 
Here is the revelations of the story. Remember when I told you she cut GRAT into her arm. Her Ex's name was ""GRANT"" he also sent me an almost year old photo that was the same image flipped 90 degrees. I was furious. We all banned and blocked her. I ended up joining Grant's server and he told me a lot more about her that I don't know for sure. Most of it bad.
For the next 3 days I wad still pissed, but on the 4th i felt bad. I know that when someone has a breakdown like that that people can't control themselves. I unblocked and friended her and immediately she began going on about how she was going to commit suicide and that the only thing that could stop her was Grant. I tried but I could event get grant to say good bye, and even if I could it would have probably been a bad thing because then she would have had enough closure to die.
Eventually she video called me and I saw her with my own eyes swallow an entire bottle of quote ""prescription heart pills"" and a whole (small) bottle of vodka. I knew it was the end so I told her. ""I don't want you to die alone, so I'll sit in a call with you until you pass to heaven."" (She wasn't religious but I was hoping that the thought of an afterlife would calm her in her final moments.) It's an eerie thing to sit next to someone that you know is going to die, and the last person they will ever speak to is you. Then in just a few moments you would have to tell everyone she knew. Her family. Her friends. everyone that she figurativly died in your arms. I told her to visit me in a dream some time.Then a maricle that I could only thank the father son and holy spirit for. She said she couldn't do it. She vomited it right on camera. I never thought I could have been that happy to see puke before. She was still crying, but alive. I felt it was safe to go to bed.
From this point on I was hesitant to talk to her because I was selfishly scared that she could do this again at any moment. Today she did it again. I learned that she had a contact to every one of Grant's friends on discord. They didn't care as much for her as I did, and I'm sure that many of them wished she did die. I spoke to her for over and hour. Eventually I felt that she was safe to be left alone. I told her that I was going to block her for the rest of the night and then refriend her in the morning. I felt she needed to be alone for a little.
I know she's not going to kill herself tonight. According to grant (who I think Is the only one of them that still cared about her life) told me she had been doing it every few weeks since they broke up (I'm not sure of the validity of that since we had been dating since fall) so I know she's not dead right now, but I need a way to keep her with us. 
I belive in life that every person on earth was put here to help someone and make it better. Find the hopeless and give them hope. I can't do that alone. I need anything anyone could do to keep her with us. I need help and this seems like the only place that anyone could help with that. The suicide hotline just said ""oh don't kill yourself life is precious"" and other robot bulcrap that they spit. I don't think she can go to a therapist because of how poor she is.
What do I do. What can I do. I know she can be saved. How can I get her off of Grant. Please I need help."
706,Is there a way to hide coronavirus related posts from my feed?,"I feel like I need this for my mental health. I’d love to scroll through reddit like the good old days and pretend nothing is wrong for a bit. 

Side note: I suffer from extreme anxiety and have been cooped up in my New York apartment without outdoor access for weeks."
707,Coping with lonliness...,"Does anyone have any ideas on how I can deal with being so lonely, yesterday I decided my friends weren't supportive enough so I've begun to cut them out, the girl I'm interested in is probably talking to a bunch of other guys cause I'm so boring

Right now I'm writing this to get it off my chest before I start the day.
I only recently got out of my last abusive relationship with a narcissist and I think that's messed me up, because now I just feel unlovable. I get that I'm not a great looking guy and I'm.not the most exciting, I just wish that stuff didn't matter so much.

Last night I wrote that today would be a good day but I've managed to wake up miserable. 
I know I just need to get used to it, this is my solitary life and I don't think much will change, I just wish I could do something about the feeling of lonliness. But I guess that's life, some people get what they want in life and some don't, I just need to accept that I'm the latter there."
708,I think my cousin tried to sexually assault me when i was younger,"
Hey can someone please help me
I am a 17 year old girl i know this sounds so random but i’ve always felt weird when someone from my family talked about my cousin who i think is almost 9 years older than me . Everytime when he would come visit us or my grandparents i always felt weird and repulsed ? I always felt uncomfortable around him and felt annoyed whenever someone would talk about him . For a long period of time i didn’t know why and i couldn’t really understand why do i feel like this. Untill one day when it all popped into my head . The thing is that i don’t remember everything and what i do remember i don’t see it too clear . I remember one time me and my  whole family went to my grandparents house to just hang out and stuff, my cousin and his parents were coming too . I don’t remember how old i was which is weird but i don’t even think i was in first grade . I don’t recall much of that day but i remember everyone sitting in a room while me and my cousin went to the other room alone, we were sitting on the bed next to eachother and the next thing i remember is him taking my hand and placing it under his pants, i dragged my hand back and after a few seconds he did it again, i don’t remember anything after that just the fact that someone entered the room and i said i need to wash my hands . That’s all. This is very scary and the weirdest thing is that i don’t know if my mind made it up or this really happened and i’ve tried to surpress it . I’m really scared right now and it makes me vomit ."

710,Negative thought processes making it near impossible to make any type of progress in life?,"I keep getting caught up in how I'm 20m, everyone I know has gone through university now and is doing their 4th year/ post grad or work experience, and I still haven't finished my first year.  Apparently I'm also meant to be quite smart, which I always thought to be just a different inclination to specific subject matter, but I would say I am definitely above average.  It's kind of irrelivent, but I just want to say as I feel it is quite significant how frustrating it is to see the average person far exceeding my accomplishments with relative ease, and yet I am now just withering and dying.

Now, I have some real fucked up mental shit.  For some reason I always just end up alone.  I mean months without talking to anyone, dead inside alone.  I don't know why but the possibility of this changing just always ends up becoming an insurmountable fantasy that isn't going to happen.

Anyway, I was really trying this semester, but now because of lockdowns, everything that was going to help me get through this (exposure therapy being the main treatment) is now fucked.  It was my most promising semester, despite being quite cognitively impeded, and now I just can't stop thinking about how many wasted years have gone past and how fucked I am."

713,Bipolar gf with psychotic tendencies,"Hi,
I have a significant other who ha Bipolar-I
And she has had psychotic tendencies.
And so as a way of keeping check on any negative thoughts we made up a rule/promise that if one of us harms ourselves, the other one can too. And I don't have any such tendencies. But I thought that this would come in her way of her thoughts about harm. 
Once she lost her pills, had withdrawals, and thought about harming herself. Had to stay on the phone with her (she's a 5hr drive) until it passed.
I know this ""promise"" is kind of fucked up but I don't know what else to do.
Also a recent red flag is that she's been telling me she can make decisions on her own, and so wants me to just  ""be there for her and support her"", but insists that this promise not be a thing.

The promise is kinda me blackmailing her into not harming myself. And I know this is messed up. But I don't know what else to do short of calling 911 on her if god forbid something goes wrong.
She says that if she has psychosis then she can't do anything, and she might end up breaking the promise. Since she won't be in her right mind. And that's true.
But I don't know what to do when shit goes that bad.

Any advice will be much appreciated.
Thanks."
714,Thoughts,So I've been having alot of thoughts latley of like killing myself and maybe more specific shooting myself or hanging my self or overdose because I just feel so hopeless and helpless I just dont understand how I feel and I'm constantly irritated and there's just nothing that makes me happy I don't use drugs I smoke weed and drink especially when I get angry I drink alot when I'm angry but idk any other way to not freak out and end up in jail for something not really sure what is going on been to doctors and psychologists and they've mentioned rapid cycling mood disorder I have the psych eval somewhere but that was like 5 or 6 years ago idk I just really don't understand how I feel and I fell like everyone is happier then me.
715,"I feel like my voice is never heard, and I always have to comply/listen to everyone.","
Recently, I’ve been really worried about my close friends’ safety.
 With my close friends I felt like I could express myself the way I want to, but with this cv spreading to a big town like mine, my friends won’t listen to my concerns. 
They stop talking to me when I try to tell them it’s important to stay indoors, or if I tell them not to go outside even if they’re healthy. My best friend won’t talk to me anymore because I was trying to tell him not to go out to bars but he thinks I’m panicking.

Whenever I try to apologize to my friends about me being really concerned for them, they leave me on read. 
Or if not, I just get told “don’t tell me what’s best for my safety.”

It really hurts me because when I’m trying to help and people aren’t willing to listen, it keeps me up at night and it gives me a lot of panic attacks. I feel lonelier and I worry so much...
And being inside in quarantine for weeks really is messing with my head..."

Back story
I am a 13 enby from England. I live in the Manchester area. I've been under CAMHS for years because I have high functioning autism, social anxiety and am getting therapy for depression. They are terrible to put it straight. My family is kinda f'd up. My mother is great but she doesn't understand. My best friend is American, older then me and studies psychology on the side. He has some of the same things as me. And this is the convo we just had... Basically.

So, I attempted suicide on Christmas day, but I didn't do it because of my bff. Family didn't even notice. I've been to a&amp;e before for it but they sent me home because they didn't have enough beds. I hurt myself a lot, I smashed my head into my wall and, quote from the convo, it was because 'Actually its because I wanted to break my skull opened so I could die in the way I was supposed to. Bloody and painfully.' I want to murder someone. I think one of my family, my mom probably. I love her but still. I'm not sure what to do. I hear and see things and its getting MUCH worse. My friend said I should do the CAMHS live thing and try to get to the psych ward. Any advice? Idk what to do. Thank you all.

TL:DR I'm suicidal, murderous [?] And hear/see things. Its getting worse and I might have to go to the hospital."

These last two days I've found myself feeling like I'll never be pretty enough, especially since the standards have gone up with IG and surgery which I haven't had. It's like I appreciate other people's individual beauty, but struggle with seeing it in myself. That just because I didn't complete x well enough means I'm not intelligent and so on...

725,Questions on Mental Health Problem vs Malingering,"Hello everyone!  

I hope this is an appropriate subreddit to post these questions on. If not, I would love to hear about another one that is more fitting. :D

# Question One

[https://pastebin.com/RFdqM2sM](https://pastebin.com/RFdqM2sM) 

A **TL;DR** of this question would be: Is it possible for someone with a history of childhood repression to repress a **non-traumatic** event **completely** over a **few minutes**? This girl has been known to act out for attention in the past, but as I am not a medical professional, I cannot say for certain that this is false. 

Later, I confronted her about it, talking about how I tried to research and find explanations for it. She reacted with intense negativity. She said things like ""this is why I don't trust people"", ""I can't trust you anymore"", ""this is why I don't get close to logical people"", and ""you just gave me the biggest reason not to trust you"".

# Question Two

I have a follow-up question. 

[https://pastebin.com/MM9hf62W](https://pastebin.com/MM9hf62W) 

How this ended up is, at one point, I asked her about it. She went on to tell me that she has voices in her head (multiple personalities) that can take over sometimes. She said that's what happened that night. She explained that one personality is an authoritative mother figure and the other is a wild and flirtatious one.

Only once did I experience these personalities come out, if they did, come out. They used the verbiage ""this body is so uncomfortable"" and ""she is upset"" (talking about the girl from a third-person perspective).

I ultimately let it pass because I was unsure how to deal with it.

# Summary

With these two situations, my honest standpoint is that both of them are faked. I was under the impression that memory repression takes YEARS, not minutes. I also believe they only happen during extremely traumatic events like war, death, rape, abuse, etc. I believe she was using it to manipulate me or maybe get attention...(?) I am unsure. Anyone who can help advise me on this situation would be greatly appreciated.

  
As for the multiple personalities, she used that to shift responsibility off of acting strange and borderline manipulative during the ""adult content"" night. She also talked about herself in the third-person when she was in the ""other personalities"". I always thought that other personalities BECAME the person, not that they were looking in from the outside and narrating the person's emotional and physical experiences.

# Salutation

I know it's a long read, thank you so much for those of you who took the time to read all of it. Any advice or knowledge on whether these medical phenomena can actually occur or if she is faking them and simply pining for attention (or something else).

Feel free to ask me additional questions on any aspect!

Thank you so much again! &lt;3

727,autism diagnosis,"people always say to me that self diagnosing is never okay no matter how obvious and how sure you are, but i'm terrified to ask my therapist for a diagnosis because she won't like it and never uses mental illness words to describe me other than 'anxious'. If i do ask her, what if she says i'm not? It's obvious and makes a lot of sense that i am autistic, so am i allowed to say i am to my friends even though it's just an (informed, i've been reading psychology textbooks and comparing my behavior and my habits to autistic people i know in real life and online) self diagnosis?"
728,Is there a certain age when you finally find your group friends?,"Im almost 30 years old and I’m at a point where I’m exhausted of constantly being alone. This has not been the first time I’ve felt this way. When I was younger I always leaned on the hope that when I get older I wouldn’t be lonely. 

I worked so hard on myself and poured so much into friendships throughout my life. Why is it that I’m constantly alone. Am I that broken and hopeless? I’m so tired."
729,How do I set boundaries being quarantined with my parents?,"I've had to move back in with my parents because of the pandemic (school cancelled classes and shut down campus). My parents, particularly my mom, won't stop making comments about my progressive weight gain in the past year. They repeatedly make comments about me waking up early to walk with them in the mornings, that I'm lazy, and that I should go running. My mom will point out how ""fat"" my arms have gotten or any cellulite she sees on my legs. This is really starting to take a toll on my mental health and I'm trying not let it get to me as I went through a slump in February and want to make progress during this time. (They also don't believe me when I say I get depressed, typical Latino parents) I've tried several times to tell them to stop making comments about my weight because if anything, it makes me not want to work out, but they keep doing so. How can I make them understand that this is a serious issue to me without seriously damaging our relationship?"
730,Quarantine has brought back the worse side of my depression,"Honestly since sophomore of High School (19 now) I've kept it in check almost on my own. The only thing I haven't been able to stop is the black hole that eats my motivation to work on anything, be it passion projects or schooling. Admittedly, that's been pretty fucking bad but at least I've kept the darkest considerations out of my mind, and liked myself overall as a person. 
Don't worry, I've made an absolute promise for the sake of others around me that I'll never do anything stupid. (Worst I've ever done is whack my face with a pencil in third grade 'cause I thought Dobby from Harry Potter was a good role model.) 
But God damn, I haven't felt like crying, and been unable to, in a long ass time. I've been napping for an extra 2-7 hours each day, only getting the healthy 8 at night sometimes. Broke quarantine with a couple of my (confirmed healthy) friends today, and despite us hanging out, I just had the good 'ol sense of absolute dread hanging over me. Before this I could at least tell myself I wasn't wasting time because of at least school and work, but now my school is down to 2-3 hours of work a week, and my hours have been cut to at most working one day a week. The nothing to do and still not being able to bring myself to do shit is killing me. I can't take antidepressants because of a risk of bipolar in my family, so I'm stuck almost entirely on my own (I have one anti-seizure med that side effects as an antidepressant). I know I'm not the only person in a rough spot here, there are definitely those with worse problems. At least I'm in a physically secure life position. But damn, I can't figure out what to do on my own, and my friends do care, they aren't able to offer any real advice on this. It's not a situation they're familiar with. There's a whole lot of stuff I have to deal with and really I just don't know what to do."
731,Rough week and I’m slipping,"Hi guys, first time poster in this subreddit. On mobile and it’s late, so please forgive any typos. Also, long post ahead as there is a lot on my mind. TLDR at the bottom. 

I am a 23 yo female, who has been working as a waitress and getting an engineering degree (finishing my 5th year this semester, with one more semester to go). For a little bit of background, I’ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (reoccurring), panic disorder with agoraphobia, and rule out OCD. At 18 I entered an intensive out patient program, basically a partial hospitalization, where I went to a clinic from 8am-1:30pm every day for group therapy sessions and one-on-one counseling, and they were able to get me on medication. I was there for a whole month. In that month I missed school completely. After that, because a lot of my triggers and issues revolved around school, and I only needed a half credit of history/political sciences to graduate, my doctors told my school that it would be in my best interests to only have to take the single class that was needed for graduation in the second semester of my senior year. Even with that, and not having any math or science classes at all in my senior year, I graduated with a 3.65 GPA, 5 credits of English, 4 of science, 4 of math, 3 and 1/2 of history, along with other required courses. I had also gone to 3 different high schools in 3 different states. 

I’ve always been an over achiever, but yet I never had to work for it. I never studied, I never needed to. But when I hit college, I struggled. I had a 1.75 GPA my third semester in college. I struggled with finding a medication that worked (never actually found one), I got myself into a toxic relationship that could have ruined my life. I felt useless. I felt like my whole life before had been a lie and I was REALLY just some idiot who was trained to speak like she actually knew something. 

Eventually, I got an emotional support animal, who helped me because once I got him, I NEEDED to take care of him. He was my responsibility. I needed to get out of bed and go to work so I could pay for his food (and mine). I needed to leave the house, because he HAD to go to the bathroom (we lived in the dorms at the time) and I felt safer with him being with me. 

Then, I got out of the toxic relationship. I saw that I was having panic attacks when I went to see my boyfriend. The thought of him touching me made me freeze up. Every text and phone call made my stomach turn and the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I knew it wasn’t right. So I plucked up the courage and broke it off. 

Then, my life started getting better. I found someone who cared about ME, not what he could get from me. I started succeeding in school (2.65 cumulative GPA, 3.3 department GPA), and those feelings of anxiety, the fantasy’s of dying, the migraines, the nausea every time I left the house, the pressure in my head that lead to intrusive thoughts telling me that the only way to make the pressure go away was to bash my skull in... they became a memory. In the last 3 years, I’ve only had 4, maybe 5 panic attacks. I’ve been able to ward off the feelings of incompetence and worthlessness.

But in the past month, things have been creeping back. The pandemic, the economy... I see it everywhere. It saturates every meme, ever conversation. My university has moved to all online classes and urged everyone to go home if they can (I can’t, because I’m self supporting. I pay all my bills myself and I’m tied into a lease). I’ve basically lost my job, because I’m a waitress at a restaurant with ~30 servers and they only need 1-2 servers a night to run to-go. 

Yesterday (or Thursday, I guess) I had to take an 8am online midterm. The professor had such crappy communication with us that NO ONE knew what to expect/do. It’s also one of the hardest classes I’ll have to take while in school.  I finish it with 10 sec left. Idk how I did. Then, I got a call from the company I was supposed to intern with other the summer. My first and only internship opportunity. They’ve canceled their program for this year. 

Today (Friday) I had another exam. As I was reaching to type in a password, I knocked a cup of coffee over onto my laptop. It froze. I can’t turn it back on. Thankfully my boyfriend and I life together and he had a laptop I could use. I’m likely going to have to get a new laptop, but I don’t know how I’ll afford it. 

Today broke me. I’ve cried a lot. I thought that if I didn’t leave the house I’d be okay. I thought that I’ve been careful enough with money to not have to worry for now. My future is truly up in arms over this pandemic (my industry has been highly effected by it, an I’m worried for myself and for those who are graduating “with jobs” as they many not be there anymore). I wonder what has been the point if all of this. I only ate half a bowl of hamburger helper today because my boyfriend made it for us. I can barely pick up a pen to write. No show, no book, no food, nothing is holding my interest. I just want to sleep. I can barley hold to a thought right now. 

I don’t know what to do. What’s the point? Why do I keep trudging along? 

I keep thinking that maybe if I wouldn’t have been so dumb, so clumsy, so irresponsible, I wouldn’t be in this position. But I am. So I must be dumb, clumsy, and irresponsible. I should have known better. I should have BEEN better. I CAN be better. But I’m not. So what’s the point?"
732,I have a serious mental behaviour... PLEASE HELP. (19M).,"The problem is:I'm soo naughty and have rage outbursts... When I see a animal I don't like, I try to hurt it. Like last time, I tried to hurting pet bird by doing something mischievous like not letting it sleep in the night by playing loud music near its cage. Or not feeding it for days. Now it's slowly evolving to people too.. I just get sooo angry when people say bad about me. Its like something else is taking over me. I hear auditory hallucinations means voices in my head to do that and this. I can't control it.

Now I'm getting these kinds of thoughts of killing. And have a thirst for blood. Please help."

734,I've been living through one of my worst nightmares and it wont stop,"I'm a 16 year old male who suffers from overwhelming anxiety and panic attacks, and recently I broke up with my girlfriend that I got really attached to. For a long time we were each other's support system because we both had major anxiety. Since the breakup which was really rough, her and I decided to still stay friends since we both still cared a lot about each other. Recently, she's suddenly completely changed into a different person. She's hanging around with a group of other girls that get drunk and high and do really stupid stuff very often. Both me and the other friends in my group are very aware that we're being completely forgotten about by her ever since she changed. This has been a genuine nightmare I've had off and on since I was a kid. The worst thing my brain could dream up was somebody I cared about so much suddenly abandoning me for cooler more popular friends. And that's exactly what I'm living through. My panic attacks have gotten so bad that sometimes I dont even know if I'm alive anymore. I communicate all this with her and she swears we're still on decent terms, and that she just clicks with her new friends more. She swears that she still views me as a very good friend. But it's obvious that she isnt telling me the full truth on her views of me. She clearly isnt telling me things because she thinks it could hurt my feelings, but the lying is just making it worse. For a long time, it went without speaking that we had each others backs no matter what. And it worked for both of us. But recently I had a panic attack worse than I've ever had before. And it was somewhat related to what's happening with her. It was so bad that I was having serious thoughts about suicide or hurting myself, because I felt so alone. I texted her for help, but she wouldnt respond. I called, and she was drunk with her friends and when she saw the texts, she told me she would talk to me tomorrow because it stressed her out too much. That made it so many times worse in the moment, knowing that the person who cared about me so much just cant help me anymore. When we broke up, we said we would talk about everything there is to talk about in person so we could move on. With the quarantine, that never happened. So we agreed to talk it all out on skype. I made it clear that that would be my first step to helping myself. It was supposed to happen tonight. She said we would call at 1 a.m. because she was busy. I asked if she needed space and she said yes, so I didnt talk to her until 1. Immediately after I stopped texting, she started posting things on her story like ""hmu I'm bored"" and ""ask me random questions"" and she started flirting with the anonymous people asking questions. And it felt like a knife to the gut. I waited until 1 and asked to call, but she said she was too tired. I told her for the second time in about a month that I really needed her help and that i wouldnt be able to deal with this completely on my own. She refused to really help me at all because she was too tired. Half an hour after that she's still online on instagram and i know it sounds petty, but we went from being genuinely in love, to lying to my face all the time for some reason so fast, it all happened in 2 months and I cant even see her throughout it. Does anyone have any suggestions to make this living nightmare end? I feel like I havent breathed in months. I want more than anything to still be friends with her, and aparently so does she, but what am I supposed to do if I keep getting hurt? I dont know how much more of this I can take."
735,"Exam stress, loss, demotivation, epidemic, anxiety/depression and what not. Enjoy.","I haven't been on this subreddit for ages but I figured I should talk to more people about this. This year so far my life has been a series of downs and as much as I try to tell myself that things will get better it feels like they will only get worst. So for most of January I was going through a lot of exam stress due to my AS mocks coming up, and despite studying really hard for it, probably harder than most people, I got terrible grades, and with my actual exams so close I felt like I would have to repeat a year. Despite the pressure and anxiety it left me very demotivated, which I know sounds weird as I needed to work harder than ever now, but I felt as if no matter what I do I will be doing the wrong thing so I didn't know what to do anymore. I considered tuition but the whole coronavirus thing made me realise that it might be impossible for a while. Then my grandfather died a week after and although we weren't ""close"" we still had a relationship and I like to think he loved me, it filled me with dread that he was actually gone. I have never had to deal with a loss of a family member before  so it came as a bit of a shock, and I am the most sorry for my dad because he was his father, and it just felt really weird how changed and depressive the atmosphere had become in my house, and I felt too inadequate to help myself let alone anyone else. Then quarantine happened, and homeschool is harder than I thought, and with everything going on I obviously couldn't focus, and the increased stress regarding my studies didn't help at all. So I fell into what felt like depression for a few days, and a lot of emotional ups and downs. Then things seemed to be getting better for a while, with my dad and cousins seemingly being able to keep distracted and with more closure, and us spending more family time together. But then on Monday we found out that we all (parents, brother and I) have covid, and although I am asymptomatic and my mother and brother have it quite mild, my dad has it the most severe and despite the hospital saying it would get better within 7 days he has had it for a bit longer and seems to be getting worst each day. He hasn't needed hospitalization yet but it looks like a future possibility, and considering most people survive it I don't even want to consider it as a possibility that he may not be able to but sadly I know I do and it makes me so anxious and sad. I literally wake up with heavy breathing and anxiety (at times when I can sleep that is), my sleep cycle is fucked and I can't seem to normalise it which really doesn't help. My mum doesn't make it easier as she is the most expressive about her anxiety and pretty much worships the worst case scenario, which makes it hard for me to not think about it and fill my head with even more negativity. I have also been having an unhealthy relationship with food as I feel hungry without having any appetite. I know this sounds very privileged of me but I miss the luxury of snacks and crave it now more than ever. In a way it makes me realise how I took it all for granted but I can't help wanting it back, especially now when I feel the constant urge to binge eat more than before, and we're not exactly able to shop for ourselves so we rely more on essentials. Sorry about the long rant but this seemed like the only place I could get it out now."
736,Recently diagnosed with BPD,"Hi 👋  
I have recently been diagnosed with BPD. Just wondering what day to day things you all do to cope to make life that bit more easier and bearable? What are your best coping strategies?"
737,I don’t know,"I have started spiralling into depression again. With all the existing underlying issues that have resurfaced due to stay at home thing, is driving me insane. I had recovered from a lot things but things are going bad and bad. I am really sorry and scared."
738,Random thoughts nothing important.,"I thought I wasn't going to wake up last night. Didn't try anything. Just sincerely thought I was about to die. The only worry I had was being found in what I was wearing, just because my pjs where old and worn. I thought to myself, 
""I should try and get up so I can change into something else before I die.""

However I physically couldn't. Seems insignificant, but thoughts of insignificant value regarding significant theme, seem to come more frequent when living with off and on suicidal tendencies. From my experience. 

When I've fallen, real meaning like mortality, starts to become almost ironic. The meaningful things then, from another perspective, look ignorant. As if I've become as comfortable with the idea of suicide, as eating cereal. I worry people think I don't take these things seriously when I'm like this. Or that I think it's a joke. On the contrary I actaully think when someone's at a point like this it's far more serious. I am personally a greater risk to myself when I become comfortable being suicidal. That's when I start to open my skin, and dream of the nothingness that suicide offers. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, fight the idea of being ok with death. Obviously everyone is different. But maybe it's ok to feel the pain, at least to a degree. Feeling pain has to be better than the numbness. Or at the very least safer. I know feeling numb sounds appealing, feels better at first, like a drug. But not caring leads to further risk, it has to."
739,Mental health is #1. Mine is wrecked.,"My life has been and still is being ruined my other people's lies and it's like I don't even have a voice and I feel so helpless. I've been so disrespected and manipulated with by multiple people. I've cried so many times, for months, hey, months. I have no one to talk to, no one to confide in, no one to listen to me, I don't want to do this anymore, i don't want to worry and cry anymore, I don't want to exist anymore. Whatever I do only makes it worse. I won't even bother anymore. Other people don't, so why should I? I'll end up as a pessimistic cynic with a diagnosis. Seriously though. I look at my jumble of feelings and contradicting thoughts and desires and I feel like I'm stuck between being two people. Living two lives. One is for them, one is for me. In one I'm a happy, cheerful, idealistic romantic, who sings all the time, in the other I'm frustrated, indecisive, a cynical sarcastic pessimist who is either depressed or cries from frustration, giving themselves yet another headache. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't want anything from life anymore. I just wanna pretend like everything's ok and nothing ever happened."
740,Relapsed after being clean from self harm for over 3 years,I don’t know where else to reach out I’ve tried to tell friends I need help and none seem to really care. I relapsed Wednesday and I can’t stop myself now it feels so familiar to what I used to be used to in high school. I feel so depressed and I’m starting to really slip up while being isolated due to the pandemic going on. I don’t know how much more of this I can take but I can’t go back to inpatient care the hospital told me if it happened again they will not release me unless I go home to my family (who tend to worsen my mental state at times and are not good for my school work). All my friends went home from college except for the guy I’ve been hooking up with and I don’t know how to communicate that I’m struggling and want support from him. I’m not sure what to do at this point I almost feel like I’m screaming for help but no one can hear me.
741,Finding an old psych evaluation?,"Long ago as a child I was psychologically evaluated. I was very young and remember very little, but the result dramatically effected the rest of my childhood and how my mother raised me. I just want to find out what the evaluation said, so I can know what it said. Thank you!"
742,My friend is terrified of his bedroom,"I have a close friend, whom I spend a lot of time with, and he recently lost his landscaping job due to the coronavirus. Both he and I would often smoke weed together, usually at my house and we would watch TV or more recently he would bring his xbox round and we would play cross platform games. Since Boris announced lockdown, we haven't met up. Just played a lot of Minecraft together. Earlier this week, on Monday he went back to work, and will continue again in 3 weeks, which I'm certain he is excited about. On Thursday he told me on snapchat he'd had numerous anxiety and panic attacks the day prior, and that he had been sitting in the living room watching TV since and even had to sleep on the couch because he was terrified of his bedroom, and couldn't even play his xbox, this wasnt a one off either. This continued until yesterday, but I'm not sure if he slept in his own room last night, but I'm concerned for him, both of us suffer from autism in one way or another and he also has depression. We played Minecraft yesterday morning and I asked him how he felt, he told me being in his room terrified him, made him feel very uneasy and that it made him feel like he wanted to die. Trying to comfort him I told him it could've been that he had bought a dodgy batch of weed, and it just caused him to have a bit of a bad experience, which I am still convinced is a definite possibility, but he is adamant that is not the case. I've been thinking and worrying about him for the last 24 hours and can't think of what it may have been, and I thought of coming here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience, or any idea what it could've been.

TL;DR
As of Wednesday, friend extremely uneasy and terrified when in his room."
743,Just. Why?,"So, about a week ago a coworker saw the self harm scars on my arm and she asked me if I had a cat. I was like, “yeah, why?” And then she said “does he scratch you a lot?” I said “uh, no. What makes you think that?” She gestured to my arms and I didn’t say anything, I just rolled my sleeves back down. 

Then, yesterday this coworker made fun of me in front of my other coworkers. I mentioned being sad about the prospect of the X Games getting cancelled and another coworker said (jokingly) “there are people dying and you’re worried about dirt bikes?” My coworker then said “you better be nice to him or he might cut himself.” She laughed and even tried to grab my arm and force me to roll my sleeves up. One of my coworkers laughed and the other was a little bit horrified but she just let it happen. It was hella embarrassing and hella degrading and I just kind of had to let it happen."
744,Why dont I have normal thoughts,"During the day I zone out and my mind thinks about completely irrelevant and random scenarios or it’s worrying about how to talk to people and being negative towards myself. Unless I’m consciously talking to myself in my head, which never happens it’s like I’m consumed by my subconscious, I never think of important things.

I don’t think things like “what should I get my sister for her birthday”
or
“how should I approach this uni assignment”
or any observations about my surroundings or things I could say in conversation.

What is wrong with me? What do I do?"
745,Isolation is really messing with my head and I’m scared to say anything.,"I’ll try to keep this brief but I’ll answer any questions in the comments. I just got done with a year of absolute hell. I had an unknown debilitating stomach condition, and for nearly a year it was assumed I wasn’t actually physically sick and that there was something wrong with my mind. I was in several locked units, I was forced into doing things I didn’t want to do, I was lied to about medication. My own mother (a nurse) says that some of the things that happened were illegal but that they were for my own good so it was ok. It ended up being cyclic vomiting and treatment is working now. But ever since then I’ve been having a lot of nightmares about being locked in a unit and being forced to do things against my will. Two nights ago I had one where I was in a unit I’d been locked in and the doctors insisted that they were gonna sew my nose shut. I fought and fought but eventually ran out of energy and I just cried while they did it. 
But my main concern right now is that I’m isolated in my room. My family is driving me crazy enough as it is. I no longer have a job. I don’t really have many friends, and those I do have are tied up in their own financial issues and online classes. I’ve been doing my best to distract myself but my mind doesn’t let me stray from the things that are bothering me for too long. I’ll still think back to those times in the units and almost cry. I get upset because I can’t just physically escape for a while like I used to. I’m scared of police, of security cameras, of most medical and mental health professionals because of what happened. And I’m scared to talk about this because I’m scared to be sent to another unit and be put on even more medication. I don’t really know what to do."
746,I NEED HELP PLEASE! ANYONE?!,"I can't help but feel like I'm living a meaningless existence. Ok so to my knowledge the whole purpose of life is free will and making the best of things and making choices to better one's self and just generally trying to do what makes you feel happy or what ever... Point is, I sorta get the gist of all that life has to offer and what not... But still I'm constantly depressed, my social anxiety is to the point where it's seriously affecting my day to day life, I can't uphold a job I can't find anything anymore that keeps my interest besides video games but even that lately has been dwindling. I have two beautiful children (2 year old girl &amp; 6month old boy) and their mother in my life, I care for them greatly and I'd genuinely like to do more for them besides being around and just helping out around the house with the basic day to day things. But still... I can't help but feel like I'm just going through the motions in life without really enjoying anything I do anymore and even when I was younger I had a serious problem with finding something to keep me grounded but I thought that was just teen angst. But now I'm starting to think that something is really wrong with me. When I was younger I had alot of trips in and out of the mental ward in the hospital for you can guess what... But I think all that was Possibly a cry for help, it's been a good 4-5 years since I last went in and in those years I've gotten back with my high school relationship, we have been on and off for 8 going on 9 years and now we've our two babies and just making it by in life. We argue often, more so than I'd like but we always talk through what is going on more so her, I have a problem with expressing how I feel I tend to just bottle everything up and just store it away which I know is not good at all, so I tent to just cherish the good days we have as a family.. and quite honestly I'm afraid of my emotions and how I feel on the inside so I tent not to talk about that stuff at all really.. But I'm trying to work on that... I haven't had a doctor for the better part of a decade and still can't get one due to all the local doctors are not taking in any new patients even before this whole covid-19 lockdown crisis, so no medication or psychiatric help. I literally feel like most days I just want delve back into my demons aka addiction... I want help... I need help... I don't feel like I can change, I don't feel like I really want to progress further on in life I literally feel like I'm at a dead end. I have no motivation. I say I have goals just to keep the people around me happy to make them thing I have a grand plan, but really I dont. I don't like disappointing the people I care for and I honestly don't know if I've ever really loved my family I know I felt something the day my daughter was born and still feel that connection with her I care for my family greatly but I don't know am I just incapable of feeling those true and pure emotions i don't know. Like when my son was born I was in a bad place and ended up relapsing the two or three days just before he was born and when I was in the room when he was born I was still all messed up and feel ashamed of myself for being selfish like that but there is a bigger story behind that so please don't judge me, I'm not perfect and I'm sure alot of people agree with me that we aren't all perfect beings. I just don't know where to turn anymore I don't feel like I can talk to the mother of my children about this stuff because I don't want to hurt her anymore than I already have in our time spent together in this life... I just want some normalcy and to know I'm not alone out here. I don't want to leave my family but I don't want to stay I feel like I'm a burden to them but I also know how much they need me and how hurt they would be if I did leave them and I don't want my children to grow up without their father (me) in their life. So I'm turning to the people of Reddit... The last place I thought I'd find myself blabbing on about how mentally and emotionally unstable I am or feel like I am... I just want some guidance or insight on my troubles... Please if someone out there has felt or is feeling the same way please reach out to me I need to know I'm not alone and what steps I could possibly take.. I'm on my last leg and I don't want to fall back down... 

Also for a hopefully more narrowed down reply or guidance I live in Kingston Ontario Canada, but anyone willing to help, share their opinions or advice is welcome and is greatly appreciated, so long as it is positive I'm not looking for peoples judgement or negativity. I just want some help"
747,Hallucinations and Derealization,"TLDR at bottom, though there's a lot i cannot say in a snippet so i recommend reading.
CW for mental health issues, sui*** mention

Hey there. So i guess i really don't know how to explain this. I've gone to therapists a few times and I would be seeing one right now if it weren't for the pandemic happening. For context i've had panic attacks, s******l thoughts, and pretty extreme periods of depression. About 6 months ago I went through a phase of major paranoia after being triggered back to traumatic experiences. Recently though its seemingly getting worse, maybe because of the pandemic, maybe not. Ive had slight hallucinations in the past, hearing the doors open, hearing people call my name, seeing rats run by. Nothing extreme like seeing and hearing an entire person in front of me, but they still happened. Its gotten worse, its more often now and its making me more skittish. Same hallucinations, but sometimes I see things outside my window or hear more creaking around my house, things like this. Its nothing debilitating, but it's there.

What's debilitating is these weird moments of derealization or dissociation, something of the like. I either become hyper aware of everything around me and who i am and my entire past and everything out of nowhere. The opposite happens as well, moments where i don't feel real, like everyone and everything around me is fake and so am I. Almost every time this happens, which is usually 1-5 times a day, I zone out so much i guess that I cant remember the last few seconds, As if I blinked and lost the past 5-10 seconds. Not a lot of course but it's concerning.

Im sorry if I sound crazy, I know this looks like a post that you look at and think, ""Yikes, what a psychopath."" I would have visited a psychiatrist or therapist regularly if I, 1) Had the money to and 2) Had a family that supported me going. Im 19, so I still live with them. And though they believe in seeing a therapist, they don't really believe in mental health issues such as clinical depression and they certainly don't believe in taking medications for such. 

TLDR: Im having mild hallucinations and moments of derealization that is partially debilitating and worrying. My family is against going to therapy and medicating (if necessary). 

My question for you, the super readers of this post here is, does this sound like it warrants going to therapy? Is it just anxiety getting worse during this pandemic or is it something more?"
748,"My best friend, former roommate, and at least former heroin and fentanyl user, has been missing for almost a week.","My best friend, a prior heavy opioid user who I believe relapsed, has been missing for 5 days. Life is too much.

When I was a senior in high school I got into weed and over the years it escalated until 21/22. I met a friend and eventually roommate trying to sell him mushrooms lol but I helped him get off heroin and live with me because he was basically living in a trap house before. Given his history or serious drug use I’m horrified that he is dead in a ditch with a needle in his arm because no one can reach him and we’ve searched all around his neighborhood and called his friends, coroners office, hospitals, and jails and nothing. I’ve lost 4 people to drugs and suicide since 2018, one on my couch. I found him dead in the morning from mixing fentanyl, oxy, Xanax, and rum. I’ve also witnessed a death involving severe trauma where he fell off a ramp and split his skull on the concrete and I was the only one with him while he died. It was also partially my fault, he was homeless and asked me to buy him cigarettes so I did and I gave him some free benzodiazepines when he was clearly drunk and he fell backwards over a guardrail on a ramp directly on his skull. I’ve lost others to suicide or overdose but I wasn’t there for those. 

Also, my brother is in serious danger with covid 19. He has mitochondrial disease and for someone with his diseases he is fairly healthy and normal and a 19 year old college freshman. Unfortunately mitochondrial disease affects muscle strength so while he can breathe just fine, he needs more time for altitude adjustments and he also gets dehydrated very easily which is why he has a feeding tube but that’s only a partial fix. His specialist said that if he gets sick there’s a 70% chance of him being admitted to the ICU on a ventilator and that’s horrifying because we don’t have enough and if they have to ration them to the people most likely to live, he will die.

The rest of my family is either 54 and older and all have preexisting conditions like autoimmune diseases and type 1 diabetes. 

I’m terrified that I’m going to lose everyone important to me in life or at least a lot of them. I just got a job at a grocery store to help but I’m scared for my own safety even though I’m in my lower 20s and am healthy but I did have an iga deficiency growing up.

I realized that all life is is proteins replicating themselves. So why suffer like I have since childhood with a sick brother, an active alcoholic father, and my own mental and addiction issues? What’s the point of staying here and not being done with it? I guess my brother and mom but if they die due to the virus or unrelated issues I won’t survive. 

I’ve overdosed, had my dad get violent with me and drive drunk with me, I handled my parents divorce alright and I’ve made it through watching my brother starve to death when I was 6-8  before we could figure out what was wrong and what to do. So my entire life I’ve been in crusts more and I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take all of the death."
749,Uncanny coincidences and ocd,"Ok so how do I begin? I have what I believe to be a form of pure-o ocd.  I've been dealing with this since middle school (I am now in my mid 20s).  Over the years I've come to rationalize and cope better with my intrusive thoughts, but lately these past few weeks I have been having these truly uncanny coincidental moments that have never really been as frequent as they have been lately.

Now I have searched reddit threads about this topic, and I do understand that this is quite a common thing for many ocd sufferers.  I'm usually able to be logical about this type of stuff and understand them to just be random occurrences, but these coincidences are just so specific and frequent.  For context, I'm not the most religious person.  I believe there could be a higher power or a higher state of existence, but I've never been super convinced.  I want to believe, but I guess you can say I'm agnostic.

I don't really want to get super in depth with my actual intrusive thoughts, because they are somewhat difficult to explain and it's hard for me to write.  I will say though, they range from harm types to existential depending on the subject of the thought. I want to tell somebody about these coincidences, but it's hard so I figured I'd do it anonymously on here. Even then it is somewhat embarrassing due to the nature of them and why they even bother me. 

On to the coincidences now.  This past wednesday I had a strange occurrence when looking at my phone.  I saw this hot asian girl on a tab I had open related to y2k aesthetics and the such.  I know kinda random and niche, but I stumbled on it through a 2000s nostalgia reddit post I had opened on another tab.  Well I closed the tab with the girl on it and went on with my day eventually having an ocd session.  When I felt sorta resolved in my thoughts, I decided to sorta test my solution I guess?  I thought to myself, for some reason, if I don't have a tab open with a pretty asian girl everything is resolved.  Well when I turned on my phone and my internet browser was open I did have the tab closed.  But I also did have the reddit page still opened and I scrolled through it reading.  I saw one users profile pic and it was a pretty asian girl.  So that sorta shook me a bit, but I eventually was able to get over that and realize it was likely coincidental, and not some sign.  Thing is I keep having more.

Today (well yesterday but I'm still awake from Friday) has been very strange.  I keep seeing octopuses everywhere!  I know that's also random, but I'm not concerned about the fact that they are octopuses or that I saw a pretty asian girl.  It's the fact that I was literally thinking of an octopus just a few moments before I saw it on youtube.  Then it led me to think of kthulu.  And as soon as I thought of kthulu... I see a video about kthulu when I scroll down.  That truly disturbed me. That's two in a row on the same day.  I do not regularly look at these topics on youtube, but I want to believe it's just the youtube algorithm.  The only thing I can think that might cause this was that I watched a Bloodborne video earlier and it has some lovecraftian inspired lore.  But that's not all.  I started looking up videos about Carl Jungs theory of synchronicity that a reddit post had mentioned in regards to coincidences and ocd.  When I was watching the video I saw something in the background.  The guy had a plush/pillow octopus.  I know this may sound humorous to some but it's just the fact that all of these happened in a sequence and being so specific. Plus kthulu has been related to mental anguish.  But there was one more thing that happened just about 2 hours ago that really shook me and made me want to post this or call a friend or something.  I was looking at my phone again and opened youtube looking at pokemon vids.  There's one channel I watch from time to time that had uploaded an hour before I checked.  Now before I looked at this  I had another ocd session and I thought as long as I don't see an octopus pokemon plus my favorite pokemon on the thumbnail together from any video (very specific) then everything with my obsessions will be fine.  And then I forgot the thought. Then opened the youtube page and scrolled down.  I saw this youtubers thumbnail and it had that very specific thing.  I immediately got chills and decided to say a prayer.

I'm sorry if this post is too long.  I just wanted to get all of the details out so that I can explain the whole situation.  I'm really starting to feel worried that these are signs directed to me telling me something about my obsessions, or something related.  I know that it's ridiculous and illogical, but I need someone to convince me and  set my mind straight.  I feel strange.  I almost wonder if I'm in a simulation.  It wouldn't be so bad if the last coincidence wasn't so specific and hadn't of occurred in such a manner."

751,Am i a narc or not?,"My friends keep telling me that I am not a narcissist but i found myself doing things from the list of the ""narcissistic behavior"". I've been a compulsive liar and I am actively working to stop it.   


Back story: My mother in my opinion has NPD at lest for me it is quite obvious."
752,13 years of the same treatment,"
I’ve had 13 years of my life with the same treatment.
I think the happiest time of my life is not being in the education system which for me is until you’re at the age to go to nursery.
In my first nursery I was locked in a dark room for 2 hours for not wanting to share with some other child.
I was later switched to a nursery which I was happy at and thought was a good nursery which keyword is was because as I found out it wasn’t due to the people there.
I found this out on my 3rd day in reception where I was getting attacked by another child for playing with Lego which the teaching assistant then proceeded lock me in a supply closet and from the start of school which was 9 am to Lunch which was 12.
When I told my parents they went into school and complained.
Somehow the reason the teaching assistant locked me in the supply closet is something to do with the fact that the nursery past over information of me being apparently diagnosed with “autism” (which is a lie since I later found out I have PTSD thanks to the lovely treatment of The education system) which somehow made the teaching assistant think I (who was defending my self against another child) was having a autistic meltdown which somehow by her thinking skills made her think the right way to deal with it is lock me in a supply closet (filled with equipment that wouldn’t be very safe or good for my health if it fell on me). 
Thanks to the nursery passing over information of me being “autistic” I was placed in the lower part of the class which wasn’t even a part of the class as all the kids i was placed with either had Down syndrome, autism or some other learning disabilities therefore up until y3 since the teachers didn’t really care about the “special needs kids” education I didn’t know how to read and write (hence my really terrible handwriting that looks like something a y3 would write).
And thanks for me defending myself against another child attacking I started to get bullied which still hasn’t stopped.
When I got into y1 I was then starting to get bullied by year 2s and year 3s and even year 6s and it wasn’t just verbal it was physical which thankfully learned me to defend myself against all the years up until year 5 where I was easily overpowered.
When I defended myself though it would be straight back to my good old friend the supply closet.
Thankfully my parents made the decision to move me at the start of key stage 2.
Year 3 and year 4 are genuinely the only years where I think the education system was easy on me and thanks to having teachers for the first 2 years in junior year I was able to read and write and I was moved to middle set for everything and top set for reading.
Year 5 though they decided it was a good idea to implement the red book.
(So to sum up the red book in a few sentences it a book where if you did anything deemed “naughty” and “misbehaving” by the schools headteacher or your teacher it would be straight into the red book)
The first person to be put into the red book would be chosen as the class example and I was that person.
Why did I get put in you may ask? 
Well it was just because someone in my class decided that it would be a good idea to stab me in the leg with a pencil where I in shock after just being stabbed in the leg with a pencil shouted fuck across the entire classroom.
Somehow the person who stabbed me wasn’t told off at all even though there was a blatant pencil sticking out my leg.
Through the months I kept on getting put in for either A) retaliating or B) verbally abusing another student for verbally abusing me.
It was sometime in year 5 where I just snapped and one night I decided to hang myself.
It didn’t work thankfully but the few weeks I got off from my parents to recover from almost asphyxiating to death was a genuine relief and I was happy.
Year 6 came around and people started to physically bully me again.
I remember coming home with a broken nose after having my head constantly slammed into a fence for simply “hey that’s a bit mean” after hearing another classmate be mean to a boy in y4 ( who is one of my only true friends).
I came in the next day and the people who were constantly physically abusing me in blatant range of the teachers on duty were gonna physically abuse me all over again for one the many days on a ongoing streak.
But on that day I was honestly sick and tired of getting beat up for simply getting an education.
One of them came to punch me and I hit him over the head with my bag.
It ended up just like in the movies.
I had him on the floor and was kicking the shit out of him for trying to punch me until a teacher broke the fight up which somehow never happened even when I was getting a broken nose by having my head repeatedly slammed against the fence.
We were both subsequently put in the red book.
My last few weeks of year 6 were spent in the same repetitive cycle every day.
Wake up.
Go to school.
Get into a fight.
Go home.
Go to sleep.
Repeat.
The summer leading up to year 7 wasn’t like any other summer though.
I wasn’t constantly pissing myself over the thought of having to step foot in school in six weeks.
I went into year 7 and I was instantly ditched by all my y6 friends which subsequently want me back because I hangout with a crowd of people who are more popular than them but me I’m not really popular I’m just the quiet kid that hangs out with them because they took pity on me.
The friend group I’m with now in y8 is somehow much different.
In summer we all played Xbox with eachother and came back in year 8 and all they do everyday on and off Xbox and at school is just make fun of me for “being ginger” or “being less intelligent then them” (which recently backfired on them when I was put into the top half of the school and most them were in the lower half).
They make fun of me for being smaller than them even though I’m the joint 3rd tallest person in the group (if you go by shoulder height Im the 2nd tallest)
I’ve recently been contemplating switching schools to just have a fresh start at life in a school where nobody knows me but I have been pissinf myself over the fact that I’ll be lonely again.
I’m turning 14 in December and look forward to y11 getting over done with and this whole coronavirus lockdown of the country has genuinely been a massive relief.
I’m going to y9 after summer and all I know is that I’ll either be in the same rinse and repeat cycle of being made fun of but then being told “it’s banter” or I’ll be in a different school either a loner or with an actual good friend group"
753,Feel like I'm going to have a breakdown soon for no reason (?),"I feel so empty. I've been having trouble concentrating and holding a conversation without it becoming some ramble or rant. I've been talking less to people and finding that I'm statting to dissociate and think about going back to my old habits recently. (I had anorexia) it's like something us triggering me, but there's nothing to complain about. I'm getting anxious and irritable and I want to talk to my friends and family but I just feel like I have nothing to give. Nothing bad has happened as of late. It's almost like I'm just a body and mind but my soul left me, and I can't explain what it's like cause I'm also numb. I want to express but how can I express nothing? It's just weird and I feel like it's just a building feeling of emptiness but I don't need anyone stressing over me, I just feel like it's getting overwhelming  although I feel nothing. I don't know right now.. this was just a bit of a rant honestly I guess."
754,I found my boyfriends huge porn collection and now everything is fucked. Please help!,"Yesterday I found by accident a huge porn collection on our shared computer. I was shocked and wrote him right away what I found and that I‘m really confused and don‘t know what to think. He came home immediatly and was very mad. He wanted to be alone and didn’t talk to me. I wasn‘t angry I just wanted to know what’s going on. Since then he acts so strange. He doesn’t look me in the eyes, he doesn’t talk. He only says that he hates his life and that I am going on his nerve asking him to talk about the situation. He gets mad at me saying it‘s not always about me and that I should leave him alone. I don‘t understand this reaction and I am scared and confused. I said this situation bothers us both, but he says it‘s about him and that he hates his life and that he wants to be alone. I‘m devastated and feel so helpless. Also I‘m stuck with him due to the circumstances and I can’t talk with anyone, because we have the same friends. Why is he behaving so strange and depressed/angry? He completely isolates himself and leaves me in the unknown although he knows that I am scared and triggered by this behavior because of my history. I am scared that he could harm himself due to his current mental state.

Also I don’t know - is it normal for a guy with a girlfriend to own such a huge porn collection? He is a very sexual type but I feel so insecure and unseen now. As I now scroll through reddit I burst in tears, when I see beautiful women because I immediately think that my boyfriend might wanna fuck every girl he sees. I know it‘s dumb, but I can’t help it. I‘m imagining so many things - perhaps he cheated? I don’t know. Because he doesn’t talk to me and acts so strange. 

I love him so much but I don’t know how to deal with that. He often acts weird and I think his mental health is not very stable. He gets mad and mean very fast and is then the sweetest person. It’s always unstable but it got better with the time. But now I just don’t know what to do and what to think about that.

Strangely I have also so mixed feelings. As I described but then I am horny and miss him physically. What the fuck is going on?!"

756,I’m not doing too bad but I feel like a complete failure?,"I’ve wrestled with this feeling for the last 5 years.

I was always the black sheep of the family. I grew up in a super successful household with my immediate family being wealthy investors/doctors, and my extended family following suit. Everyone in my immediate and extended family graduated college from well-known universities and just seems to be doing awesome. Me, I always feel like I’m trying to play catch-up with them because of choices I made in the past.

I won’t dive into my past/current mental issues too much to ensure anonymity (I don’t want any ramifications from my jobs) but things used to be very tumultuous. My father was a (functional) abusive drug addict and growing up with that kinda influenced me to start partaking in the sauce a little too much as a kid. I wrestled with addiction for a handful of years, dropped out of school and was homeless for a while on and off.

Fast forward a while to the present. 

I’m over 5 years sober and working a good program, I have a decent full-time job making a little more than most peers my age (with no college degree), and also have a promising career in the Army reserve with a deployment to Iraq under my belt (I experienced some extreme circumstances that bothered me, but nothing that I’d say is crippling mentally). I have 2 nice cars and a healthy relationship that’s been going on for around 5 1/2 years. My immediate family ties (even with my dad) are mended I have a great relationship with all of them, and I finally have enough money saved up to move out of my parent’s place and drop a down-payment on a house.

However, I still feel like a complete failure. I am 24 years old with no college degree and despite the turn-around I’ve made, I feel like I’m in stuck in an eternity of self-imposed mediocrity and always will be. I still get condescending remarks a lot from my extended family about how I’m not in college and that I’m never going to actually be successful. I feel like I’ve already given a max-effort approach to life the last 5 years and I don’t know how much more I have to give. I don’t think I’m suicidal by any means, but I feel defeated even in the midst of the relative success I’ve had trying to put my life back together. Does anyone feel the same or have any advice?

TL;DR:
I was a complete fuck-up and a mental mess a while back, and even though I’ve done a good job putting my life back together, I still feel like a piece of trash because I don’t stack up to the rest of my family."
757,I never knew how much my anxiety affected this social distancing thing,"I had to get some groceries at Walmart and oh my god my anxiety started. People we’re way to close to me, aisles felt small and claustrophobic and people we’re in my way. My heart raced and I started to panic."
758,Really struggling mentally,"I worked so hard to get to where I was. I went from dropping out of high school and then dropping out of college due to depression and psychosis, to having a decent job with good pay, plans to go back to college, and being stable for roughly 6 months. 

Now, I'm depressed again. I wake up and just stare at the ceiling. There's nothing to do. I'm not eating or drinking right and am losing weight. I'm staying up till 1 or 2 AM and not getting up till 11AM. I'm not guaranteed a job at the end of this pandemic and I don't even know when it will all end. I share a room with my sister who spends all her time in it so it's not even like I get space to myself. I can't focus long enough to read or write and the thought of walking my dog makes my body ache. 

I shower when I can and try to brush my teeth but I feel so angry and sad. I've completely go back to how I was before and I have no idea how to stop. I desperately want a fag and to just get smashed but I know once I start, I won't stop.

Idk, I just needed to vent. I just want all of this to go away and to go back to normal"

But then a day like today, I got up and she has definitely been crying, has been lying on the couch all day and can barely say a word. She asked me a few days if I ever just feel like crying. I said yes that this is a strange uncertain time and it’s normal to feel a bit down now and again. 

I know that she has been prescribed anti depressants in the past, and as far as I know she is still taking them but I can’t be sure.

Now 2 years later, I am really scared of that touch still being there on those items
For example, if I walk by the fridge handle, I walk froma distance or of I wat on the dining table, I sit really far away from the chair.

OR

Emotionally ON to the max setting: where all the emotions of myself and others are so strong that I can't maintain an awareness of my experience outside of the emotion. 

For example I see a stranger cry and I am struggling to hold back tears. I see someone express joy and I soar along with them. A friend tells me of a loss in their life and I am wrecked for days, having meltdowns of tears and grief. 

At first I was concerned that means I'm a psychopath because of the reduced emotional response but I do have emotional responses they are just either one or the other: really strong or or there at all.

767,What am I feeling right now?,"I don't know what happened to me since the quarantine started. I don't feel to eat. In addition, I get and feel a lot pressure in my work, everytime I got a message from my boss, I lose my appetite. I hate the set up of working from home. I just felt like the pressure is always here inside our house, I have always been dreaming about work, I worked  15 hours a day, it's just too exhausting. I have this fear to communicate and ask questions from my manager whenever I have issues about my task, it feels like I'm being stupid, but  I should not. I don't know. Sometimes I want to eat but when I get to the dining area I feel like I'm throwing up. It's been three weeks now."
768,"partner having a go at me, I put my hands over my ears and screamed like a banshee","I don't really know whether to put this in the 'relationships' or 'mental health' or 'sex workers' sub-reddit. I feel like the lock-down has exacerbated my mental health issues significantly.

I'm a postgraduate student, I had 2 part-time jobs as well now suspended because of lock-down. It's meant my money is almost all gone, and I've started camming (I'm a 28 year old F) to make rent.

I've spent many years in therapy when I was younger from the age of 15. I've always had anxiety, OCD and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I've done a lot better since my adulthood generally, although I have 'episodes' where I become obsessed with something, for example, last year I stopped sleeping, dyed my hair a colour and decided the colour made me hideous, became suicidal, crying all day everyday for a number of weeks.

Recently I had a brief few weeks where my OCD became stuck on 'contamination' and I washed everything in the house repeatedly and felt unclean. A few days ago I became convinced I had a deadly disease (obviously my obsessive mind is being fed with covid19 fears)  and had only a year to live. I was inconsolable, which obviously put a strain on my partner who didn't know how to talk sense to me. These episodes do pass with time, but how long I'm in that irrational state of mind varies.

I tried to spend time with my partner last night, being affectionate suggesting we watch a film, as I spend all day alone in lock-down they are still working (not a key-worker, but just work for a shitty company who insists they come in or lose their job). They were in a bad mood and said they wanted to be alone. I said okay and went and started camming. Before I knew it, it was pretty late. I checked my phone where my partner had text me saying that they guessed we weren't in a relationship because I was too busy having cyber-sex with strangers. He apologised when I confronted him (I began camming only with his blessing, I'm also a non-nude cam model).

This morning, it sounds so silly typing it out, he made himself some soup. I said oh it looks great. I went to taste some picked up the bowl, but sloshed some liquid out by accident. He became nasty and pissed off at me, about how I couldn't let him have anything good and have to ruin everything. And why would I do something like that. And I just, get this urge sometimes where I don't know what to do. Like a real pent-up energy. And I just put my hands over my ears and screamed as loud as I could. 

He looked petrified, stood up a bit shellshocked and went upstairs. I tried to talk to him but he won't speak to me. I think he is being unfair to me, because he resents me partly because of camming and partly because of having to put up with my erratic mental health. I shouldn't have screamed but it didn't really feel like a conscious decision either."
769,Why is my brother acting so egoistical nowadays?,"I [20M] feel really stressed out about my brother [22M] who seems to lose touch with everyone the older he gets. As a kid he used be really easy to talk to. As a teenager he would naturaly become a bit rude towards me and my family. Its really nothing to think too much about except for how extremely insecure he was at the time. I was too but didn't really wanna show it like he did.

Fast forward now the recent years he has become harder and harder to communicate with. He has his own appartement but comes over to us all the time cause he seems to have lost his ability to socialize with his friends. He will constantly complain about how we don't seem to enjoy talking to him when we try our hardest to seem approachable.

Now when we are isolating from eachother my sister [13F] was visiting him and when we tried to call her up she didn't answer. Later she called us up on our brothers phone crying that he had taken her phone. (Our brother is obsessed with not having any media related objects around so its not the first time.) He obviously showed no empathy towards her and just tried to joke about it like he never would have reacted the same if someone had taken his phone. He will complain on our parents on how they raise her and its all complaining all the time we hear from him and it feels like he has lost himself. He constantly comes up with stuff to critizise us for and will later make us feel guilty for not being nice to him. If we say that he is being rude, hypocritical etc. He will become mad and deffensive like a little kid. I don't know how to deal with this and it feels like something bad will eventually happen.

I want to think that im overreacting but when I do I always become really worried after the next time we talk."

772,I can’t cry without causing others guilt,"Hi :-) I’ve posted here a few times in the past and last time I got some really kind advice from someone.

Like I mentioned before, I live with my parents and we do love and care for each other but my parents tend to argue a lot. I sometimes get scared or panic when this happens and put my hands over my ears to block out the noise and/or scrunch up my eyes in fear. This sort of coping mechanism (idk what else to call it) makes my dad mad, bc he thinks it makes me look like I’m mentally ill. I think the problem is he thinks mental illness is a matter of being stereotypically crazy and yelling gibberish, knocking things over for no reason and nothing else. It’s either that or you’re absolutely fine mentally.

I feel bad mentioning this sort of, because it makes me worry that I’m coming across as “ugh I hate my parents” and I don’t at all — if I did, I wouldn’t be looking for a way to improve things.

Just now, I was washing my hands in the kitchen and my dad approached me because he wanted to do the same since there was no soap in the bathroom. I kind of panicked because I didn’t want to be cornered by him (the kitchen sink is in a corner) and told him to please keep away, and that REALLY set him off. He told me not to have “trauma” about being cornered and that being cornered just means intentionally pushing someone into a corner. 

I abruptly felt like I couldn’t take it anymore and after a while I sort of started to cry but I didn’t ACTUALLY cry, tears sort of formed because I wanted to but they wouldn’t come out :-P then my dad told me not to because it makes him feel guilty.

One thing my dad does is try and laugh problems off. I don’t know whether this is healthy or not for people because it feels like it’s just putting conflict to the side as if it’s nothing when there’s obviously a problem that needs to be addressed. And my mum tells me to just not care about what my dad thinks about mental health but that’s not very easy because we,,, kind of live in the same flat.

But anyway, I was advised to look into CBT and it does look like a very good option but a) idk if going to see a therapist is a good idea in these times and b) my parents don’t really think I need it.

I sometimes feel as if I’m trying to make up that I have mental health issues for attention but idk... it’s not been too bad lately but I just thought I’d post something again.  :-)"
773,Stigma hidden under positivity,"Let's say you are experiencing anxiety, or whatever else really. 

People say they want to help you but instead it feels as if they want to change you. 

Like people that have stigma will shame you.
People that are positive towards you and without even knowing they also have a stigma. want you to change any negative emotion to them is bad!

every time I cry im looked at as odd. Now a days its like ""we care for you. you should seek help.ecc""
at first it seems fine they care. 

but then you feel pressured into changing who are and what you feel. 

if you cry on some days they feel as if your not making progress and slowly you start to see the stigma leaking out of them.

Do you guys feel like this? 
Thats people are just wanting to change you not help you?

The difference between helping someone and changing someone is big. 

Stop trying to change someone.But help them instead. if not dont bother to do anything."
774,I don't know what I want to do,"I am currently a first year engineering student. I also have a scholarship from a government-funded organization (luckily). I am even planning to run for student councik for the next academic year despite how my seniors have said that the 2nd year of chemical engineering in our uni will be one of the hardest.

Quarantine has been the equivalent of me having nothing to do for weeks during summer vacation and me ending up reflecting too much and feeling and thinking about many things about myself.

I wanted the challenge and made the promise to myself to study Math and Chemistry in advance to keep up with my studies, hence, choosing the course.

I originally wanted to take a course on theater performance arts back in early high school, but we were reminded early on how it's our best bet to choose a career path that has more certainty to it: finance-wise, majorly. I wanted to my job to consist of my passion of singing and performing in front of an audience... but at the same time, I thought about how it may ruin the fun for me since it will be my source of income.

Yet, I can't keep up with the pace that my classmates have. I don't have this study habit because I always let laziness win over me. The anticipation, making everything seem negative. I hate this about myself, because I feel greatly towards this with academics-- the thing I should be improving on and preparing for even in quarantine... I made it barely alive in my first Calculus subject, and in our second semester, I'm still doing what I did last time, with only a bit of more activity compared to last time.

I am now questioning myself about my decisions. But I guess my studies is not a question because I want a diploma for myself, even if it's just a bachelor's degree. I have come to a point this year that I don't want to excel in anyway with this course and line of job: I just wanted to finish my studies and make myself free and explore what I really want.

Somehow, the thought and feeling of being under a spotlight satisfies me. I want to be a known person somehow. YouTube has been intriguing me since 2013 when I discovered its magical world. The first and last content I made was back in 2015 when I did a cover of Hunter Hayes' Invisible. I think I did not have the confidence to do anymore content. Whenever I come across that video which had less than a thousand views, something sparks in my heart. Passion.

But it always dies. This quarantine, I have already thought of 2 ideas to post. Every month, I will have some idea about a content that I want to work on and post... but nothing has manifested. 

I feel dry when I try hard to achieve.

I feel so lowkey angry at myself to just settle with the happiness I gain when watching other content creators, and leaving myself with nothing created.

""What sparks joy in you?"" that's the phrase that has been echoing through my mind for some days now.

Now, I don't know.

What should I do? I feel like a blank slate wanting to be striped and colored, but at the same time, my actions don't correspond.

I want assurance and I want to create. So much happening right now. Anything is good."

777,"Looking for advice, feeling unwell :(","(Mentions of self harm, suicidal thoughts and eating disorders!) About a year ago at this time, I was a senior in highschool who dealt with a lot of suicidal thoughts and heavy depression. I was in the ER several times but never hospitalized. Once I entered college (September of 2019) I started to make really good progress on my health. I got back on my feet and back on track mentally, I stopped self harming, I stopped feeling sad almost all together. I still struggled with my eating disorder and anxiety but my depression seemed to almost completely disappear. I know it was still there, but it was no longer something I thought about. Fast forward to now, I’ve been home for three weeks since my college closed due to the virus. I woke up thinking about a lot of heavy stuff and (this sounds stupid) started reading a bunch of fanfics and shit involving suicide and self harm because it’s been my way of coping with thoughts of wanting to hurt myself. I know it doesn’t help, it probably feeds into it, but I can’t stop. I’m so scared I’ll fall back into that awful mindset of wanting to die. I know it heavily involves being at home because I don’t like being home, but I don’t know how to cope. I’m transferring colleges but the price is insane so I can’t dorm. I also can’t get an apartment, so being home is my only choice. My dad also lost his job yesterday, and I don’t like him so that means he’s going to be at home (he’s not looking for another job as far as I know because he’s old). I’m trying so so hard to not give into the urges to self harm but this is the first day in such a long time that I’ve had a sort of mental relapse, and it offers me quick relief (even though it’s awful and I always regret it). I’m not really sure what I’m looking for. Advice? Encouragement? I’m tired and sad. Sorry for the long post."

It makes me feel really bad.","It makes me feel like I'm not enough because I feel like I have to do everything right so that if they only had me at least I'm good enough but that's not the case. I really thing this is one of the causes of my depression and suicides thoughts. My therapist quit her job so I can't talk to anyone who understands it about it now.
And I always say I never wanna be a mom because I'm scared I'll be a bad mom and make my kid miserable."
780,I have some kind of weird obssession problem and it's starting to damage my productivity,"First of all, I would like to ask you not to reply if you can't take what I'm about to say seriously. I have been told multiple times that I ''just don't know what real problems look like'', and surprise surprise, it didn't help. This thing is starting to really get to me and I would appreciate some advice.

First of all, it's important to note that I'm a journalist dealing with pop culture. Watching movies, TV shows, playing video games, reading books is an essential part of my life. It's basically my passion and my job at the same time. So read the following in light of that.

Ever since I was a child I had a weird obsession. At least that's the closest I can describe it. I always had to keep my mind focused on one thing and one thing only. In my early years this often meant only watching one specific movie again and again, because I was almost ''obsessed'' with the idea of liking that movie. Same with video games, I always had to have a favorite that took up most of my free time. This might sounds silly, but it has never gone away and it even got worse.

Nowadays the obsession doesn't apply to specific films/games, but the mediums. For example, if I don't play anything for maybe a month, which often happens because video games don't come out that often, then I'm immediately getting anxious that video games don't drink up enough of my time. To the point where I frantically try and buy some shitty game I don't even care about just to cater to the idea that I still like games, no worries.

The exact opposite can happen too. If there are no major movie releases but there are tons of games, I might do nothing but play games for weeks on end, and therefore get completely anxious if I even encounter a video or post about movies, because it just feels alien. It's a sort of vice versa thing where I'm constantly jumping between focusing on video games and focusing on movies.

This is seriously interfering with my work, because I refuse to write articles about games when I'm in a ''movie obsession phase'' and vice versa. In the past I have rewritten actual articles so they don't mention video games, only movies, therefore eliminating interesting correlations and making it an overall inferior article.

I have no idea what this is. I don't even dare acknowledge it most of the time, because people just laugh at me. Sometimes even I feel like laughing at myself, because it's just such a bizarre thing. And yet I can't escape it. It often leads to procrastination, because instead of getting some work done I'm obsessing over whether I'm a ''good little gamer'' or a ''good little cinephile'', and the quarantine has really drawn this out and showed how much of a nuisance it is.

It may be unrelated, but I used to have an obsession with making lists. I had to concentrate my ideas and thoughts on a single paper because otherwise it felt like I'm falling apart and missing out on stuff.

Is there anything I could do to deal with this? Could someone at least give me a reasonable explanation as to why this might be? I feel that if I at least understood that this is something other people struggle with, then I could ignore it more easily. But it just feels doubly embarassing to struggle with something so absurd."
781,A simple question,"If your voicing how you feel about something and the person responds with “well sorry YOU feel that way” or “I can’t make you feel any type of way about anything” is that destructive to the conversation?

Example: my boyfriend has been very grouchy in all this time in quarantine and I was expressing to him that it seems like he has been in a bad mood and been snippy and seemingly putting me down and he likes to tell me that no one can make me feel any type of way and that it’s all me. I am a sensitive person and he isn’t. I can see what he means and agree somewhat but I don’t think that its totally true. I do think the way people treat you and speak to you can have a heavy influence in how you feel. 

Am I wrong? I’m open to all opinions and thoughts."
782,Dating in time of corona. Shoot me.,"Should two sensitive, emotional, individuals be in a relationship? I'm kind of...unstable...he likes me...but he doesn't know how fucked up my brain is. I want him...but I'm worried I'll hurt him... I'm worried he doesn't want me...I don't want to make him cry any more than I already have. I'm so fucking sensitive, easily triggered, afraid, emotional... it's so fucking easy being with someone who you just like and you're not attached to them. But when I really like someone, when I really care, when I really want someone, I'm afraid to show them. I'm afraid to try anything. Because I want so much and it's too much. And I run. But at the same time hope he won't let me go. I don't want a relationship. But I want him. And I'll never have him because I'm afraid. And he doesn't and shouldn't know that because it's way too early. I just...think he should be with someone more rational, normal, stable, less damaged."
783,I can’t stop dreaming about my Ex,"I got dumped by my ex about a month ago to be with someone else and I haven’t really been able to recover. My thoughts keep getting darker and darker. I can go 2-3 hours without thinking about her. Most days I just have complete mental breakdowns. But the absolute worst is my dreams. I keep essential reliving the break up in these dreams. Last night was the worst where I had this happen 3 times, and ended throwing up because this gave me such bad anxiety. I don’t know what to do.

I’m 19 and live in the USA."
784,Intense primal anger flashes - anyone know what this might be?,"I wonder if I'm reading into it too much, but I'm generally not an emotive guy. Very stoic, calm when shit hits the fan. Some things get me quite angry inside, but I've never ever lashed out at anything or anyone. 

Today, after a particular person had angered me, I went off to do some chores and one of those chores was carrying a box. I carried it into a small closet, then stood up and smacked my head on the inside of the closet by accident - in the next 5 seconds I had absolutely no control over what I did. I did a low growl, and quickly turned and got ready to punch whatever did it to me, and in the process saw myself in a mirror down the hallway. I looked like a feral madman. 

It's the first time anything has ever happened like that, and I'm kind of worried that I could now just lose it in an instant and punch someone without any control."
785,I have depression but so does my girlfriend,"I have depression but so does my girlfriend

So, she’s been feeling pretty low these past few days like really low. And I don’t know What to do anymore because she won’t text her therapist. And tbh I’m
not the best at giving advice about depression. I’m starting meds soon and it’s just really frustrating to see her like this and literally have no idea what to do. Because I can’t think of anything. Any advice or solution or something. And it’s always the same like in here for you and stuff which obviously I am and I will for a long time but it’s really hard when I can’t think properly and I feel even worse because I can’t help her. ( We’re also in LDR because of the Coronavirus and our country is on a lockdown so I can’t just go and be with her physically) 
And it’s really hard for me to be there for somebody only verbally you know. Like I’m much better at physical support and idk. Idk what to do and I can’t make her text her therapist because she just won’t listen."
786,Is it normal think about hurting or killing people?,"Now I know what it sounds like but let me explain. I’m not ACTUALLY going to kill anyone or hurt anyone as far as I know of, but I can’t help but to just randomly think about it. 
I could be at the train station and think, I could just push this person in front of the train and they would die. At a street crossing same thing, I could push this person in front of a car and they would die or be severely injured. In the kitchen, I could use this knife and just stab the person in front of me and they would bleed out. Etc etc etc. 

Now I’m not ACTUALLY going to do any of these but I just wanted to ask if this is normal? I feel like most people think these kind of things but recently someone told me that it’s weird to think these things so now I’m questioning whether it’s okay or not. 

Thanks guys"
787,What am I supposed to say to my girlfriend after her attempt?,"Hope this is the right place to seek advice on that...

Wednesday, my girlfriend attempted suicide (pills and alcool, I found her unconscious) for the second time in 3 months (she spent 2 months in the hospital's psychology area whatever you call it in english and it really didn't help her). She's in the hospital, she seems to have recovered without any problem, so that's a huge relief (for me more then her). Yesterday she started waking up, but she was still too out of it, so I couldn't talk to her (because of the pandemic, I can't visit her in the hospital, it's definitely the hardest part for me). Tonight, I should be able to talk to her, the problem is... I have no idea what to say.

She really didn't want to be reanimated (she left a note), so I imagine she's devastated it didn't work and could be angry at me that I didn't let her succeed? So I really have no idea what to say. I can't just ask her how she feels because obviously, she is the far opposite from well. I'm not someone who has personally dealt with depression, I have no intention to die anytime in the next 60 years, so I can't relate to how she feels and I'm really shitty at comforting someone, never knowing what to say or what to do. Normally, I just hug her and try to calm her down and it generally works well enough, but right now, even though that's all I want to do, I can't. I fucking can't. All I can do is try to talk to her (if she even wants to) on the phone. And I don't want to say something that will just make it worse...

I'm lost, I don't know what to do, any kind of advice would be welcome, here..."

789,Frustrated,"I've always been one to just kinda keep my problems to myself but ever since I've gone into university things have been piling up and I thought that it was maybe time I actually share my problems and talk to someone because I really feel myself getting worse day by day.

Now comes the frustrating part: everytime, every single time I sit in front of someone and I think I'm ready to share my problems I go absolutely mute and I have no idea why. My throat closes up and I can't speak and I just end up saying nothing. This probably sounds dumb because all I have to do is open my mouth and literally say something, anything. But I can't. And I don't know why. It's like my mouth is glued shut.

If someone can tell me why this happens or just give me some advice please do so. This has been frustrating me for such a long time now."

Most of my life I experienced from anxiety but it became worse when I went to college. I developped social anxiety, general anxiety, and panic attacks. My body was always on alert and I had problems sleeping. I also did not have control over my body anymore, I even got muscle spasms in my neck which made me even more self-consious and even more anxious. I also had problems with reading because my eyes couldn't focus anymore. This resulted that I had no motivation to even study, to go to classes or to do anything at all! My school results would also get also influenced by it. Ultimately, I just would avoid to go to school and sit at home playing videogames.

I could not live with it. Then i decided that enough was enough! I went to a psychiatrist which presribed me Zoloft. I started from 25mg to now 100mg which is my current dose.

It worked! It worked so good! I was confident again i could finally see the world and kick it in the balls.

However there was some side effects: 

1) Hair loss and weight gain but i could live with it!

2) There was also a period however when i relapsed which was thanks to co sumption of protein (chicken and whey protein) when i wanted to build some muscle. This was because protein rich foods contain already a dosage of serotonin which Zoloft already provides. This phenomenon is called Seroronin Syndrome. I saw that a lot of people on the interner experienced this same problem. I decided to just eat normally and not eat a lot of protein anymore which was annoying but it made me better.

3) There also a relapse when I got Zoloft from a different manufacturer which would have the same effects but not for me, so I kept to the same manufact. and I am fine again.

Now I want to stop with it, it dont want ro be dependent anymore on it, I want to live my own life but i have a feeling I'm going to be dependent for it for the resr of my life.

How can i get rid of it? What are you experiences with it? Just lower tje dosage to 50 mg? Talk maybe with a psychologist and talk about underlying problems? Yes I am going to contact a doctor about it but I am stuck here in another country thanks to Covid19. Thank you all!"
797,Trouble making decisions,"Hey! 
I don’t know why I’m making this post it’s just something that been on my mind. I tried to turn to google for answers but came up with nothing. So I’m here to see if anyone feels the same, and also to feel less alone.. i guess. 

I’m a 25 year old female who struggles with making decisions. Yes I’m an adult who still struggles with that. I over think every single possible outcome, and when I finally make a decision I’m left with regret. I’m always left feeling like I made the wrong choice big or small. 

This has been an issue I’ve struggled with since I was a child. 

I got diagnosed with anxiety and bipolar depression last year but my medications don’t seem to be working, as I am still anxious. 


I just started seeing a therapist and I’m getting re-evaluated but I have to wait for my insurance to approve it.

My question here is does anyone else struggle with this? How to you cope? If you were able to overcome this, how? Also what could be wrong with me? Is this just anxiety?

I feel like I live every single day with regret and it’s becoming unbearable"
798,How does one learn to improve for the sake of themselves rather than others?,"I work in an industry where other's respect is dependent on your knowledge and usefulness, and I'm low on the ladder since I lack skills, one of the oldest around, and entered the field late in life. They also aren't aware of my personal handicaps that affect my energy levels, memory, and attention.

In video chat meetings I've seen another colleague grin and laugh behind their muted headset when I've reported my status and it's horribly demoralizing. I'm a failed human being to some of these people.

All I can seem to think about is proving them wrong, which is impossible since they've scaled mountains in their work and knowledge and I'm just walking up the first couple hills as an older man.

This sort of thinking causes me to give up since I don't care about improving for my own sake and I know I'll never live up to their expectations. After a childhood of being bullied I just want respect. How can I care about improving if I know I'll never find it and any improvements quickly fade away?"
799,I can't love.,"Due to bad past experiences, i think i have completely lost my ability to love a person (in a romantic way ofc bc I love my parents). I feel irritated whenever a girl talks to me or I even see a girl. I am not gay either lol. But, I can't spend a single minute with any girl and I don't know how will I be able to spend my life with one."
800,I smoked CBD and completely lost touch with reality,"Little back story. I used to smoke a lot of weed, like A LOT. My parents got divorced and then my dad found a girlfriend, they fought a lot. I was around 14 at the time. Were talking violent, fights, 2-3 times a week it seemed. I started having panic attacks alot. I then developed Depersonalization, a disassociation disorder where I feel like I'm in a dream and its very panic inducing. Well years go by and I havent had DP for a long time now. I'm 22 now. I started to smoke CBD becuase of its calming effects, I smoked too much or something one day of a particular strain and I had the worst most distressing panic attack of my life. I could hardly tell where I was, i slept for 14 hours and now today its still lingering. If yesterday was a 10 I'm at about a 4 now. I've been having suicidal thoughts because this is so terrifying. Constant fight or flight. It feels like it will never end. I really dont know what to do. Today my grandma hit her head on a sink and I had to take her to the hospital. She isnt doing so hot but i was starting to recover and this made it worse. I want this to end so badly. Its sheer terror. I feel like I'm going to die.  Usually panic attacks last an hour or so for me. But over 22 hours???? Is this normal. Someone please shed some light"
801,Friend blacks out occasionally,"A friend of mine (F14) has a lot of issues in her life that I don't know all of them and I won't go into too much detail but she has severe depression, lots of deficiencies and lots of painkillers and supplements needed to be taken everyday. She also has anxiety and panic attacks daily and she is emotionally and verbally abused at home from what I've been told. However, she told me that every now and then she has these black outs where she describes it as losing consciousness but continuing to do things and then waking up about 10 minutes later not remembering any of it. What I'm concerned about is the last time this happened was probably halfway through February, she blacked out and woke up on the floor of the school bathroom with cuts in her wrists surrounded by blood. She has been doing somewhat better with managing the cutting but when she does it with no control, there's not much that can be done and I'm really worried for her. Now with this COVID-19 lockdown stuff, there's no escape for her from home and no chance for her to catch up with the needed physical friendship so I'm just really scared she's going to blackout again and do something bad. I'm wondering if there's a name for this and if there's known causes and treatments."
802,I need support and feel ashamed to ask,"I live alone and haven’t seen another person in weeks. I know there are so many of us in this boat and everyone I know is struggling so I feel bad asking for help right now. The world is falling apart and I feel like I’m crumbling along with it. 

I’m doing my best to take care of myself personally. When I can I reach out and ask for support. I try to schedule calls/FaceTime sessions with my friends and family but I just keep thinking if I didn’t reach out first no one would talk to me. I have a few good friends, who also struggle with mental health, but this whole situation has made me realize how little support I have in my life. 

I don’t really know if there’s a question here I just needed a space to be honest. Thanks for reading"
803,Having issues with weight on my medication.,I’m on lexapro and Buspirone and I’m having issues losing weight. I’ve changed my diet up completely and I’m exercising a lot more (going on 6 months now) I am just curious if anyone else has had issues with losing weight while on these medicines? I’m currently deployed so I am not allowed to stop taking my medicine until I get back home. I feel at a complete loss. I’m at the heaviest I’ve ever been in my life and I am worried it may impact my military career. I’ve been on these medicines for a little over a year now and I have gained 20 lbs.
804,I feel like if I need to see a new therapist all I have to do is give him/her my reddit account username &amp; password instead of spending ages trying to figure out how to tell them what’s wrong w me.,"I feel tired of explaining my life story over and over again to new therapists. The feeling sucks. 
It cannot all be crammed up in an hour"
805,Why do I tend to feel like everyone's against me?,"I often feel as though people, including friends, are silently judging me or are just keeping me around for pity/to be polite. I know it's all in my head, because it's not like they've said or done anything to make me feel this way, but I don't understand why this feeling keeps happening when it's essentially baseless.

It's worse when I interact with strangers. I don't feel welcome anywhere despite being greeted politely and interacted with normally by others. I wouldn't say I'm a shy person, but this feeling presents itself in most social situations and it makes me dull myself down in fear of saying the wrong thing or revealing how weird I am. This feeling is ruining my ability to be candid when I socialise."
806,"Mental health is at an all time low, I haven’t eaten in two days &amp; I have no desire to eat.",
807,33 and experiencing mental decline,"I have found myself, lately posting and saying things that make sense to me at the time but the sentence structure is extremely poor or the thought made no sense in the first place. Sometime almost r/ihadastroke worthy. I have never been a great writer and maybe I'm over thinking it."
808,I feel SO irritated I want to take my skin off. I feel like a prisoner in my own body,"I know this sounds weird, but hear me out. 

Every since I was a kid, certain things would trigger me to freak out irrationally. When I was a baby, my mom would find me trying to pull my clothes off, stretching all my little baby sweaters out in a fit of frustration. Then when I was a bit older, it was my hair. I'd be so frustrated by how my long(ish) hair would touch the back of my neck and get tangled from time to time. Eventually, my mom took me to go get it cut into a cute little toddler bob and I was relieved. Then it was socks. If the line on the top of my socks didn't line up perfectly on my toes, I'd squirm and writhe around because I was so uncomfortable. 
Pretty consistently my whole life, things like that have bothered me. One thing being jeans. I hate how jeans feel on my body. I feel constricted. I hate the rough feel. I hate the bulky area where the button and zipper is. I hate how it looks when you try and cover that area with a shirt. It looks and feels awful to me. 
As I've gotten older, I don't have moments like this to the extreme like I used to, but every once in awhile I will wake up one day and just wish I could remove myself from my body because everything is upsetting me. Today is one of those days. Yes, I am particularly stressed out today for a number of reasons: quarantine, my job, my infuriating coworkers, my dishwasher that is not working, my sink that isn't draining, my online class that I can't focus on, my car that needs to be fixed because I hit a curb and damaged the front. It all feels like its accumulated over time and now everything is in shambles around me. 

Also, since quarantine, I've gained a couple pounds. Not anything significant at all, though. I'm a tall, rather slender woman and always have been. But when I feel ""chubby"" that amplifies all of my frustrations. Suddenly I am very aware of my chin and my belly and my outer thighs. I writhe around flexing muscles in an effort to calm down these feelings that my body is expanding and looks bad. I KNOW that I am not fat or that I've turned into another human being overnight, but it FEELS like those things are true. 
I don't know if my lifelong frustrations are tied into body image, though. Maybe they are. But right now I feel like a prisoner in my own body. 

HELP! Does anyone have any insight into what the hell is going on with me?!

TL/DR I often get SO frustrated by external stimuli that I want to remove myself from my body. Everything is overwhelming and frustrating. I don’t know what is wrong with me"
809,What’s wrong with me?,"I’m 28 and have been diagnosed with ADHD since about 12 and was treated for depression in high school. At this point I’m almost positive I’ve developed borderline personality disorder due to fears of abandonment stemming from my late adoption when I was 2.

I ask have several really intense and completely baseless fears that I don’t understand. I’m a fairly picky eater and am horribly embarrassed about it to the point where I will choose not to eat anything at a company dinner to avoid people seeing what to order or watching me eat it. At lunch I’ll only eat in the break room if no one is in there and even then I’ll sit in the furthest corner and turn my back so I’m facing the wall. I’ve gotten in my head and stressed out so many times about what I’ll do if in the future I’m at some important function and have to eat food I don’t like in front of people. It’s awful. 

I also have a fear of dancing. I get so much second hand embarrassment from seeing other people dance poorly that I just can’t ever bring myself to dance in front of anyone, ever. Not even once. 

Is this just part of the over emotionality of ADHD/BPD? Is this something else? I know it seems silly but it’s actually quite crippling. What’s weird is that in general I’m extremely extroverted and carefree and quite confident in myself. But certain things trigger this neurosis and make me completely retreat inside myself."
810,X &amp; Ys: My World turned Upsidedown,"Please take some time to read this.
Hello. I have been diagnosed of clinical depression with psychotic symptoms years back to bipolar I and after a few therapy, BPD. I had trouble maintaining my normal weight when I was in junior high. If I have to estimate the times I've eaten something every week, it would be twice or trice, and water would be at most a litter/week. I  have been hurting myself since I was in 8th grade and my first  attempt when I was in 6th grade. People around me have noticed my quick change in relationships with friends and partners. I'm in my early 20's. My psychiatrist gave me anti psychotic pills to stop my auditory hallucinations. But in the long run, it didn't help. The partners started right before 7th grade and didn't last long. After a few days, there's another one. It went on for so long. I started going to therapy because of my harming behavior. That was a little before 9th grade. Still having randomly short span relationships. Everytime the relationship would end, I find myself cutting with a shard of glass or a blade or a broken pen, basically anything that  would make me bleed. This is applicable to crushes as well. I couldn't help myself. I never mentioned these flings to my therapist back then, I've only told the serious ones. Fast forward, college. Dyed hair, lots of piercings in different places, cuts,vices, and daily starvation of myself. My second serious 1.5 years relationship ended and after a month I met this guy who we'll call ""Tod"". I'm in my second year in college. Around 17, I live in the Philippines. We became friends then went in a relationship. The relationship was fast, just a month and we've already slept together. It was a rollercoaster, we had ups as well as downs. We cut classes to go to the arcade or drink and smoke, we went outside the city to far places, we buy a lot of cigarettes. Then on my 18th, the abuse started. I admit that I have slept with some of my flings when I was younger. And Tod never failed to remind me that I'm a slut and a whore every single night. My parents like him so they allow him to spend the night in our house. We go to the same University. Every single night, despite me being tired from all of the school work and projects, he would insist of having sex. I sometimes fall asleep during this. He would hit me to wake me up and tell me that I'm shit for not giving him his need for pleasure. Sometimes he would tell me ""you're the dirtiest woman that I have ever known. Do you think that anybody else will love you like me? You're worthless. Nobody will ever respect you because you're a whore."" Those exact statements. I wouldn't be able to sleep every time he says that. Then the physical abuse started. He would pull my hair, hit me, choke me when we get into an argument. He would blame me for his actions towards me. He would also yell at me in public. Then came when he tries to control my emotions in public stating that it would make him look like a bad guy if I cried, and would get angry and hurt me. The abuse went on to my choice of being an atheist. Since Tod is a religious person in a religious family, he would often say that I'm evil because I don't believe and worship ""God"". The relationship was on and off
 He didn't like me being quiet and walking away whenever we had an argument or misunderstanding. He wanted for us to talk about it, I wanted to cool my head first before the talking. That made him even more mad. That's usually how the physical abuse starts. Why didn't I tell this to my parents? Because I had the thought that they like this guy so much and would hate me if I hurt him. Dad treats him like a son he never had. I kept this all to myself. I had a party to celebrate my 18th and that same night, he went to an after party got drunk and called me because of his extreme jealousy over my guy friend in High School who went to my party. Blaming me that we hooked up or having an affair. I didn't have another guy or relationship. Our group of friends believed him and decided to exclude me in the group. Then Tod left the group too to be with me. The abuse didn't stop. It got worse after a few more weeks. I started to have auditory hallucinations. He would harass me even through text messages. These were the things I've heard and read:
You're worthless.
You're a slut.
You're dirty.
You should just kill yourself.
Die.
You are useless.
🖕 ( A bunch of this)
You're nothing.

We were in an on and off relationship, every off, I would usually be the one to apologize and patch things up. He usually blames me for having an affair even tho I'm not. This went on for a year more. Finally we broke up. It was hard because I wanted to patch it up but he didn't. Then after some time, I accepted the end of it. Throughout the relationship, the harming and attempts never stopped. He was the one pushing me to do it. 

After a few months, then came another one. We didn't last long. Then another one. Keep in mind that I was still trying to move on from that toxic and abusive relationship that I admit got repressed at the very back of my head. Most of the memories of the abuse and the exact details got repressed and I would only be able to remember when I hear something or see something that would remind me of it. I'm living independently now. A This is my current bf, ""Mark"". He knows that I'm still moving on even after the break up 3 years ago. Last year was hard on the both of us. Exactly a year ago, I had stopped going to work and had been locking myself in my room. Hurting myself every chance I got with anything I can get a hold of. The voices grew louder and clearer. The cuts got deeper and that was it I said. I have tried to hang myself in multiple occasions and cut myself deep on my wrist, arms, and thighs. He always finds me and stops me. 11 straight nights of these extreme self destruction. Then we decided to go back to therapy. Now with a psychiatrist. She gave me anti psychotic pills 300mg on our first session. For my extreme self harming and hallucinations. The meds didn't work in the long run, it just made me drowsy all day. I stopped then went to refer for another therapist. This time a psychologist. It was going well then we had financial problems. it stopped too. I resigned at my old job because of Tod randomly popping anywhere in the internet. During the 3 years, Tod would request to follow or send a friend request  on my social media accounts. Everytime, I would feel anxiety attacks and trauma feeling comes back. He recently sent me another request on ig and it's been over a week. I have been having dreams with him in it every night. It's not bad dreams but it triggers my anxiety and paranoia. He's still in the city I live in and I can't function properly at home and work when I remember this. And the dreams too. Every time he tries to get in my life, I would feel the urge and idea that it would be better for me to die rather than see and hear from him again. I am so scared. Everytime I feel okay, I unblock him and he would request again. I feel the need to talk to him to know if he is okay but I also feel scared as hell. I want to do it. To stop remembering the painful memories. But I feel like I want to get back with him because I ""miss"" the abuse. I don't understand myself. I know the relationship was toxic but I'm still hoping for another chance. I keep denying this idea but it makes more sense to why I cant keep him on my block list. I am not a masochist. I dont hurt myself for pleasure. I find it as an escape of reality and to know that I am still alive if I bleed.  My want to commit suicide is high as well. I dont know what to do. Mark is helping me out but every time Tod appears out of no where, my whole life turns upside down and out of control."
811,How to Deal With a Toxic Mom,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has dealt with mental illness. Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, anger issues, and most likely a mood disorder. These episodes come in waves and when they do they are extremely hard for me to handle. I’m 32 and my mother is 54. Anytime I try to tell her I’m anxious, depressed, or sick she will tell me “you’re fine” and not want to talk about my feelings. I told her this is hurtful to me because she makes me feel like she cuts me and my feelings off when I’m trying to open up to her. She says that is her way of helping and that she wants me to tell her what she should do to help me. As I’m trying to tell her that all I really want is for her to listen and to ask what’s making me feel anxious, what am I doing to help my anxiety, etc, she’ll cut me off and say “can I speak now because you just keep going on and on” and it’s very hurtful. I then become quiet and say a few words which piss her off because she doesn’t understand why I would be upset that she was so rude to me. She can’t handle any type of shame or negative feelings towards herself because she can’t accept shame. She has majors issues with her childhood and how she was raised, she was also in an extremely abusive relationship with my father and she’s never worked through any of those issues. I asked her to get therapy but she says “they tell me everything I already know”. And it’s just very difficult talking to her 75% of the time. I am a calm and understanding person. I never raise my voice or talk down to her, I tell her how her behavior makes me feel and she becomes so offended and won’t talk to me, and makes me feel like I did something wrong. 
My question is how do I communicate more effectively with someone like this?"
812,I'm going mad,"I don't know what this is. Might delete later.

I'm a young woman in my twenties. I have suffered from anxiety and recurring depression my entire life. I have had several stress burnouts. This is by far the worst.

I haven't slept for a month. I wake up several times a night with my heart beating, my body pumped with adrenaline and with lots of anxious thoughts that just feel like I'm falling deeper and deeper into a dark hole. I can't be alone for a second. My partner was staying with me, but now he has to work and he has night shifts. I'm staying in my mom's house. Sometimes I sleep next to her in her bed holding her had, because of the anxiety attacks. Or I sit with her dog who calms me down. I can't take care of my studies. I'm such a fucking baby.

All day I'm a zombie. I have to be put on leave from my study, but every time I sit down to fix it my heart starts pounding, I get a headache and I feel disoriented, så I end up giving up. I used to cry daily, but now it's like there aren't tears left and all I can do is shake and out my face in my hands. 

Sometimes my skin is buzzing and tingling. I can't keep a normal conversation. I can't keep any focus. I have zero thoughts. 

I don't want to get into it, but this is all due to a medical problem. So on top of this, I'm I'm daily physical pain. I have lost all life quility as I can't do most physical things. I used to love sports. Haven't done any for weeks. I'm unable too. Can hardly take a shower or brush my hair. 

I have treatened to kill myself more than once due to this. I even started telling my partner how much I loved him and how I want him to move on from me when I'm no longer here. He convinced me to contact a hotline, which is probably why I'm still alive. Don't even want to think about what would happen, if I was alone in my apartment right now. 

I'm not looking for pity. I just wanted to get it off my chest. So desperate at this point that I'm holding fucking crystals and I'm not even spiritual. 

I do have a therapist that I am in contact with. Will soon get to tell him where I am. 

If you read this, thank you."
813,I need help so badly... But there is no help for me. This world is so fucked. If there's a God he's a sadistic piece of shit.,"I'm sssooooo mentally and physically ill. I am self-diagnosed with psychosis from leaving bipolar disorder untreated for so long. I'm ssssoooooo severely angry and anxious and depressed and miserable. I'm a severe hypochondriac like I've never seen before. I haven't gotten a full night of restful REM sleep in years. I wake up every couple hours and stay awake for a couple hours. I'm 99.9999% certain I have cancer. The terrible pains I have throughout my entire body in the scariest places can't possibly mean anything besides terminal illness and I'm so afraid to die. I'm beyond petrified by doctors because I'd rather live with 99.9999999% certainty that I'm dying than to be put in that situation where they tell me I'm 100% dying and tell me the horrifying-sounding disease names I have and give me an expiration date. I would then just sit in a corner rocking back n forth in terrorizing anticipation of that date. I'm so afraid of this illness going around and I just know that if I catch it my inevitable premature demise will be that much sooner and that much more painful and excruciating. I'm spending every day freaking out about catching this damn virus. I just hate how fucked up this life and world is. I didn't ask to be born. I'm stuck in a toxic relationship with a bitch who's also mentally ill and gives 0 fucks about me or anyone but herself and taunts me about my mental illness. I could go on for years about how fucked my life is. I just want to be cured and live a long happy life and help the world. Now that I would even be a tiny bit possibly willing to see a dr about my preexisting conditions, I'm even more afraid that if I leave the house I'll catch the virus. I live in an apt complex and have a dog that I have to walk several times a day and I'm so scared to. I hate this shit. I just want all the bad shit to go away. I want to be cured and healthy and utilize my full potential to help people. I have so many ideas on how to help make the world an even slightly better place but I can't do shit with this crippling mental and physical illness. Sorry for being selfish and coming here to complain about my problems instead of trying to help others. I'm just so useless in this current, miserable state. What can I do? I also have severe pill anxiety. Pills are so unnatural and kill you with a million other symptoms and illness than the ones theyre meant to treat, etc. Sorry I'll shut up now and continue wallowing in my hopelessness. I hope you all are doing better than me. I don't wish this on my worst enemies.

tl;dr- I'm severely mentally and physically ill. I am 99.9% certain I'm dying of cancer and I'm terrified of it. I'm terrified of this virus and that would be 100% death if I catch it, which seems inevitable from all the grim news I keep hearing. I just want to stop being so mentally and physically ill. But my crippling fear of doctors and pills is far too great to overcome. "
814,"""Dealing with someone with mental health issues is worse than the illness""","
I had another bitchfit with my family for being unsympathetic towards my mental health. I threw out the cliche and childish ""you dont understand what it's like having severe mental health issues.""(Yes, I know this isnt a good argument, but I was extremely frustrated.)

They returned with"" Well you dont understand what it's like DEALING with someone with mental health issues!""

 I understand that taking care of a person with mental illnesses is draining and I commend people who have the patience and empathy to do so. However, it's not the same thing as having the illness.

Most days, I flip-flop between intense overwhelming panic and complete numbness. My brain hyper focuses on inane details and blows them out of proportion to the point where I cant stop my intrusive thoughts. I'm housebound due to my panic disorder and I cant escape my mind. Everyday feels like a fucking nightmare. This is not the same as putting up with my sorry ass for a few minutes!"
815,Is sadness physically debilitating?,"Lately, when I'm sad (if that's even the word to describe my feelings), I get very physically weak. I move slowly and painstakingly. I don't have the energy to do things. It wasn't always like this. I don't know if it's normal. It's scary."
816,Will it ever get better?,"(Just a little rant because idk, you don't have to even read it)

I know it's up to me, but it's just so difficult, I feel like it's beyond me to create a better life. All I want is to be calm, secure, happy and free. I'm not dreaming of anything big, just normal things. I'm tired of my fears and negative emotions holding me down and not being able to deal with the problems that are present in my life."

I realised that none of my friends text me regularly or ask how I'm doing or check up on me, and it just suddenly hit me, I'm the friend the no one cares about. And I dont know how i feel about it.

About 3min and 14 sec. In, I heard the woman say ""being a child of immagrents we suffered through mental illness and PTSD and the focus was on making sure you assembleate, get a good job, make sure people see you as an American..."" I am a daughter of an immigrant father and we all suffer from mental illness and PTSD in different ways... does anyone  know more of what connects immigrants and mental illness? I understand the survival mode and behaviors that get passed down but am curious to her almost ""normal"" tone as maybe there is more to this being a normal thing that I may not know. Or maybe I am just over thinking, just thought I'd throw it out and see. Thanks."
822,Fear of getting worse,"Hi I wanted to just share something I’m going through and ask if someone I feeling the same . 
I have had problems with psychosis for a while I’m don’t diagnosed with schizophrenia. They called it- psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. 
So I basically have bursts of psychosis they happen rather fast I feel strange for like 1 month and that I get psychotic. 
I’m scared because I’m starting to feel strange again.. like I’m floating outside of my body and time seems to be all over the place. I also hear steps and people having conversations. I live alone so I know it’s probably not real. I’m scared I’ll get worse. I don’t want to go through this again I’m just so scared. And hospitals are full so I’m not sure they can take me in if stuff goes downhill. Both my parents are in the healthcare community so they are very busy and I can’t put pressure on them. 
I just don’t know Im scared of losing reality again especially now"
823,Living Fearless (Freedom From C-19),"**Living Fearlessly is about waking up to that which we truly are, it’s a moment by moment prioritization of that which is real over the illusions**

You are all that you need, reality has never been certain.

Certainty and safety can’t be found in the world of form.

True safety lies in the core of our being, here we realize that there is no reason to hang on to fear.

Once that we realize that we’re one with the universe/infinite intelligence fear will be transcended.

824,I've come to the conclusion I should never be in a relationship,"I read the book no longer human by Osamu Dazai and I have never related to anyones mental state so closely before.

I am still young and have never been in a serious relationship before and I think I'm going to keep it that way.

The mc of no longer human was already on a mental downward spiral as am I and when he got Into relationships it seemed to be much worse."

826,Should I change my doctor?,"After a year I found out she believes in pseudo science like homeopathy and occult practices. I had my first share of doubts when she started saying new age nonsense but I brushed it off. I don't know what to do. I don't want my therapy to involve occult nonsense. But she managed to stabilize me through medication it's only when we started talking my problem begins. Well maybe a bit sooner. When I stopped any progression and just stayed at the same level. I don't even know what my diagnoses is. Right now she says that i'm healthy just lazy and that I have to just fight it. I don't know what to do

Edit: It doesn't matter anymore. I don't think I'll be able to talk to anyone anymore anyway"
827,Religious OCD is a nightmare,"I can't keep going on with this shit man, every single day I worry if what I'm not doing isn't enough for God. What if I'm not praying enough, what if I'm not doing enough, what if God wouldn't want me to have hobbies, etc etc. I can't sleep. I stay awake until like 4 AM becuase I'm panicking so much. I feel like everything I do is wrong. And of course with all this Coronavirus nonsense going on I can't go to a therapist or anything of the sort. I've been having suicidal thoughts, I get random headaches, It's just painful to deal with. Nobody understands what's going on here man. Nobody gets it. I just get told to get over it or get called weak or stupid. I don't sleep anymore I can't sleep I don't. I feel like being dead would be better than living this way"
828,Be well -simple. Less is more,"Just a simple post. If asked to, social distance. You don't need to be ill to do this. Pickup the phone, use social media to connect . If doctor has ok'd, do some light walking distancing fr others. Simple excercise if your doctor has ok'd.

Less contact now will help us more in longrun.   I've been triggered lately by few things. Not a big religious person but prayed thanked God and then felt calm.

Hope this helped a bit. I'm not a professional or expert at this at all. Just giving my two cents"
829,Motivational Advice/Idea: write down a list of everything bad in your life and everything good in your life,"*^(Idk if I'm allowed to post advice but here goes.)*

The other day, something happened to me that made me feel very upset: I sent an application to a university and it got rejected. This caused me to feel very bad about myself and think of myself as a failure. I was quite miserable for the rest of the day.

Now, many of you have probably heard of writing down your emotions as a way to better your mental health. I came up with a twist on this: rather than writing down my emotions, **I decided to write down all the things that are** ***bad*** **in my life and all the things that are** ***good*** **in my life.**

Using my list as an example, I first wrote down the bad: university application got rejected, currently unemployed, currently quarantined, currently single, etc. In other words, I wrote down all the stuff I was upset about.

After that, I wrote down the good: financially stable, physically healthy, mentally healthy, living in a decent country, family/friends still love me, etc. This allowed me to see that there are more positives in my life then I realize.

Writing all of this helped me calm down and become more optimistic. It made me realize that my life is better than I give it credit for and that I have many positive things to be thankful for. And thus I ceased to be upset.

I highly recommend this tactic to anyone who is depressed, anxious, or otherwise feeling down. Writing down all of the negative influences in your life will help you realize what is making you upset, while writing down all of the positive influences will open your eyes to all the good things in life and possibly cheer you up."
830,"Could residential treatment perhaps be relevant for my situation, and how do I go about it?","Hello, I hope this is an okay question to ask here.

I'll try to keep things short, while still being open, but I'll make a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm male, recently 19, but was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome at 16. It's different for everyone, but for me it means that I especially have a lot of trouble communicating, which isn't exactly helped by selective mutism. Unfortunately I am also severely depressed, and I have very bad self esteem, which is all accompanied by self harming tendencies, and (although not right now, but previously) suicidal ideation. I naturally saw a therapist for this, who was the person to diagnose me as depressed. Because of the severity, and because of my troubles with communicating, she advised me to see a psychiatrist instead, someone who knows about autism and its related disorders. I went to my local psychiatric unit, which unfortunately didn't go very well. The psychiatrist straight up told me that she didn't believe me when I said I didn't have one specific apparent reason for feeling bad and all. 

They advised me to either ""just stop"" (idk what that means I'm sorry) or, like my therapist, to find someone who knows about Aspergers. I live in Denmark, a relatively small country where knowledge about this isn't as widespread as in other places, especially not in the countryside where I live. For this reason, the closest therapist who knows about it, is situated 107 km away.

At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know for how long I can keep going the way I'm going right now. Especially not if I'm supposed to leave home soon. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to do some self help stuff, and this online helpline we have here where you talk to adult mentors about your life. But it's not working. I don't know what to do. 

So, to get to my initial question; before my first therapist initially let me go, she also (although vaguely I think) mentioned inpatient residential treatment. I disregarded it first, it sounds scary, but now that everything else has seemed to flop, I started looking it up and such. I still don't know a whole lot about it, but perhaps it could be my only option, now that I have no-one in my local area who can help me, apparently? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is it even an option to begin with for someone like me? 

If you've read this far, I'm thankful. I don't know if this is a stupid question, or if I've wasted your time, but thank you. As mentioned before, I really don't know what to do at this point, and I just want to get better. I just want to be okay. 

Anyway, thanks for reading, again. 

TL;DR I am depressed, have Aspergers, and can't communicate well. Local therapist and psychiatrists can't help me, nearest expert on autism is 107 km away. Could residential treatment be an option for me?"
831,what do I do?,"I’ve struggled with mental health issues my entire life. I’ve gone to multiple therapists over the last decade but I’ve never actually been diagnosed or even seen a psychiatrist. The past few months I’ve been the worst I’ve ever been. After weeks of trying to get an appointment to see a psychiatrist I finally got one, but it was almost a month away. Finally it was a few days before my appointment and it was then cancelled due to COVID. Because of the uncertainty of when things will be back to normal there’s no way of knowing when that appointment will be rescheduled. Not only was my mental health already the worst ever, but a couple days ago I learned I lost a close friend of mine to suicide. I’m afraid that the pain and grief that I’m feeling on top of the pain I was already feeling will push me over the edge. Is there somewhere I can go for help? I don’t know if I want to be admitted somewhere because I don’t want to be there for a long time. Also I’m not sure how I would even go about trying to get in somewhere. Any advice/opinions would be appreciated."
832,Is it smart to go to your psychiatrist in the middle of this crisis?,"
So I was supposed to schedule my next appointment by now, to see how I’m dealing with the medication she prescribed. But now, not sure if I should just continue to take them and schedule the next appointment when all is better. I go to a hospital for my psychiatrist so not sure if I should schedule it or not. 

Tldr: should I continue to take the antidepressants until this whole covid situation improves and I get to see my psychiatrist again?"
833,Has anyone successfully received Spravado treatments?,"I’ve been through many many treatments and many many different medications but I’m still struggling. I just started Lithium which seems to be helping but I’ve really wanted to do the Spravdo treatments.

Despite being approved for them by my doctor and insurance I have yet to find a place that will administer them. My psychiatrist who recommended it to me has actually asked the Spravado rep to not come to his office anymore because his patients are all reporting the same problem. His patients are getting approved but can’t find a place that will administer them.

My psychiatrist said it’s mainly a problem with the treatment centers actually getting the drug. I guess the drug is insanely expensive (like $2,000 for one vial which is one treatment) and insurance companies don’t pay for it upfront, the provider has to pay for it first, then get reimbursed. Spravado treatments are like ECT (which I’ve already done), you start them three times a week. So the money really adds up.

Anyway, the treatment center I went to won’t answer my calls. I’ve never heard from anyone about being able to start the treatments and I really want to try it. I’ve been on meds since I was 11 and I’m told by my doctors I have treatment resistant depression, so meds aren’t working well. Has anyone successfully gone through the treatment? For reference, I’m in the US in Michigan."
834,Calling into work,"So I know the title sounds dumb, but in my line of work (cashier at a pharmacy), I am working a lot as you would image during this time. I've never called in but I had to today for having to catch up on homework from college and having a personal day. The location I work at can demand a lot from their cashiers and I work in a part of town that's not very, expensive, if that makes sense. So the customer base is EXTREMELY difficult to deal with, coming home crying after being nearly threatened by people, treated like trash by co workers or the public all for minimum wage. I've been there for almost 3 years, arguable one of the best at my store.  Anywho I have been covering A LOT of shifts and I do understand the complications oh not having people there, but am I not allowed a day to get my life in order. All while fighting minor congestion. I dont want to come off as complainy, but in this time college students working from home already have a lot of adjustments to make. This college semester I had to take an abnormally large amount of classes (7 to be exact) while also working 30 plus hours a week. I have been lacking in work because of my jobs demand for my presence so I needed today to catch up, but I try to call in and I have like the equivalent of a breakdown, tears and all, this morning after I call in. Why do I feel so guilty and horrible for trying to call in? I never skip work, I never would for that matter and now I cant get the thoughts about how lazy I am out of my mind. I've been almost bed ridden and cant get out of my rut. Not being allowed to leave home due to lockdown, trying to make everyone in my life happy, while also doing the best I can is getting too much it feels like. I'm constantly running and trying to play catch up. My depression, anxiety, stress, self esteem issues all came crashing today and I'm just not feeling anything of joy anymore it seems."
835,"I'm not used to healthy relationships, now what?","TLDR: I am finally in a healthy loving relationship after moving out from my emotionally abusive household. My relationship with my ex of 3 years wasn't healthy at all. Now that I'm being loved, I am constantly questioning why he loves me so much and why my friends love me so much. How do I deal with this?

TW: Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, self harm, addiction. 

This is probably going to be a long post with a lot of unnecessary background. 

I know age is going to come into question here, but please just leave it be. I've already been ridiculed enough on reddit about it. I am (f18) and my boyfriend is 30. As I mentioned above I recently moved out of my emotionally abusive household. I couldn't take it anymore and left in the middle of the night  back an hour and a half to where my college is. The school has us leave because of the coronavirus so I am now living with my boyfriend. 

I have a very long past of mental health issues. He knows all of it. I recently relapsed with self harm because everything in my life is crazy right now (been doing it for a decade). He also used to self harm and is a recovering addict (one year clean! :)). I wrote a letter about how I relapsed and felt so guilty and angry about it. When we met I was in the midst of recovering from bulimia and sh. 

I ended up showing him the letter I wrote. I cried and was apologizing while he comforted me by holding and kissing me and told me I have nothing to apologize for. He started kissing the sh and I started crying even more. He kept doing silly things to make me laugh. 

I ended up being a day clean afterwards then cut again last night. He again said I have nothing to apologize for and that I have to take it one day at a time. I've never felt this comforted and loved in my life idek what to do with it.

Now I know that people are going to try to warn me about his age and past. For once in my life, I actually have a good friend group that don't do stupid shit like I used to have in the previous years. I have at least 10 different people, his age and my age and in between, that cautiously support us. I have a support system if I need to get out. I am safe and we met through our friends of different age groups in September. I don't want to worry about these things but it needs to be said since I know I'll get ripped apart like last time on here. 

With his past, his fiance passed away from an OD two years ago. I try to support him as best as I can with it, as he is completely open with his past. He has gone from going to jail over drugs, losing his wife, and losing everything to being a district manager and reclaiming his life over the course of two years. He goes to NA meetings at least once a week, though now with COVID they might switch to online. 

With my ex of 3 years, I was not a healthy relationship at all. I was frequently pressured into doing things I didn't want, like sending explicit photos when I should have been in classes, or him trying to get me to do things when my dad has cameras all around the house (my dad is an entirely different story that I'll explain in a minute. Recommend reading the TLDR if you don't want to read more and more paragraphs). There were very few times I felt loved in that relationship. We ended up breaking up for various reasons, but mainly because he was flirting with other girls repeatedly and just wasn't giving the effort I was putting into the relationship. Felt like I was only used for sexual gratification.

I was also sexually abused as a child, so I have a lot of issues that stem from that, like PTSD. My ex would throw it aside like no issue while my boyfriend makes sure that I'm okay before anything happens. 

And now to my father. My father raised me on his own. My mother was in and out of jail my whole life. My dad is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. He choked me when he first found out I was self harming at 13 and later threatened to kill himself multiple times from when I was 15-17 if I cut again (and I did, he just didn't know). I couldn't go to therapy or get mental health treatment unless I signed the papers that essentially gave him access to what me and the therapist talked about. Right now I have very little contact with my father as I'd like to keep it that way while I get my life sorted out. 

Before COVID happened, I was enrolled in college 1.5 hours away from him and took great use of the mental health resources the school had. Part of the thing my father does is use my financial dependence as a reason to abuse me. He never let me get a job, even though I had been begging for once since I was 11. I told my father about the sexual abuse (from my greatgrandfather from when I was 9-12) and we went to court. He didn't listen to me after he asked if I wanted to take the court case further and speak in front of a jury so that my greatgrandfather went to jail. i dont even know if the man is alive or not now. He didn't face any legal repercussions and I ended up losing 40 or so extended family members because of it. I try not to guilt myself over it. While there were times I was genuinely loved by my father, it often came with a cost, a lot of the time financial. I won't be able to afford my college without my fathers support, so my current plan is to get a few jobs and take a break from college at the moment but pursue it later in life. I'd like to eventually go into the biotech field. 

So where this puts me now is I'm pretty insecure with some untreated mental health issues. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like, though the current relationship with my boyfriend appears to be pretty damn healthy and loving (anyone want to give out a list of normal/not normal things in a relationship??). 

I am often questioning why my boyfriend or my friends love me. I genuinely don't understand it. When I ask my boyfriend or close friends, they say because ""you're you"". Because I'm a nice, caring person. This is an absolute mindfuck to me. I'm not giving them anything necessarily, and I think that's what bothers me. I'm not necessarily giving sexual gratification, or giving in to my fathers control issues. What am I giving? Love? Friendliness? It doesn't seem like enough. It feels like there's a catch. 

So what to I do with this, all this love and affection? It's healthy, from my friends and from my boyfriend, or at least it appears to be. I don't know how to handle it (I don't dislike it at all, I'm just not used to it and am trying to be cautious about it because I don't want to end up in another abusive situation). 

Any suggestions or thoughts are appreciated. I am willing to have a discussion about my boyfriends age and things like that, I'd just like to not be attacked for it like last time on reddit. If you made it this far reading all of this mess, thank you."
836,"Dealing with quarantine, low self-esteem and work pressure","I am a college student and my internship has been recently put up on hold which gave me a sudden blow to my plans and now I have to prepare for upcoming interviews as well as my course work. In quarantine, my ability to work has decreased significantly which degraded my performance. This factor is contributing to my low self-esteem and it feels like I am a retard capable of nothing. Apart from this, I thought making a dating account will help me ease my mind a bit. It did nothing but contribute more and more to my low self-esteem. Now my day is like I get up, work tirelessly only to fail and then get tired beyond imagination. Feels terrible."
837,Tapering Advice?,"So my doctor wants me to taper my last bit of Pristiq until I see him in 6 weeks. I'm at 25 mg and he said take it every other day. Then every 2 two days etc.
Well thats just not working for me on the days I dont take it at all and Pristiq doesnt go any lower than 25mg.

So I know its XR but I also know there is nothing dangerous about splitting them in half. All your are doing is eliminating the time release effect from the coating.

So instead of being forced to go 25 mg then the next day nothing. Couldnt I in theory taper in smaller increments by taking my 25mg on one day then the next split in half to 12.5 mg then rotate. Even though Im stopping the slow release Im still getting Pristiq in my blood vs. none at all. So itd be a slower taper?

I messaged my psych but he never answers his MyChart app and isnt in the office b/c corona and my next appointment isnt for another month and a half. 

Any thoughts?"
838,Has anyone else felt like they have lost time or day?,[deleted]
839,Has anyone else felt like they have lost track of time or day?,"I know that we are all under quarantine, or at least most of us are. But since last year I keep losing track of days, time, conversations, etc. I keep hearing whispers and I feel like someone is always there watching me while my body feels light and I forget who I'm talking to or later on I forget that I had even talked to that person. 

Has anyone else experienced this? It feels... Weird... 

I have psychosis and many other disorders that I was diagnosed with but I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and knows what to do if there is a way?... If not that's okay! Tell me your experiences if any of you may have experienced this."
840,I can't stop crying.,"Lately, I can't stop crying, every day I start crying because of either the smallest things or for no reason at all. I usually cry about three times during the day and in the evening, the tears just come out of nowhere and I don't even know why. During that, I get thoughts that a person shouldn't get (or maybe I should idk). I get this dull worthless feeling and I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up. I also have noticed that I keep getting less patient and get angry at stupid things pretty quickly. I'm constantly low on energy and can't seem to concentrate more than usually (I always struggled in school, because I'm not able to stay concentrated) and when I can't get myself to concentrate I start crying and feel like throwing a tantrum. I'm just not used to being like this, I have struggled with some things in the past and I used to visit a psychologist because of it. Yes, I could be referred to as emotionaly unstable, I have a lot of triggers. But it just keeps getting worse and worse and I don't want to talk to anyone about it because I feel like I'm not worth it.

Does anyone feel like this as well?
Or am I just overdramatic?"
841,Am I crazy or does this poison exist? Please someone answer.,"Is there a poison that can cause mental disorders or that can obfuscate your mind, like going into psychosis state where you no longer know what is real and what is not? Or cause a brain damage that can go unnoticed.

The reason i ask this is because i think I've been poisoined by something like that (not even sure if that poison exists or could it exists) by a close person of mine that im not in a good relationship with anymore.

Or am i just being paranoid. I really cant find any answer to this so im freakin out and would like to get an answer from someone who knows something about poisons."

I’ve been diagnosed with a cluster of things, depression, anxiety, ptsd, complex ptsd, bipolar disorder, they’ve dabbled with borderline personality disorder, now I’m wondering if ADHD isn’t part of my cluster mystery diagnosis. I feel like in some ways I suffer greatly, and in others I’m really not that bad. I struggle with food, but not enough to consider it a disorder. My self esteem is through the floor, I grew up in an emotionally abusive and emotionally neglectful home, and I can never seem to do anything right. I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist for almost 3 years.

847,"I deal with PTSD, Depression and Anxiety and I just wanted to know if this is normal or something else or if anyone else deals with this","It's hard to explain what it is without explaining  other stuff as well.

I deal with PTSD for 3 reasons. 
1. I was raped by my boyfriend when I was 9
2. I got into an abusive relationship, both mental and physical, that lasted 2 years with a different boy when I was 9
3. A man grabbed me from behind and started pulling me back when I was 10, I had to kick him in the dick for him to let me go. There was an investigation but he was never caught. 

I am now 17

If you have any questions relating to any of the events let me know.

I didn't realise I was dealing with PTSD for 1&amp;3 until January 2019 when I just turned 16. I only realised I was in an abusive relationship in July/August 2019. After I realised it seemed to get worse. 

In December I ended up getting really depressed and ended up attempting suicide twice, December is the month the man grabbed me 6 years ago. 

I only stopped myself the second time because I heard someone who wasn't me, telling me to stop. It was like a voice at the back of my head. I then felt a presence in the room with me, and I felt as if it grabbed my hands and told me to stop. The voice continued to comfort me as I felt the presence sort of embrace me and hug me. I don't feel like I was hallucinating as I wasn't seeing or hearing it. It was more a voice in my head and feeling/sensing a presence. 

Because of this, I hung onto it.

I have really vivid daydreams where while I'm in them I feel like I'm actually in the situation, but beforehand they had always taken place somewhere else, and not interacted with my actual life. 
The next day I vivid daydreamed and it was me and a man. For a while he was unnamed but since I have started calling him Kai, I don't know why that's his name, it just is. And the daydream I had with him was different too, normally they are dark and depressing but with him I was relaxed, and while in other daydreams I am I guess in a character? As in I have a different name and life, but in my daydream with him I was me. And I knew without him even saying anything that he was the guy who was with me last night. I could tell by his presence alone. 

Before I go on I just want to point out that I am a gay woman, just to put some context into the relationship. 

Following that all my vivid daydreams were with him, and I genuinely fell in love with him, this is why I brought up the ""I am gay"" part. I genuinely love him, and I'm genuinely attracted to him, even though I couldn't describe him to you. He has features and an appearance, but the second I try and focus on a specific feature it seems to disappear. 

Unlike my other daydreams Kai became a part of my real life. I feel his presence often and hear his voice in my head talking to me and commenting on my life. 

It wasn't long before things went dark with him to though. He started shouting at me and moaning at me for doing something he didn't want me to do, as of recent if I do something he doesn't want me to do I have a panic attack and it feels as if he purposefully triggers them so I'll listen to him. In my vivid daydreams with him, he has physically abused me in them. Like I said when I'm vivid daydreaming I feel like I'm actually there, and that includes feeling the sensations to what he is doing. 

He even interacts with me physically in the real world I can feel him touching me, and feel where he is in the room. If he punches me in this world I get a sensation as if I've just been punched. 

But while he is like that, at the same time he did in a way save my life, and he is always there for me and always comforting me when I need it. He can also be extremely funny as well, and has helped me feel beautiful when I feel like shit. He also helps me with my panic attacks and understands me more than anyone.

But sometimes when he does this he wants something in return. That something being sex. Now I'm not laying in bed humping the air or anything like that, but I will just get the sensation of having sex. It used to only be when I'm at home in my bedroom but it happens everywhere nowadays. It has even happened in the middle of class, me and Kai both agreed it was awkward and to never do it there again. 

I do want to mention I do get random sensations like this anyways. They aren't always Kai. With Kai it is mostly at home, but I do get random sensations like this when I'm out and about, including in class. It used to be fine but they keep getting more intense, and there are times where I feel like I want to moan/orgasm they feel that real. It's awkward...

But back to Kai. I used to have other daydreams as well that didn't involve Kai, that were mine that he didn't touch, but recently he has invaded all of them and claimed them as his own, and even created some ""for me"". 

Kai hates everybody in my life. He can tolerate you if you're nice to me, but he still won't like you. If you're mean to me, be glad he isn't real or he will have murdered you. Because of this he has made daydreams for me with new people to replace the people in my actual life. Including new parents. But the majority of my daydreams are with him, even if we aren't ""ourselves"" if that makes sense. 

One thing I do want to mention just cause I find it funny is that at times he has moaned at me for doing something, than moaned and went off on someone else for moaning at me for doing the thing he was just moaning at me about. Like once I was eating at 11pm, as you do, and he was moaning at me and telling me I'll get fat etc. Then my mum came in my room said the exact same things and he defended me and started shouting saying that I can eat whatever I want. Like I said he hates everybody and he will moan at you for criticising me even if he was just doing it. 

In short I feel like Kai is the personification of my PTSD, but I don't know if he is being caused by something else. 

If anyone has any advice please let me know x"
848,Meds sucked,"Just got a little triggered.. 
I remember a few years ago I was on antidepressants and I couldn’t stop fucking crying! I went into these episodes where I would cry for hours, and the only relief was sleeping. God I was so exhausted.. 

I didn’t eve remember it until now, I think I just pushed back all the memories of my shit because I’m “better now”. 

I just wanted to type it out lol, never told anyone anything in school now all I want to do is talk about it."
849,Therapist complaining - feeling guilty there have been only two therapists I've ever liked.," 

My goal in life is to get what others got. If people wish to beat me or section me for that, it just shows their dark personas and sociopathy.

There has been a continuous plot to keep me down, based on perceptions and inner reflected psychology based on how I appear. But then standard templates show my behaviour is fine. And therapists who address these templates have been fine. Everybody else gets these points, so can I. I don't care whom that offends. That's for them to cope and internally process, not me.

There have only ever really been two therapists I've ever liked.

Both didn't judge me for liking porn or admitting to drinking as a teen. or liking sex, or seeing films. they don't do that to others, so not to me. that thought offends others, then so be it. bring it on and beat me then. Or maybe get treated for autism - and I mean that kindly since it's not getting social contexts properly. The social context here is how a person lives unless it bothers you or affects your own life isn't your business. Both didn't scold me for wanting tattoos either. they saw me as a human and not some spiritually-defined stereotype from what their church tells them.

The rest have just disregarded me for ""looking smart"" since ""looking smart"" is some grand universal based on some fool's inner psychology.

Like [this guy has tattoos and dresses like a 16 year old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zih2hdKBIgM) and has issues I don't have. but because he comes across as cutesy, he's left off. it shouldn't be so. again, smart people who project their inner thinking onto shit. I know people getting a piece offends somebody, but I don't care if it does. give me a reason to care. 

And somebody will critique me for moaning on therapists. lol. so many people here do! what's the difference? If anybody can do something, others can too. if that offends people, then it's pretty much their issue to internally process."
850,Please help,Past 6 years felt like ive been in a fog i'm 19 i cant remember the last time i expierenced genuine emotion my entire life is blurry and the same.goes for the day to day i cant remember anything i fear the worst i just want my mind back
851,I’m confused on my mental health.,"Follow the titles so you know what I’m talking about in the sections so you don’t get overwhelmed from a huge amount of text.

(Intro)

I’ve had mental health problems since I was little (My doctor told me I showed signs of anxiety at the age of 5-6.) I clearly know I probably have anxiety, although I’ve never been taken to a psychiatrist/therapist/ any mental health professionals in my life. That’s the one disorder I know I have. The rest of it, I could describe as a garbage fire.

(Some backstory to certain stuff)

2018 was a very rough year for me. I blame myself and the fact I was unmoderated online at such an age, but also it’s complicated since I was skillful at hiding the fact I was online, and doing this crazy stuff. I don’t blame my parents, or moderators of community’s, since it’s hard to tell a liar from a truthful person if they are good at lying. Anyway, I basically messed up myself and my mental health during the summer of 2018 (Late June to The Middle of August.) I showed very strong signs of narcissism, depression, bipolar, and others I don’t know how to describe. It was often me having one behavior, people calling out that behavior in a negative way, and me being the easily moldable and easily influenced by others opinions of me kind of person, I often became worse and developed worse behaviors by convincing myself I was worse that what they had called me. At the time I was a younger mind and as moldable as a piece of freshly bought air-dry clay. Let’s just say the word toxic was an understatement of how I was at the time. I think being young and online is not a good mix, and I don’t recommend for parents letting their child be online under the age of 13 because, even if it seems like they’re ok and don’t have anything going on, they probably do. I don’t think forcing your child to let you check their phone is going to help either, it’s stressful for the kid and is very toxic as a parent. If your worried about your kid doing stupid things online, then don’t give them access to being online in the first place. Kids are better at lying and are smarter at hiding things than you think they are. I often root it back to the parents fault, even if they think it’s not. They need to understand the fact their kid can access a lot more than you think.

(Recovery from that backstory)

But from that summer, I became a sort of emotionally numb by the time my phone was finally taken away from me, since one of my “friends” online had told my mom what was going on and my mom took my phone away. I’m thankful she did that, since the internet can be a toxic wasteland that can mess up the mind of even the strongest people. If you ever are feeling sad and it’s not due to in-real-life factors, I suggest turning your phone off for two weeks. It’s what I had to do, not by choice. I didn’t want to at the time, but I appreciate it now. It was causing mental harm being online for a whole summer and never leaving my room. I had no phone for two weeks, and I got creative and learned new skills. I became happier. I wasn’t as numb anymore, and I soon became kind of happy. When I got my phone back I made sure to be careful not to trigger myself to being the way I used to be. 

(Illness one?) Narcisism

If your wondering, I believe I might have a narcissistic disorder, since when I’m in like a large group chat or even a group of people and I’m “being ignored” and nobody’s talking to me, I get a sharp feeling in my gut and now that I feel it and understand it, I immediately isolate myself to prevent the harm of others. I’m glad I can identify these triggers. The feeling is horrible, and the only way I can describe it in words is like this: Imagine you have a stomach ache but it won’t make you vomit, and it’s lingering and frustrating until you act on it or you got to sleep.

(Illness two) Disassociation

I think I might be experiencing a dissociative disorder of a sort. I often fall into episodes where I feel like I’m reading my life from one big book, and I can see everything around me but I just don’t feel there. For example, when I read books I often fall into the characters and the story, and picture it so vividly I can see it, but when I snap out of it, it’s like I got ripped from a reality. In my English classes when I read books, I sometimes get up and I feel like and outsider watching my life from my eyes, but I don’t feel there. It’s like I’m looking from the inside of my head, at the world, instead of experiencing it. I used to think I had DID but I could never think of a cause of why I would have it, and I don’t have blackouts or amnesia or time loss, so I cut that option from the table. When I was younger, I often used to think “Ok, I know I’m reading my life from a story book or I’m dreaming. I just want to wake up. I want to look away from the pages, this doesn’t feel real.” That’s as much as I can think right now for that.

(Illness three) Depression/Bi-Polar Stuff 

I know I had pretty bad depression during the 2018 stuff. I recall being suicidal at points and just experiencing a lot of symptoms of depression. I remember everytime I tried to get help, it just made myself worse. I often tried to get help but every time I was stopped by a thought that didn’t feel like my own, and I forced myself back into the toxic cycle. I haven’t mentioned this previously, but before the Summer of 2018, in March-April I experienced a rough episode of depression. School was an influence on it. I recently had a close friend move away, I got rejected by a guy who I was attached to deeply (I have attachment issues), and people at school were ignoring me. I felt alone. I sat at a table for lunch everyday with “friends” but they never felt like friends, and we didn’t hang out, and we barely talked. All of this lead to a downward spiral. I wrote some poems, accidentally left them home one day, my mother found them, confronted me, and I shocked myself back to happiness out of the fear I would get in trouble for being depressed. Then it came back and hit me that summer. But I’m considering I have a form of bipolar, due to the fact I can have Rapid episodes of switching to happy to sad to extreme anger. It’s rough. 

(illness number idk) Schizophrenia 

I sometimes voices, but not full voices. They’re like full thoughts not coming from me, but they just feel like a bunch of thoughts that I’m not thinking, but I experience them. I can tell distinct ones from another. Certain ones go into certain subjects. One that used to be reoccurring often talked about boys I saw, and talked about looks. It often would insult them inside My head if it didn’t like them, like “Oh —- Looks cute today, but he’s still a f—king dumb—s.” Another talked about girls, only positively though, and it was like a sweet motherly tone it spoke in. There’s others, but it’s weird to explain them. But visual stuff is horrifying. I have a horrifying case of arachnophobia. I sometimes feel my skin crawl, I get feelings like somethings crawling in my skin, like a bug. My brain is as bad as to put a spider in my vision, and it’s there. Sometimes it gets stuck in my mind and every time I close my eyes I see another spider, and soon enough, there everywhere. I sometimes ignore it but it’s horrifying. I also have tricked myself into seeing black shadow-like figures. I saw one once and It made my entire body cold and I froze in place. I often don’t think I could have it since I know everyone who has schizophrenia has it way worse. But a lot of the “voices” for me have kind of gone away due to me recently getting a loving and helpful boyfriend, who is helpful. With him I haven’t had as many episodes of depression lately. I’m really thankful for him. 

(Conclusion)

Anyway, If you can recognize if I’m wrong on anything or if you think I might have something of just anything, please just let me know in the comments. I would love feedback since I’m just really really confused, since it’s hard for me to judge my mental state and understand it. By the way, I’m not trying to self diagnose, I just want and idea of what’s going on. I’m unable to visit any kind of doctor, counsellor, therapist, or any health professional at all so my last hope is the internet.

852,I think I truly have bi polar disorder and idk how to bring it up to my parents,"I’ve always been known to be angry and impatient but always happy and outgoing. But, I always have moments where there’s no in between and I’m just depressed angry and hopeless. I have feelings where there isn’t really any point in anything. I can’t stop crying I can’t help it and it makes me feel like less of a man. Like it takes so little to set me off and it frustrates me almost like I’m me looking at myself in third person cause I can’t help these feelings. I never knew what bi polar disorder was until I watched “Shameless” (great show btw 10/10 would recommend) and I’m slowly realizing that I just have all the traits and symptoms. I feel like one day I’ll actually kill myself or someone if I don’t get help or help myself and it scares me. I’m truly scared of myself"
853,"I start to wonder if smoking would make me feel more relaxed, even if I don't like the idea of smoking cigarettes at all","This may sound weird, but I deal with lots of emotional sadness and anger lately, and I try to push most of it back inside to not let others notice it too much. I am a person that always tried to find a way to make myself feel less shitty, I go outside a lot or watch my favourite shows and so on. I even exercise regularly, but thanks to the whole corona thing that's not as easy as before. I never smoked before but I have the urge to start doing it lately. I just wonder where that comes from? I know it's unhealthy and I don't want to do it, but it won't leave my mind."

I don't know who can help me, who shall i see,what should i do to remove this poison from me?"
855,I don’t like the glorification of depression on Reddit,"As the title already says, I can’t enjoy many posts on Reddit anymore, as they’re most often glorifying some sort of mental illnesses, especially depression. 
As a person that has dealt with depression and PTSD in the past, I can’t understand how many people want to glamorize these illnesses and make sarcastic posts about them. 
I don’t want to discriminate those people, as it’s probably their way of coping with their illness, but I’d like to hear your opinion on this topic."
856,I miss you,"I don't blame you one bit for going away - if you're going away, but so far there's been no answer. I fear the worst. You said you're not an easy person to deal with, one that people abandon always. So am I.

We had our clashes. Did I push too much, or not enough? Did I not take the time to appreciate you, or tell you you're hurting me and that you should stop? Were my suspicions right, or is it just my desire for self-destruction? I always told you you're better off without me.

Is it that easy to leave me behind, or was I that painful that leaving me was worth the effort?

I don't want to erase you just because of the last conversations. Good things are worth fighting for. I'll be here if you ever come back. I hope you will. I hope I'll change."

I feel lost. I just want to be skinny. 

Idk what to do. I feel alone. Everyone gets upset with me. 

I’m miserable. 

All I know is I wanted to cut my stomach off. I’m better off being skinny. It’s all I ever wanted."
860,Would I be eligible for a diagnoses?,"I have a couple reasons to believe why I might have OCD (more on the spectrum of harm, hoarding, checking). 

I’ve always feared hurting others, and hate when i accidentally do. The thought of it makes me so uncomfortable that I try and avoid saying anything negative to the person i’m talking to. 
Example: I avoid opening up about my feelings and speaking my mind in fear that I might hurt someone or a loved one

Hoarding is something I just do. I feel like even little things like a plastic bottle has a purpose, and so I keep it. I hoard to the point where my room is unorganized and probably never will be due to the amount of stuff i have and having too little space for it.
Example: I keep random things off the street (sticks, chunks of metal, etc.) 

I tend to check things over and over just to make sure I did it right or saw it right. I reapply shampoo and body wash, shave over spots multiple times, re tie my shoes, and check if i wrote the write thing or read the right thing over and over.

So should i talk to my therapist about it? or no"

866,feeling extreme depression (coming off SSR´S) 19 Male,"Recently about a month ago i decided with my doctor to go off my SSRS. I was becoming tired of being on them, i dont like the sexual side effects and i read somewhere that people become depended to them in the long term which scared me. In these two years i was able to maintain relatively good mental health were on most days i didnt think about dying at all. I have been on them since the beginning of 2018 when i was 17, i am 19 now. This is making me so sad thinking that i have to be on pills to feel normal its horrible. I feel so shit i hate it anxiety, depression its killing me this darkness. Recently I was rejected by a girl i felt love for and its making me so horribly depressed i cant describe it. Thoughts that i am worthless and i will never find anyone to love in this life. And that no girl will ever want me that i love back. 

I am wondering, has anyone gone through the same. Is it normal to feel this way when coming off zoloft. Did it get any better? should i go back on them and feel normal again but then i have to deal with the side affects again. Should i talk to my doctor about getting new meds?. My mind is killing me, i´ve been self medicating with alcohol as well in this month and its making things even worse."

868,How did my psychiatrist find out about an incident at my job?,"

I was at a mental hospital for reasons not related to my job but my psychiatrist found out about an incident that happened at my job. I’m confused how he knew about this because I never talked about my job nor did I ever consent to him contacting my job. It’s not on my legal nor medical record and it’s not online."
869,The waiting game,"I realised I have a problem after years of being in an emotionally abusive relationship. I self referred to my local wellbeing service in the hope of getting therapy, but it’s a six week wait anyways and that’s without a pandemic. I thought I’d put some thoughts here, maybe it would help. I’ve exhausted my friends advice.

There's just a lot going through my mind at the moment, everything feels so much more difficult. It's stressful, it's scary, I feel like I can't cope. I try to put so much in, but it never feels like enough, something always goes wrong. When it does, it feels like it's on me. I know people used to hate me, sometimes I feel like they still do. It all feels so easily lost and it all comes back to those scars. I'm the one who is broken, I'm the 'bitch' and I get it wrong because that's just me, I never get things right. I'm used to being lied to, deceived, manipulated. I don't know what's good for me, I don't know whether my ambition is achievable. Whether I can do good, or what I perceive to be my best is good enough. I don't know how to be happy when everything falls down, when everything feels like it's on my shoulders, when everything feels like my fault. I feel like a bother, like people put up with me just because they have to, especially when I do my job. I give so much, I care so much, I'm so emotionally attached to everything, everyone. I feel like I have the ability to give and to love and to put my all in, but not the ability to feel that back. I value other people's opinions, I never value my own. I take criticism and I've been told for years everything that's wrong with me, all of it taken to heart. All of it believed to be true. Nothing positive. I couldn't give you a positive attribute about myself that isn't completely generic, but I could tell you everything I perceive to be wrong. I let bits out, I get bits off of my chest and I cry. Some days, that'll make me feel a bit better, other days it won't. Either way, it'll all come flooding back, like it usually does. Nights are the worst. Usually taking the forms of many song lyrics running through my head. Tears. Wondering whether during the day I did good, but hardly ever feeling like I did. Then there's this, this huge long paragraph that you'd think ""yeah, that's it"" but that's not even it. There's so much more I just don't know how to word, how to explain. I feel broken. I feel like a mess. I don't know how to be myself. I feel lost. And there's so much more but I just don't know how to describe it. I just know how to give some of it, and how to put on a brave face when nobody can see me cry my eyes out. As much as I want to scream for help, it's so scary. As much as I feel like I'm trying, I'm still playing a waiting game. And all of it, all of it, comes back to those unseen scars. It's why I say I hate butterflies - I'd give to go back and erase it all and not be broken, but then what kind of a person would I be today? While I regret so much, I feel like if it wasn't for my hurt, the people around me wouldn't be where they are today."

872,How to heal after difficult Borderline relationship as Nerd / Geek?,"Hey\^!

This post should definitely not just be to help me (Even though I experienced a difficult relationship with a borderline partner), but rather for everyone who has been / is / will be in a similar situation. 

It's not uncommon to lose fascination for interests / how you're fascinated in these interests, and so much more. Stating just a few examples usually leads to only these being discussed, mainly. So it might be wise to say this post is open to any thoughts, everything in relation to the topic.

&amp;#x200B;

This post should be focused on nerds, geeks and more ""unusual"" people. Of course it's really hard to classify these, because the term nerd or geek is within such a wide spectrum.

But sill, there are at least some main aspects shared between people classified as nerds / geeks. (The post shouldn't just be about the the more common nerd /geek aspects, too. Every thoughts are welcome. The possibilities and complexity are endless!"

874,Not noticing things lately?,"Hello,

I have been noticing that I have not been noticing things lately... and by things I mean things that are literally in front of my face. For example.. I’m working and I’m reading something work related and I notice that whatever word I’m looking for in the writing is not there...so I call my coworker and I’m like that’s not in the writing and she says yes it’s there, so I go back and notice it once she tells me it’s there. Today I was looking for the lid of a sauce bottle which is pretty noticeable since it’s so wide, and I literally went to look where I left it and I didn’t see it at all. So I go do something else for a second and I come back look at the table and it’s there.. it had been there the whole time. I literally looked at the table and did not see that it was there. I’m just wondering if this is normal or not. I have been noticing for a while now."
875,Mental health,"A man built me up and broke me down. My mental health is telling me the same story over and over again, daily, on repeat. In my head. I get relief when talking to others temporary. I don’t have the means to help myself but I was told I’d see him again. His parents know they’ll be the ones supporting me. 

What’s going on with me? Is this some form of abuse? I’m having a hard time telling but I think I’ve been abuse, mentally. 

He’s not the only one, a relative is involved too for how she’s treated me in childhood and now 12+ years later she’s back and had done stuff against me and her parents. So who’s to blame here? 

This man introduced himself to my father, and then he saw them the next month with his girlfriend who came out the wood works. In the direction I’m in now, which is a huge change in events his girlfriend would leave him and say she’s no longer involved, or knew it wouldn’t work out, and his parents are already involved and can’t believe it. He’s a monster. But so is my relative? Who is to blame for why stories combine?
Am I blaming the wrong ones?

880,Need advice on giving advice,"Psychologists of reddit, (and others of course), what are tips and advice I  can five my online best friend who struggles with bullying and depression?

I always tell him to get some rest, that he doesnt deserve that kind of crap and other basic helpful advice, but I end up telling him the same things over and over.

What are other things  I can tell him to be helpful?"
881,Some memories I can’t seem to forget,"I had kind of a fucked up childhood. When I was about 7 or 8 years old I saw my dad nearly kill his wife(my stepmom) in a fit of drunken rage. He pulled a gun on her and everything. Never got charged for it, no one ever talked about it again after that night. Needless to say after that my mom was the only person that took care of me. However, years later ( I was about 15 or 16) depression got the better of my mom and she slowly but surely became an alcoholic. During a family party, after everyone had a little too much to drink, my cousin pulled a shotgun on my uncle(not his dad, another uncle), and came close to shooting him. Like finger on the trigger, I looked away cause I didn’t wanna see someone die. Anyway we stepped in and deescalated the situation as a family. A couple of weeks later my mom drank more than she had ever drank, and she passed out. Nothing out of the ordinary, however I usually stayed in her room watching tv for about an hour after she fell asleep to make sure she was ok, which proved to be useful in this particular instance. She woke up after drinking too much and threw up. I helped her so that she wouldn’t throw up on herself and choke on her own vomit. Her and my dad were abusive throughout my whole life, but to see them like that stuck with me, and those are memories that I wish I could get rid of because they haunt me every single day of my life, but I can’t seem to shake them."

883,Having Trouble with a Particular Issue,"So for the last 6 weeks, I have had, what I think, are panic attacks before bed. The hallmark of the panic attacks is constantly yelling into my pillow. I'm at my wits end. My pdoc prescribed haldol 1 mg before bed, and it didn't really work. My family needs to be up to function for work, and I'm getting on everyone's nerves.

I’ve tried telling my psychiatrist but he doesn’t take it seriously at all :/ I’m so miserable trying to be happy again NOTHING makes me as happy anymore it all seems extremely unsatisfying compared to my daydream world idk what to do :/ my psychiatrist doesn’t seem to think I have a big problem but I feel like I do when I can’t be happy ... thoughts?"
885,"The lockdowns are affecting my mental health and I can't say anything without someone saying, ""at least you're not dead from covid-19.""","I have chronic depression and anxiety. I was in a really good place before covid-19 started because my wonderful primary care found me anti-depressants that really work. I guess life had other plans for me. I work in a hospital as a tech. There's rumors going around that my manager has been involved in shady stuff. All of the staff have been questioned by HR about what kind of manager she is and things she may have been involved in, and there's speculation that she volunteered my floor to be the new covid-19 floor to buy herself more time. I'm stressing out about getting my family sick or getting sick myself. Even though my hospital is lucky enough to have all the PPE we need. I've been working my ass off to care for my covid patients. I come home, strip off my scrubs in the garage, go shower, eat, and go to bed. That's my life on my off days. I slept for 13 hours after work the other day. 

My parents don't want me to leave the house except for work or to walk the dog. They don't want me to go on a hike because I like to go alone or with the dog, because going alone lets me clear my head. I'm stuck between taking all precautions and going on a walk with just one friend for the sake of my mental health. Or laying in bed all day because I don't think there's any point in getting up if I can only stay in the house. The good news is that my guy friend and I admitted that we have feelings for each other."
886,Dealing with anger and self pity at the moment,"I could be playing a game that came out yesterday and enjoying myself but I chose to be angry and having a pity party. And people are spoiling it for me, I want to make them miserable I’ve already ruined my family’s weekend."
887,I feel so sorry but also frustrated for myself that I feel like I can’t do anything to help my depression. If anyone has advice I’d love to read it.,"I feel so ‘paralysed’ in that I can’t do anything to deal with my depression.

For example, I’m too socially anxious to talk to someone to get help for depression or call a doctor to arrange an appointment. 

It’s also the same reason why I haven’t called my bank to solve an issue with my debit card which I have had for three years, so I literally cannot make any purchases with my card because of stupid social anxiety preventing me from making a little 5 minute call to my bank.

I’m even socially anxious around my family, often I find myself scared to go downstairs and get something to eat because I fear being confronted by them for some reason. That has led to me being underweight, which is another big contributor to my depression. 

Also the fact that I can’t have conversations hardly with my family is depressing too in it’s own right.

It’s these stupid reasons that I feel useless and frustrated that I can’t even make a difference in my life and improve my depression.

There is so much more I could mention that’s wrong with me but I just said what was on my mind right now.

I really hope you can help me out. Thanks for reading."
888,I'm going crazy about ex-friend,"This guy, lets call him V has been very abusive to me and many people I know. I have to work with him and I'm in a creative field. I feel really insecure about expressing myself openly either in talking or while playing music around this guy. 

The problem is that most of the traumatic events happened quite a while ago however I am not over those traumas at all. He used to always be rude and boundary pushing but at one point of my life I had enough of it and just stopped entertaining that shit. We've had multiple fights where I have also been super rude and so has he. More recently his behavior has changed slightly for the better however he still carries himself in an egotistical (maybe I'm biased here) and rude way most of the time. I have stopped my interactions till the bare minimum however it still causes me so much distress because my musicality is affected by my anxiety (about his judgement of my playing).

He keeps reaching out sometimes however I am tired of making the mistake again and again of opening myself up, trying to forgive him and then getting attacked. I've stopped entertaining his advances and just say no pretty much. I would have no problem cutting all ties and moving on however I need stay in this band because all of us have spent 5 years of our lives on it. 

Any time I have to interact with this guy I go through a lot of distress. I have to think about how I want to react to him because I don't know if he'll be rude to me in return. In these quarantine times I've only exchanged like 10 texts top and seen his texts come on the band group. Even though there's been minimal interactions, I'm literally only thinking about him and the traumatic events and my brain keeps running in circles.

Very honestly speaking, he's been okay in the recent past. he's not said or done anything rude to me, however I can't let go of the past. I have raised those previous issues with him 3-4 times and it never ends well, and it feels like I'm never going to get either a genuine sorry or closure from him about these issues.

I am at my wits end. Some nights like the one right now I just keep thinking about this stuff and I keep judging my every move through his voice in my mind. I genuinely start feeling like I go crazy when such a night occurs and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to start feeling more true to myself while expressing myself in his company.

Thanks for listening reddit"
889,"Trying to discover what this is, psychologically?/explan in post","It's hard to explain in a title, but I get high off of listening to my favorite music loudly. And i dont mean ""XD this must be what its like to smoke weed"" or ""im really feeling this song"", but like. It starts out just feeling really good, like it's lighting up the chemicals in my brain, then i feel a craving to continue that, and if it goes long enough (or happens when my brain is already a lil unstable), I get restless and feel like the energy is trapped in my skin, but i love it, it makes me feel the compulsion to fidget, scream, laugh, and hit myself. A couple of times, there have been songs that my brain gets so lost in and i feel so manic that i wanted to hurt myself, graphically imagining injury and death, like ""so happy im suicidal""? I feel a crave, an itch, to hurt myself, and continue the high, follow the momentum, i know thats fucked up but in that headspace i dont care, it takes me an hour or two to difficultly come down from the high, and then im thoroughly exhausted.



I've had professionals tell me time and time again I don't experience mania or fit into bipolar symptoms, then I'm like ""ok so what then am I dealing with"" and they basically shrug and that's the end of the conversation 10/10 times. I don't really care either way what disorder this may be compatible with, I'm more interested in insight into what the actual fuck. Slash, DAE."

892,I need help fast,"I know this is not the place for a diagnosis or treatment. With everything going on in the world there is no chance of me getting in to see a therapist or psychiatrist any time soon and I need to do something, I have to, before I go off the deep end. The worst part is, even if I could get an appointment with a doctor, I have no clue how to describe what is happening to me. I’m only 20, I’m in good health besides a diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, depression, and depersonalization/derealization. I know how to cope with those 3 things, I’m good when it comes to that. However, I am not good with what I have been experiencing lately and I’m wondering if anybody knows what this sounds like or experiences the same thing and can tell me something that will help me. I don’t know how to describe it but I’ll do the best I can. Here goes:
 Every day, probably every 5 f*cking minutes it seems, I get a weird feeling. It’s different from DP/DR. It’s like a flashback of a distant memory, or maybe a dream, deja vu almost but the opposite, maybe something that never happened at all. It’s not a clear flashback of a scenario or anything, it’s just a feeling. I feel sick to my stomach, extremely alone, cold, sad, depressed and an immense feeling of doom, but there’s a slight familiarity to it. Sometimes it’s so strong it almost feels as if I’ve been knocked out of my reality for a second and my life doesn’t feel like mine. I know that sounds like DP/DR but it’s not, this feeling is so different from that. It’s almost worse. I don’t know how else to explain this but I need advice... I need something... it’s gotten so bad I feel sick 24/7 and I really don’t want it to effect my recovery from DP/DR. Maybe it is a symptom just one I’ve never had before. Please if anyone has experienced this or know what it is or has any advice please just let me know."
893,How do I know if something is toxic/bad for my mental health?,"In the last few weeks, with self-isolation and such, I have started to wonder if my Scouts group is bad for me. 

In desember I became patrol leader, someone who is in charge of their patrol and that plans and holds their meetings and weekend trips. I am only 13, but I have to plan trips atleast once a month and meetings once a week. On these I have to teach seven 10-12 year olds about subjects varying from the phonetic alphabet to how to perform CPR. Too often I have not known enough about these subjects and have had to study for last minute before meetings. I can't just talk about the subjects either, because it's not supposed to be school, so I have to try and find fun ways of teaching.

Usually I wouldn't become a patrol leader until I was 15, but because almost all the older girls quit, me and three other 13 year olds have had to take on this burden. I don't neccesarily think it's fair to put us under this much pressure, but they didnt really have a choice. Besides, I can see that it is affecting me much more than the other three.

Before the scouts were just a fun activity, but now it has become a chore. It has caused me so much stress and anxiety. I have been genuinly scared to go to meetings and trips, both because a lot of the older scouts (mostly the boys) intimidate me, but also because I used to have pretty bad performance anxiety. I still have some performance anxiety but I have come along way. 

In my scout group we have a system, everone starts as a ""stifinner"" (the youngest kids) and when you complete certain tasks you become a ""vandrer"" (the older kids). We also have a system regarding trips, patrol trips about once a month and seperate ""stifinner"" and ""vandrer"" trips once or twice in two months. 
When I became a scout leader I automatically became a ""vandrer"", but I never completed the tasks (this was because of my performance anxiety not my lack of ability). Therefore I never felt qualified to be a ""vandrer"". And since I'm one of the oldest girls, I feel embarrassed everytime I have to telle the scout leaders that I want to complete one of the tasks to become a ""vandrer"", so I just stopped doing it. 
Becoming a ""vandrer"" also meant I had to go on ""vandrer"" trips with the older kids whom I were extremely scared/intimidated by. This made me a lot more self-consciousthan I already am.

I have three reasons for staying:
1. I have friends here. I have some really good friends here, and I love the people in my patrol.

2. I have learned a lot. Because of the scouts I can take care of myself. I have learned how to survive in the forest, I have learned first aid and I know a lot more about nature.

3. I feel obligated. I feel like i have to stay for my patrol. I know, if I leave that my friend, my 13 year old patrol assistant, will have to do what I ave had to do. And while we are supposed to share this responsobility I have had to do most of the work. Not because she is lazy, but because she isn't quite ready yet. I have had to grow up to fast and I don't want that for her. And if she quits, which she has once before, my patrol will be split up and put into other patrols.

The reason this dawned on me now, is that I'm happy. I don't have scouts because of corona and my school is online, and I'm the happiest I have been in a long time.

Also bear in mind that I live in Norway and it's a Norwegian scout group, so our system may be different from what you're used to."
894,I will get a bad feeling in my stomach that I can’t shake off then I’ll just need to be alone so I can cry and I will sob for no reason,Is this what anxiety is?
895,grotesque and terrifying night terrors every night for the past two weeks,"All my life I have been a normal sleeper never had nightmares, and never really remembered my dreams, as they were never particularly interesting. About two weeks ago I had my first ever nightmare. It was intense and unlike anything, I had ever experienced. It consisted of blood-curdling screams that seemed to go on for hours and it felt as if I was watching a film consisting of unbelievably grotesque and gory images. Blood, guts, death, decapitation and whatever gruesome thing you could think up. I woke up that morning and I was shaken but assumed it was a one-off. I made sure to eat healthily and drink lots of water that day in case it had something to do with physical health. Unfortunately, it did not go away, and every night since has consisted of the exact same gory images and terrible noises. I am not avoiding going to bed, but I do dread the act of closing my eyes. These dreams have caused a lot of stress and anxiety for me and I seem to regain no energy like I normally do when I go to bed. Going to sleep is no longer refreshing and I am just as tired when I wake up as when I go to bed. As the weeks have gone on I'm getting more and more exhausted. The stress has caused some of my acne to come back and caused work to become more difficult. 

I'm typing this in hopes someone who has experienced something similar has gone back to normal, and in hopes, they could share their solution with me."
896,i just emailed my old therapist my emotionally abusive father forced me to stop seeing. Was this okay?,"To give a bit of backstory I saw this therapist two years ago. After she informed me that my dad was emotionally abusive, my dad wouldn't let me see her anymore. We didn't end therapy on the best terms. I recently left the emotionally abusive household a few weeks ago and have been thinking about her a lot. I wouldn't have left the house if she didn't open my eyes two years ago (saw her weekly for a few months). 

I found her email through psychology today and sent the following message to her through their service:

Hello, You were my therapist about two years ago. I hope that this is an okay way to contact you. You told me that my father was emotionally abusive and he forced me to no longer go to therapy. I would like to apologize for the terms that we ended on. The abuse has only gotten worse and I didn't recognize it until recently. I've since left the household and am living with a friend. I'm not sure if you remember me but I just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes and helping me during that very difficult time in my life.

Was it okay to send her an email or did I cross a line?"

898,"To older people, was it at all common to have multiple friends with significant depression/suicidal thoughts/mental health issues?","Recently talked to a friend about their suicide ideation and it got me thinking. I’ve suffered from issues of depression in the past, and I feel like I know a lot of people with significant mental health problems. Idk if my friend group is just a weird sample or more predisposed to people with mental health issues, but it makes me wonder how common this amount of mental illness is among my own generation."
899,i saw a video of someone dying and i feel pretty shaken up.,"i didnt search for this, it was posted on a discord channel and me being curious, i clicked on it to see what would happen. Somebody was hanged. i wont go into too much detail for obvious reasons, but i feel pretty shaken up by watching it. no idea what to do, dont really want to tell my parents as they will blow it way out of proportion, and it isnt a big enough issue to warrent counseling."
900,OCD and extreme panic disorder,"i’m constantly convinced i’m dying which gives me the most intense panic attacks ever. they’re so physically bad that it only continues the thought in my head that i’m dying. i can’t eat anything anymore without thinking it’s been drugged, i can’t sleep without thinking it’s my last night awake. so much so to wear i have a panic attack almost every night over it and over every meal. every physical sensation that isn’t the slightest bit neutral sends me into panic. i already have heart palpitations and an arrhythmia and asthma so continuously making my heart rate and breathing up and down is becoming painful. i’m only 17 and i just want everything back to normal. i’m so sick of being terrified of dying every day and the only thing i can focus on throughout the entire day is intrusive thoughts and panicking. idk what to do this is all so new, it only started back in january because i took one dose of effexor and i’ve never been the same since. i hate this so much, i go to therapy but not much seems to be working."
901,Having a breakdown,"So long story short, I had a med school interview today which I did and I told my parents not to tell anyone, which they agreed to earlier on. 20 minutes ago my father comes to me and says he and my mum made a deal that mum can tell her friend who is coming for dinner. I straight up was like what the heck and just went up and took my sibling out cause he had to anyways but full on having a panic episode. I broke down. Pulled over with my sibling and cried. I feel heartbroken and just how much we both are disrespected by our parents. Like this may seem small but it's an ongoing issue that occurs and they straight up just don't care. Frankly it wasnt their ""deal"" to make I don't care how happy it makes them. How does something like this not have my say."
902,before the corona outbreak for the first time in my life I felt secure,"I have suffered with anxiety,depression and PTSD for a while now. It used to be so bad I would be in and out of the hospital and treatment centers. A few months ago I stopped self harming and I enrolled in a new school. I got into my schools musical, found the most amazing group of friends, started to do well in school,starting dating an amazing guy and formed a healthy relationship and I could finally control my thoughts with the help of therapy every week and medication. I was seeing my boyfriend every day and I was going to musical rehearsals to keep myself busy. Then when the shelter in place started things started going down hill for me. The musical gets canceled and all of a sudden my boyfriend becomes distant with me. I cant see my friends and now my boyfriend doesnt even want to facetime me and tells me he isnt on his phone and thats why he isnt texting me. Now I am once again over thinking and I feel like complete shit. I am overthinking my relationship and I keep questioning if he really wants to be with me or if he is done with me. Every time I ask him he says he loves me and never wants to break up but it does not feel that way. I am trapped in my house with my paranoid thoughts and my screaming 4 yer old sister that my parents cant control so she comes in my rooms and tends to take things or break things. I am constantly stressed and I even got a new medication to add on to help with my anxiety but I still feel like shit. I keep thinking about self harm and I have been clean for a month or so but now it just seems so easy to do."
903,My mental health is worst than it has even been and I really need help.,"I'm 19 years old and I'm a freshman in college. I have struggled with anxiety and  depression for a while now and it's getting really bad. I just feel so empty and numb and I have no motivation to do anything. I haven't been sleeping much because I can't stop overthinking. In the past I experienced a lot of domestic violence and  recently I've been having flashbacks and nightmares from when my dad was abusive and used to hit my mom but my parents are okay now and my dad doesn't do those stuff anymore but I can't stop thinking about it and I can't get the flashbacks and nightmares to stop. My anxiety has gotten to the point where I get anxiety attacks almost every day. I'm really stressed out because I have so much work to do but I have no motivation to do it and I'm failing a few of my classes and it's all my fault. I feel like a disappointment. I've also been having suicidal thoughts and a few days ago I was in a really bad place and I wrote a suicide note but I didn't end up doing anything and I'm glad that I didn't. My suicidal thoughts come and go, one day I'm fine and then next day I'm thinking about suicide. I know that suicide isn't the answer and I'm convinced that I won't actually try anything but the fact that I actually have those thoughts are really scary. I feel really alone and I feel like no one cares about me. I've been trying to ignore my feelings and pretend like I'm fine in hope that my depression and anxiety would just go away on it's own but the more I ignore it the worse it gets. I also use to self harm and I haven't done it in 5 months but today I had really bad self harm urges. I want to tell someone about what I've been going through but I don't really have anyone to talk to. I can't tell my parents because they don't take mental health seriously and they don't show me any emotional support at all and I only have one close friend that trust enough to tell but I'm afraid to tell her because I don't know how she would react. I've also tried going to the counselor at my school a few times but every time I tried I always get really anxious then end up not going. I'm just in a lot of emotional pain right now and I feel like it's never going to get better. I just feel really hopeless."

905,My dad is in the ICU,"He was brought to the hospital two nights ago showing symptoms of COVID-19. Fever, SoB, 88% o2 sat and vertigo. The results still haven’t come back, but they did say he has double pneumonia, and the mutated virus is presenting as that. I’ve been having increased anxiety and more frequent panic attacks. Him and I have never had an ideal relationship. The last time I saw him was the end of September. I called the hospital today and was able to talk to him and it made my heart flutter to hear him say “I love you too.” I want my dad so badly to make it through this so We can work on our relationship."
906,What movies should I watch when feeling depressed?!,"It’s me again! I posted earlier today about a full day sensory overload anxiety attack. I’m feeling a LITTLE better now than before, but mostly because I put on comfy PJs and fuzzy sucks. Those things tend to calm me down. 
However, I still have a strong lingering feeling that my mental health is on a decline. When I felt like this before I happened to watch a few movies that were so emotional and potent that it helped take my mind off things, but also to gain a new perspective on my stress/mental triggers. A few examples of what I’ve watched that have helped are: “Requiem for a Dream, “Girl Interrupted” and “Perks of being a Wallflower.” 
I guess I dig the dramas that touch on mental health. 

Any suggestions?! 

TLDR I need recommendations for movies to watch when I’m feeling lonely/depressed/anxious"
907,"Did anyone else always get called mature when they were young, and then develop anxiety or add or depression or ocd?",
908,I lost a friend,"Like the title says, I lost a friend. I feel like I was hit really hard. The thing is, I was planning to confront her and probably from there leave her as a friend. She was manipulative, and was constantly putting me down. That might be why I feel so bad about it. I was really suffering when I was around her. From me always being put down when I was around her, to her just brushing off the fact that I had just confided in her about my anxiety. Some people don’t handle people confiding in them as well. She does. I know that because we both helped a friend with her problems, with her taking the lead. 

Recently I texted her. I told her why I was such a “blazing b**ch” the past few months. I did a few things that could be put on the more “risky” side, like disagreeing on a big topic or telling her that she was doing something wrong. Then I told her what she did that hurt me. I did it in a civil way, saying that these things hurt me, and she didn’t acknowledge what I said at all. She just cut me off. I’m not sure why it hurt so much. There’s just so many emotions involved in this. She helped me see who I really was. Now I’m second guessing that. 

My whole year has been a mess, with her being a prominent part in mostly ruining it, and every single emotion from the past year came back. Being dropped from a different friend group because I didn’t want to date a boy. Terrible year full of oral surgeries and an unknown pain. A borderline sexual harassment thing between me and a teacher. Every emotion came flooding back and I can’t stop them. I’m scared of these emotions, which is why they were all pushed down. Even when i’m writing this I know i pushed those emotions back down. I don’t know what to do."
909,how do i tell my parents im suicidal and have them actually believe?,"I told my mom a couple hours after i was on the lifeline chat from 11PM-5 AM... it was scattered but still, and then she just said i have nothing that's causing problems for me, other people are dying in the world, and she hasn't had a life since she's met my father. Well shit man, didn't know my problems didn't matter at all, fuck. Like i know she said that so I would count my blessings, but damn. I just want a therapist im failing everything in school, and my grades have literally gradually been getting worse for years, and both of my parents have had depression and have seen therapists but they wont let me see one cause of their own fucking experiences and because they just think im lazy. Shit man I have no funds cause they wont let me get a job, I have no car, no license, cause they don't think I'm responsible, I have nothing... can I at least get some mental help since their strategies aren't working?"

It’s a toxic workplace and I’m not good enough to get hired somewhere else. I’ve probably applied to 30 jobs this year, got called twice, and never went further. My parents are immigrants and I’m constantly afraid they’ll get deported . I’m an immigrant and I don’t want my SO to help me get residency bc he’s made comments in the past that led me to think he thinks I only married him for that. I make OK money but it doesn’t ever feel like enough bc I don’t have enough to give my parents that much. My SO wants kids but I am terrified to have one and I think he wants to divorce over that. My SO family member has a mental illness and is into witch craft so I’m afraid I’m witchcrafted on . I have no real friends , rare to get notifications. I feel so alone and am scared to tell anyone everything that’s going on with me . I do believe in god but doubt a lot . My head constantly hurts .

I'm 24 now. This week alone has been hell. The virus  has nothing to do with it. I have OCD. All the things they've said to do I've been doing since I was 7. No. 

My depression has been making it so hard for me to wake up in the morning and stay up during the day. I barely eat. I've lost 14 pounds and that's without doing anything. I don't have the energy to cook. I have to force myself to even take a shower and that's getting hard. And then I'm supposed to be dealing with grief over myself. I have Major Depression, GAD, OCD, and PTSD. Suicide has been on my mind since I was 12. I don't know why I stay. But I guess I'm too afraid my twin will be the one to find me. 

I applied for Social Security Income so that I could go somewhere. Get away, but also help my twin and I have some stability of our own instead of relying on my parents. They said I got denied in August of last year. I never got a paper. I called in October and they told me I would get my results. Never did. I called in November to be told they were supposed to send it in August, I was denied and past the date for appeal. But she'd send me the papers and I'd write a letter on why I was late.

They never talked to my mental health organization. None. Their decision was based on medical conditions of mine that aren't the problem(two types of anemia, IBC, insomnia). They talked to my primary who I see maybe once a year and my gastroenterology who I see maybe once or twice. Not the therapist I see every week. Or the clinician I see once a month. But I didn't have mental issues because they never even contacted them. I saw it on the denial paper when I finally got it in December.

I broke down. Don't lie on my name. I get a call from you and you belittle me and then tell me to see you urgent.  I come, she's not there, get belittled. I may look like a teen, but I'm not a fucking child.

All for a paper that needed my signature.  My fucking signature. 

It took them less then I week to deny me. In a process that takes three months.  And I lost it. 

Everyone wants me to stay, but I feel like all I've been through is hell on earth. I know I can reapply. But my sister who has lupus who I've seen deteriorate right before my eyes has been denied for years. 

I don't know if I want to live anymore even if I'm not suicidal right now."
914,I hate the nurses here.,I'm currently being warded and yesterday night I couldn't sleep cause i had alot of dark thoughts in my head and not cause of any head pain (that's what I'm being warded for) and I was having a mental break down but none of the nurses paid attention and asked me to sleep persistently. They even wanted to take my phone away while that was the only source of distraction for the negativity.
915,Am I experiencing mild catatonia?,"So I found out many of my Neurological and especially psychological illnesses can produce various types of catatonic states, which I feel I experience. To help explain I should list my relevant illnesses according to the many Psychiatrists, Therapists, Neurologists, and addiction counselors(I say ""according"" as most of them have a common consensus that my illnesses are atypical in behavior and thus harder to diagnose); Bipolar Disorder (they constantly change their minds between type I and II), Borderline Personality Disorder, Cluster Headaches and Migraines(this may seem irrelevant but it can actually cripple and damage the neuron pathways), Insomnia (I actually may not have insomnia as I function on a 24/12 system, which is metrically no different than the average 16/8), Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks, and Shaken Baby Syndrome.

These are my experiences, I can't tell if they are catatonia or a Derealization disorder; I will sometimes just sit staring or pacing around without noticing or feeling what I am doing for extended periods, I will autopilot constantly even in the middle of conversations(during these moments I experience extreme discomfort, and I can't communicate what I'm thinking properly{I believe I am currently in one of these states}), I have pseudo-sleep paralysis (except I can move, I hallucinate entities, which are not always uncomfortable and I had a friendly conversation with a hallucination once) I will also very rarely hear voices and during these moments it's like I become dumb and extremely happy, because normally I would know they aren't real but I converse with them, lastly I experience physical contact from invisible things when I'm like this. I know these experiences aren't real but in those moments they are more real than reality is."
916,Suddenly unable to keep track of things?,"I never lost anything.  Organized and efficient.  Out of nowhere, I am unable to stop losing things.  Almost every day I misplace two or three important possessions like car keys, apartment keys, cell phone charger, etc. and on average spend a hour a day looking for them.  It is not uncommon for me to lose something while looking for something, for example I can't find my cell phone charger in my car so I Begin looking tearing up the seats etc. but in the process I lose my car keys and have to spend another 30 minutes looking for those too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've resorted to throwing away almost everything I own, but that made little difference.  I can't stop losing things and don't know how to stopl    I Feel hopeless"
917,How do you know if you actually have some sort of mental illness or your brain is just trying to trick into thinking it as an excuse for bad habits and stuff like that?,"The past couple of months I have really been wondering if I have a mental illness. It would provide an explanation for a lot of things that I think are wrong with my head. When reading things about it, I see many similarities between it and my brain. But at the same time, maybe there’s nothing wrong. Maybe my brain is just trying to blame something other than myself but then I feel guilty so doesn’t that defeat the purpose?. I think that subconsciously, my brain might be doing it as a weird way to get attention. But that also doesn’t make any sense because if I thought for sure I had something I would probably never tell anyone so that still doesn’t make sense. I don’t really know how to explain it any better than that. Is this a common feeling with other people or is it just me?"
918,I don’t how how to seek help,"I’ve been looking to get some help for a few years now, but my experience has been atrociously bad. The best i’ve gotten was to see a counselor but she doesn’t actually help, at this point she’s just someone to talk to, but she has talked to me about my personal life and has told me that it’s apparent that i’m struggling with some emotional trauma

I’ve considered checking into the local mental health center because i’m so desperate. I can’t get better in the environment i’m in currently, i barely even feel safe here. I try so hard to reach out but as soon as they’re aware of my age they just stop, i guess cause they assume i can take care of it myself but i really can’t. I don’t know where to go or what to do and all i want is someone or somewhere i can go to get better, if anyone can reach out and at least point me in the wrong direction it would be highly appreciated please"
919,How to tell if I’m a manipulative person,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this post but I’ll put it here for a start. I’ll delete it if it doesn’t fit the rules and guidelines of this sub 


Ok some context. Me and my ex have been back into contact with each other after a month of being broken up and things are looking good as we are feeling good about being friends (prolly a bad idea, I know) but basically she broke up with me because I never had the time with her with a busy schedule and that school also heavily affected my mental health with all of the stress it put me under.  

But anyways, today I have had rough day and we were talking but I wanted to end the conversation rather early because I wasn’t feeling well and I didn’t want to project all of my problems into her as if she could solve them. That’s all I said to her and she responds with “I feel like I’m being manipulated” even thought all i said to her was that I wasn’t feeling well and I didn’t wanna spill out all of my problems to her because she’s around. 

I guess my question is, am I actually being manipulative to her in this instance? I have been trying on bot telling people all of my struggles because they are nearby (I have even been told by her that it feels like I’m putting an unrealistic expectation on her to help with my problems)"
920,Anyone have any advice when you have absolutely no more will to live anymore?,I just don’t have anymore fight left in me. My depression and anxiety are consuming me. I just want the pain to stop.
921,Negative thoughts,"I have a little voice in my head. It’s my voice but it’s like it’s evil. It’s always feeding me negative thoughts. It always says that I don’t deserve to be happy, it tells me that I’m just a fake. It tells me I don’t deserve to live. I have so much to be happy about I’m only 19 years old I own a clothing line start up, I have a shoe resell business in the works along with many other business ventures. I have the most beautiful Nieces and Nephews who i love soooo much and they’re the reason that I haven’t tried to take my life again...(attempted and failed twice) yet I still feel worthless... day by day I just feel like I’m being consumed by this evil and I don’t know what to do... honestly most days I feel trapped in my own head..."
922,What should I do?,I’m 18 and I’ve been through eating disorders multiple times and have struggled with depression/anxiety for a very long time. I always find myself trying to give advice to ppl suffering from similar stuff because they ask my for advice. I had a friend recently get really upset about feeling lonely and they’ve always worried about being single forever. This person tells me what’s going on most of the time but this time they just told me they “can’t do this anymore”. Im worried about them but I don’t know how to help them. They just think everything in life is a distraction and that they are completely lost/alone in this life. Ive tried to reach out since quarantine and news media is putting us in this same boat where we are forced to be with our minds. I’ve tried to give them ways to cope with it and I tried to listen but they told me to forget about it. I don’t know what more I could do?
923,Do I have something wrong with me?,"I live in the UK and people have started telling me my behaviour isn’t “normal” but I don’t want to see anyone and I didn’t know where else to ask. 
I guess the problem is I don’t ever feel happy, I look around and I see people smiling and talking about their lives and it makes me feel angry and worse about myself. It’s got to the point I hate every single part of my day until I can come home and get drunk enough that I’m not afraid to cry. 
I feel angry at myself that I can be entitled enough to be so unhappy with my fairly privileged lifestyle and that just makes it worse. 
Ive realised that I hate every aspect of who I am, I despise it completely. 
Ive become so unhappy I’ve started punishing myself without realising. I don’t feel like I value anything anymore."

925,"I really don't know what this is, its long and stupid but my heart is telling me to post my thoughts","This shit is so demotivating, I don't even know why Im stilling typing no one will care, no one will comment, no one will respond, everyone is going through the same problems, why are mine worse, why do I think I am more worthy of help than the other people going through the same problems I am and doing fine with it, why am I worse for not being able to cope or understand any of the work I am doing, why am I so fucking annoying why do I stop people from caring about themselves so they can focus on me, why am I still alive, why am I a parasite , why does this shit get to me so much, why am I letting this control the way I think, why does the corona-virus have to happen now, why can't I just take a break from uni, why did I go to UNI, why do I want to teach, why do I think I'll be a good teacher, why do I not do my work, why is it whenever I get help from a professional, I don't tell them my actual problems, why do I only tell them the start of it, do i do it so that they can think they did a good job and have helped solve my problems when they haven't, why am I alone, what have I done to deserve being alone with my evil goddamn thoughts that I don't like, my thoughts that make me want to harm myself, is it worth living? Is it truly worth living in this time of apocalypse, why are we here, does it even matter, is there anything I can do, can I even help one fucking person? Maybe thats why I want to be a teacher, so when I die I could've at least helped other people instead of myself, people with potential, people who aren't destined to fail, people who can succeed in every area I failed. Maybe thats why i want to teach. I still don't know why I keep typing, I just want it out there that my life is miserable, but if people know its miserable they will try and help me when they could be helping themselves, Im not important, these people don't know me, why would they care about some random stranger on the internet that they have never met, someone that they don't care about, someone that just keeps on crying and complaining someone that is annoying, and loud and just flat out fucking useless. Someone that doesn't have anyone to talk to, someone with no actual friends, only friends they can talk to when they want to play games, I have no friends to get support from I've tried with one of them only for it to come back and fucking hit me in the face. The last friend I opened up to looked at me with disgust, it felt horrible. Am I that disgusting for having fucking depression? Albeit, why do I have depression, because school is hard and I am a big cry baby. There are people out there who have depression for legitimate reasons, yet here I am upset that I cannot do school well, I just hate myself, I just wish I didn't feel anything, I just want everything to be numb, I just want the sound of the self doubt and yelling to stop.

Im sorry for this wall of text, I just need to tell someone or just post it somewhere"
926,"Unsure but possible dissociation? Never intend on offending anyone, just trying to figure my brain out.","If you have any experiences similar to mine please please share them. I’ve always known I had my own issues. We all do to a degree. I’ve suffered from misophonia from a very very young age. I’ve also worked through a long time restrictive eating disorder, and have had general anxiety and depression my entire life as well. Some times in my life were worse and some better. Something that affected my day to day life and also has from a very young age is inability to focus on conversation, memory loss, and inability to retain information. I have memories of things in my life but many many are clouded. For what affects me in my relationship now is I’ll forget entire conversations. I’ll completely zone out during arguments. I never wanted to think so but I think it may be dissociative. I do my “zoning out” (not on purpose, I absolutely hate it) during normal conversation but it gets much worse during conflict, or being under stress. I find myself thinking about other topics or about my emotions or focusing only on the sounds that are bothering me etc. hopefully this makes sense. My dad used to scream at me as a kid for not listening or paying attention etc making it worse. And even now with me thinking maybe it’s really something serious (I’m 22 now) I blame myself for just not trying hard enough. When I feel like it’s out of my control. My boyfriend said that when he first met my father (I left his house at 17 and tried making amends bringing my bf around but lost touch with him again) said he (my dad) was talking  to me and then turned to my bf and said “see, she’s not listening to a thing I’m saying” and I supposedly snapped out of it saying “What? What?”  I have no recollection of this happening but I believe him. He has no reason to lie about this. Im ashamed. I know probably most of you aren’t doctors but if you’ve experienced anything similar I’d love to read about it. Or if you have any tips for advice that would be nice too. It’s honestly causing so many issues in my life and I would like to gain control of my life. I’ve always felt off but could never pin point it. Blamed my anxiety and depression or ED. Thank you"
927,It feels like all of the work I’ve put in towards mental wellness is coming crashing down and the amount of insecurity that has been sowed do in my life during 2019-2020 feel unfixable,"I was doing so good for so long. And this feels like it’s pushed me down a well of insecurity I will never climb up. I think I have a shit personality l, and nobody will ever truly like me. I don’t understand why I am so terrible but it has to be true based on empirical evidence. How can I not believe in a pattern so apparent in my life? I

I had original posted a Snapchat on my private story before I deleted it to come on here. I want people to know how I’m feeling so they can tell me that it’s all wrong but I feel so attention seeking and I’m not sure I’d believe them and I don’t know if it will be satisfying like I want it to be.

I’m going to turn into a shell of a person for awhile and everything is going to crumble around me and when I get back there will be nothing left. I feel like my life is crashing in around me."
928,Mental health struggles due to Covid-19 outbreak,"Hii guys, I just joined Reddit so I'm new to this whole thing! 

I'm currently at home in quarantine but I still do have school. For one of my assignments I have to design a tiny house which can be used for quarantine. 
I noticed that a lot of people (including myself) are having some trouble with staying inside and not being allowed to see people or not even being able to go and visit your therapist. This is why I'm asking here to what people currently miss, want or need these days when being in quarantine / lockdown. I'm doing this assignment for the people with disorders like me cuz we usually get overlooked by others so every reply would help me out. 

So it doesn't really matter what you want to tell me, every bit of information could help me a lot. But I especially would like to know what helps you getting trough these days or what is something you desperately need at this point.

Thanks for reading and stay strong! ❤️"
929,Any here have really bad luck with meds in general?,"I have been on 2 SSRIs and have bad side effects ranging from erratic behavior to feeling awful or losing my own ability to feel emotions + many more. 

Have taken beta blockers for a few days and had a lot of problems with low blood pressure and fatigue and it didn’t help with anxiety 

I have taken buspar and after a bit it made me sick and left me feeling really depressed so I couldn’t keep taking it. 

I have been on a variety of sleeping meds which produced different results with the worst sending me to the emergency room and the working ones slowly loosing effectiveness every time I took them or causing extreme morning drowsiness. 

Am also trying adhd treatment with a non stimulant blood pressure medication and am also experiencing a lot of side effects including fatigue and nausea along with just feeling unwell when it’s in effect, which is nearly all day because it’s long acting. 

I have also gotten a test to determine my drug response to anxiety and depression meds and no SSRIs made the complete safe list and a few of the sleeping meds I took made it into the safe list. I am also under 18 and am a around a 100 lb Asian female so I don’t know if that has anything to do with my negative responses to meds. 

Does anyone else have these issues or advice? I have been taking my non stimulant ADHD meds for 2 weeks so far and I don’t know if I want to keep taking them but other than that I am not on any meds."
930,A game for y'all,Im finna call this guess the mental illness (i have no idea myself) so there is many places to start but what really sticks out to me right now is my paranoia it started as a horrible fear of the dark i sed to run to light switches so i can feel safe again but as the years went by it got worse i have weeks where i think everything is whatching me and something is going to attack me so i usually wind up holding up in my bedroom with a knife until im so tired my mind eases. Then theres hatred for authority amoung other things that is set off by the smallest of thing's.then theres the normal homicidal/suicidal thoughts i go between evrey once and a while.if i have been through the above a lot a go into a state of drunk like psychosis maybe i start stabbing inanimate objects. thats all i can think of right now
931,Life just sucks right now,I honestly just wish my mom could work from home. School is going good for me but knowing that she risks her health by working alongside doctors and nurses to treat sick patients fills me up with a type of sadness I’ve never felt before. I’m also missing my friends. I’m close to college and it pains me to think of not graduating with them. Life just sucks right now. Stay safe everyone!
932,How are you guy’s holding up in these strange times ??,Just wondering how my fellow human is holding up in these strange times. Especially the ones that are suffering mentally of just feel lonely.
933,Here is something that will make you laugh (I hope),"I was watching Facebook Watch and there is a video on there called Internet Challenges. Well, one guy put a whole Big Mac into his mouth at once and chewed it all up and poof it was gone.

I was not disgusted by this...no.

My first reaction? MMMmmmmm!!!! I want a Big Mac now!

So I ordered delivery from Door Dash. At 11:25 at night.

Sigh...gotta love those Late-Night McD's cravings! 

What makes it funnier is that the store is only 1.3 miles from where I live. Hubby was too lazy to go get it ahahahahh!!! He said, ""Eh...just order from Door Dash"" and so I did. 

What is WRONG with me lolololol!

Hope that brightened your day (or night). I ordered for all the kids too (who are also turning into Vampires slowly but surely--up all night and sleeping all day) so now we are going to have supper Part 2 here soon.

934,I’m almost done,"I just moved to a big city after my girlfriend of almost three years and I broke up. I hate sounding like a sob story but I’m just really alone and not above asking strangers for help I guess. I’m in an awful place mentally and have some awful thoughts that I promised myself and her I wouldn’t act on but damn bro life doesn’t feel worth it ya know? Especially with the state of the world right now I find it hard to find a reason to keep going a lot of the time, it’s all just so overwhelming and numbing at the same time it’s hard to explain. I love making music but the reality of that being a pipe dream is tough too bc I never really developed a passion for another career. I’m kind of drawing a blank but thank you for listening and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
935,Just why?,"Honestly I just feel I'm apparently not handling life and relationships in the correct way I should.  Because apparently to a ""friend"" I know my way of trying to find a relationship is soo wrong.  I look for someone who I can be friends with first then I try to move it further.  Which apparently is so wrong.  Aslo like I'm honestly a more docile,  quiet person.  I more would rather be out of people's way than try and be an instigator. 

For when I try to get into a relationship with a perspective partner I'm not one to advance for sex that isn't my first thought when I try to find someone.  I try and find someone who will like me for me. 

I could mostly just care less about the sexual stuff really.  I just want someone who I know is willing to support me for who I am faults and all.   Apparently to someone I know they think I'm stupid with how I handle trying to find a partner.   I'm a 22 year old Male who has medical issues that affect me daily they aren't going away anytime soon. I'm not trying to find someone who is with me out of pity. I'm trying to find someone who will love me for me faults and all .   Like how most guys my age are looking for their next lay I'm not.  Even though I've never actually had sex. Honestly that's not the most important thing to me.   

Apparently that's stupid and just so invalid. While yes I'd like to have sex that's ultimately not the reason for me to get with someone.  

I just feel like I'm doing life so wrong..."
936,I have no desire to do anything at all.,[removed]
937,Could use some advice...,"Because I love my brother, I want to help him. He has no confidence in himself, he thinks lowly of himself and he is always comparing himself to me. Things like ‘I don’t have confidence like you’, ‘I still don’t know what I want to do with my life, you know your path and I dont’. How can I help my brother gain confidence in himself as a person? Btw when we younger I would hit him a lot because he would provoke me, but I realize now it was because he wanted my attention and I was horribly bad at expressing affection back then. In fact our relationship was so bad that he would always stay out till very late and not tell my parents or I and we never talked (even though we always slept in the some room). We didn’t hate each other or anything, it just wasn’t a good relation. In the passed 2.5 years we have mended this relationship a lot and are now very close. I want to help him, any advice?"
938,How do I not get paranoid over every ailment?,"I was gonna see a therapist but then COVID happened.

Is money involved, and if so, is it a lot?

Do I just go in and ask my doctor?"
940,Just realized that I’ve been binge-watching the same TV show daily for the last 12+ months. Is this a symptom of my mental health issues?,"38F, single mom, diagnosed bi-polar since about 2000.

I suffered through childhood sexual abuse and I was raised by my mother who has borderline personality disorder. I got out of a terribly abusive relationship a little over a year ago, which has brought back a lot of the trauma for me. 

Today while I was working from home, I had Netflix running on my iPad, watching the same show I always watch, Forensic Files. My daughter, who has been out of school for nearly a month, asked “Don’t you ever watch anything else? I think I watched this episode already.” I told her I watch other stuff and she said that for the last month, I’ve been watching the same show every day over and over and that’s so weird. 

It got me thinking. I went on my laptop and pulled up my Netflix viewing history. It seems that I have only watched Forensic Files and nothing else for over a year. We don’t have cable so Netflix is our only media source. I’ve cycled through the entire series at least 4 times now. 

I’m not sure if this is a conscious decision I’ve made because I really like the show or if I’m just compelled to do so because I’m somehow mentally stuck.  

When I was a teen, shortly after my abusive stepfather finally left our home I couldn’t stop eating toilet paper. My family doctor chalked it up to anemia-induced pica. 

Is this just me being an oddball or an I missing a sign of bigger issues?"
941,I need help. Or someone to listen.,"Im so tired. And angry. Im writing this as a last ditch effort to not bottle up my emotions and turn myself into a trainwreck- even moreso than I am now. This is a throwaway account because I want to tell this story from start to now as a means to vent. The family issues started when I was young and my dad had to travel to another state to work over the week and he would come back during the weekends to me, my mom, and my brother. My mom would diligently pick him up and send him, cook, clean, and make sure we were all ok. One day, my dad decided to take me my bro and my mom to dinner with one of his colleagues, who turned out to be the woman he was having an affair with. For god knows how long. I was 7 or 8, young enough to not fully grasp the situation, but enough to see and hear everything. This situation quickly turned abusive, having to jump fences to hide from my dad as he became a raging alcoholic and life went downhill. We eventually had to stay with my aunts family, start life all over again, with a depressed mom who was also trying her best to stay alive. Sparing the shitty details, they eventually got back together, mostly I assume because of my moms dependency and the taboo of divorce at the time. Since that point, life has been filled with soul wrenching fights that tear you down emotionally to the point of just wanting to escape inside yourself. I can mostly deal with it, but having to watch this over the course of your entire teenage life and even watching your older brother self-destruct from this evidently takes a toll on you. She was diagnosed as being bipolar a few years ago, and from then she now uses it as an excuse for her actions- ""Im fucking mad so deal with it"". Since the actual affair is over and 10 years have passed, my dad has done nothing but the best for this family in every way possible. He takes all the shit from my mother that he possibly can, from throwing glasses at his head, screaming at him, cutting herself to guilt trip him. I know this is him making amends for the shit he has done in the past, and my mom will never truly forgive him (which she has a right not to do), I have always been the man in the middle getting demolished in the process. I cant even explain how fucked I am inside the head because of this, but AT least im admitting it. Im 18 years old and im fucked. Her screaming and arguing and violence is only getting worse and I dont know what to do at this point. I dont deserve this. Ive never spoken about this before to anyone because i TRULY thought I shouldnt complain about my life because other people have it worse. But it hurts to have your own mother emotionally fuck with you and abuse you for your entire life. Ive existed in my own world since I was a kid, doing nothing to anger my parents only to be called a slut a whore and a bitch of a daughter by my mom behind my back for simply existing. It hurts. Its a 2v1 against me ever since my brother left and I cant take it. Its going to haunt me for the rest of my life and I hate that. My dad doesnt deserve this. Nothing he does will ever be ok in her eyes. But they will never divorce and thats the part that makes me angry. Till death do us part i guess. Im at the point where I want my own mother to die. Is that bad? I know thats bad. Theres so much more I want to say, but im so tired. So so tired. Im sorry if this doesnt make sense, I just had to say something. im sorry"
942,Bored but I don't want to do anything,"With this whole quarantine thing I have Netflixed myself out and I've played video games to the point where I don't really want to play anymore.

I got laid off and my boyfriend is still working so on his days off he wants to relax and play games which I understand, but I'm so bored when I'm alone. Any advice?

When she stopped moving, I did cpr, and I was able to bring her back long enough for her to let out a Yelp of pain and die again in my arms. I handled the situation surprisingly well at the time, but now a few months later, whenever I sit down to relax or anything I relive those moments in my head and it's almost as if I cant get them out. Now I'm just stuffing my life full of mundane shit because every time I have a moment to catch my breath, it's almost like it's just playing in repeat in my head and I cant get it out. Its causing me a great deal of emotional stress, and I'm not posting this to ask for pity. That's the opposite of what I want, im posting this in hopes that someone can maybe help me get my life back on track. Thank you.

944,does anyone else get triggered by better help ads?,"i always get better help adds about anxiety and other things and i hate them because they always include breathing getting faster, the room being engulfed in flames, or rapid threatening texts. idk how to explain it really, it’s just that they show vivid enactments of people having panic attacks, along with devices like speeding up beats and others that feel as though there designed to raise my heart rate and trigger a panic attack. idk if i explained any of this at all well i just wanna know if anyone feels the same cause i feel a little stupid for always getting upset at these harmless therapy ads.

i’ve included some links but if u are prone to panic attacks i would be careful

945,The abyss started back (somewhat of a rant),"""Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long enough into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.""

Friedrich W. Nietzsche 

For almost all of my life I have been suicidal, since I was able to grade the concept of death, I feared it and due to the fear become hyper aware of the concept. Things like time spent and decisions made became grand and potentially world ending. People became simultaneously incredibly important and nothing more than dust in the wind of a cosmic storm within a vast expanse. Nihilism and mental health are not a good combination. 

It's weird to think as babies we exist in the womb unaware and surrounded by darkness and its comforting but the concept of returning to that state as an adult is scary. 
Why should I fear death ? I've come close so many times and often by my own hand, double digits. So why should the concept of something I have face still be scary. 
That's the funny part, I dont fear death. Death is easy. I fear watching myself die. The transition between aware and unaware, the closing my eyes for the last time and being aware of it, knowing. 

I have severe body dysmorphia, each day I wake up and find something wrong with the man in the mirror and then I feel like even more of a piece of shit because not only am I ugly, I'm ungrateful too. Even the hunchback had a happy ending... yes I know its Disney. 

Perfection is impossible,  why do I search for it ... why do people do anything, because the alternative is nothing. People pray, they do it for hope. I guess that's the same reason I redo a 5000 word essay when it's more than enough. The hope it can be better. 

I pray sometimes, wear a cross alot, I was raised catholic. 
Why..."" insurance"". I know, I'm a smartass. But logically I'm playing my hand, if theres a chance, I might as well put an egg in the basket, besides its sentimental and a cool necklace so it has a value. I mean I used to wear a Pentecostal coin (lost it in a fight)... I wonder what side it landed on. 

Humans are inherently disgusting and shallow. I mean the only reason we are morally opposed to hating babies for how weird looking they are is their biology triggers our psychology that says ""it's cute, dont hurt it"" same with puppies. But offer anyone a gold Rolex and watch them punch a twenty year old.

Maybe it's my coping mechanism ? Death. I used to say on ward ""I have three choices. Keep suffering, hope for change or die"" what a jerk ... but I was right, that's life isnt it. Stay where you are, go somewhere new or...die. staring into the abyss makes you realise alot but at the same time the only thing you really realise is how little you know. How little any of us know. We all are living off the accomplishments of dead people and a brilliant 1%of geniuses combined with the efforts of a very hard working 70% and still complain. 

I've ran out of space... even reddit doesnt have time for my shit (implied smile here). Oh well, here's some of my mind. Do whatever. Stay safe in quarantine I guess. Peace"
946,What's my disorder?,"Hello everyone!, First of all, im sorry for my English.  
My symptoms :  
\-overthinking about little possibility things such as fear someone in walkway listening and recording me in front of my door when im in my condominium (when im talking about illegal, bad topics) 

&amp;#x200B;

or overthink about fear when i have sex, my telephone is on streaming.

or after i have sex, maybe im feeling anxiety about maybe i forget to close the curtain.

It's OCD or anxiety symptoms?  
Thank you!"
947,"this has to be a named phenomenon, plz help","I'm getting on in years. Bla bla bla, I've made some personal and weighed choices about my life expectancy and things like that.

It's my birthday tomorrow (well, 'today' or whatever now). I have been 'systematically' (recklessly) eroding relationships and pushing people away in preparation since about July of last year. I've managed to not be invited to a single thing in 30 days! Woo hoo!

So anyways, this whole covid thing happened. To me, this represented a 'window of opportunity'. Myself and a couple of friends over the years have often joked/lamented about not having Cancer, as our conditions were just as terminal, but without all the public support and understanding. ""Instead of having Cancer, have you tried not having Cancer?"", etc. So here I am, staring down the barrel of the perfect opportunity to get out of this awful, nightmarish contract by way of global pandemic...

*When suddenly it* ***occurs*** **(THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE PHENOM LIES)** *to me... ""I will just end up recovering, but I might pass it on to people I care about, people with a purpose in this world...""*

I've always been very good with pain, thanks to (afaik) issues with proprioception/ADD, but that is vastly outweighed by my pride. Something in me is just deeply triggered by the notion that I have to *suffer more* in order to *end my suffering.* I've done my best to research peaceful exits, where I 'get to have this one thing', but my mind always picks out direct ways any given approach could negatively impact another life. I don't mean indirect stuff like 'you will be missed', but rather things like the impact I would have on the conductor and whatnot. Do they butterfly effect spiral out and their kid doesn't go to college or something?

I know, if I know anything, that I am not the only person who struggles with a resolute-but-argumentative mind on the matter, because no one is special or interesting, certainly not me. I am curious as to what this brand of 'cold feet' is called. 

**tl;dr** qualities:

\- committed to suicide, likely in the near future

\- has formulated many plans (something I learned from a very young age is something of a threshold)

\- always manages to find a (seemingly) altruistic reason for not following through

\- does not fear pain or mutilation; no history of aversion to, or outbursts from

\- feels spited/used by the very nature of existence and reality, *evolution's automaton*, etc.

\- greatest fear is reincarnation

My actual diagnoses are Bipolar (II) and I have some (manageable) anxiety beyond 'normal' levels, but never had a full blown panic attack. *Although I am sure more than a handful of prideful psychs\* out there might need to reinvent the me-wheel, as they always do, and my friends in the industry make it seem as if BPD is all the rage in diagnoses these days... I am anecdotally/empirically certain it really is little more than type II bipolar... sad most of the time, every couple years I get between 1 and 4 (contiguous) months in which I can effortlessly do whatever I set out to do from losing weight to quitting smoking to going vegan by way of hypomania. Seems cut and dry to me after all these years, but psychs these days visually recoil if you tell them what you have been diagnosed with previously, because OBVIOUSLY. Can't be the next Freud if you aren't adversarial and dismissive towards patients, right? Sane until proven crazy. Last doc told me (his attempt at prescribing) Lexapro would* ***""help with the crying""****. LOLOLOLOL*"

I don’t really know what’s wrong with me but when times get really stressful I have a really hard time breathing and my heart starts to beat really fast. I also pull out my hair everyday. I really want to stop this habit, I’ve had it since elementary school, but when I asked my mom about therapy she said that I don’t need it and that it’s “only for crazy people”, which isn’t true. She also doesn’t know the extent of the hair pulling. I don’t know anymore, I feel I can’t really go to anyone I know because I’m embarrassed it."

952,I can't feel love,I have been in denial for years and every time I work up the courage to bring it up to someone I trust they have told me it's just anxiety and I don't know what I am talking about and to not be so dramatic but when I tell my parents I love them I feel nothing all romantic relationships I try to form fall apart I can enjoy being around people but that is it I feel like I am unable to form deeper connections with anyone I hate it so much I desperately want intimacy and companionship but I can't have it I hate myself so much I feel like a horrible person for not being able to return my parents love to me or anyone elses affection sure I can say nice things but it feels wrong saying it without meaning or feeling it I accepted a long time ago that I would die alone but it still hurts I wish I could just have a normal life
953,Hair picking,"I've  always had an urge to pick stuff since I was little, picking nose, skin, scabs, paint off walls etc.. but that's pretty normal stuff for a little kid to do. I've been picking my hair for a few years now, around 5 ish years if I can remember. It started with my eyelashes and then my eyebrows and body hair ( haven't done it to my head thankfully ) it was pretty unoticable at first and I didn't do it often so I saw it as a small bad habit that would go away eventually , but recently around a year or two ago it started becoming more severe and more apparent. What started as picking a but at my eyelashes spread to so much more of my body especially my eyebrows. Right now I have some scars on my belly since I pick there alot, I also have half the bottom row of my eyelashes gone and a huge bald spots on each of my eyebrows like someone ran a razor to shave them off. I fill them in everyday even before going to bed just because I hate seeing them first thing in the morning or I'm scared my parents will see how much of my eyebrows are really gone. Sometimes I pick without realizing but most of the time I do it because I feel this weird and almost painful sensation like needles pricking my skin or something crawling underneath and it's hard to focus on anything until I pick out the hair that's causing all this pain. I also get drawn to picking out ""imperfect hair"" hair that's really course and dark, hair that's really long compared to others or a hair that's starting to grow out (stubble) I tried alot of things like cutting my nails, wrapping stuff on my brows, I even have a tracker to track when I pick ( I mostly do it while lying in bed) but it's only getting worse and the bald spots are getting bigger and bigger. I end up feeling really guilty and I beat myself up alot for not being able to stop this. I mostly saw this as just a bad habit that I could eventually control if I keep trying. My parents know that I pick and they're supportive but they get so worried and worked up about it ( rightfully so though) that I just keep hiding it from them since seeing them get stress or cry just makes me feel even worse about the situation. I went to my school councelor and she told me that its just a bad habit and gave me some suggestions which were nice, I was hoping to go to more sessions but then COVID-19 happened and the hair picking is back. Any advice on what this hair picking stuff is? I don't understand why I'm picking and why I find it so enjoyabke, I want it to stop but at the same time I don't which makes it even harder to control the desire to pick."
954,Writing about PTSD,"So I’m writing a  short story about PTSD in children and was hoping to get some feedback and critique? I just want to make sure I’m doing it... okay? Like it’s not offensive or sensitive so if you do read the long paragraph below, I appreciate it a bunch 💕

The story starts off with a little boy who’s shown to have a toy horse imaginary friend named tumbleweed who’s his best friend, he’s eat with him and play his favourite game, (cowboys). it turns out that tumbleweed is just his stuffed toy that he holds close but he sees tumbleweed as a walking talking thinking being who’s always by his side. It’s the start of a new school year and the little boy is very nervous to go back to school so he keeps his friend close by, he’s shy and doesn’t interact much with other students but a group of kids take interest in him and invite him to play at recess, at first his imaginary friend tries to stop him from playing with other kids so the little boy is hesitant but he decides to play after the kids  suggest playing cowboys, he stuffs tumbleweed in his backpack and head outside. after a little while it seems he’s enjoying himself but then one of the kids trip over the boy’s backpack and the boys stuffed toy is revealed.  The kids question the toy and start to poke fun at the boy for still having a stuffed animal for babies, the little boy tries to get his toy back but the other kids push him back, the boy panics, he doesn’t see just his favourite toy being taken away but his imaginary friend calling for help as he’s being tossed around. The little boy snaps and hits the kid and tumble weed falls to the ground, the other kid begins to cry and all the other children start to stare and whisper. The little boy grabs tumbleweed and runs away in a panic. His school day is cut short as the teacher calls in his parents and he’s taken home. The parents worry about their child, sharing glances and such. at night as the boy sleeps with tumbleweed close to him the parents argue about taking him to the doctor now or wait for their already set appointment for next week.  The boy sleeps and he begins to get night terrors, flashes of a playground, a car horn is ringing in the background. A little boy running around and tumbleweed getting hit by a car. The little boy gets up with a start and begins to sob loudly alerting the parents who come to comfort him, they both nod and decide that going to the doctor now is probably best. The next day the boy and his parents go to the doctors (therapist). After his session the boy sits in one of the waiting rooms as his parents talk to the doctor. The boy holds on to tumbleweed and tumbleweed reassured him that everything will be okay and he apologizes for getting in the way again. The little boy smiles and tells tumbleweed that he’s still going to be his best friend no matter what. While the little boy talks with his imaginary friend , the parents discuss their worries about sending their child to school again after the events that day. The doctor reveals how for a young boy his age, going through the trauma of seeing his friend die from a car collision is going to take a long time to recover and that it’s best that he continues to interact with normal activities like school if they want things to get better. At this point the audience learns that tumbleweed is the imaginary embodiment of the boy’s best friend who he lost and uses him as a kind of coping method.  After the session the parents leave the doctors and they go to the classmates house who the little boy hit. The parents stay for lunch and the little boy apologizes for hitting him. The two begin to get friendly and the other boy even takes interest in tumbleweed and they both start to become friends. The little boy even leaves tumbleweed in his bag when the other boy suggests going to his room to play video games. 

Epilogue:
Fast for award quiet a few years and we see the little boy grown up, he’s emptying his room as he packs for college. He’s almost done when he spots tumbleweed sitting by his nightstand, it’s still apparent that after all those years tumbleweed has still been close to the boy even if he stopped seeing him as an imaginary friend or stopped playing with him entirely, he always sat next to his bed stand comforting him. The boy picks up his toy and looks at his suitcase, hesitant on if he should bring him or not. Cut to the car and the boy is loading his luggage, his friend ( the boy he hit when he was young) at the steering wheel waiting to get going. The boy kisses his parents good bye and the two friends head on their way to a new start in their life. The boy’s friend asks is he forgot anything. The boy shakes his head and says he’s set, cut to the packed luggage in the back and we see a little stuffed arm poking out from the side."
955,I was wondering if y’all could recognize symptoms.,"I know most of y’all aren’t doctors or anything, but I’m getting worried about my friend a lil and I figured you guys would have experience with lots of different diagnoses 

My friend has told me recently that he has a couple mirrors in his room, and that the person in each one is a different person, like not him. He even named them though it’s just numbers and they all have different personalities. I know that this quarantine is putting a lot of stress on a lot of people and I worry he may be cracking a lil. Do any of y’all recognize this? Thanks."
956,Motivation required,"What motivates you to get out of bed during the lockdown and do things? I struggle with getting out of the bed in morning, even if I do, I don't feel like doing anything but my mother keeps pushing me to do things.

959,Have no one else to talk to... need some advice. Weight loss/depression,"I don’t know where to begin but here’s my backstory:
I’m a 20 year old girl and I’ve been dealing with depression and body image issues pretty much since I was 14 or 15. I’m very overweight and I’m at this point where I don’t think I’ll ever get down to a healthy weight. Physically I’m capable but the one thing holding me back is knowing no matter how hard I try I will never have a “perfect” body. As little as an issue as that may sound to you, it rocks my day to day life. I know I shouldn’t compare myself to others but I go on Instagram and all I see are beautiful people who don’t have stretch marks or have any excess skin. My biggest fear is excess skin. But there’s more

I’m so introverted and I find it hard to make friends. I graduated high school in 2019 and the few friends I had moved away and I stayed here. Going away for college wasn’t an option for me because my high school grades were so poor (due to depression). I got a job to occupy my time but I still go home every night sad and alone and I just lay in bed for the rest of the day when I’m not at work. I have tried making friends but it’s so hard for me for reasons I don’t understand. I do consider myself a nice person. I do have some redeeming qualities but I am shy and I don’t really have social skills. 
My home life has always been rough and I don’t have a support system or family I could depend on. It’s always been me and my own thoughts. I finally couldn’t take it anymore so I tried to make an appointment with a therapist and the hospital said their earliest appointments are in February of 2021. I had the scariest thought earlier after my shower while I was looking in the mirror “maybe all my problems would go away if I just killed myself” I really have no one to talk to and I feel like it’ll be this way forever. I feel like I’m going to die young and alone without anyone here for me. My thoughts get really dark during this time of night. I thought it was better to come online and vent then to keep it bottle inside any longer. Thank you if you took time to read this and reply to me. I appreciate it more than you’ll ever know..."
960,Sister (F24) has sobbed to my parents almost nightly since she was in high school and as much as my parents want to help her she essentially rejects all forms of help. How can I help?,"Since we were young, my sister has dealt with rather severe anxiety and depression. It manifests itself in obsessive tendencies and severe perfectionism and although she can function, she has sobbed and complained and yelled at my parents almost every single night for the last 10 years of life. Basically sobbing and getting mad at them when they don't help her is her only coping mechanism and it's hard because I can see as much as my parents want to help her, how burdening and draining it is on them. They've tried to get her to see a therapist but she doesn't trust people and instantly rejects them. They tried to get her to take medication but she claimed nearly immediately it made her feel worse and she didn't want it. She exercises but almost obsessively where it's unhealthy and she reads books and knows the ""steps"" of coping with anxiety and depression but she never implements them. I know nobody can make her change, and I really try to empathize with her and really do want her to be happy and successful, but I really resent how much stress and pressure she puts on my parents and how she gives up or rejects anything that could potentially help her. It makes me worried too since my parents won't be around forever and without them, I genuinely don't know how she would cope. Does anyone have any advice? 

Summary: My sister's only coping mechanism is sobbing and yelling to my parents, but refuses therapy and medication. I'm worried about her and want to help for her sake and my parents sake. What do I do?"
961,Anxious in a relationship.. (looking for advice),"
When having anxiety because my boyfriend was out drinking, not responding to my texts.. and reading them. To clarify the drinking part doesn’t bother me.. it’s when I see that little “read at 12:26am” sign pop up and time goes by without a response that my feelings start to churn. I eventually call him multiple times and get ahold of him, and I’m being the anxious, sad, over bearing, unappealing version of myself. Trying to use him to cope with the anxiety, which I feel is a quick fix and not a long term resolution. Also let it be noted I’ve been through a very bad abusive long term relationship prior to this one. 

After I called he wouldn’t speak to me &amp; kept saying I’m sitting on the couch with my friend- I’ll text you. And would hang up. (Of course he didn’t text me) And I don’t know how to put into words to him how I feel, and why I get like this.. and that all I wanted was for him to walk away for five minutes and just be sweet and caring and talk to me and say goodnight. I never know when I’m being “too much” or expecting “too much” or how to really cope with the anxiety when it comes. He repeatedly tells me to calm down when I start to get like this. And I don’t know why but when I’m anxious and someone repeatedly tells me to calm down it always makes me feel worse. Me and him have been together a little over two years so I’m started to wonder if I’ll ever be fully functioning. Or if my expectations are too high. 

The last thing he texted me was “your just finding reason to be upset. When will you see it for yourself” 
And this is how I felt : 
When will you see that people actually have mental health issues and disorders that they can’t just flip a switch over night about and one day wake up perfect and fine. I have my triggers. I can understand that you don’t have any, and you don’t feel the way I do, that you don’t experience anxiety. But that doesn’t take away from my experiences and what I go through, that doesn’t make what I go through unreal. 

AnywaYyys I typed all typed all this out and feel a little better but do sort of agree with him? I don’t want to find reasons to be upset. And I often don’t even think of reasons in the moment,  it’s more of a feeling of abandonment and fear and my body takes over. My stomach drops, my heart rate accelerates and I end up not being able to sleep.. and on reddit

962,i see people making memes about crippling depression and its so hard to believe they actually have it.,"I know memes are a good way to cope but oh my god, the way people create these memes make it sound zany and hip, as if its aesthetic or whatever. Do you know what crippling depression is? It causes you to be almost unmovable, no shower no teeth brushing, you sit there in your own sweat hating literally everything about yourself and life in general, and you want to die. There's no motivation to do anything, there's nothing. It **cripples** you.

Call me a party pooper but I don't think it's funny to make rainbow-y heehaa edits of you saying you have it or being like:""sorry, blame my crippling depression XDD"" 

Especially not those dumb tiktok videos. God, they make it seem to hip and fabulous. These are the kind of people who think folks who don't shower or have any extreme symptoms (i.e actual crippling depression) are 'dirty' or lazy.

I'm all for making jokes but this stuff treads a thin line between glamorizing and being genuine."
963,I am not doing well in quarantine,"For all the same reasons I’m sure most of us are struggling — total loss of income, my career prospects ground to a halt, and lack of contact with the outside world and a regular schedule, and physical pain issues with treatments postponed indefinitely. I didn’t realize until tonight just how bad I’m doing.

I can’t get out of bed for long stretches. Increasingly I think things like, what’s the point of doing anything, and that I’m bringing my husband down by being around me all the time. I take long naps most days just to avoid being conscious. I’m tired all the time. I don’t want to do anything I usually like to do — not painting, sculpting, writing. I barely even want to play video games. Animal Crossing is literally keeping my spirit alive through this garbage fire.

I rarely brush my hair anymore. I shower, but I have rat’s nests and just leave them. That’s what made me realize this is serious, it hit me when I realized I’ve read that neglecting basic self-care like this is textbook depression.

I average a panic attack a week so far. Usually I have maybe one a year. I take meds that have always been great at balancing me, but lately don’t feel like they’re doing anything.

I’m happy sometimes. Usually because of things my husband goes out of his way to do to cheer me up. I was happy this morning (or was it yesterday morning?) when he hauled the sofa onto the balcony and I could sit in the sun for a while. I was happy when we had a picnic in the empty park. But mostly I just wish I could go to sleep and wake up when my life can be back to normal. 

Just needed to say it somewhere."
964,The suicidal 12 year old is back!,"I’m back! If in this post you see some weird humor, it’s because I use humor and references to hide my pain :). Anyway, after that depressing thought, I’d like to share to the users of Reddit who absolutely don’t care how I’m feeling. I’m feeling worse. Yay! Whenever I start to think about any of my thoughts about my family, I start to cry. Yeah, I cry like seven times a day. Sometimes I think about what my divide letter would look like, and how I would kill myself. Why’ll I’m not fat (according to my parents) I still think about puking up my food to be skinnier. There is no one I can really talk to in my life, because they would either overreact and send me to a therapist, or not talk to me anymore because I’m that weird depressed kid. I’m super insecure of my body, wearing oversized hoodies over leggings. I’ve thought about suicide many times, but have never actually attempted to. I don’t know, maybe I should? I know I shouldn’t be throwing away my life, but I’m just so miserable I don’t know what to do. My family always relies on me. My family fights so, so, much. And I am the one that always changes the subject, always makes everybody happy. Well, for once, I just want to be happy myself, you know? I’m posting this at 2:30 am because I have nothing better to do than reflect on my self misery :). Well I think that’s the end of today’s ted talk. Stay safe everyone!-💙💙💙"

967,"Parents mean well...but man, they were most of the cause of my mental health being at risk.","27 M 

I hate when parents (with their particular type of neuroses) try to help.

If a parent actually knows and understands the actual issue that I'm going through, then hell yeah--- I'm all ears.

But while my mom means well, there are so many times when she just reacts insensitively without thinking. 

As a black person, I really feel the weight of generational trauma with my mom--- who grew up in an abusive home.

Blacks back then were dealing with Jim Crow laws and No Colored Signs. That's the world my mom grew up in.

I love her to death, but African-Americans just have really hard time understanding the nuances of mental health issues.

I know that she wants to help, and sometimes she does in her own way, but for the most part....mom only gets in the way.

I left my religious faith when I graduated college. (I was a born again Christian freshman year).

Mom tried to understand but she kept using terms like God and Jesus despite them triggering me. Everywhere in the Bible Belt felt like a trigger fest.

For personal reasons regarding pornography, I felt the need to go to a 12 step group and asked my mom (15 year sober AA) for advice. She suggested that I try one. 

I made a mistake telling her about that. I initially just sought her advice because I wanted to honor her wisdom, but all it did was cause her to worry.

I later told her, ""Hey, so...what I'm going through is not like alcoholism.""

This caused her to respect my privacy more. In reality, I stopped going to meetings. I felt like the people in the meetings were dealing with far worse stuff than I was. (All I did was watch porn and it was legal, compared to people who had compulsive problems cheating on their spouses etc, illegal stuff)

The meetings helped me, and I made some nice acquaintances...but my mom is so rigid with her AA stuff. She apparently has never relapsed.

I hear her talk to her sponsees' all the time in the harshest ways.

She means well, but man...her neurotic nature just made me go insane. 

I eventually moved out of her apartment and started going to school in another city. I love her to death, but I only take practical advice from her. I do not consider her a source for mental health advice.

At one point I was so depressed while living with her that I wanted to kill myself. (I've seen a counselor and gotten healthier since)

I always tried living up to my mom's standards and it just...drove me crazy. My sister doesn't talk to her, and while I think my sister is also nuts...she's not wrong in that my mom can be quite judgmental.

I guess I just feel better off by myself.

I get envious when I see people with their close-knit families (healthy relationships)."
968,I wish I was normal 16F,"I have sexually intrusive thoughts relating to pedophilia. I’m also scared of being sexually attracted to 15-18 year old girls. I’m 16 and sometimes I’ll fantasize about a girl who’s within the mentioned age range but then get uncomfortable. I’m scared that I’ll never grow out of this attraction because I rarely find adult women sexually attractive. I just see them as “too old” for me. The only adult woman I was sexually attracted to was Emilia Clarke, that’s all I really know. Am I being paranoid?"
969,In need of coping skills,"..To help get this negative memory out of my head. 
It's been a great few days. I've been sleeping better and eating well. Then *BAM* this memory I've blocked out for two years just resurfaced. 
Any tips on how to tackle it?"
970,I feel like people are harsh with me even though I’m very forgiving. What’s the point of being kind when nobody reciprocates it?,"This is just something I’ve had to deal with for ages, be it in person or online. One particular incident that happened to me recently was just over a game, and normally it wouldn’t be a big deal, but I’ve had to cope with this problem for so long that it just broke me this time. I told a friend a strategy I was going to do before the round started and he just ridiculed me in front of everyone and accused me of “baiting my team” even though it’s worked for me before and I didn’t intend to do that. I just caved in and did something different to appease him.

It’s not the disagreement that saddens me itself, but the way he went about making his case. I felt like he was trying to put a lot of peer pressure on me and “get the mob” against me so that I wouldn’t insist on implementing my original plan. Why did he need to do that though? Why couldn’t he just make his case in a kind manner without the accusation?

I wouldn’t feel so unhappy about this if someone, anyone called him out for his harshness. But nobody did.

I feel like I’m just firmly viewed as a pushover by others for being “too nice” and that makes it easy for them to take advantage of me. I don’t want to change my character into something fake for these people though. I’ve made people I love happy through my personality and I feel like I value that more. But it still hurts a lot. I think others view my kindness as a thin veil to mask weakness and incompetence.

I’m really bad at trash talking so I can’t exactly defend myself with that. I just don’t know what to do with myself if I keep going on like this. I don’t mean to sound pretentious with this post, I just really feel like I’m constantly getting hurt and the thought of people that hurt me getting the “last laugh” just makes my emotional pain even worse."
971,Dreading online classes,"I have to be in a conference call with people, while at the same time I’m trying to push people away. Figures."
972,Just need to let it out.,"Hey all,


The past few months have sent my mental and emotional health spiraling down the drain. January, I was perhaps as happy as I could be, but as February went on, it just went down. My own birthday just felt super depressing in late February, but I’m thankful I got to celebrate it unlike the poor March/April birthdays.

Now here we are in April. People I really care about just randomly decided to ignore me, online college is stressing me out, and I’ve been laid off from my job. I really hate to type this out, because I know there are many people out there who have it much worse than me, but I just need to let it out.

I thought I’d be fine with quarantine, what with me being a Gamer, all I ever did before was stay at home and game all day. But, ever since I got a job at 17, I simply feel bored just sitting at home doing nothing and such. Games haven’t been entertaining me like before. My daily routine has been wake up at around noon, use my phone, play games for a little, nap, and eat a meal. Sounds okay but, I just feel absolutely alone... No one really cares to talk to me and such :/,

This quarantine has really given me time to just think, and I can’t help but think that I am just a failure. I’m so unmotivated in my college work, I STILL don’t even know what I want to do for a living, and hell I’m not even making any money right now. I wouldn’t call myself suicidal, but I do at times, imagine myself in the act.. And I HATE to think that way.

Can anyone relate at all? Sorry for writing so much, and once again I do understand people have it worse. But I just had to let it out."
973,Struggling after being broken up with,"My (21F) long term partner (23M) of almost 3 years broke up with me almost a month ago now. We had just moved long distance as he went to another state to study. What's more, he broke up with me over FB messenger and then went no contact. The night before he was telling me he loved me and wanted to make it work, then all of a sudden it was 'I can't sustain a relationship over this distance for 5 years'.

I have a history of mental health issues and had been going really well for the past year. He has cut off all contact and I can't seem to find closure at all given it all happened so suddenly. I am really struggling at the moment and having difficulty finding support due to the COVID-19 situation. Thought I'd post here as I don't feel I can voice my thoughts anywhere else. I'm really not sure what to do with myself."
974,Civid 19 interfering with mental health needs,"People who are already suffering from mental health issues are really being left behind right now. I got a new psychiatrist a couple months ago and because of this pandemic I’m going through benzo withdrawal, because the offices I go to have shut down. I also haven’t been able to get a refill on my antidepressant. No one is taking new patients and I really don’t want to go to the hospital at a time like this. Many people aren’t even able to get in rehab. I’m trying to find ways to fight through this. I don’t know what to do. I’ve always done patient stays at the hospitals but where I’m at they are becoming flooded with covid 19 patients. Is anyone else running into similar issues?"
975,My mental health has gone to shit recently,"My grades are in the toilet with my college semester being online, I hate online school, being up at school better even though my health was shit uP there too. Ive switched my major 3 times after failing the introductory course. I hate going through this and having a shitty outlook on life. I hate how Im told if I don't do well in school I won't be able to be successful. Not to mention I have a shitty GPA and it will only worsen once the semester finishes up."
976,Somethings wrong with me,I’ve tried my hardest the past couple of days to cheer myself up and get in a good mood and not be pissed at the world or people. So far I’ve slightly been able to feel good for a little amount of time. Last night I lost my shit and cut again to the point where I bled. Sometimes I just feel disconnected from myself and the people around me. I’ll push people away but then I also freak out when they leave me. It always feels like theirs a voice or multiple voices in my head telling me I’m shit or I’m trash. As a bisexual person I also call myself a faggot a lot for some reason. One time when I lost it I carved faggot into my chest. Sorry for jumping around a lot I’m trying my best to stay stable rn.
977,Not sure what this is but it's a real thing I struggle with.,"I don't know how to describe this so I'll give an example. Right now, I'm watching a documentary about serial killers. I literally feel like I have just killed someone now. Like I feel like an evil person and I feel like I am the person the show is talking about. Or, I'll feel like that will be me in the future someday and I'll do what the serial killers do someday. I like put myself in their place and it scares me and gives me anxiety and I cannot even watch this fucking show without constantly thinking ""would i do that? What if i did that? Do i want to do this right Now? Do i like this type of stuff?"". I really have to limit what I watch because I just feel so much anxiety, guilt, fear, and uncertainty from watching this type of shit. Does anyone know what this could mean? I'm really scared of becoming a killer or something."
978,"Whenever I think something positive like ""I love them"" my mind automatically thinks ""I hate them""","This keeps happening. I was thinking about my cat and how much I love her, then I thought the opposite uncontrollably. There's many other examples, but I wont go that deep."
979,I feel like I'm slipping through the cracks,"why do i feel so alone? it may be that quarantine is getting to me, but this isn't the first time ive felt or dealt with this. I used to have groups and circles of people to talk with and hang, but now I feel as though I'm unable to even talk with one of what i perceived to be my best friends. They've all moved on its in part due to us going to different colleges and so on, but I have little to no daily contact with these people. I know for a fact that if I choose to keep in contact with these people I would need to be the one to start the conversation or to hang out with them. To me that seems that the efforts of hanging and conversing with these people in the first place were pointless, and I do understand its a matter of quality and not quantity. However I haven't been able to find new instances of either quality or quantity, or for that matter of fact any of these instances with my current ""friends."" I feel as though day by day I'm slipping through these cracks and losing touch with who I once was in relation to these people. I'm overcome with feelings of dread in these situations when I'm all alone with no outing, no resources for help, and no idea in where to even start. I know that I am not doomed to this feeling and it doesn't define me and that at any moment in time change can strike and it is a matter of how we as humans can adapt. With all that being said I still feel hurt, I still need someone to talk to, is there anyway for me to be able to make these friends and be distracted, I don't want to continue suffering like this. I just want to have enough friends who care enough to talk with me and make sure I'm doing alright as I have tried in the past to make sure my friends were. I know I don't have to keep suffering I just need a little help."
980,"Sorry I have to say something, this just happened today idk how to feel","Possible TW?? 

Ok, so me my mom and dad went to get my stuff out of my dorm at my college tonight. We wore protective glasses, goggles, and face masks. And then we got home ...

My dad has been freaking out, and not like in an anxiety. He has been yelling at us about cross contamination and arranged the garage to where you could only walk in certain spots without your shoes on?

Anyway my mom forgot and walked through the garage with her shoes on and he FLIPPED. She started laughing bc she laughs at everything (y'know how in Joker he had the condition. Think similar to that but way less severe). He started screaming and swearing at her in front of me - nothing unusual Unfortunately.

Then my mom goes inside and it's just me and him. And he tells me we cant bring our clothes in the house. So he tells me to take them off (I could still keep my underwear luckily). But he was still in there with me so I was like ""Uh... ok? Can you turn around and not look?"" So he did and it was like fine?

But then he turns around and sees I have my phone in my hand. He comes over to me and I tell him to stop looking, to which he says he isn't. And I dont think he was looking in... that way, but he still had to look at me to talk to me and stuff. He then grabs my phone and puts it on one of the carpeted spots in the garage to sanitize it. He tells me to go straight inside and shower.

And, ok honestly? Nothing really happened, he didnt touch me or sah anything but... I felt so disgusted and violated. I almost had a panic attack and started crying in the shower. I told my mom and she just said it was weird but not to worry because my dad is going through one of his ""cycles"". (We are almost positive he has bipolar or something. He goes through times when he is super happy and nice, then he'll be moody and scream at everyone). Idk what to do I know it could have been worse b I just feel so disturbed."
981,Does it ever get better?,My brother died a few months ago and it was very traumatic. I’m feeling very suicidal but I know I won’t do it because I can’t put my family through that again. So I just have to live with it forever. I hate every single part of my life now. I keep seeing him dead. I am going to trauma therapy but it is very expensive and I can’t go as often as I need to because we can’t afford it. There is nothing more that I could look forward to. I want this to be over.
982,I find it difficult to concentrate and sometimes I am acting sub consciously without even thinking. I am also having trouble in processing or understanding things. Is it normal?,I am 19 years old (M)
983,Could I Be Schizophrenic?,Okay so now 10 years now I have been talking to myself. I’ve been doing it since I was 8 and now I’m 17. I have full blown conversation for hours upon hours to myself. But I have a twist to this! I have a spare phone with pictures of characters of my favorite anime or show and I converse with them as if they were real. I’ve gotten to the point I don’t want to talk to friends sometimes. Wherever I go the phone will go. I knew it was weird for me to do that. So I deleted the pictures for the new year of 2020. I got lonely and downloaded all of them again. I know my mom is schizophrenic and bipolar. Is it possible I could get symptoms of it because it seems to run in the family? (I started responding back to myself lately and I’m pretty paranoid. Please help. I don’t think my guardian can afford therapy and junk. Is it possible I could help myself?)
984,HELP NEEDED IM REALLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS,"I woke up to these texts from my bff

""Life is shit
It's completely pointless

If I'm gonna get hurt again what's the point
Only bad things happen""

HELP PLEASE WHAT SHOULD I TELL HIM"
985,Need help,"So I (25F) have anger management problem. Whenever I am angry, I tend to lash out or verbally abuse (no, I don't use slangs) my partner without thinking anything. Of course I don't mean any of them. I have said some hurtful things to him like ""you manipulate me"" or ""you just don't want to be with me"" or ""you use me"" or "" if you think yourself so good why you don't have any friends"" etc etc. No, he doesn't do any of them. He is really a sweetheart. He is very understanding and loves me a lot that's why even though he is hurt, he never disrespected me over this matter but of course it's a concern. I don't think my anger problem is good for this relationship or his mental health. I even decided that from now on whenever we will have an argument I will definitely think before saying anything but to my surprise I failed three times in a row and I seriously don't know what to do. Please help."
986,Just when I mustered the strength to tell my parents,"Hello all, 

I’ve been noticing my behavior lately and it was basically this; I get fidgety around people, I don’t talk to no one, talking literally makes me feels sick to my stomach, I can’t answer the phone, I can’t go outside for a long time because I think people are looking at me, I don’t like attention or else I start to feel sick, before school re opens I vomit the night before every single time, when I do talk, I feel dizzy and my palms gets sweaty. In public I’m always on edge because again I think people are judging every little thing I do. 

I decided to google what I’ve been going through and found out—

(Before I continue, I know self diagnosis is not health but I was desperate at the time.)

That I may have an anxiety disorder. 

I grew up in a black family so you could imagine when I told my mother that I want to go to a therapist, just to make sure that nothing is wrong with me. But all I got was to pray and trust in god and it’ll go away. Now I was pissed at first but I took her word for it and the next few weeks, my sister sent me to order something but I couldn’t because that mental block and sick feeling came back. I tried to explain to my sister what was happening to me but she told me it’s fake and it’s all in my head ( a phase I’ll get through soon she said)

Now I don’t know what to do, I’m starting to get these really negative thoughts and whatever happening to me isn’t going away. Any advice?"
987,You're allowed to express emotions even in trying times.,"Even if the world is crumbling due to covid, even if you're not in the epicenter. Even if you're not a front liner, even if you get to stay at home, even if you Dont personally know anyone dying. you have the rights to express your emotions, tell people about your problems. Well. Perhaps not to an ER nurse (but if he/she doesn't mind, then why not?).

I know people whose default response is ""	at least youre not on the front lines"" or ""at least you haven't lost a family"" whenever anyone bring up ANY issues.

Sure. They have it worse than us. That doesn't mean we can't share about our own challenges?

Well. What triggered this thought was in a group chat, someone said ""time flies. It's already April"" and I said ""April is gonna feel slow"" because my country entered a half lock down.

And some self righteous person started his tirade of ""well at least you get to stay at home. You're fortunate enough so stop complaining""

All because I said April is gonna feel slow."
988,I’m experiencing new emotions,"I don’t know if I’m overly stressed or if I’m just reaching my breaking point but everything makes me sad. I’m talking to a girl and she asked on her Snapchat story for people to hit her up and I almost had a breakdown. And anytime I think of the slightest thought of just anything negative I feel completely useless. I had a horrible dream not to long ago and it messed with how I felt the entire day and for some time that morning couldn’t tell if it was real or not. And I feel like I’m just straight up losing my mind. I don’t know what to do. My anxiety is skyrocketing,my emotions are unstable, and I’m unsure about my mentality."
989,How would I talk to someone about them threatening suicide almost every time they are upset?,"I know it's just an empty threat most of the time but it's so extreme. I don't like hearing it. It's nerve wracking. The context it's used in by this person is a form of manipulation so I don't know how to go about it. But it's still concerning overall. They've taught me not to do the same because I know the stress it brings when those words are said. This person should know better afterall too. It's just very hard to talk to them knowing that something could upset them to the point that they feel the need to say that. I've been meaning to address this person about it but don't particularly like the idea of them taking this as they need to do this action. I just want them to know that they really shouldn't say that when they are upset at something. Yes it does get everyone's attention but not in the right way. I just want this person to stop saying that, it just leaves everyone on edge and makes the atmosphere uneasy and makes it feel like no one can talk. 

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you for reading."
990,Am I a bad person?,"I've been dealing with negative self destructing thoughts for about 10 years. My way of coping with emotions is burying them deep inside. On a daily basis I walk wearing a mask of ""I'm fine"", while on the inside I'm boiling with rage, desperation, sadness, hopelessness, fury, anger, pain. It takes a lot of energy to deal with myself, leaving me drained of energy to care for myself or others, in the past years a reocurring thought comes to me of wanting every person of this planet to get in my shoes and live with my feelings and thoughts so they would suffer as bad as I am, so they would be miserable, have no dreams or anything to look forward to therefore not being able to see themselves in future, not having desires except for one that it would all end in the fastest possible way, so that they would feel the agony and feel helpless, hopeless that it will ever end. I really deeply want people to suffer in such a way, I want everyone to have their dreams and hopes taken away, that they would be hollow vessels, just getting by through another pointless day or event. Does that make me a bad person?"
991,Depressed &amp; Anxious In Quarantine? (A Message For You),"What is going on in the world right is now crazy. This is a new thing and everyone is uncertain about how all this is gonna plan out.

There will be people out here that were already suffering with mental health issues before this outbreak. So all this pandemic will add fuel to the fire.

I just want you to know now that this lockdown is a opportunity to get to know yourself and understand your feelings. 

* Spend time meditating to calm your overthinking mind 
* Plan your day to keep busy so you won’t get distracted in negative thought 
* STOP USING SOCIAL MEDIA and keep the messenger apps so you can still contact people 
* Learn something new everyday ANYTHING I learnt how to solve Rubik’s Cube, Juggle Clubs and also been reading some great books
* Perform some aerobic exercise and go for a run
* Have a book and write down your emotions and also right down your dreams and goals (you may not have any but write down things you enjoy and passionate about)
* Listen to motivational podcasts and videos 

I use the suffer with depression and anxiety attacks and this helped me MASSIVELY.

If I would ask you to study one thing it would be Neuroplasticity. Understanding how the brain worked made me realise how I could fix my mental health problems (Mindset is the best medicine) 

There is a way out from all this depression and anxiety but you got to be taking the actions to make this happen. It won’t happen over night. But if your spend 1% of your day doing something that will have a positive affect on your mindset you will sooner or later see great results! It worked for me.

I really hope everyone stays strong during this time of crisis, it will be over sooner or later. But take this opportunity of lockdown to learn, grow, and be better.

Take care everyone"
992,Lost myself,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, first time, and it seems strange to be posting something like this. I don’t know if anyone will read it or care but at some point I just need to verbalize what I’m feeling. I’ve always been quiet and reserved, since I was a kid, but around my sophmore year of high school things started to change, people acknowledged who I was, I always knew I was a funny kid but other people started seeing it too. I hit puberty hard, I wasn’t a short skinny kid anymore, I was attractive, and people started seeing that too. I joined new friend groups, life was amazing, and when I got to my junior year things got even better. I had a way of talking to people, I was always happy, funny, quick witted, I could talk to anyone and laugh with anyone. It was never a defense mechanism, I was just so happy to be happy. I made new friends, friends I could talk to about how I felt, and yet still laugh with unconditionally, it was real and for the first time in my life I was the man. Flashback a year forward and many of them have gone to college, I started getting high more often and it pushed me away from what I was, happy go lucky, not worrying about what people thought, and free. I’ve stopped since then, it’s been almost 6 months and yet I’m not happy anymore, conversations with my best friends in the world are taxed by my own insecurities that seem to come from no where. It gets harder and harder as I search for an answer that doesn’t seem to even really exist. I don’t know how to be myself again, I don’t know how to be the happy go lucky, free, confident person I once was. I’ve never been depressed before but for the past few months I think I have been, I know I can be that same person I just don’t know how to get there. Thanks for listening if you did, hopefully some people can understand, but if not thank you for reading anyway."
993,Stop trying to be nice to people like this.,"I have been pretty skinny a few years back. But now that I’ve finally started adulthood, I’ve become more on the chubbier side. But I love this version of myself! But I have friends who are constantly saying, you should lose weight. You’ll look nicer. Why? They say it’s for your good. It’s not good to have that much weight on your body. 
Now the thing is, I know I’m not the only one who faces this. Family, friends, boyfriends, girlfriends, I’m sure many of them have people like this who try to be ”nice” in this way. Saying they are worried about your weight when all they are trying to do it shaming you in a nice way.
And no matter how happy I am with my body, their negative comments make me feel very bad and insecure. I’ve been a victim of body shaming and verbal sexual abuse. I still try to be positive about my body. And I hope everyone out there going through this same type of shit will smack on those people's faces and say ”I love myself the way I am.” Because no matter what they say, It’s me who is there to love myself truly. I’m sorry if this post makes no sense. I just wanted to share how I feel in these situations and this subreddit felt like the right place."

996,In patient facility for Borderline Personality Disorder to help keeping a job?,"Hi everyone,

God knows if I have BPD or not, even the doctors can't tell. But I have had trouble keeping a job. I finally got a job after 1 year of searching, and it hasn't started yet.

In the past year I have wanted desperately to go to an in-patient facility, any advice on good ones that teach practical skills I can bring to my new job? I know I need to work very hard, but I need something to work with first."
997,My girlfriend has dissociated and doesn't remember me.,"So basically the title says it all. My girlfriend (whom I haven't seen in about three weeks because of the Coronavirus) has woken up this morning and doesn't remember much of anything from the past couple of months. We've not been dating all that long but we both confessed very strong feelings for eachother and both said we could happily spend the rest of our lives together. 

From what I can tell, she's heavily dissasociated. So my question is, what do I do? She's read through our messages ect and understands that we're going out but she said she doesn't remember any of her feelings towards me or ever seeing or speaking to me. The last thing she remembers is going around to her friend's house and I'm not sure when that was but she hasn't left the house since the lockdown began (UK) so it was a fair while ago, she didn't even remember anything about the lockdown or the Corona virus at first.

So far I've just been trying to remind her of key points and conversations in our relationship that I think would matter the most and then just telling her things about me and things that she said she likes about me and visa versa with the things I like about her.

Nothing I have said so far has worked and I'm on the verge of breaking down. I don't know how to help her and it's killing me. Not only that but I feel like such a dick because there is a little part of me the in back of my mind going ""she's making it all up, she just doesn't love you"" and I hate that I could ever even think that way about a situation like this or about her in general.

I guess basically I just needed to vent and ask for advice? Or if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation? Or if any of this is even possible? Or if I'm just being taken for a chump?

I'm sorry to make this such a huge read and futhermore I'm sorry if I've spread any misinformation or offended anyone in similar situations by insinuating she might be making it up, I'm just freaking out heavily and have no idea how to handle the situation. Thankyou in advance for anyone who takes the time to read this and or give their feedback."

999,I am confused,A big source of my confusion is the fact that the guy who sexually abused me when I was 12 spent 99% of the day being nice to me. Before he did it he was nice and after he did it he was nice. He acted like nothing had happened. And while he was doing it he was smiling at me. I don’t what it means but it’s really confusing.
1000,Ibhave lost 2 pets during quarantine,"Go to the bottom if you want a summary of this long story.

Ive had a cat named Ronan and a guinea pig named Jesse they were very close to me. So on March 11 my cat was hiding from me and my family in the bathroom, he was very quiet, cats hide from thier owners when they feel like they are about to die. So on the next day my cat started to seem better since he went up the stairs and stayed on his favourite spots, I thought it would be fine since he looked much better, But the next day, March 13, he died. I didnt get to say goodbye. We touched his stomach and it was very hard so my mom said he must've died of gastric cancer (stomach cancer). We were very sad for the rest of the day, we wept silently, it was hard for me since I still had to go to school and pretend nothing  has happened. Ironically I had a great day, the teachers were barely there so we used our phone like we were home, somebody brought a whole wifi router, and some grade was holding some sort of indoor carnival but you actually win something, we even watched a movie. My Guinea pig named Jesse he was the sweetest guinea pig, he lived for 3 years, so I got very attached to him unlike my cat who lived for 7 months. So on April 5, I woke up and went to see Jesse, well he was lying on his side which was very unusual, so I gave him carrots, but he wouldnt eat. So I knew somethings off. You may be thinking, I should bring him to the vet, but unfortunetly its quarantine I dont think vets are not working, even if vets were working, they wouldnt know how to treat my guinea pig due to the country we live in. So all I could do was give him food and water. 4 o' clock he was walking around in circles since most of the day he was lying down on its side, so i got a bit of confidence he will live. But 6 o' clock he stopped walking and stared just lying down on its side, his eyes were closing so I tried waking him up so it worked. After Dinner he was on his deathbed. His life was fading away, I comforted him by petting him, he seemed happy but was still dying. The most heartbreaking thing was he had a heart attack and was reaching for me I cried. For me he was saying that he loves me too. We buried both of them next to each other. Now what do I do? Im lost in sadness. Any advice to overcome both of thier deaths?

How do i overcome the death of two pets that I love?"
1001,"my dad said ""she will change, she will change eventually""","Yeah, I'll change when I finally leave the fucking house and get myself the help I need because counselors can't CBT or anything that might actually fucking helping me, damn. I don't think my dad knows I want to kill myself again, but my mom sure as hell does and she just brushed it off. She said you have no problems, and I know that was to count my blessings, but my guy, I do have a problem, my brain is trying to kill me and I even look at cans now and think about how I can make them sharp to cut myself. Like seriously, I need fucking mental help asap..."
1002,Sometimes I wish I died last summer,"I had surgery last summer because my shunt stopped working, causing fluid to build up around my brain. Exactly a week after, I packed and moved all of my stuff by myself to a new city to live with my now ex girlfriend of 3 and a half years despite still being in major pain from my surgery. About three weeks after that, she packed all of her shit and left without saying a fucking word while I was at work. Blocked me on everything and just vanished. It took a little bit, but I got over it. Or maybe I just tell myself that. Anyways fast forward a few months, I meet another girl who I believe is the most perfect thing in this entire universe. We’ve been dating for 3 months now, but tonight she told me it doesn’t feel right. She wants to leave me. I begged and pleaded for her to change her mind, but it still seems like she’s going to go through with it. I drove an hour to where she lives and I’m currently sitting in the parking lot of her apartment complex because she fell asleep and won’t answer my phone calls. So now I’m just sitting here thinking, alone with my thoughts. Telling myself that coming here was just a waste of time, and that I always care way too much just to end up getting hurt in the end. I just want to be fucking loved the way that I show it, you know? I’ve put everything that I have into this relationship for the past three months because I swear to god I love this girl more than I have ever loved anybody else. Now I’m just thinking it was all for nothing. Sometimes I think things would be better off if I just fucking died last summer. Or maybe when my tumor was first discovered. I just wish I didn’t have to go through all of this fucking pain and heartbreak. I wish everything would just end so that I can’t feel anything anymore. I put so much fucking effort into things. I just wish somebody would put that same effort into me. I’ve never felt like I wanted to die before, but right now it seems like it would be a good thing. Especially with everything going on in the world right now."
1003,I get very angry in the morning and take it out on my boyfriend. How do I stop this?,I get angry normally when I take a shower in the morning. My negative thoughts take over and I end up yelling at my boyfriend while he’s sleeping and wake him up. I know it’s wrong and idk how to stop it.
1004,Feeling lost and slightly hopeless,"I feel like I have no one to talk to. I have friends but we aren’t close enough to talk about my really serious  and depressing issues. My parents always say that I can talk to them, but I honestly feel like they’ll be scared if I tell them what’s really going on. I feel like I keep on dumping all my problems on my boyfriend and it’s not fair. Plus I have no one to vent to when he’s the problem... I just wish I could vent and get all my feelings out. I know therapy is a thing but I don’t have the money for it and my medical aid doesn’t support therapy sessions. I don’t know if I’m sounding needy, but I just feel lost and slightly hopeless. I’ve been in a dark place before and I’m scared I’m going down the same road. Any advice on which direction I can turn to?"
1005,Should I seek help?,"Ok this post will be an in depth look at my mental health over the last year and a half or so. About a year and a half ago I was extremely depressed as a result of loosing an extreme amount of weight for wrestling. I didn’t feel happiness for about 3 months or so and eventually became suicidal. The day before the qualifier for the most important tournament of my season I had the worst cut of the entire season. While I was running on the treadmill I thought “if I just let my legs give in and hit my head off the track of the this then my parents would surely stop this” I didn’t and ended up going to bed that night. I was in such great pain I went to stand up and use a knife I had in my room to kill myself. Luckily for me my leg cramped up and I couldn’t move until morning. I ended missing weight the next day and just started eating to cope. After growing 2 inches and lifting for an entire year I still don’t weigh as much as I did during that period. I just felt so bad about myself. Eventually, alone, I got through it and felt happy to be me again. 

But right before school started my mom gave me a talk on how school is going to be more important than it was last year and I that I’m only going to be allowed to play video games and go out with friends on the weekend. I was a mostly As some Bs student as well. But I broke I went up to my room and cried for at least an hour and a half. I’m normally so calm and collected but I felt powerless. That same feeling came up again in December where after going from school to practice to an outdoor concert I felt overwhelmed and was ready to cry at the concert. I would have stuff like that happen later in December and February. Earlier this month I was on call with my girlfriend when I got text messages from my dad ‘trying’ to motivate me to lift more I told stuff like “you should be done g at least double your body weight” and “Look at this kid doing 350 lbs” and he has said stuff like this before and normally I would get mad but that day I just started crying out of nowhere and I didn’t feel the same the rest of the night. Now this is when I realized this might be serious. Two days ago out of nowhere on call with my girlfriend I just got sad. No reason to my sadness but I went from my happy self to wanting to lay in bed the rest of the night. I listened to music and felt a little better but later that night I had a complete breakdown. I was crying for 20 minutes, I had full body twitching, and didn’t know what caused any of it. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend who helped me with some things to help calm me that she learned from Therapy as a result of her depression and anxiety I don’t know what I would have done. Yesterday I had that same feeling of sadness and ended up going the entire day until about 8:30 without eating anything. I had another breakdown of sorts which wasn’t nearly as bad and I eventually was able to fall asleep for a nap and woke up feeling 100 times better. It’s been two days since the original incident and my body still twitches every 30 seconds or so. It’s usually just like a back muscles or a knee or hand so never major but it worries me that it’s still happening. My girlfriend and I believe it might be an result of anxiety. I told her that if I had another breakdown like that I would talk to my parents about seeking medical help but I that was two said before yesterday’s events. Does it seem like anxiety? Should I seek help or do I make sure it is not just a one time situation? All replies help, thank you!
I live in the US as well

TL:DR I have had some mental breakdowns of sorts over the past 6 months possibly linked to a depressed period from about a year ago. It got bad two days ago and I am wondering if I should seek advice"
1006,Everyone I Know Goes Away in the End,"And that's okay, y'know?

I mean, the whole 'you're not alone' thing is bullshit. Some of us aren't good enough. At best, we're useful. Why? Eggplant. No really, some of us lack that charisma, that thing that makes people interested in us, notice us, want to talk to us. We're invisible.

I know that because I know such invisible people too, and I also don't have the emotional capacity for that they need. And that's okay. That's life. You have to accept it, and wonder all around the valley on your own. Be kind to others, but keep your walls up. 

These words hurt. Don't say 'you're important to me' or whatever. Constant rejection is a sign something is wrong with me, and you're not an outlier. You just lie to yourself and me.

Please, stop the 'you're not alone' bullshit. It's more hurtful than you think."
1007,Floaty brain post,"I feel like my mind is in a body of water, like each little piece of it drifts around and rearranges itself into different combinations of emotions and identity and stuff but then sometimes all the parts drift away from each other until I don’t know who I am or if I am even real. 

There is no point to this post I am sorry, I am just floating around in my thoughts right now and this analogy keeps repeating in my head. I hope this kind of post is ok"
1008,28 and my family &amp; spouse are now adamant I have ADHD....,"Hey all,

This is literally my first post on reddit...

There is a reason behind it as well, due to recent quarantine/isolation apparently I have exhibited more noticeable symptoms, coupled with my brother being recently diagnosed - my parents have used the criteria that was used to diagnose him, and applied it to me - coupled with the input of my other half... and its been thought provoking, and the reason's they seem to believe I may have ADHD is because.

When i got ""sat down"" over face time, these were some of the reasons/things they listed.

\-I'm very impulsive, e.g end of last year bought $70,000 car without much thought because I liked it.  
6 weeks ago, I bought home a new puppy, after we already had 2 dogs.  
\-I have issues completing tasks once I've formulated an idea/plan - I wanted to go back to studying so I spent $700 on a course to take A-level biology... I haven't even begun yet, as I'm no thinking about progressing my finance career instead.  
I am also currently doing a CiPD qualification, but it bores me and has taken a back burner.. but ultimately I know that little bit of paper will be valuable.  
I cant watch TV or a movie without doing something else or being on my phone, if it doesn't get my interest in the first 5/10 minutes I switch off, very much when having conversations with people.  
I cant watch how to videos - I always end up skipping to the end product...  
If i'm watching a video on you tube/Facebook and an add pops up, I just go on to the next.  
I always do enough just to get by and I leave things to the absolute last minute.  
I'm smart but my teachers always just said they wished I had applied myself, If i got a C in an exam.. i was very much like I'll get an A next time and bring it to an average of a B.  
I wanted to learn another language, I downloaded the duo lingo app and paid 1 yr subscription - not used it in 2 months...  
I have great ideas, with massive potential but never follow them through - business orientated.  
I'm restless and wont finish 1 task before i get distracted by another, apparently a prime example is cleaning the house... I'll start filling the dishwasher and then notice the windows are dirty, and get to work on them before I've finished the first task.  
I have strong foundational knowledge on a lot of subjects, but nothing of any true substance.. ""this one hurt fyi""

The reason this has come out, as in being in quarantine and having to work from home - I'm finding it near impossible... When I'm at work, i get nudges from colleagues to put me back on the right track, but take that out of the equation and its madness.

I can't even get a Dr's appointment to follow this up atm, due to recent lockdown - this isn't considered an emergency and it's now began to concern me... what should I do, whats the next steps? how do I go about potentially identifying/tackling this? I'm currently based in the UK.

Thanks in advance guys &amp; girls."
1009,Stigmas come in all shapes and sizes,"So lately I have been sharing my opinion here and have gotten quite a good response with having civilised discussion. 

Something else that I have noticed which might get some bad responses if I dont address it well.I do apologise in advance 

I have noticed this with parents and their kids that have some sort of metal disorder on the neurological side usually autism (spectrum disorder) And A.D.H.D.

I do need to emphasize that this isnt for everyone this just a part of people that I have seen and heard of lately. by no means am I wanting to shame or start an argument I'm just sharing this opinion.

These parents have children who let's say suffer from Autism or something else that's neurological (mild or severe) 

These parents are not shaming their children which is great and some actually praise them and say the wouldn't have it any other way.

 But instead I feel that they still have a stigma of some sort due to the fact that they always have to say that,

• Their kids are capable of doing things just like everyone else. 

(And most kids cant and they end up feeling like they have to stress themselves out to reach that goal to prove they are just like everyone else. Most kids are mild and can live but have areas where they need help or cant achieve and thats okay.)

 I feel that these parents deep down have a huge stigma towards their kids and they dont want to accept that their child has an issue especially if its not so bad.

• There are parnets who dont feel that their kids have a problem and that they are just different. But then they always want all the special needs and medicine. 
but again they keep saying they have no issue 

( here I see another stigma due to the fact they dont want to admit their child had a problem) 

• Then there are other parents who dont want their children to get help or any special attention.Because, just like the rest of the points I have  mentioned they see that their children are just like everyone else.

 (again that's a stigma because you dont want to admit it they have an issue and might need some help that they deserve also with this trying to prove to the world that they are the same, in previous post I stated how it's okay to be different and let's say you suffer from something the goal to recover or cope isnt to be like everybody else it's to be at peace  ) 

If you seen my last two post I stated how a disorder does not define you and also stated how that there is a difference between changing a person and helping a person. 

They do have a stigma because they dont want to know the struggles of having a problem.

They feel that if you hate your disorder or are finding it hard to cope it must be because of the stigma we have. and you need more awarness.

I have seen this within mental health awareness campaigns were disorder are always talked about in a positive way to not scare the people suffering with them and the other people. 

Were people have been shamed for wanting to get better because that proves they have stigma when it's not.  

Again I hope you get what I mean if you disagree I am all for having a civilised discussion but no hate so keep scrolling by but again would love to read your opinion."
1010,Anyone seeing therapist?,Has anyone continued seeing their therapist in person while everything is going on or have you used phone appointments?
1011,Why am I like this when drunk? Is this normal?,"This doesn't happen every time but very often when I am drunk I feel like I am mentally in a terrible place. I start getting emotional and weirdly paranoid. I start getting bad ideas in my head about people in my life. For example last night I somehow got this idea in my head that my grandmother, who I have seen the previous day, is fake and not honest with me. I get the same idea but about a different person every time. I start thinking that everyone is dishonest with me and taking me for a fool. I also feel like others are manipulative with their own agendas and don't care what I want in my life. I also start thinking terrible things about people in my life and get very angry. I have never been violent towards others when I am drunk, but sometimes I start raging and throwing things around me. I have never hurt anyone though. I am not aggressive towards people. But I get extremely angry and I want to lash out at others. I wonder if this is because I am repressing anger in everyday life so when I get drunk it all comes out. I also have OCD and social anxiety and a lot of guilt when thinking negative about other people so I always suppress standing up for myself and criticising others. But when I get drunk it's completely opposite lol. I know I shouldn't get so drunk especially when I know it has such a negative effect on me but I wanted to know what causes this, since most people don't act this way when drunk. 

TL;DR I get very angry at people in my life when I get drunk and I wonder why"

1013,I know I’m not the only one feeling lonely and fighting against my mental health issues...,"This is an attempt to vent and reach out for others who may be dealing with similar issues... 

I’ve been in a recovery program for a couple years now. I’ve suffered with a severe case of bulimia for 15+ years, alcoholism and substance abuse for 13 years, and a mood disorder for a similar length of time. I also work in a counseling position and am studying to get my LCSW someday so I can hopefully help others who have battled similar issues (Eating disorders seem so under treated in our communities so I think that would be especially fulfilling). I had a spiritual shift a couple years back and it brought me this beautiful sense of self-compassion and hope that allowed me to break free from the intense cycle I had been stuck in for years.. however the addiction ended up shifting over to a relationship that within the past few days has come to an end for the foreseeable future. Meetings are all online now and for some reason it’s just not the same... my sponsor has too much on her plate and I haven’t seen her in weeks... I’ve become so anxious from this pandemic and the insinuations from my ex that I’m not making attempts to look good and have put on some weight... that I relapsed into my ED very, very hard. I’ve been stuck back in the cycle for a couple weeks now... and one day was feeling so suicidal that I finally turned to kava for relief. Now I’m drinking kava, feeling guilty because it’s a taboo in the sober community although it is providing me with some comfort, feeling isolated, ashamed because I’m in a position at work where my job is to guide people in recovery, and single as fuuu. I just have so much resentment against the idea of complete abstinence from mood or mind-altering substances... I just don’t know if I could attain that again... maybe I can, but it seems like such an abstract concept from this vantage point. I’m just in a low at the moment, I know this too shall pass. Hope everyone is doing what they can to keep themselves in a good place mentally and spiritually ❤️"
1014,Am I Crazy,I recently found myself only attracted to crazy people. People who could murder me at the drop of a hat. I’m in some way addicted to mental and physical abuse. help!!
1015,Desire for self destruction,"I've been suffering from depression since about 2012 2013. I've been seeing a therapist for about 2 months in 2019, which was probably the worst period in my life. I dropped the therapy because I was feeling a lot better due to me finally taking care of myself. I have cut ties with most of the people I knew except for my football team, and I started working out to get better at football and prepare to join the military. At that time I was feeling really well, and I was also busy. After the summer brake I started college where I have met my girlfriend. Even though I only knew her for a few months(she also had a boyfriend at that time) I decided not to give up when she said she can't be with me even tho she wants it as much as I do. Now we are together, planning to switch to other university I know what I wanna do in life and everything seems to be going fine yet I still tend to feel down, ofc I worry about things but I control that feeling, it's hard to describe the problem, sometimes it feels like I just choose or want to be depressed and I'm only looking for a reason, maybe it's just an excuse to be unproductive. I feel like I'm sabotaging my own life, like I'm desperate to feel the sorrow."
1016,Should i seek help?,"i’ve dealt with a feeling of sadness and melancholy for four months now. it’s taken a lot out of me. i haven’t been able to bring myself to text my girlfriend. i keep thinking to myself i can’t be depressed because there are people out there dealing with much worse stuff and my problems are so small and insignificant to theirs i should just be able to deal with everything i have by myself and i did for a long time but it’s hard and it’s getting harder. i self harmed, small cuts on my hand. i don’t know if i’m worthy to get health because someone who needs it more should be able to get it. i don’t know why i’m like this."
1017,What are safe things to think about / fantasize about to calm yourself in a fearful/stressed/panic moment?,"Dorothy told herself ""There's no place like home"" in wizard of Oz 

Fantasizing about being back with a girl you liked in my experience hasn't been a good idea for me- it has a depression rebound effect when you remember she is no longer here. 

Anthony Bourdain talked about he would sometimes fantasize about killing himself to help calm himself down ( I believe he imagined jumping off of a building)

1018,Advice for my boyfriend who has been going through depression,Hi everyone! I come to you guys because I need help and I want to help my boyfriend (male 21)whom I love very much. He is very much into philosophy and is always on YouTube listening to debates or reading philosophical material. He has been feeling very depressed lately due to a lot of factors and the more he gets into philosophy the more he learns about himself and the world the more depressing it is to the point where living doesn’t have much of a purpose anymore. He is perfectly functional and overall he’s a very outgoing always happy personality kind of person but there’s days where he’s just extremely down and would rather not exist or just be alone in the world. I have suggested a therapist but he feels that it won’t help because he is afraid their response is “that’s just the way the world works as shitty and depressing as it is and we can’t do shit about that”. I am trying to be very supportive because I know he has some points when we speak certain topics and how there’s some things that is just very depressing when u are exposed to the reality of things but I want to know if there is such a thing as a philosopher/therapist duo or a book or some philosopher he can search that has a positive outlook on life. He has been reading a lot on moral impediment and the more and more he educates himself the less he has the want to try or feel like there is any reason to live and this life is just suffering. Idk what to say or how to help at times other than just trying to be positive. I want there to be someone he can talk to or listen or read on. Any advice could help

My mother also abused me mentally more often than physically as well as most of my family seemingly being against me at every turn. I've always hated school because it made me incredibly anxious and depressed as well as providing unneeded stressors.

I currently live with my girlfriend of 3 years however I dont work because I cant leave our apartment without feeling extremely afraid,like a sudden burst of overwhelming anxiety and dread.

I never think I've suffered through enough and feel like I'm just weak minded because everyone has a hard life one way or another so what makes my life so bad.

1025,I don't feel as if I'm entitled to how I feel.,"To give some context I am a 19 year old male.I've always been very depressed,anxious and I've also had suicidal tendencies since I was about 10 years old. I've never met my father and my mother always had rotating boyfriends the only one that stayed around is the father of my two siblings and he abused me. My mother also abused me mentally more often than physically as well as most of my family seemingly being against me at every turn. I've always hated school because it made me incredibly anxious and depressed as well as providing unneeded stressors. For as long as I can remember I have had a problem with my appearance,realistically I'm not terrible looking but I always think I am especially when I smile. I have always played a lot of video games and most of my friends I have now I met through video games.

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder,anxiety disorder and suicidal tendencies but I always feel like I am just weak or lazy.

I've experienced many different situations in life that have really molded me into who I am such as facing the threat of being kicked out of my home by my mother since I was 14 years old,being falsely accused of rape when I was 16 years old and many years of abuse mentally and physically at the hands of close family and friends.

I currently live with my girlfriend of 3 years however I dont work because I cant leave our apartment without feeling extremely afraid,like a sudden burst of overwhelming anxiety and dread. I know nothing bad will happen if I leave but my body is simply afraid and I feel horrible about the fact that I dont provide any kind of financial support to help her and essentially just sit at home all day doing nothing.
I know a lot of people will judge me for that and I understand why but to me it's that or essentially death or that's how it seems to me at least. I wish I could help her but I can't and I feel horrible about it despite her saying that it's fine. 

I never think I've suffered through enough and feel like I'm just weak minded because everyone has a hard life one way or another so what makes my life so bad. I feel like I'm just faking all of it and that subconsciously I'm screwing my girlfriend over just because I'm lazy and dont want to work.

1031,How long do manic episodes last?,"My fiance is bi polar and on medication, he messed up a few days of his meds and started having exatreamly manic episodes worse than anything I've ever seen aka I am god, talking to and as his dead father as well as they grays aka aliens. He does come back to me normally before sleep but falls asleep fast because he exsausted his body but he just wakes up in the morning manic again. My question, if anyone has ever had a loved one with something similar...how long will it last? Also he is now taking abilify because of the episodes, it's been like a week now and he has been on his meds steady for I'd say 3 days. He is not agressive and I am not leaving his side unless he tries to hurt us, but he hasn't so I'm not worried. Sorry for being all over the place, this has never happened and I'm just trying to help the situation...so any advice is welcomed and appreciated To add: his other meds are paxel and lexapro if that matters at all."
1032,Working from home is sending my anxiety through the roof,"I work as a construction manager for an essential service, telecomm construction, weve been hooking up doctors offices and home offices with fibre to allow people to work from home, so I understand why were considered ""essential"". 

All the clerical staff have been working from home for 2 weeks at least, and our technicians arent allowed in the office, everyone goes straight to job sites and I meet them on site.

My wife is about 9 months pregnant, and our doctors had expressed concerns with me still working, and have told us if I don't pass their screening I wont be allowed in the delivery room. My boss and company have been unbelievably supportive and have allowed me to work from home until the baby comes so that I dont risk missing the birth of my first child. 

I know I should be happy and thankful that I'm being taken care of by my company, but instead my anxiety is through the roof. I feel guilty that my employees have to go in while I'm sitting at home. I feel like the other managers who still have to work will hate me for getting special treatment (they wont, they're awesome people, but my brain doesnt seem to realize this)

Is anybody else out there having similar feelings? 

Again, I know I'm incredibly lucky to be able to keep my job, while so many others are not as fortunate. But I'm sure many of you know that counting your blessings isnt always easy when you're dealing with mental health issues.

Anyways, thanks for reading, curious if other people feel the same.

Thanks,"

1035,are there any resources for those of us who are going stir crazy in isolation?,my partner goes stir crazy really fast. this all has been really hard on her. my anxiety is getting worse. i'm mostly concerned about her. she's seen the exact same house setting for a couple weeks now and she says she's starting to lose track of the days. are there any resources for this? i hate to see her suffer and i know this has been tough.
1036,I can't feel nothing sometimes,"I'm 18 years old , I live in Spain so if I make any mistake sorry for that.Two years ago I've started having intrusive thoughts ,every day  they were increasingly disturbing. Thoughts about hurting other people, suicidal thoughts... Nowadays, sometimes I feel that I don't have emotions , that I don't love my friends and all this stuff. Recently I read a Instagram post that said : you're like your 5 closest friends , so if you don't love you , you know what to do . That post make me feel nervous because I've been thinking about I don't love my friends . I don't know what i feel. I'm scared about being a psychopath. Can anyone relate ? Or give me an advice. Thank you !"
1037,Sleeping troubles,"I’ve been having trouble falling asleep for awhile now but recently I’ve also had trouble staying asleep? Like I can only sleep around 5h before I wake up, then have to do smth to get tired again to be able to go back to sleep it’s rlly annoying. Does anyone know what could be causing this?"
1038,I need help,"The past 6 years I have isolated myself because of some experiences I went through with family. And over them years I have gotten extreme anxiety and depression to the point i havent left my house in 2 years and struggle to talk to my mum or brother without feeling extremely nervous. 

No one knows I feel this way my family thinks I'm just extremely lazy. Has anyone got some advice for me that could possible help me? Maybe you experienced the same problems and over come them and have some tips that personally helped you?

I just need some help because I'm getting extremely worried for myself and others around me. I have random break downs and burst of anger for absolutely no reason. And I cry for hours some nights thinking to myself why am I still here. I have completely given up with life and have a weird obsession with death. I'm lost confused and dont know what to do."
1039,Anyone pushed away all their friends?,I know this might seem like karma whoring to some people but I really need some human interaction right now..I’ve pushed away all friends except one and I’ve no one to talk to
1040,Sometimes I just feel like weak loser who can't do anything,"I don't have the willpower and self-discipline to be better. Heck, my mind is just a random mess and can't really figure out what my life is really about. There are people I love and care for but at the same time I find them inconsiderate and makes me feel like they're leeching my life. I hate that part yet I still know deep down I'd cry a river when the day comes that they die. My grandma right now is alone, lonely and hurting. The last time I talked to her via video call, I got mad because I just felt like she was putting all the weight on me. It annoyed me that she antagonizes others and gossips about them. It triggered everything else that I've been feeling--deep rooted anger and bitterness coming from my childhood. I got disappointed in myself. I haven't talked to her for days. I've ignored her messages and calls. I love her but at the same time I don't wanna hear her mess because I already have my own. Then again,  haven't really done much to ""improve"" my life because I ultimately see no point.

I'm just so confused. I have all these thoughts and feelings that seem to contradict each other. It's like there are different me's in my head arguing and judging each other. Sometimes I'm really happy and hopeful about life but then I fall down very hard and feel like I don't deserve life. My basic physical needs are met. I have food and shelter provided. But my life ultimately feels pointless and meaningless. There is a hole I just can't figure out. I always feel like I'm out of place or that I'm not supposed to feel normal or satisfied about life.

I just wanna say sorry to everyone for letting them down, including myself."

1047,Was it a good idea to tell my teacher about my problems?,"For context, I made a post before basically explaining my struggle with eating and my unhealthy desire to lose weight. I wanted to ask my parents for help, because I knew I couldn’t fix this by myself. 
Well, last night I promised myself that I would ask my parents for help the next day. Which is today. I was sitting besides my parents, thinking of how I’m gonna bring this up to them when my dad starts scolding me for not attending the Zoom e-learning lesson that I had in the morning (I didn’t attend the lesson because I woke up too late). 
Then my dad tells my mom, as if she didn’t hear him when they were sitting literally centimetres away from each other. She snaps, starts hurling insults at me. Same as my dad. But it wasn’t the usual insults now. They started saying things that hurt so much, that I was in physical pain just from hearing them. Calling me a pig, a fat cow, that my only reason for living is to eat, a waste of space. My dad joined in too. 
The pain was genuinely unbearable, my heart ached. They aren’t usually abusive at all but they snapped. So I studied, and started having a breakdown that lasted 3 hours (I just calmed down). 
It was clear as day to me that my parents are just the catalyst to my rapidly declining mental stability. No matter how much I love them, I can’t forgive them for the way they scarred me today. 
So, mid-breakdown, I thought of the next best person to help me during these hard times, and thats my form tutor from school. He has been with me for 3 years now and knows my ups and downs. He’s an extremely understanding person, so I emailed him asking him for help on what to do. Because my breakdowns are affecting my e-learning. 
But I don’t know if that was a smart decision. What if he tells my parents? What if the school finds out? My parents will be involved. And I know that my parents will not be understanding."
1048,Hateful rage + what to do about it,"I've never discussed this with anyone, but I thought it'd help me and maybe someone else. In fact I don't see many people talk about this...

I'm totally alone, and when I see a happy couple sometimes I just wish I could tear them apart. Bad news sometimes gives me a strange satisfied feeling, like I know people who don't deserve it now have to suffer as much as I do. A popular doctor I listen to has referred to it as ""extracting revenge on existence itself."" Pretentious I know but this pretty well sums up the desire. 

I think I understand how horrible and pathetic this sounds to other people, but I just can't shake it. I realize what a piece of shit loser I am for being this way. I agree with everyone else when a mass shooting occurs, that this is a tragedy and something must be done, but I see myself in those awful people. It makes me feel incredibly sad to think that I could possibly ever perform such an action... 

I've struggled for a long time with many things, but this feeling is new to me. I'm mid twenties and have only felt this for a few years. I've been violent and prone to violence as a rowdy teenager but this is a totally different thing. I realize I haven't dealt with many of my issues, but for the past couple months especially I've felt hopeless because I don't know what to do.

 I want to add a disclaimer that I am not considering going out and actually, really hurting anyone, it's just a sort of fantasy I have, which obviously is frightening to me. I do notice some regression further into the negative emotion regardless of what I do or don't do, so this is my main motivation for posting this. I believe that I would commit suicide before I picked up a weapon to harm someone else... Any help or a finger in the right direction would be seriously appreciated."

Thanks to all this corona business and being on lockdown her parents have more control than ever and are taking advantage of these tuff times making them even more difficult. I’ve noticed notice behavior changes in my gf since the lockdown and being home more than she’s used to, her parents have started saying no a lot more and she can’t go out as much anymore to come see me even if I offer to pick her up, she relies on them for a place to sleep roof over her head and I think more on that, fear plays a large part in it. If she goes against them in anyway I’m not sure what happens, she only tells me so much but I think it might be physical abuse? They’ve threatened her before, they go through her things and invade her privacy, overly control her, bash her tell her how shitty she is and then act like everything is fine they’re two faced and they raise their voices often. I know for a fact that her dad physically hits and slaps her brothers so I wouldn’t be surprised if it happens to her too. I’m starting to get really worried because even though I’ve offered her to move in with me even though my situation isn’t the best (I live in a hotel with my two parents) at least she wouldn’t be dealing with abuse and would have more freedom, she’s not looking at this as an option thought because she was suppose to move in with her grandma I think that fell flat though and I’m not entirely sure why, I just don’t think she’s okay and her mental health is declining and I can tell mentally she’s really struggling and suffering right now, she self harms and I can’t do anything to make her stop or to make her feel better because they’re trying to limit how much we can see each other. They offered me once to go over there but I try not to go to their house if I don’t have to because I feel like I’m giving into the control and giving them their way by me having to always hangout at her house where her parents are strict and won’t hardly let us do anything, the tension is extremely high and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I feel like a terrible boyfriend because there’s nothing I can say or do to make this any better for her and I’m lost as hell. I’ve never been in a relationship with someone who lives in an abusive home before so I just feel helpless and like her bad mental health is starting to rub off on me which hurts me to say but it’s the truth, I like being here for her in anyway that I can but her having so many bad days it’s also starting to effect me greatly. I don’t know what to do or what to say, does anybody have any advice or any words of wisdom? I feel like I’m doing everything wrong here and I just want her to be okay."
1051,"People fade away,they disappear. I just end up alone. Always. It hurts so bad. It hurts so much."," Everyone leaves me, and I have no clue why. They don't even tell me what i did to offend so much that they stop contacting me and forget me and move on in life. I am struggling to accept myself as I am, and just hate myself because whenever I'm ditched, I always assume it's because people hate me for the kind of person that I am, or probably I did something wrong. I live with this horrible voice in my head. My mind plays very dirty tricks on me. It blames me for my loneliness. I have no support people. No friends. No loved ones. How can one live like this ???? Everyone I genuinely loved and cared for and considered my loved ones just left me behind in darkness. And I cannot stop blaming myself. I cannot stop criticising myself. I cannot stop hating myself. I suck. I don't deserve to be alive."
1052,"I have everything I wanted, but I'm still unhappy.",[deleted]
1053,Is it possible I have gender dysphoria?,"I always wanted to become a woman, but I was able to suppress these feelings, but now when I'm bored out of my mind I can't think of anything else but how much I hate my current body... I didn't choose to become a man, but I'm pretty sure my parents wouldn't support me in my transition... 

oh wait, our government banned changing sex a few days ago..."
1054,This is the worst year to hit rock bottom,"Oh, you're suicidal and have lost all your friends and essentially can't cope at all while home? You're stuck in a cycle of isolation where being alone makes you panic and plummet into harmful coping mechanisms? Here, take a pandemic that forces you further into isolation and prevents you from seeking therapy when for the first time in your life you're seriously considering it."
1055,How can I help a friend if we don't want to go to hospital right now?," My roommate and best friend has been scaring me for a few days. I don't know if, with everything that's going on, I can take him to the hospital or to see a psychiatrist. I don't think we should go to hospital.  
For a while now, whenever I try to talk to him I have trouble deciphering what it is he's trying to say. He will often talk about paths, or being manipulated, or that there are animals in the house. Whenever we talk he tell me to keep my voice down so that nobody can hear, although there's no one else in this house.  
I have a family history with mental illness and it's hard to ignore. Two days ago, there was this extremely loud buzzing and scratching. I went into his room and it was coming from his laptop, and he kept closing it and opening it like I wasn't even there. Yesterday he came into the kitchen, absolutely horrified, saying he accidentally proved the existence of God. Then he cried for a while. And then a bit later he told me he needed to borrow money for a plane ride to the states (I'm Canadian) so he can get married.  
I've been trying to check in on him every two hours or so. I don't think he's sleeping at all, and I don't want him to wander out of the house. I don't think he's in danger, but he needs to talk to a psychiatrist, and I can't bring him to the hospital. Can I? I don't know how these things work. What should I do? I called his brother and told him, and he wasn't sure what to do either. What can I do to help him?"
1056,"""All You Need Is Love""","and it's what i never got.

i have a complicated relation with my father, he was addicted to drugs until about 6 months ago. yesterday he told me to go to his house to spend the evening with him. actually, i spent the evening guarding his house while he was out of the town buying a new car.

my only way to not feel bad, and not ashame myself for everything bad in my social life is by putting my 5$ headphones that my mother bought and... nevermind. she told me that if i broke the headphones, she would not get new ones for me, but yesterday, when i was at my father's house, she used them and... wow, broke them. she said it's my fault, that i should watch my stuff better and that i'm ungrateful.

just laid in bed, and even thought about cutting my wrists. but instead i just hid under my pillow and played All You Need Is Love quietly on my phone.

*""there's nothing you can do that can't be done, nothing you can sing that can't be sung, nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game, it's easy, all you need is love.""*"
1057,Why am I so god damn miserable all the time.,"I don't want this to sound like I'm pandering or just a plot for attentuon but I'm sick of feeling so god damn sad and tired every day, I'm sick and tired of having no motivation for anything and wasting every day away. Don't get me wrong when something really good happens the world seems a little bit brighter for a little while but it doesn't take long for me to default straight back to feeling like shit.

My mind is just a constant loop of missing good times with old friends, trying to make a change and then feeling like crap because I failed again, missing the ever loving shit out of an ex that I should by every means be over by now, and the list of not so fun things goes on

I know all of the advice that will help like go outside amd excercise and all of that but I can't find an ounce of motivation to stop the spiral but because of that it's been this way for years.

It's getting to the point where I don't even feel as sad as I used to all the time which scares the shit out of me because all that means is that I'm just feeling more and more numb to the point where major things in my life that should effect me don't bother me in the slightest, but at the same time I always feel that I'm seconds from a breakdown.

Is there anything however small that I can do to claw my way out because I'm just tired of being tired. I have to find a way up because honestly I don't think I can go further down from here."
1058,I’m a good person but I have mild anti- social personality disorder. Should I accept it Or leave it,Hell
1059,In need of some advice,"So I wanted to talk to one of my doctors about this but I won’t be able to talk with either of them for a few days because they are really backed up. I have tried calling pharmacies but they are closed or won’t talk to beacuse I haven’t filled any prescriptions there so im really sorry to ask my mind is scattered 

Would it be ok to take 3-4 0.5mg clonazepam to make me sleep?

In the past 4 days I have only slept about 5 hours a day I have tried napping but  I wake up every 5 mins 
I’m super irritable and I just don’t want anyone in my room I want to be alone I keep getting the sensation that bugs are crawling on me and even heard a bug near my ear but I look and no bugs I was in the bathroom this morning and herd a whispery hi it really freaked me out but other wise I just feel nauseous and headache and I don’t want to go to the hospital because 1. They are probably overworked 2.i don’t want to risk catching anything and bringing it home to my family
 
I’m sorry to ask I just don’t really have other options right now"
1060,Lonely,"Idk what's wrong with me.  I constantly feel like no matter where I go or whay I do I feel like I am alone.  In a group of people I feel alone.  With my family I feel alone.  I don't even know what kind of loneliness I feel.  Almost like I am just not even happy.  Constantly confusedn but what I am feeling, even writing this idk if it is really how I feel or am I just misunderstanding something.  Why doesn't life feel as joyous as they make it out to be.  Why can't I just be ignorant to the stupidity and unfairness of the world.  Is happiness even a real thing or it something people use as an excuse for whatever vice they have that lets them cope.  What is it? Idk, I just feel like life isn't as fulfilling as childhood stories made it out to be.  Why can't I find someone that understands how I feel? That doesn't just listen to what I say, but truly empathizes with it.  Cares about it.  Whenever I do it just ends up backfiring on me and every single time, and I feel like the biggest idiot in the world.  Like, it was a ""hey you deserve it"" kind of feeling, but for what? Why can't people just be open about how they feel and what they want? 
Idk, it just feels a little disappointing and unrewarding (the fact that when I do say, ""let me face life head on"" it seems to really hit back hard and in wtf ways). Looking for some advice.  Sorry if it sounds whiney or complainer-ish.  Just one of those days for me(good and bad days).  I am ok though, just wondering how other people think of it.  Thanks 😊"
1061,Struggling to seek professional help,"I believe I've struggled with mental health since I was 14, for six years now. When I was younger, I felt very invalidated by my friends who had been diagnosed by a doctor. They told me that if I hadn't seen a doctor, I was fine. In reality, I find it extremely difficult to talk about my mental health out loud. I choke up and struggle to get my point across. I went to the doctors once about how I was struggling to sleep, but he came across disinterested. I've tried to self-refer myself online twice, but each time it reaches the stage where they set up a phone interview, I put it off. 

Has anyone got any tips to help me? I think I'm afraid of being invalidated again, and I can feel the lack of professional help taking a toll mentally."
1062,What can I do to remain positive? Is this the end for me?,"I (22m) am currently homeless in mexico without any way of getting back home, sleeping on the beach at night, relying on locals for food and water, trying to do some work but it's very difficult to encounter. I am trying to stay positive but I am struggling because I just don't see a way out of this for me, the few family that I have said they will not help me get back home because it would upset my father who I have never met in my entire life. I feel like I'm just going to end up dying on the beach or starvation or thirst or something like that"
1063,I'm dissatisfied all the time,"So I'm a productivity addict and I have/had depression and anxiety. All fucking day I think about what I didn't do yet, what I did wrong, blah blah blah. I'm so sick and tired of this bullshit. I constantly berate myself yet I still don't get more than half of the things done I wanted to accomplish that day. I want my head to shut up. I do practice meditation so I can give myself a pat on the back for that but otherwise I'm helpless."
1064,What keeps you going?,What makes you get up every morning? What keeps you alive? Why do you do what you do? What makes you get back up when you are knocked down?
1065,The worst thing that ever happened to me,"This is long, I will sound stupid throughout the story, and I don’t expect anyone to read it, but this drags me down every day.


Last year, my best friend had set me up to get robbed. I ended up being dragged around for a day, threatened in order to keep me subservient and drained of all my money. My friend, I’m assuming had been tricked into this as some form of fraud. Because they (my best friend and the two guys who had been orchestrating this) kept my bank card and tried to use fake checks to repeat this. I ended up getting fined an extra 1000$ by the bank for the fake checks. 

I was left in debt and completely mentally drained. As someone who was already mentally ill, I just shut down. I was convinced if I go to the bank they’ll have me arrested. So I avoided everything and everyone. 

Two months later one of the guys reached out to me and apologized. Said I was supposed to be reimbursed, that he had every intention of paying me back. Being dumb and naive I agreed to speak to him. He offered to meet in public and pay back cash so I agreed and met him. 

Next thing I know we’re at a train station and he’s saying he has half of the money and had to get the other half in a city a half hour train ride away. I was alone with two older men who could easily over power me so I bit my tongue and prayed for the best. Well the best was not the best, because again I was dumb and had fallen for a lie. We ended up in a different province. We took buses and metros and one of the guys told me he was going to go get my money and meet us back at Tim hortons. It was already late, I was empty handed, and had no money or anything. Just a phone at 4%. I begged the workers to let me charge my phone and they refused. The second man who was staying at the tim hortons decided to leave and find his friend. Leaving me alone. The tim hortons closed and I had no where to go so I hid in a gas station restroom, and eventually got kicked out for being inside for two long. So there I was, sitting outside in the middle of winter with nothing but a coat and leggings, in -20 weather. I waited outside the whole night and the men returned in the morning and met at the tim hortons. We took the buses and metros back to the train station we arrived at. 

So we’re back at the train station no one is telling me what’s going on, I have been begging for my money or even just enough to get food. They never replied. 

So we’re back at the train station confirming the tickets, and the lady helping us informs me that our train is delayed till 8pm. I check the board with all the train times, and notice theirs one leaving to my city in an hour. When I ask the men about it they tell me that they’re not taking me home, but to another province. 

There is a certain level of fear I never thought I’d reach, but in that moment I did. I almost threw up. I waited 20 minutes and excused myself saying I was going to use the bathroom. I ran to the front desk and begged for them to change my ticket. The woman, realizing I’m in a crazy state of fear takes me to security, I instantly lose it and explain the situation. 

They tell me that the only explanation is human trafficking, and at the time when this happened, there was a huge increase in human trafficking so it lined up very well.

Having no money, I couldn’t get a ticket home, and despite the circumstances, one wouldn’t be provided. So I have a close friend of mine buy me a ticket. 

Security tells me I have to leave the office cause I can’t stay there, but to avoid anywhere those men might be. So I go to get myself a drink and spot them out of the corner of my eye. However the train station is very crowded so I easily slip away and speed walk in random directions. They caught up to me quickly, pretending to just bump into me by chance. Again I feel my stomach fall and explode. I quickly explain I bought myself a ticket home, and thankfully I was surrounded by enough people that they couldn’t do anything so I slip away again without saying another word. 

I got home at 1am after another 8 hour train ride. Emotionally, I was broken. I couldn’t leave my bed for a week. 
But there was this guy I was talking to for about a month, and he seemed great. Was in med school, wanted to open a residency for sick children, overall very wholesome. He told me I had to leave the house at some point and get some air or do anything. Just move. 
I agreed only to shut him up, but told him blatantly, I don’t want to be touched, I don’t want to have sex. We’re just going to watch a show.

I was still so emotionally detached and physically weak that I couldn’t stop him from using me. I just layed there and let him have his way with me. He was confused as to why I was crying after so I know he hadn’t realized what he did. 

It’s been a year since then, I’ve been forced to mature and lose my childlike sense of wonder and trust. The world is dark and bleak, and I can’t help but hate myself for being dumb enough to trust these people.

No one knows the full story of what happened to me, my friends are aware, my family has no idea, and charges were never pressed because I fear that this will come back to me. I also know that if this goes to court I could not handle a lawyer tearing my story to shreds and making me look bad. 

I’m sorry if the story is choppy, I have very bad adhd, and this is also a very hard thing to share but I hope some young girl out there can learn from my mistakes. 
Speak up before it’s too late, staying quiet and subservient could be the death of you."
1066,A discussion about online/Zoom therapy,"Hello everyone

I'm a psychology researcher as well as someone who sees a therapist and has recently transitioned to remote therapy sessions because of COVID-19.

As I'm sure we all know, telemental health— namely, live therapy sessions through technology/services like Zoom — has been on the rise in recent years, but is currently spiking because of COVID-19 and the need for everyone to stay indoors.

Many therapists are adapting quickly and transitioning to remote sessions via apps like Zoom, including my own therapist. This is fantastic and is working for a lot of people, but, as I'm sure other patients and therapists on this sub are experiencing, many important parts of our usual therapy is getting left behind at the office.

For example, my therapist and I usually make use of an Oculus VR headset or actual physical objects/things for my exposure therapy. Now, we have to do things verbally or by sending links of images/videos. Additionally, my therapist usually gets a close-quarters view of my reaction and state of anxiety during our sessions, but this is significantly more difficult over video call (webcam quality, lag, etc.)

If you're a therapist, I'd really appreciate it if you could fill out my survey: https://forms.gle/SkY9jkz7K8vBfkWs8. I'd love to understand this problem from your perspectives. This might turn into a research project at a later stage, but your answers from this survey won't be included there. My apologies if links aren't allowed here.

Otherwise, looking forward to discussing this with everyone and hearing your thoughts &amp; experiences so far :)."
1067,Why do people have therapy ?,"For people who have had therapy, what motivated you to go? 

For me it was a breakup from a toxic relationship"
1068,anyone else lose 35 pounds without actively trying or just me,Started on Prozac over a year ago. Started losing a little weight but it continued ever since.

1070,How do I deal with my toxic family while in quarantine?,"For context, I'm currently in high school, and my parents' work means that I don't see them for very long, at least on week days. I've always had a pretty unhealthy relationship with my family, especially my dad, and only realised the extent of it about a year ago. This quarantine means I'm constantly stuck in close quarters with them, and it's been exhausting. They're bigoted, and it hurts me to know that they are. They know about my mental health issues, but are constantly dismissive of them. My father always thinks the worst of me--he once said that I probably fail on purpose just to anger him-- and makes me keep my door unlocked so he knows I'm not ''wasting my time on the Internet''. They've also confiscated my phone for the duration of this quarantine, again to ensure I'm not ""wasting my time"", so I can't contact my friends or my therapist. I feel constantly threatened, and keep having suicidal thoughts. Please help me."
1071,I am very hard to love and need advice?,"At the start people usually get a great impression off of me, things go great, vibing is on another level but that’s not always good enough I guess? Everyone knows me, everyone likes me but nobody loves me. It pains me when I see friends loving each other, caring, being remembered and being chosen, I’m always the last option..... I always think I’m doing the right things but what I do is never good enough. I have a big fear of being left behind which causes me to self sabotage a lot of times and leave group of friends where It seems that i don’t belong in. I deleted the app where I have friends in because i don’t want to try anymore. I had a very rough time growing up but I’m not sharing it because I’m planning to write a book about it but my time growing up caused me not to have any experiences and not knowing what’s right from wrong. I have someone to coach me she’s a year younger but she’s mature and knows how to handle things. I don’t go outside because I get panic attacks when older men get near me and talking to therapists brings me back to when I would talk to child services as a kid, not a great feeling.
How can I grow into a person everybody loves? I have no fun stories to share and I’m very uncultured in the media aspect movies/anime but I’m learning. I don’t know if this is the right sub?"

1073,Getting kicked out in the middle of Covid,My parents gave me 2 weeks to leave. I got into a fight with them because I’ve been tired of their abuse. Called them out and now they want me out. Having an extremely difficult time coping and thinking about what I’m going to do. Please advise.
1074,I can't deal with touch starvation anymore,"I've been touch starved for so long. I have random emotional outbursts and panic attacks. I can't see a therapist because I'm too scared to tell my parents, and because of coronavirus. I've had it for months now and it's getting worse. What can I do?"
1075,Is my outlook on relationships healthy?,"I know my idea of a romantic relationship is far from normal, but I am sure I cannot overlook my ideals (I’ve tried for years.) I’ve been in many relationships but ended all of them because I never felt secure. Here’s the backstory: I grew up in a physically and verbally abusive home. I watched my mother get beat by my father and I myself was abused as well from a very young age. The only idea of love or relationships I ever had growing up is what I saw between my parents. I recognize that it was very dangerous and not a good situation and I have a lot of depression and issues stemming from my experiences. Well around age 16 I started having very odd sexual and romantic fantasies (I am a male) of being physically hurt by a woman and being absolutely controlled by a woman. Nothing that would seriously harm me but I want to be hit and told what to do everyday. I find women with extreme jealousy and intensity to be very attractive. I want them to dominate me in almost every sense and have a very tight grip on me. I don’t know why this is and I don’t know why I crave this to the point of ending every relationship I’ve been in (over 15) just because they couldn’t give me this love. I see a possessive, dominating, clingy girlfriend as being so attractive and loving. I don’t feel loved by really any other way. I don’t understand this and I’ve been struggling for very long.

I have a lot of problems and I feel that I have wasted eleven years of my life, before I was bothering now, and they still hate me, and some of those who never did anything to me, hate me, I am terrible at school, I thought about committing suicide and after being sad, it seems very strong and repeats like a loop"

1078,17 M Severe PTSD Need Someone To Talk Too,"*TRIGGER WARNING*

I was sexually abused, raped and beat over 3 years when I was younger by my teenage cousin, who was supposed to babysit me while my parents were at work, but instead he took advantage of how naive and scared I was, and I’m just really struggling rn. I’m really suicidal, I cut a lot, and there’s just a war of emotions going on. I feel like a bitch for not being over it yet, but I also sympathize for myself, but then I get mad because I’m feeling sorry for myself... I just need someone to talk to, I have a therapist but that’s fucked up because of this stupid coronavirus. It’s just so frustrating that my life got fucked up by my selfish cousin, and I have to relive it everyday bc I have like 50 flashbacks a fucking day, and he’s living a great life because I’m too much of a bitch to go on the stand and press charges. Ik I’m venting and ranting about something several other people have gone through, and a lot of people have it worse than me, especially on this sub, but please someone talk with me and help me out..."

1080,10 top thoughts that spin daily,"...thoughts on my mind. Please be kind...

Actually 11 not 10. My bad...

1. Being asperger's is both a gift and a curse.
2. I see scientists trying to detect the genes that cause people to be classified as ""disabled"" ""autistic"" ""deformed"" to try to ""eliminate"" or ""fix"" or ""cure"" whatever causes it....regardless if it is for hearing impaired or the blind, autistic ect... this makes me feel not just separate from society socially onto of the labels, but makes self love hard to accept. It makes me feel not just a minority but alone and knowing there may not be anyone like me again one day... that's a whole other understanding....
3. Being a 1st generation Mexican-american I also find that I am culturally not Mexican enough for the Mexicans to accept me in america and not American enough for americans to accept me either unless I play a ""part"" that fits to the ""norm"".
4. Wondering how ""american"" became a race in a country that prides themselves on being diverse....Indians and Mexicans where here first then pushed out... I really wonder how many US citizens know the first European language was spanish... 
5. I'm frustrated that just because I'm a daughter of a  LEGAL immigrant, that I have to be worried that the US society will think I'm illegal. I literally experience this with my physician asking if I am upset about boarders....?!? I am a legal citizen as are my family members!! Why would I be upset? Our schools need more funding! We have to know how many people are here so that every child from anywhere that comes here gets all that they are right to!!! Not a failing education system with teachers having too many students...for my doctor to ask that question so irrelevant to the purpose of my visit, I find that racist and I see ignorance. I am for boarder control because my grandmother, a woman in Mexico, in poverty, from an abusive relationship, did what she had to, to get her and her 9 children into america for a better life!!!! Even if that meant my dad had to be left in Mexico with his brothers for 5 YEAR living in a whore house being abused because she could only afford to get the girls over first.... I'm am NOT for inhumane conditions for any human. But I am damned if my dads experience isnt accounted for or struggle not recognized!!! It is all of why he has the behaviors and anger that has caused so much hurt in my life. And for someone to tell me, that people crossing illegally is okay?!??! You might as well say my dad went through it for nothing and I as well!!!! 
6. Why does american say we are one for all and all for one? The. Send a cencus to remind us we are Mexican American and not just americans...? I know the numbers are hard for several things but it's still a smack in the face to us.
7. Why is mental health (chemical imbalance) a norm for Latin cultures?
8. Why is it, you can spend 10 years learning why you do what you do and the truth behind it and it doesnt change the chemical physical control you have over yourself? The whole thought and understanding of why u are going into a panic and knowing and narrating the entire thing yet can't physically stop my body from spiraling is exhausting...let alone soul sucking....being a human that cant control something sometimes and smart enough to know why is like saying I'm a bad example of a human. If your born a frog, frogs jump, you jump. I'm human and see myself not being able to be a human in the sense of basic abilities...
9. My mental illness has separated my connection with all immediate family members, friends and family except my grandparents who are the only ones who love and accept me for me...
10. Sometimes I feel like I'm falling and I cant find a branch or I'm jumping off a cliff to save a life and didnt realize I was losing mine to help them find theirs...
11. As a woman I was sexually harassed and assaulted by 2 different people in 1 year when I was 19. I am on alert 24/7 which is also exhausting...

No comments necessary just please be kind if you do..."
1081,Inability to feel sad at all without crying,"So I've been having this issue for a few months now and it's seriously getting in the way and I have no idea what to do about it. Every time I feel the slightest bit upset or sad it turns into full on sobbing, which... really isn't practical if I'm around other people... It's like the feeling of sadness, no matter to which degree, triggers this intense crying reaction that I can't control or ease. I really don't know what to do, so if anyone has heard of this thing...or have any advice/info that'd be great... (Note: I don't have depression)"
1082,I need help with suppressing emotions.,"In past, every time I showed emotions, wanted to talk about some issue, I got told to just get over it, becouse Iam not a girl, I just have to deal with it... When I cried I got screamed at.... Now I keep suppressing emotions all the time, even when I want to cry, I can't, I just automatically suppress it, and opening myself about my personal issues is impossible for me outside of anonymous internet..."
1083,Should I be worried about myself?,"Hello. Multiple times throughout the day, I feel very very sad for seemingly no reason. And in between the times that I feel sad, I just feel exhausted or empty. It's not a secret among my friends and family that I have ""dangerously low"" self esteem [as described by my mom], and I've been alerted many times that people are worried for me. I don't like talking about the fact that I feel this way because often times I feel like the people I care about hate me or are growing tired of me and my insecurities and I always feel like I'm doing stuff wrong. I sob in private over awkward or negative social interactions, or ones that I perceive as negative, but most of the time it's out of self hated I think. My friends and family are starting to get worried that I might actually hurt or off myself, but I think they might be overeating. I don't think I have depression or anything serious because I think compared to me, there are people who have it much worse mentally. I'm not on medication, I'm not in a hospital, and I'm not sad ALL the time, just most, I'm not starving myself or over eating (at least I don't think), and I can leave my bed most of the time. I don't like saying I have problems because I don't want to sound like I'm over exaggerating or looking for extra attention. I haven't attempted suicide at all. Sometimes I think that the quality of people's lives would be better if I was gone or that they'd be happier without me, but I wouldn't call those suicidal thoughts. I often just think that I'm being sensitive or irrational. However this has been going on for about a year or so now, and these feelings of sadness and exhaustion have been amplified over the past few months. My mom thinks I should get therapy. Is this something serious that I should start looking into, or am I right in saying that I'm just being sad? How/where do I get diagnosed and treated if it is serious? What should I do if it's not? I live in the US if that helps. Thanks in advance."
1084,i cant take it anymore,"i have reached my breaking point. I want to fucking die. Everything is reminding me of things that i dont wanna be reminded me of, i keep having to deal with obsessive thoughts and dissociation. I tried last year, actually attempted. Then i tried in August- but i never jumped and got help with the police officers. I got away from my sister too, realized what she was doing was insanely toxic and manipulative. I got away from my entire family thanks to that, but I lost literally EVERYTHING I owned. A good and bad thing, sure. It helped me move on but look here!! Does it look like ive moved on!!? Im in so much pain, both physically and emotionally. All i can think about is how much i hate myself, how terrible i am, and how much everyone fucking hates me. I have no motivation for anything, ive been struggling with motivation for years. The only time i had the most motivation was when i was in  the ward recently, and then a little bit when i was homeless. Thing is, when i get depressed..... I cant do anything. I cant move that much, i cant take care of myself, etc. It is like a smoldering rock on top of me.

I havent took a shower in days, i havent took off nor changed my clothes in ***days.*** i stopped my diet, i stopped my meds months ago because they made things worst. im dying inside and soon i will be literally dead. I just cant take it anymore. why did i have to be born into a corrupt family? why am i fucking obsessed with a person i hardly know?? how come CPS is so flawed yet no one wants to actively care.. i just want to move on but i fucking lost EVERYONE AND EVERYTHINg- i keep telling myself i can do it but how can someone from on from that???? how can someone recover knowing their little sister probably got molested by your brother, that your little silbings think you abandoned them when YoU DIDNT WANT TO... your mom is fucking delusional and psychotic, all your items are now gone and guess who fucking has them???? your bitch sister whos too busy doing drugs and shit- always lashed out on you, always calling you names, treating you like its a 'privilege' to let the stay there, looked into your journals and then fucking... got in contact with the one person you want to escapee from, i legit thought my oldest brother was gonna MURDER me after that- i had to unwillingly explain to her about the fucking.. molestation thing since she read my journal, my vent journal... like god, i wanna love you but you treated me like shit over every little thing due to your instability. She has all my things and probably sold it off too. She blamed me for being depressed and acted like it was my fault for not trying hard enough, fucking.... yelling at me for my dissociation/maladaptive daydreaming...

oh sure, she was better than my mom but what fucking ever. Im only 18, about to be 19 in 13 days- that is, if im even alive by then. I have all this SHIT happen to me, older adults shame me for being 'chiidish' AKA FUCKING **HAPPY.** GOD. sorry you HATE LIFE and think everything needs a reason on why you feel a certain way, and get literally angry when someone asks you a simple question like ""whatcha doing"" BITCH IM NOT EVEN ATTACKING YOU?????? SAYS THE PERSON WHO CALLS ME NAMES WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY AND DONT KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEIR HANDS TO THEMSELVES.

&amp;#x200B;

its funny how im mature than a lot of people in my life. I dont smoke, i dont drink. I dont attack people when im angry, you know when i do attack others? when they attack me first. I have every right to start yelling, start fighting back, after that person treated me like shit all this time while i had to stand there with my tail in between my legs and just **take it.** EVEN with my current living situation, i have to deal with my roomate, who is OLDER  (28), treat me poorly because they are angry at life themselves. Are you fucking kidding me? Is this what it is like to finally be an adult?? Is it an unspoken rule to hurt others because you are hurt yourself?? Is there a rule where i must think only about the negatives or else im just a little kid who 'doesnt understand'? People who just.... Take hits at me, emotionally and physically. How can i move on? Ive lost close personal relationships due to outside forces. Guess fucking what? I would wet the bed until i **got out of my mother's house.** I still almost wet the bed while living with my sister. This is how stressed i get. This is what i have to deal with. Between pulling my eyelashes out, shaving my entire body excessively, cutting myself, hitting myself. I just want to live a normal life but i keep getting stuck with toxic people and awful situations. Now outta every fucking thing, we are dealing with the virus. Are you KIDDING me.... I was so close to getting my social security benefits so i could get into assisted living, then move on with my life and get away from my roommate... get away from toxic people hopefully for the last time...... But even then, i still cant move on. I still have the past clawing deep inside me. Its fucking hopeless. I just want to live a normal life.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont get the point of being alive anymore. I love God, i love him and im trying to believe the best i can. Im trying to have faith- but i cant do this shit, man. I cant. Im a piece of shit, i deserve to die, I benefit nothing, i cant even take care of myself anymore right now."

1086,I’m a misfit (?),"So I changed school and I’m in a new school since September. I had to start school 2 weeks later then other students. And my classmates are great and we’re all friendly with each other. But I don’t have that one person to talk to all the time like I had on schools(2) before (I’m introverted). And when we have make groups or pairs mostly In the one who is left out.
Probably bcs I came late and everyone has made their friends circles?
Now we have to make groups again to do online project. And everyone who I asked has their group already and I texted to group chat and no one replied. It makes me really anxious, 
anyone knows how to deal with this?"

1089,Need some help,"Need help

Hello everyone before I start I just want to make it clear that I’m no way am I making fun or mocking anyone with OCD.
I came on this this subreddit asking if I should consider therapy, I believe that I have OCD, let me give some examples. 
I have really bad intrusive thoughts that I obsess over like one time my mind convince me I was going bald, I would constantly check up on my hair line or feel it to see if it was receding this ended up giving me an anxiety attack that led me to start crying another time my mind also convinced me that I was losing my hearing my thoughts felt so real and scary, that thought took some time to go away but I overcame it.
Recently I am in the process of overcoming with what I believe is HOCD after seeing 2 men kiss I felt very uncomfortable but I jus couldn’t shake the thought, now I don’t have a problem with people being gay I just know that’s not me but my mind tells me otherwise. 

I also check up if my doors are locked more than once, I check up on the stove knobs more than once."
1090,"Cut off from society since 2010, no human interaction, how can I cope?","I have no friends, this is not the normal “oh boo hoo” shit I literally simply do not have anyone I talk to and am around besides myself. Me and a group of friends had a falling out around 2009 - 2010 and I just never really had a desire to replace them I guess... My family doesn’t like me very much, they don’t hate me, but they’ve always been distant from me, most likely because I’m on the autism spectrum. I live a very closed off life, I have my interests and my hobbies, and I don’t talk about them with anyone besides here on Reddit, even then, I don’t get much interaction. I’ve never had a real relationship, I’ve never been on a date, never went to a party (besides my siblings birthday parties when I was young) I haven’t hung out with anyone besides my mother since 2014, and I live a life that is so painfully solitary that I’ve managed to partially convince myself that I am happier living like this. The only person I have regularly, somewhat friendly, contact with is a group of door to door missionaries trying to sell me into some bullshit religion closer to a cult than a practice. The only things I do for fun is watch television and movies, over and over again. I stay up until 7-8 AM watching movies then I sleep until 3-4 in the afternoon. I am a mess really. 
How can I be happy living cut off from the rest of the world"
1091,"vent, am i a failure?","no matter how hard i try, no matter what ideas i use, i fail, i mess up or worse nobody cares, its like i am just doomed to fail, i am useless,pathetic, i offer nothing to anyone, everyone in my field gets success but i am left alone in the dust with no answer as to why?, is it my lack of budget?  i had similar ideas to ""i am sophie"" and yet she got a spotlight and love and im left with nothing, is that it? im just too poor? or am i just a failure? i dont know anymore, this is stressful"
1092,My body is rotting from inside,"Note: I tried posting this to other threads but it was removed by moderators. So I'm posting it here hoping someone can help. 

My body is rotting away, my partner says he can't smell it, but he's always had a really bad sense of smell, so I don't know of I can believe him when he says that.

Its sort of like a smell of uncleaned, blocked drains, with a fishy tinge too.
I can smell it in my breath, my v*gina, when I go to the loo, my ears and behind my ears. I've also started looking really old, I'm in my 20s but I look about 60, and now I think the rotting smell is coming out of my belly button too.
I've stopped having s*x, because obviously I can't let my partner see me rotting away down there, and I've started using super powerful mouthwash whenever I can, using antiseptic (TCP) in my bellybutton and round my genitals to try and cover the smell, and hopefully stop whatever is happening.

What is there that can help to stop this? Has anyone else had this?  
I really want to ask for a whole body scan or xray, to find out what is rotting and maybe find out why, or have it removed before my whole body rots?

Addition: I do not have any physical issues, as far as I know, but I do have some mental health issues which I take medication for"
1093,Increased anxiety after taking meds?,"I've been taking medication for my anxiety and depression for about 6 months now. Recently I've noticed an increased feeling of anxiety about half an hour after I take my medication. Does anyone else have a similar experience? The feeling usually lasts for about an hour and then I'm back to feeling ""normal"". All in all the meds are working well for me."
1094,So mentally exhausted I just fall asleep,"I spend all day in my head. Fussing over negative things, past memories, and the future. Arguing with myself and feeling angry, sad, and hopeless. It just overwhelms me and I feel drained and I fall asleep.

I've been suffering like this for years. I haven't seen a therapist because I don't have the money and I feel I'd just be wasting their time. Maybe I'm just making too big of a deal of things. But I really want it to stop."
1095,I’ve lost my passion.,"I have a lot of problems, and I don’t know if I’m okay or not. I used to be really hardworking, and super productive about my art. I would constantly improve, and I was always very passionate about digital art and drawing. For the past year it’s all changed. I still love art, and I want to persue it. But after seeing all these people doing all these things that are far more better than what I can do, I’ve been sad. I feel like I can’t compete with any of this. I feel like I’m not good enough for art school, but that isn’t an excuse to give up. If I gave up that would be so selfish, just because people are better than me it doesn’t give me the right to pout and sulk over this. I want to improve, and prove myself but I feel like I can’t do that. I feel really trapped in my own mind."
1096,Hey there. I'm growing desperate trying to figure out what's going on in my head. I don’t feel it’s important enough to worry about seeing a specialist but i don’t even know what ‘it’ is.,"
Hey guys. For a good few years, I’ve been trying to find out what caused a certain type of experience for me that I used to feel almost daily. The best way I can describe it is you know when you’re zoned out and then you like come back to reality? For some reason what would happen would be that my brain seemed to think it was stuck in the transition between zoning out and being active in the present moment. So I would be talking with friends for example. Then if I’m listening to them my mind could suddenly start to feel like I was zoning out. But instead of zoning out in the present moment, it would feel like my brain was thinking back to a memory or moment of the past and trying to come back to what it thinks is the present- which doesn’t even exist because what my brain thought it was reflecting on, was my real and live life. So you would have one part of me determined that my mind was wandering and I needed to snap back to the “present” and the other part fighting it trying to actually focus on my real life at the moment. I wouldn’t feel as if I was looking on at myself so to say, more just feeling like I was literally stuck in a memory and that my real present life was nothing more than a memory or dream. These episodes could range from only a few minutes, to 15-30 minutes, to longer. I’m still in high school and my parents aren’t particularly mental health aware. At first it was suggested it was a panic attack because of a change in place. Seemed reasonable until this continued happening randomly years on, whether in school or outside in general. I should mention I’ve had a trauma free life as of now, and I’m not a user of drugs or anything along those lines. It’s been a while since I experienced an episode of this- however I never did find out what happened with my strange dreamlike mindset, so thoughts would be massively appreciated. Thank you for reading this :)"
1097,What’s everyone do when they start feeling like a ball of dirt?,"I’m struggling through self confidence issues right now and sometimes I can’t help but feel like a walking human garbage can. I don’t feel good about my looks, hobbies, intelligence, or basically anything right now. I know I’m not the suck of the earth but it sure does feel that way, and I need to know what everyone else does to cope with this feeling. Thank you"
1098,I can’t grieve,"My old best friend died while we weren’t talking and i can’t process the guilt. 

So when I was 22 I went through a really tough time mentally. I was out of an abusive relationship, loads of trauma and attachment issues I’d never dealt with, repeatedly attempting suicide and self-harming - honestly it felt like I’d lost like 3 years of my life because I was just actively trying to die or felt like I was nothing. This girl who id known since I was 18 was there for me through it, she stopped me going through with it, she told people who were nasty to me or called me an attention seeker to back off. Eventually I started getting help, it got to the point where I can tell what’s my anxiety and what’s real, I can do what’s best for me and I take care of myself.

She was struggling too, and she got very involved in alcohol and substance abuse. She wasn’t getting better, she got worse - and she was making me worse too. She would call me and tell me she was going to self-harm, when I didn’t reply to her messages fast enough she’d threaten suicide, she’d insult me and my family - then tell me I obviously was still I’ll when I got upset. I kept forgiving her, and giving her second chances - then one day she messaged my mom telling her I was going to commit suicide because I hadn’t replied to her message fast enough. I cut her off then, she got obsessed with me, asking my friends to see pictures of me, obsessing over my social media, making fake accounts to contact me... I know she was ill, but I couldn’t handle it.

Two years ago she called me when she was in hospital (sectioned) and I agreed to talk to her once she got out and was in a better place. I never did. I always meant too, I just never did.

Last week she died in her sleep of “flu like symptoms” (possibly covid-19 but I’m not sure). I thought I’d have more time. I didn’t think us not talking would be forever.

I feel so guilty, and I don’t think I’ll ever stop feeling that. She died thinking I didn’t care, and now I can’t even grieve because I don’t deserve too. I wish I’d have had more time."
1099,I'm scared of not being able to handle my emotions..,I'm scared to get too mad at school and throw a big tantrum or something. Or to get sad and start crying. I don't want to be seen as a freak. The thing is just that I have a hard time handling my emotions. What's wrong with me?  I'm so scared to lose my mind and not being able to control myself.
1100,Ticks? Or something else?,"So, I made these random noises at random times.
I always thought they were ticks, but they have gotten more frequent, and more random.
If they are ticks, how do minimize them?
If they aren't ticks, what could they be and how do I minimize/stop it?"
1101,Mental Health. Curable vs Treatable,"I’m not referring to genetic mental illness like someone who always had anxiety or depression from preschool. I mean mental health caused by a trauma. Like being depressed since your divorce at 42. Or developing anxiety after being bullied at 13. Do those things go away once the (I guess you would call these traumas) are treated? I would assume so since it makes sense seeing as how these people in the examples did not have any disorders prior and was triggered by an event, especially if they only feel depressed or anxious when reminded of their event.

So are these triggered illnesses treatable or curable?"
1102,Strange disorder going on need help,"I'm 26yr old male and have some mental illness that's been holding me back from prosuing a relationship with a girl. I believe there is something odd going on and can't understand why I'm still single after years of opportunities. I don't have alot of dating experience, this is causing me insecurities and low confindence. I need someone to talk with maybe hear there presepctive. 

Everyone finds me odd to why I'm not in a relationship or talking to anyone.

Can someone pm me with some dating advice while having mental illness"
1103,Is this enough to cause someone mental harm?,"So I’m 22 years old now, I’m a male. I have a serious porn addiction/ I cheat on every girl I’m with and I really don’t think I’m capable of love at all. I don’t love myself, I’ve never really loved anyone besides my mom and somes I don’t even love her. Alright backstory I was adopted when I was younger apparently my mom couldn’t take care of me so she gave me away, My mom and dad were the nicest parents, they got me what I wanted. I had a cousin let’s call him Greg he was a couple years older than me he maybe 4 or 5 years older than me. Growing up me and him would hang out all the time, because our dads were brothers so we got really close. I truly love this guy like a brother but we also had a dark side to our relationship. From the ages to like 5 to 11 we used to do sexual things with each other.  He used to let me
Penetrate him give me head , we would also watch porn and do sexual things whenever we were alone together. Whenever we would hang out with our female cousins we’d do sexual things to them aswell we got caught once by our parents with the females as we never did it again. The last time I remember doing something sexual with this man was when I was a middle schooler and he was in high school. I would penetrate this man he never tried to penetrate me but he would make me eat soap and shit if I didn’t want to do sexual things tbh I actually remember liking doing sexual things with him as a young kid. I just thought it was normal as I got older I realized this behavior was not normal so I stopped doing it. So I guess for the majority of my teen years I kinda tried to forget that it ever happened. Which worked okay I guess I didn’t think about it at all I tried my best not too. But lately I’ve been thinking about it more and more and trying to connect the dots to see why I’m so sexual and have so many mental issues and why I don’t love myself or anyone. And this is the only thing I can think of that could have possibly traumatized me. Because other than this I had a pretty decent childhood. So yeah do you guys think that this could be causing me pain without me even knowing?"
1104,Can't understand myself,"I've been feeling lately that all the bad things that happened to me have been caused by a bad side of me. This reminds me of the film ""Split"" where the main character had a mental disorder, where a lot of personalities were inside him . (Sorry 4 my basic english) The thing here is that, I broke up with my gf months ago and today I was looking atvthe lst conversation we had and I was talking like someone who's just not me, that shocked me a bit, don't remember if I had a mental breakdown that day, can' remember if I was crying at that moment, is very confussing."
1105,I'm feeling myself spiral back down into depression and I don't know how to stop it or let people help,"It's been a while since I've felt this bad and I don't really know where to start.  


I'm a 19F who has been previously diagnosed with GAD and depression. Throughout the year I was in therapy, I didn't try hard enough and they decided not to refer me to adult psychiatry once I hit 18. Instead, I was referred to social work. The social work already knew of me due to them reaching out after I ended up in A&amp;E for a psych evaluation after I phoned either my nurse or 111(that part is unclear in my memory) for severely suicidal thoughts. 

Social work tried to help me get back into society (I was previously doing nothing) but I was never comfortable with the social worker. The only thing I got out of it for the time I was there was her mentioning my old nurse's evaluation. She said that I showed very strong autistic traits to my social work but never once to me while she treated me. Despite already somewhat knowing that, it had upset me for a long time but I eventually came to terms with it.

Around the time I left therapy and all throughout social work, I had started talking to a friend of a friend. Over the months we got closer and closer and he became the person I could share with. Eventually, after months of friendship and a weekend together (he lives in another close-by country), we became a couple. It's been 8 months since then and we talk and visit each other regularly. I hadn't been that happy in a long time and he feels the same way. I love him and that's something I struggled to say and come to terms with for a very long time and even to this day -  I still have difficulties expressing myself to him. He's understanding though, he loves me regardless. 

Since then I've been happy. I got a new social worker and I'm building up my confidence so that I can try and attend college. My family life is getting better little by little. So why? Why am I spiraling back down - why am I becoming the person that I was 2 years ago?

I play games with my boyfriend and our friends but now I can't bring myself to do it most of the time. I'm always so angry or so tired of something or someone. I have a long and tiresome history with a friend that makes it so hard sometimes. One day we can be chill and the next I'll be so angry at him for existing. He's my boyfriend's friend and at the end of the day, he's my friend too. I don't want my boyfriend to not play with him but I can't stand to be there so I leave and I let them play.

On top of the depressing mood I wake up with every day and the lack of contact with people, I'm worrying all the time. I used to not care about my health since I just didn't care about being alive. But now that I'm happy and I have my boyfriend, I'm terrified. Almost every minute of every day, I'm thinking that I could be dying. What if this is wrong with me? What does this pain mean? I stand in the shower and will think that a tugging sensation in my stomach is cancer. I'll feel pain in my side and think that it's more cancer. I feel a lump? Cancer. I've always felt this way, even since I was a child, but now it's overwhelming. The thought of dying scares me so much now that I have something to lose. 

I know I should phone the doctor and they'll probably treat me for the anxiety but I can request tests for peace of mind. I just need to get around to it - the doctors are still scary to me and phoning can take me a while. 

My boyfriend wants to help but I could never accept it. I've never been someone who can be comforted. Soothing words don't work and hugs when I'm upset just make me feel uncomfortable and awkward. I want to let him help though. I want him to feel like he's someone I'd turn to because he is. He's the kindest, most understanding and loving person I've ever met. There is no one in the world that matters more to me. He makes me comfortable but I still can't be comforted by him (or anyone else) and it makes me mad at myself. I want to be comforted. I want to know what that feels like and I just don't know how to get there.   


Maybe you guys might have an idea haha"
1106,I’m pushing everyone away and drawing into myself.,"When I’m down, I withdraw. Lately though, I’ve been in what has certainly seemed like a constant “down” state, with it getting worse at night when it’s quiet and I’m left to my thoughts. 

The thoughts are the worst. They make me despise myself. They make me feel pathetic, stupid, and just like a piece crap. Then they make me think that I’m just faking it for attention. Of course, I believe them. So then I feel guilty on top of everything else. 

As I said though, I push others away. Before school was cancelled it was harder to do. I’d see my friends in person. It’s not like I could just tell them “hey get out of my life” or “don’t talk to me”. Then I’d feel more bad about that. So instead I was just quiet. Simple nods of the head, or short, blunt, answers to questions that weren’t yes/no questions.

Another day I’d go in not feeling as bad. I could smile, and joke a bit. Until whatever is wrong with me came back up and dragged me down. Then I’d go right back to my true self I guess. This made me feel more guilty. More ashamed. The thoughts would tell me how I just annoy everyone, and people just tolerate me. That I’m a bother. That people think I’m faking it. I know I’m not faking it. But the thoughts do a good job of convincing me that I am. 

Now, with school cancelled for a while, and probably until the end of the school year, it’s easier for me to push others away. Sure I’ll see them on video calls for some classes, but it’s different. I don’t feel as obligated to talk. I don’t have to attend every class. I only see them for short periods of time. Plus, if it does get cancelled for the rest of the year, I can just sort of disappear. I’m a senior so I won’t have to see them again if I don’t want to. I don’t have to contact anyone. 
Still, I dread the calls. I dread the small amount of time where I have to see people. As much as I hate to say it, I also wish I had a break from family for a while. I just want to be alone."
1107,I just realized how sad it is when you can't even talk to family,"I realized I can never be truly honest with my family, because I know their answers to my issues will only hurt me. I know they wouldn't understand, because the only thing I do is pity myself and who sympathizes with that? It's weak and pathetic. I am ashamed and embarrassed of myself. And I don't know how to go forward. I don't know how to conquer my fears, but I have to do it on my own, because I can't rely on anybody else. It's just me, but I can't trust ""me"". Nothing's going to change because I know myself better than anybody else. The world hates useless people and if I can't do this I'm going to kill myself before I become a burden. At the end of the day it doesn't matter who loves me. If I'm going to be a bother for the rest of my life, I'd rather be dead. That's a promise."
1108,"If you cant afford therapy, should you just kill yourself?","Title, i want a therapist but have low income, i already have a means to commit suicide.

I want a meaning to live but I dont have it and have begun to hate everything and everyone.

I dont care about how my death will affect my family, I am the chief of miserible everyday and I am sick and tired of feeling aimless. My sister commited suicide last year so I know what I will be doing to my family but I just dont care.

My life simply doesnt matter and I am unworthy of help because I can not afford it.

I want to be better and make progress but I am aimless and starving for purpose, but no one even wants to talk to me about such things.

I dont have the strength to do this alone and the only thing I am passionate about doing is dying."
1109,Why am I a robot?,"I have lost the feeling of emotion (for the most part). Like, I just do not care about things. People can call me an a\*\*hole, I don't care. My partner gets pissed at me? I don't care. If someone in my family dies? I don't care. I shrug it off as ""well that's life, everyone dies."" It's to a point where even if my nieces and nephews were to die, I **know** I wouldn't cry. I would just say something along the lines of ""well that's sad and it sucks but life goes on...it is what it is."" I have tried therapy for this (in addition to other underlying mental health issues). For the most part, I have managed to understand and control a lot of my past behavior stemming from other mental illness. But when it comes to emotion, I can't get over this 'hump'. My therapist is/was unhelpful. I am literally a robot. The only thing I care about is my income, as that directly affects my quality of life. So if I were to lose my job, I'd be upset...but even then I would just say ""ok no big deal, I'll just get another job"", and I will rationalize it as just being a process of life. Literally, almost nothing makes me feel anything. Yes, people have told me this is some sort of defense mechanism but I call BS on it. And even if it is, it is so strong and engrained in me that I cannot get over it now. Like I said, therapy has not helped in this regard. Anyone experience something similar and if you have gotten out of this, how have you done so?"
1110,What's Happening to Me?,"I am really distressed and I don't know what to do or what to tell my therapist. Here's a list of what I'm feeling:

-I don't feel connected to reality or to myself
-I can't stand being in my body, it feels like a prison
-I don't recognize myself if the mirror/when I look into my phone camera
-I am incredibly anxious
-I feel the intense urge to know what is wrong with me and how I can stop it

I feel like this is more than just depersonalization or realization but I honestly don't know. I have been told I dissociate and I know what that feels like but this feels different. I'm in panic mode. 

What's wrong with me? How do I describe this to my therapist?

Edit: I also experience dysphoria quite often. Is this just an extreme version of that?"
1111,How do I get over my existential terror,"For as long as I can remember, I've always lived in absolute terror of death. Not, like dying but of being dead. The idea that I just don't exist anymore for the rest of eternity. What happens to my memories and my personality? It all just vanishes? 

These thoughts aren't always debilitating but sometimes they are and I've had them at least one every single day for my whole life. 

It's like being at a party as a kid and then your mum says you gotta be ready to leave soon. You can't enjoy the rest of the party the same way because you know you have to go soon and you don't want to. 

A family member died today. I'm obviously incredibly sad. I'm also so so anxious because this is like the equivalent of my mum waving at me from across the room at this metaphorical party and tapping her watch. I'm in bed trying to sleep and I can't. I'm just so afraid. 

How do I stop being so scared of something that is inevitable and totally out of my control? I've been considering looking into hypnotherapy but it's pretty expensive and I don't even know if it would work for something like this. 

Does anyone have any coping mechanisms that can help me?"
1112,I'm scared that my insecurities are going to ruin my relationship.,[deleted]
1113,Self quarantine is fucking me up,"I've been inside the house for the past month and for the month to come, I'm quite sure it's gonna last that long maybe even more, now I've been dealing with anxiety, depressive episodes, panick attacks and lots and lots and lots of stress, now, when I was outside, working, then going to class, and then back home, Everything was fine, usual episodes every now and then etc, but since if stayed inside, after a week or so, my anxiety starting rising so much, to the point I try to go bed next to my mom, because I'm genuinely scared for my own safety. I keep popping Xanax, doctor prescribed them, my asthma keeps kicking my chest keeps hurting ,my stomach keeps turning, my appetite is lost, And this lump in my throat won't go away, I keep having diarrhea out of nowhere,I even got a rash, on my leg ,that  even my mom gets whenever she's overstressed.. I'm sleeping a lot, or not sleeping at all, my mood is gone, I don't wanna play video games, I don't wanna text my girlfriend, I don't wanna have sex, nothing, I know all those symptoms are caused by my anxiety, but for the love of God, I want this feeling of dread, that I keep getting since I got locked up inside 5 weeks ago, to go away, I begun praying, mediating, listening to asmr, called Mental health lines, and it does indeed help, until the night comes... some things left me scarred few weeks ago that made my head even more scared and unable to cope. I even brought a doctor to see me,he said that I'm perfectly fine and fully functional, and my lungs where perfect even for an asthmatic. It's all caused by stress and Overthinking. Please, for the love of God, I want my mind to relax and go back to how it was.."
1114,A good portion of my life is fake. Does anyone know what this could be?,"I recently realized that for the past years i’ve “lied” about plenty of things out of shame of my actual life, like the amount of money i make, things ive done, my past, places ive been etc, even my personality. What could this be?"
1115,Social isolation is driving me crazy,"I've been in social isolation/quarentine for about a month now and this is driving me crazy, I only leave the house for what is essential.
I'm working remotely and I've noticed that I'm starting to confuse days in a sense that I can't recall on which day I've made a certain task, this was not usual when I worked at the office.
I'm also a lot more temperamental in the sense that I lose my mind for simple tasks that I can't achieve right away such as giving meds to my cats, this episode also lead to me mistreating my gf who has been living with me for the past 4 years.
My sleep routine is also totally messed up, I can't go to sleep at decent hours and when I wake up in the morning I feel like crap, this makes me way less productive at work.
Basically I'm becoming something I never tought I would become.
Any advices on how to handle this whole situation?
I should also refer that I used to smoke a joint everyday after dinner(just one and only one) and since this whole isolation thing started it became impossible for me or pretty much anyone I know to get some weed."
1116,Need help supporting my friend,"My best friend is severely depressed. We talk often and I do my best to support him. But he is constantly depressed and suicidal, but doesn’t have a plan or anything as far as I know. Every time we talk about it he begs me not to call the cops. Someone called them once on him and he was forced into a hospital on a hold and is terrified of going back. I’m not sure about his insurance but I know he doesn’t have money for any pricey help. Is there anything I can do to get him more professional help without ruining our friendship? Sacramento area, California."
1117,I want to gain the weight back...,"Most of my life I suffered binge eating disorder. I have always had a fast metabolism, so it wasn't that noticeable to the people around me. My brother always called me fat growing up, even though I wasn't. He was joking, but hearing it so often eventually made me believe it, which is when my binge eating started. In recent years, I've lost my appetite entirely. I can only eat a couple bites at a time, I used to weigh 130 (I'm 5’2”) and now I only weight 89 pounds. 

I never intended to be ”anorexic”, but everyone around me now tells me that that's what I look like, like I'm anorexic. I want to get to a healthy weight again, but I don't know what steps I can take on my own. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or tips?"
1118,Something is wrong.,[deleted]
1119,I just discovered that I don't have to be nice for people,"And I'm very happy about it. I feel like when I'm nice I'm just fake and everything gets worse than when I'm cold fuck, but being myself atleast. Just wanted to write this out to remember it better. Hell yeah"
1120,"I’m probably not depressed, I’m just completely out of touch with my emotions.","They’re there, but very diminished and hard to identify with."
1121,been dealing with mental health issues for a couple months. Ways getting help before Covid-19,"I see and hear stuff alot. sometimes its tramas from my past and other times its fears. I was getting help before covid-19 and I lost my job and insurance. The doctors told me I had anxiety and psychosis- until they figured out what exactly i have(my mother has schizophrenia, hence why they proceeded cautiously, I still take my mediation for anxiety(because thats all they proscribed for me) but I still get visual and audio hallucinations- does anyone know of ways to cope with them- I'm currently jobless and insuranceless because of covid-19. thanks in advance. Right now I just draw or play videogames when I have a bad panic attack or hallucination."
1122,Does the joy of others bring you down when you're already feeling down?,"For the past few months I've really found myself in a rut. I went through a breakup and tried to start something new and it hasn't gone my way so I feel especially triggered when I see happy couples. I graduated college and I have been unemployed and out of school for over 4 months so I feel like I've really been a waste of space. I've lacked a lot of ambition these past few months because I've had very little energy many times sleeping in until 5 pm and feeling so negatively towards myself thinking I was pretty much good for nothing. I don't want to sugar coat my emotions or try to justify them but sometimes I just feel angry! Then when I see people happy and laughing I feel this wave of irritability and then I find myself emotional later on when I'm alone. I often catch myself being so negative as well. When people are speaking positively about something I always feel the need to chime in on how terrible things are going for me and I hate myself for it. I also have tried to open up to my mother and she brushes how I'm feeling off telling me I'm just trying to drag her down to feel how I do and essentially control her life. That isn't my intentions but it's made me feel like maybe I could be even if that isn't my goal. 

I find myself being reckless quite often especially when it comes to driving. I am a pretty small female and I will walk around places at night by myself and my attitude towards it is if something happens to me it happens. I look back and I know that such behavior is stupid but in the midst of my emotions I do not care. I cry every single night and I can't stop thinking about things that are out of my control. I stress out big time and the stress brings a lot of tension causing back pain, I've been unable to fall asleep and stay asleep, and I've been been getting this rash on the side of my face which I think is from stress. I know I said I sleep in until 5 pm but it's not a restful sleep at all I am just in bed trying to sleep until 5 pm. Not to mention I have continuously been losing weight when I'm not trying to. Food was always something I enjoyed and it brought me joy but now almost nothing sounds good and I eat a bit to survive. It is often greasy fast food as well that I never even finish because the idea of it makes me want to gag. 

I wouldn't describe what I'm feeling as envy and maybe more of self pity. Maybe I am in denial and it is envy which is why I get so down when I do see people happy maybe because I want what they have. My mental health has not been well though and because of these feelings I've really grown distant from everyone in my life. I do feel like I need to be happy to make others happy but I feel like I haven't been able to get there. I can't diagnose myself as depressed or having any sort of mental disorders because I have never seen a professional but I've had problems for the last 13 years of my life and I am currently just 24 years old. I never got help because of the cost, I never had good insurance to cover it before, currently I do not have health insurance, and my mom would keep telling me I needed to deal with things on my own and a therapist was going to do nothing but listen which she said anyone could do. I do need some advice and I want to know if anyone has such awful feelings. If others are happy I just want to feel happy for them instead of it making me feel resentment towards myself. I feel like my question is so dark and maybe makes me a bad person but I know that can't entirely be true because there's no way I am the only person feeling this way."
1123,Advice needed to help someone suffering from depression in isolation,"Really appreciate any advice about the following:

My younger brother had been going out with his girlfriend for about a year. She lives about an 40 min drive away from us. They have been separated for 3 weeks because of isolation. My brother just confided to me that she was diagnosed with depression prior to going into isolation and that she needs to see him because she isn't dealing well with the separation and she needs him because ""he makes it better"".

They have for a long time had a sort of dependent relationship, her parents are divorced and I think she enjoys having someone to rely on (totally fair). However it has also been a huge amount of stress on my brother (I know I'm gonna be slightly biased here but he's my brother). He panics when he misses a phone call to her, in case she's hurt or anxious. She can get annoyed with him for not being able to spend more time with her because of work or because he worked a late shift. 

The ultimate issue is this, our countries laws at the moment is you must stay within a 2km zone of your home unless you need to a) buy food or b) need to visit a family member who needs special attention i.e. bring groceries to your grandma. Our police are randomly stopping people on the road to make sure they are either essential workers or going shopping. 

Tonight she called and said  something along the lines of ""what do I have to do to get you over here"" my brother was basically like I can't, because of quarantine and he also can't drive so and she seemed to indicate that he was making it worse and that this could end their relationship.

I told him that there was nothing we can do because of the laws in place and that I thought though he might act as a balm to her, she ultimately needs to get better herself with the support of therapy, medication (possibly) and her family.

Was I wrong? Is depression a reason to break quarantine? Technically, it is possible to drive him to her but it's against government guidelines. 

I feel like I'm biased on two fronts because 1) I am very independent and don't totally understand how they can't wait have a month or 2  apart especially with facetime etc and other tech. 2) I have been lucky to never suffer from depression myself, I have had blue moments but nothing as crippling as I have read depression can be. However, it also makes me unsure how to deal with this situation am I being too harse? Or would be giving in coddling her? I just don't want to push too far either way. 

I wanna finally end this with, she has a big family but does not feel super close to them, both her parents remarried and had more children (who she is close with) so I think she feels like a bit of an odd one out at their houses but they do love and support her so she is not totally alone.

TLDR: person suffering from depression wants boyfriend to break isolation rules to help her. Is this advisable?"
1124,"Feels empty, unloved, dilapidated and unappreciated - how could I live like this?","I am just gonna keep things short...

1. I've always experienced many episodes of depression throughout my whole life, and the cycle repeats itself every few years. I would heal, get depressed, heal again, get depressed more, and on and on. The current one is getting unbearable.
2. I had a few dates and they all went pretty well. I've been seeing this guy for about 3 months now and after he told me that we were moving too fast, it seems as though he is no longer interested in me anymore. (I am still closeted so nobody else knows that I'm gay.) What can I say, jokes on me... I am deeply hurt. We are still in contact because I love him so much, but I don't think he knows. 
3. I no longer have any friends after graduating from college. I wasn't the the typical ""nerd"" who had no friends to begin with; in fact, I had friends, and I had everything I needed to have in a typical normalcy, but I guess everything just fell apart when I began to develop self-destructive behaviors to cut off everybody. (I don't know why and how, I believe it's due to my inherent insecurities.) I am just tired of pretending to act social. 
4. I've lost my interest in just about everything. Playing video games, playing music, working out, singing... are no longer fun to do. nOW I just lay in my bed all day contemplating about what I had done wrong as a human being and why couldn't I fix myself to get back on my feet.
5. My family and I are distant, both emotionally and physically. They're all the way back in New York and I am here in Los Angeles. Don't get me wrong, I love them to death, but because of childhood experiences, I've never told them any of my personal matters as I believe that to  falling back on them is to ask for severe reprimands. I feel trapped.
6. The only thing that keeps me at bay and busy as of now is my job. I am a software engineer at a well known corporate but I'm starting to lack motivation in  working as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how can anybody live like this honestly. 

I am lonely and sad. I have the money but none of those things make life interesting to live. I am literally boring myself to death.

Please help."
1125,my mental health as of late (4/5/20),"Quick tw for some people I'm going to be talking about depression and anxiety (also ADHD if that applies I'm not sure)

Also, disclaimer I've never used Reddit before so I am very, VERY new to this.

Since I've gotten back from college I feel like my mental health has taken a big blow and I don't really know how to handle it. I've always had trouble with mental health/disabilities but I can't remember a time when it has been this bad. 

Second semester started amazing and then everything went off the rails over spring break. March 7th I took off with my softball team to go and play in Florida and I thought everything was going to be so perfect. A few days in we started hearing word of schools near ours going remote for the remainder of the spring semester as a precaution. I did not think much of it. We soon found out that our school would be going remote as well but that the spring sports would continue with no spectators allowed. That changed within probably 2 days when our coaches gathered us at their rental house to break the news that spring season would not continue after we got back from Florida. Naturally, we all broke down crying and I really haven't been the same since that moment. I took it really hard. My first ever college softball season is being taken away from me and I'm devastated. 

Since I've been home I've just been getting worse and worse but I just chalked it up to just being my lazy self. I've been home for a few weeks now and very rarely do I leave my bed, if I do its to see if we have food. I went on TikTok a lot and saw a lot of TikToks about other college kids doing the same thing so I again thought it was normal. Because of my ADHD I've always had trouble doing assignments but recently I just can't seem to do anything. Not just assignments but video games, TV shows, youtube videos nothing is fun anymore. I can't find anything to occupy my time with that I actually enjoy.

I didn't notice how big my shift in behavior really was until my mom started to ask me if I was ok. I assumed it was her usual polite inquiry but whenever I'd answer good she'd ask are you sure. That had me thinking why she asked and that's when I started to notice my actions more. They've just gotten progressively worse as the days go on. Today was by far the worst because I actually got up a few times to go do something (which is a big deal) and every time I tried something to make me happier it just wouldn't work. I actually took a shower for the first time in a few days (gross but I feel its relevant). I also did some research and took a few self-assessments online and they all pointed to serious depression. I didn't think I was actually that bad until it asked me those questions. Anxiety has been keeping me awake every night until 2-3 am. 

I would also like to say that the only thing I've actually been diagnosed with that I mentioned in this post is ADHD.  (there's your token disclaimer folks)

The bottom line is I don't know how to get better. I obviously don't want to go make a doctor's appointment right now and I need tips on how to handle it. Advice is very much welcome and thank you in advance if you reply."
1126,Progress!,"So I’ve been digging through my memories to find out why I am so mentally damaged and ruined to this day, and what happened. I’ve been looking through memories of childhood trauma and how they relate today to my life, and I think I’m beginning to piece together a solution on why I am so unhappy in life. So I’m slightly less anxious"
1127,Missed another application deadline.,"I missed another deadline for a job I wanted. Been unemployed for over a year. Have been looking after someone straight after graduating and now I feel like I'm too far behind. I didn't get just any job. It's not that I felt they were below me. I felt like I was running on empty. Ive been working since I was a teenager. Mostly earning half the minimum wage even in 20s. I have no savings. It was either taken from me or expected that I cover debts when my parents lost all they're money. 

I spent almost a year doing nothing and barely seeing friends since 2018. I'm broke so I couldn't go anywhere. It's my fault. I took on responsibilities I felt my family was neglecting. Im not even sure if I did the right thing.

My friends are really nice. They pity me, I can tell. I have nothing to contribute to relationships. They're all moving on with they're lives and they trying to help me move forward. But I just feel like a weight on them. The more they try the worse I feel.

I've forgotten how to hold a conversation. I haven't been in a relationship in over 10 years. Ive woken  every morning for over year wanting to end it all. I won't, because there are certain people who won't understand. I know that sounds like a cop out. I tried once as a teen, but I won't again because I don't want to pass these feelings on to someone  else.

I wish I could feel like I was living for me. I'm stuck."
1128,Why do I HAVE to stay alive?,I'm just miserable constantly. For 6 going on 7 years I've just felt empty and depressed. Isn't it selfish for people to not let me pass so I can stop feeling this pain?
1129,Need any kind of feedback on this,"Posting this on a throwaway account because the people involved with my main one might see it otherwise.  


I'm a 22 year old Male and over the past 6-7 years, I have developed an awful system that traps me in an unhealthy cycle that I have no idea how to break. I do not currently have access to professional help and all the support groups I tried didn't end up doing anything for me.   


In a normal, everyday state I feel almost nothing but apathy about myself. I feel for myself as much as I feel about a random stranger on the street. If I see them struggle, I go ""shame"" but keep moving. And I treat myself the same way. I had a lot of issues at home as a kid but was never able to voice them anywhere for a few reasons. And over the course of time, I really did not want to voice them anymore because I stopped caring about myself in that way.  


The only reason I still keep my body relatively healthy and my mind quick is because I care about others so much. Especially my friends and family and my amazing girlfriend. But that is also where the problem is. I only really live for them and not for myself because I just can't feel anything about myself. No like or dislike, just apathy.   


Recently, my girlfriend tried to coax me to speak more about my past or any problem I encouner during the day really but that is where the second part of my system snaps in place. Whenever this general state of apathy about myself gets disturbed, either by accident or on purpose, I instantly dissociate right then and there and feel absolutely nothing anymore. No physical touch, no pain, no stress but also all the affection for my family, friends and even my girlfriend is gone. I become absolutely hollow and numb for around 1-8 hours.   


Right now, I just came out of one of these cycles and I can see how frustrated and hurt my girlfriend is. I really just need anyone to give me some opinions about what I can do. If I don't care about myself and let the apathy reign, my body starts to suffer and sustain injuries and if no one is around to please, I cease to do anything until there is someone again. But if I do care about myself (or try to), my body forcibily shuts down all emotions and feelings and leaves me as a numb shell.   


Doesn't matter if it is advise, help or just opinions but I know something has to change so i'm ready for anything"
1130,Enjoying being rude to people on occasion,is it healthy to enjoy being rude to people on occasion?
1131,How my parents caused(and still cause) my depression and anxiety(long post),"Yes, I know it may sound harsh, but some of you may relate to this without even knowing it.
I still remember my parents LITERALLY pulling me from both my hands(my mom pulling one of my hands towards her and my the other way around) fighting over who I belong to which may have been my first trauma (at 4 years old), I remember my mom’s mental breakdowns, she went to the store, bought a packet of cigarettes, bought one beer and sat at the balcony crying and then coming inside the house and yelling at me and my brother for not doing some chore (this used to happen when I was 7-10 approximately). I tried to kill myself in class because I yelled at my teacher (I was a stupid kid) and I knew she would call my mom which would lead to her screaming at me and telling me she’s gonna send me to live with my father (she basically threatened me and still does every time I do something, even for the smallest thing) so I guess I thought the smart move would be to kms before it happens. From 7th grade-11th grade (now) my mom moved to a different technique. Every time we get into an argument and I speak up and say something (that’s most likely correct) she becomes the victim, she presents herself as a poor 50 year old lady whose life was way too hard (and they were, she had cancer, my father used to beat her and etc.) and that I torment her and that I hate her, basically she thinks everything revolves around her. The way she scarred me and my brother for life is so sad to me. My brother developed anger issues and is dealing with them now (he’s 22), he too, tried to kill himself when he served in the army (my mom kicked him out of the house). I developed anxiety from years and years of mental abuse. Every time I get near my Mom I get anxious, when we argue I get anxiety attacks and than my depression kicks in, every time I feel depressed, my mom notices it and says I can control it. I’m honestly fed up.
But the point of this post is to show our generation how crucial parenting is for your children’s mental health. Don’t bring kids into this world if you’re not ready for them mentally."
1132,why go on...,"I am just exhausted... I have been trying to ""get over"" the tragedies that have occurred in my life but I can't. everybody says that it takes time and stuff like that... I've been struggling for a decade right now I cannot take it anymore. I started making plans since last year... to say my goodbyes, and then this pandemic happened, and well I'm stranded without being able to even visit my family. I have been on tons of medications for about 5 years and none have helped me, the ones that do make me feel like a zombie and magically times go by faster. I feel that I am not supposed to be here, nothing feels right to me, I haven't belonged anywhere since I can remember... believe me I have tried. I have tried to make friends, to join clubs, to volunteer, to matter in any way but I am always the odd one out. the one that never gets invited, the one that doesn't fit in anything. I had a couple of things that held me to this life but now it seems just not enough. no family, no friends, nothing..."
1133,Take a read,"Where do I begin? Make of it what you will but this is my life. For months now I’ve believed I have a problem with my external occipital protuberance changing etc, for the last two months I’ve been prodding at it everyday and you know what yeah it has changed on some days,  some days it felt as if the bone had completed collapsed it felt like a crushed monster munch on one side. I believe these things because of how I feel physically throwing up everyday and feeling generally horrific. But my mind also plays a massive part. For years I’ve suffered with anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and hypochondria. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks or maybe it aint. More recently I had an experience where out of no where just at random, something came over my throat like a sensation would but it was uncomfortable very uncomfortable, it’s left me over the last few days believing that somehow, a part of my skull I’ve been prodding at and felt like a crushed crisp has made its way to the back of my throat and is lodged there. Crazy right? That’s what I’m convinced of I’m convinced I’m going to die because of my head, I’m convinced part of my skull is stuck in my throat. This is how my head works. Do I need a psychiatrist? I most definitely do but this is what goes on in my head day to day touching it every 5 minutes exactly 3 times. I thought I’d vent it out on here. Not look for advice just vent to see your take on it yourself. Thank you"
1134,Strategies for Coping with Anxiety,"I've been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and I tend to get really bad anxiety attacks maybe 2 or 3 times a month. Sometimes I can fight them off, but lately I've been having a hard time dealing with them.

I'm reluctant to start taking benzos because I already have low blood pressure and I'm worried about complications.

What sort of behavioral therapy do you guys use to help with anxiety?"
1135,How to pick the right medication?,"I made an appt with my dr tomorrow to discuss my options. 
A little background I have suffered from anxiety for a majority of my life and I have depression (that has been around since a few years ago) 
I want to pick the right anti anxiety/depression medication. Ive done research and I know about them but I want to hear personal experience.
I want to be happier, stop having sudden panic, and be able to get out of bed after 8hrs of sleep. But I dont want to gain weight or not be able to drink alcohol.
What medications do you take and how has it worked out for you?"

1137,Being a bitch sometimes - is it important to well-being?,is being too nice healthy?
1138,Little to no interest in others.,"With all of this self isolation and what not, I have had quite a lot of time to take care of things around the house and in my life that were on the back burner before. Including some serious introspection. I have always lived in my head, but recently, it's really, in my opinion, better than dealing with people. I use to feel so much empathy for others, going out on limbs all over the place. ""You need a car? Here, use mine."" ""You need money? I have some extra saved up, pay me back whenever."" ""You need xyz? Here, I'll help in any way I can."" And, without fail, each and every one of these people really just screwed me over, in some of the worst possible ways. And recently, after a coworker did the same right before quarantine, I thought: fuck it. fuck them. fuck literally everyone. Need help? Do it your goddamn self. Need someone to use their AAA miles to tow your car? Good luck, sis. 

I'm now perfectly happy saying less that 50 words a day. Seeing no one. Talking to no one. Dealing with no one. Knowing that there is no one that has any power over me. And I'm done. 

Humans are social creatures. So, it kind of dawned on me, is this normal behavior? Is it symptomatic of an antisocial disorder? (would it help if I threw in working in customer service for years?) 

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks guys."
1139,Advice to help a family member,"I think my brother is depressed. He's 24 years old and we live in the USA. We've all asked him what's wrong but he won't respond. He dosen't speak when spoken to and often turns away when we try to start a conversation with him. He  distances himself from everyone, he dosen't even want to eat dinner with us. This is getting scary.  Something has been wrong for a while and there's no way to find out what it is.

We're going to try to get a doctor involved, but I'm feeling pretty helpless. I keep talking to him even if he won't talk back.  I don't know what I can do to make him feel better. Any advice or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated."
1140,MH the cause of my problems? (m/20),"Hey,

so about 3 months ago I went to my family doc to check out my blood values because I feel like having no energy since being a kid. I was always told that it is because I hit puberty and that it will go away someday (children's doc then). So now, many years later, I still feel like doing nothing. The blood values were all fine so the doc told me that mental health problems may be the cause. I would tend to say that I am relatively ok right now, even when some things happened in the past. For example there was an accident in 2012 which costed my little brother's (he was 5) and nearly my mom's life (coma, now well recovered). My dad was since I can remember an alcoholic (non-abusive) and stopped drinking 2-3 years ago. Also we lived in poverty my whole life (even besides all these things I get really well with my parents). All of this things don't seem to bother me (I only get sensitive if my brother is being brought up). And there are things that may seem silly in comparison but those things bother me really bad. Like my receding hairline, my acne or the fact that I don't have any close friends.

I don't what I should do. I don't feel like going to a psychologist and I probably never will. This post even may be a rant. Idk."
1141,Help and advice for my girlfriend stuggling with depression.,"So my girlfriend has struggled with depression her whole life. This has been coupled with drug addiction as for a long time that has been the only thing she thinks makes her happy. Shes recently come to the realisation that this isnt making her truly happy and shes finding it really hard to find any sort of meaning or fulfulment in life. She started councilling a few weeks before the corona outbreak and it went AMAZING. She finds it really hard to open up to anybody and for the session she asked me to go in with her because she felt she wouldn't be able to open up. I expected it to be me speaking for the whole session giving the councillor everything I know about her situation but boy was I wrong. She instantly opened up to this woman straight away and I was over the moon with excitement about it. It seemed so perfect she even said herself she could'nt believe how open she was being. Then this corona thing happened and it's got a bit shit again. We spent the first part of the lockdown (we're in the uk) together at her house and it was great. The thought of being locked inside didn't matter because we had each other. Now im at my parents house the thought of spending months apart is horrible for the both of us. We've decided to ignore the government guidlines slightly (and the views of our parents lol) for the benefit of our mental health and meet in Bristol where we both attend university to spend the rest of the lockdown together. I wish we could start councilling again with this woman however I don't think that's going to be a possibility. We have asked her to do a video councilling session however I'm not sure if that will be as good for my girlfriend but it's worth a try. I'm so fucking extremely worried about her I just want her to get better, it sucks so much that she started to make great strides in getting better and this shitty virus has fucked it all up.

The main point of this post however is because she has just sent me a message and asked for my advice and I wanted to ask the people of reddit for their advice too. I have told her the advice that I can give which is basically take an hour once a day to chillout. Use part of that time to meditate with the headspace app but mainly focus on taking a break from these thoughts and emotions to try and take a step back from it all.

Here's what she sent me anyway, If you guys have any advice that can kind of work in the moment to help feel okay while all this is going on in her head that would be great. and apologies if i don't reply instantly. Thanks in advance

""Does anybody know what to do when you just want to give up. I can't even think straight, the thought of actually thinking properly seems like too much of a tas. I don't know where to start. All these thoughts are jumble up in my head, I can't make sense of anthing. How do I get out of this cycle, what can I do to just help me think and be bothered to live?"""
1142,I’ve been dizzy and anxious for months. Not sure what’s going on,"One night last November, I fell asleep feeling a bit of vertigo. I was woken up in the middle of the night in a very anxious state. I thought it would go away the next morning. It hasn’t. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night in a very dissociated state, super confused about what is going on and it almost feel like I’m dreaming while awake. During the day I’ll feel fine with occasional spikes of dizziness/vertigo, but when I’m in bed trying to fall asleep it can get intense. I’ve visited a doctor, they didn’t have much to say other than “I might have anxiety”. I’m pretty young so I’m just really confused what it might be, I was wondering if anyone has heard something like this? I don’t think it’s just “anxiety”, I don’t get that anxious and I can have all these symptoms without any anxiety."
1143,Hello I have a few questions about self harm and depression," 

For starters what exactly is depression? What EXACTLY makes it depression. Everyone gets sad at points in their life and for a good reason. If theres no reason to being sad is it depression? If there is a reason does it not? I have never really understood exactly what depression is and how to know if you have it.

2nd question. Whenever i get angry i cannot calm down unless i feel pain. Anywhere in my body hands, feet, legs or head. I have to give myself pain for anger to stop. I normally just hit myself in the legs a few times and its over. If i dont i will be angry until I do it. Why do I do this? and what can i do to not do it? I have done it since i was a child and i used to run into doors head 1st because i was too weak to cause any other pain when i was angry. Now i have grown up and got stronger I can hurt other areas of my body that will not cause as much damage.

3rd question. Randomly out of nowhere a few times a week i get the urge to just hit myself for no reason. Nothing brings it on i could be watching tv, playing games and all of a sudden i get this urge to hit/slap myself. I can stop myself but sometimes the urge is too great. This has only started happening recently which made me come here and ask all of this because im just like wtf. I know theres a reason for everything else but theres no reasoning behind this.

Few notes for context:

I am not suicidal, I am insanely scared of dieing to the point i got myself into a month of not being able to sleep well as i kept thinking about dieing and not being anymore. I could never take my own life. That shit be too valuable to me.

I have never cut or harmed myself in a way that could possible cause death because reason above.

I am a man, 18 from the UK.

Any other info you guys would like to know just ask. I will be fairly open unless it comes to private details that could reveal my identity."
1144,Do I have a problem,I have come to the realization that my lasting relationships are always with depressed and unstable girls. I keep starting things based on physical attraction and staying with them out of sheer guilt. I feel like I have grown accustomed to this dynamic and it has hindered  my ability to start relationships with healthier girls that I really like.
1145,How do i stop my sister from giving herself an eating disorder?,"I tried posting this to r/ advice but all i got was people telling me to let her continue self harming just because she was overweight.......

but my little sister (f17) has suddenly started a really drastic 'diet'. shes logging her calories on an app, and shes confessed to be that she's probably only eating between 600-900 calories a day. Last night she told me that she needed 1100? calories or something like that for her to lose ""drastic weight"" so she obviously knows shes really low balling it. 

When i was a sophomore i did the same thing, and now i have severe body confidence issues and i dont want her to permanently ruin her relationship with her body and food like i did.

Ive been telling her to eat and serving her normal portions of food, but as soon as i turn my back she scoops the food back. Shes just so stubborn and defensive. Theres a history of BPD in our family and although shes undiagnosed we're all pretty sure she has it too. She lashes out whenever we mention anything about how little shes eating. She started this about a month ago.

Yesterday was her birthday and it mad me angry that she wouldnt eat her own birthday cake. she refuses to believe that there can be balance between healthy foods and treats. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated."
1146,Should I seek help?,"I [17F] feel like most things in life really don't matter because one day we're going to to die. Like I never cared about my grades because I would just think 'but were gonna so who cares what I get' and whenever I get panic attacks I always think 'this will only go on for a few more years then I'll be dead so it's ok' but whenever I talk about this with my friends they're all astonished by the fact that I think like that. Do you guys think that it's alright to think like this? I mean it doesn't really affect me negatively, in fact it helps when I'm anxious about something (I have anxiety) because I just think 'it doesn't even matter cause you're gonna die'. Basically am I ok or should I talk to someone about this. 

TLDR: Weird mindset, need help."

1148,"I recovered from mental health problems, I now just want to enjoy my newfound happiness and not have a job, is this normal?","I am a 25 yo university student, I suffered from panic attacks for 4 years, I spent every single day for those years reading self-help books non stop for hours, listening to podcast, understanding why I was feeling that way and learning how to have a good mindset. I now think I hacked it, I have been happy and grateful everyday for several months now and I am just so happy with myself for having saved my life (I was suicidal at times, couldn't get out of bed in the morning, etc), I am in good shape, I eat very healthy, I never smoke or drink, I resolved my childhood traumas, I am dating a nice guy, I think I could buy a second home and be financially independent very easily thanks to property income from a house that I inherited (it isn't much, but £1000 a month with work or having to pay rent is pretty good). The things is, all I want to do now is to learn art, music, dance, read, sing and enjoy all these things that I always dreamed of doing but that I never had time or support to do. I don't want to get a job (I would like to build my own business, but I don't want a normal 9-5 job), and I just want to learn new things and take a sort of gap year enjoying my hard earned peace of mind - am I being lazy? Should I be more ambitious and want to get a career like everyone else? Will this lead to me having no experience with a proper job and having future financial problems if my business idea doesn't go well?is it weird that I just want to spend my days learning arts (I am a stem student atm) and not do anything with my degree and not really have a desire to have a job?

I understand this post might be a little confusing and all over the place, I guess what I am trying to say is: can I take a gap year just learning arts and building a business? Am I being lazy for wanting to live off an income that I was basically gifted and should I be harder on myself and put more pressure on myself to just have a job like everyone else ?

Sorry if these questions sound obvious to some of you, but I am genuinely confused and I would appreciate any sort of point of view from other people, positive or negative, Just please be kind if you got some criticism to do."
1149,Permanently socially stunted,"I'm pretty sure I'm socially stunted beyond repair. Since childhood, I've lived a pretty secluded life. This has lead me to become very socially awkward. I've held your basic retail jobs where even with daily interactions with customers and coworkers, It's still very difficult to interact with others. I become anxious and even the few people who were close to me, still considered me to be awkward and closed off. Its painful since I either miss or overreact to social cues and I get worried that people are angry with me when they're not. Is there anyway to fix my complete social ineptness or do i just have to accept that's how I am?"
1150,Curious if anyone else is like this,"For as long as I can remember I've acted in a self destructive way in regards to most things in my life. But it's always been in such an apathetic way. Like I'll self harm and feel nothing from it, I do it because I can and that's it, it's just some kind of detached bordem that I feel. But there's never actually any motivation to do it and I feel or experience no benefits or release from doing it.

Same goes for taking drugs or drinking a lot, I'm aware that I'm damaging my body and all that but I don't really care, it's kind of a cold, disconnected not caring that I have to remind myself I should probably feel. I've destroyed good relationships with people for absolutely no reason, no anger or sadness about it or anything. Just suddenly decided I was going to do that, but it felt like absolutely nothing. What's more I don't regret it at all, that coldness has just kinda lingered with me.

I know that's a bit of a ramble I'm sorry, but I just want to know if anyone else experiences things like this? I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder a few years ago, but I don't know if this is a common experience for that."

1153,I havent felt proper emotions in a very long time.,"I would describe myself as feeling nothing most of the time recently with everything going on its no surprise I've cried and have overall felt pretty sad but I can't remember the last time I was truly truly happy. I feel like often time when I'm in a situation where I should be happy I can fake it and laugh like I should but at any moment I could just turn it off and feel nothing. I haven't been able to feel empathy for others for as long as I remember, if someone gets hurt I really don't care. I have a hard time making any sort of emotional connection with anyone because of it. I just want to lay in bed all day and do nothing but text and watch TV and with college course's going completely online I'm really struggling to even pay attention, even now I have a months worth of homework due that I haven't started.

1155,Can you make phone calls whenever you want from a mental hospital?,"Sorry if this isn’t the place for this sort of question, but someone close to me was recently involuntarily admitted. They called me on Friday to let me know they were admitted and said they’d be calling while they were in there but I haven’t heard from them since. I know it’s only been two days, but I’m kind of anxious and apprehensive about texting them because someone else has their phone if they’re still in the hospital. When in the the hospital, is there a limit to your phone calls and when you can make them? I’m just a little bit worried

Also, what is the process for being involuntarily admitted? I know there’s a 72 hour thing I’m not super clear on, but I’ve been reading it could take longer. Thanks"

1157,Trapped with Abusive Parents,"Hi guys. 

Basically i live with my abusive parents (they punch and treat me like trash for the smallest mistake ever)

im 25 yo. (yes im old) and i have 2 other siblings (both are treated better). im a boy yet feminine hence why i assume they treat me like that. 

i want to live on my own but i have some problems.

1. expensive to live alone (i work minimum wage)
2. i dont like that my other siblings lives will be much more easier. basically all money and properties my parents have will go to them.

HELP.

i want to proceed to medicine to get a higher salary after that i could finally leave. but i need to get scholarship first in order to do that.

now if i dont get any scholarships, i kinda want to start a business but im not sure if i like that idea for the following reasons.

1. in business you need reliable people, hence a family but that wont happen with me.

also you might be thinking if why not just start a family. i have the following reasons.

1. expensive.
2. im feminine and i think im asexual.

HELP"
1158,I am lost,"Current diagnoses: S.A.D, health anxiety, adhd. 

I don’t really know where to begin. Im turning 30 this year, parents pay for everything and nothing is getting any better only worse. I havent met anyone apart from drive through cashiers for over a month now. Mainly due to the covid stuff, but all i did before was stay home until someone forced me to go to the pub, where i would get blind drunk. The next day i wake up with bad anxiety and want to kms. The one time i actually went down to the psych emergency they locked me up and brought in a security guard to escort me. Finished therapy for social phobia but it doesnt feel like it did much. All my friends are doing drugs to a certain degree, which has caused me to distance myself from them as much as possible. I dont have much self control and the only thing keeping me from completely fucking my life up is that i am too scared to ask people for drugs. I used to smoke alot of weed before but now not so much. Max 2 times per month, and i never keep any at home. Quit because it was fucking up my psyche even more. Started becoming extremely paranoid, not knowing if flies i saw were real, flashes of lighting midday. 
I have also been having periods of time where i obsess over my sexuality and think im gay when im not. Its exhausting. Fucking neighbour wakes me up every day with their piano smashing which makes my already shitty sleep worse.
Nowadays i have suicidal thoughts around 3 days a week at least, i also got my urge to hurt myself back. I overeat to the point of nausea. The psych ward does or did do checkup calls on me but i quit answering the phone. I dont see the point anymore wasting both my time and theirs. 
All my friends have full time jobs that are well payed, and i cant even hold a job for more than 2 months before i break down. Applied to over 30 jobs in january, 0 replies. 
Im not on any medication apart from melatonin because i hate taking pills. I cry for no reason at even fucking tv ads. Wtf should i do?"

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for some time and seemed to have it fairly managed until COVID-19 disrupted my (and everyone else's) life. I am very lucky to have a job where I can work from home, but as I have some health conditions, I cannot leave my home for the foreseeable future and it is doing a number on me and my mental wellbeing. Please share any resources you've found to be helpful during this trying time. I appreciate it!"
1163,My sister said I’m constantly being deceived. Now I’ve lost all trust in her.,"Maybe I’m naive, stupid, gullible, but up until last night I never once doubted I could trust my younger sister. We both high and someone the conversation led to common sense, which my sister said I had none of. She then told me this whammy:
“You’re constantly being deceived”
So now my entire perception of my life has changed and I’m doubting that I can trust any of my family members. Again, maybe I’m incredibly stupid I’ve never thought in my 22 years of life I should be wary of my own family and that they may not be telling the truth. Of course people lie, but being *constantly deceived* I just feel like an idiot. 

Is the only option to move out? I’m really not in a good place right now, I don’t know what to do. The only other person I’d feel comfortable confiding in is my therapist and now I’m not even sure I feel comfortable with that."
1164,Living situation leading to mental health deterioration,"Hi I'm a 17yr old f high school senior who currently lives with her father, his wife and my half sister. I recently moved in a month ago and that's when everything was going down to shit. 

Previously I have moved out without looking back and mentally was a wreak. My father's partner used scream at me and call me pathetic about the simplest things in a horrible matter. Such as I was told to take out the rubbish by my father so I did and then I got told off by her for not replacing the bag when I was told to straight away to do dishes that were never mine btw. I used to get told off by my father that I never washed my dishes but when I told him they weren't mine he would complain about work and tell me off for not washing his dishes. There was a time period right as my baby sister was born and right before that everytime I entered the kitchen for food I'd get stared at and critised. So at one point I decided to stop eating properly and basically went on a milk diet to not disturb them. Cause I was disturbing my dad's partner. At one point I tried to start making food at odd times because I thought it would be a better way to avoid them except I got told off about making sound. Because there was seemingly to be financial issues at one point and I avoided contact with them. I asked for an allowance every week which I lived on as I didn't go grocery shopping with them. It was $50 which I would live on for about 1 to sometimes 2 weeks. Essentially when his partner had an issue with me she would complain to my father and get him to tell me off or critise me directly. When I went to see my cousins with my mother I realised my situation wasn't normal causing me to crumble into pieces infront of my other sister's. My mother would give me living allowances for food and basically told me to immediately move with her when I could. So I did that. As soon as the term of school came to an end on a Thursday I packed up everything and moved everything. Cleaned the place and didn't look back.

I was happy and had people I live and trust surround me. If i made mistakes or made noise it was okay. I was treated with kindness. Then as I was allowed to go on an outing for one of the first times alone I decided to go out to an anime convention with a large allowance to simply have fun. The next weekend happens and then I learn that my dad's partner has been crying because she lost her wedding ring. And I was getting basically blamed for it essentially. On the phone he was like ""I'll put up a reward to whoever finds it"" as well as asking me questions. Apparently she hid it in the bathroom in her own fking section under the bathroom sink closets hair spray can or something like that. With a tissue on top of it according to her. And she happens  to realise she lost it when I move out . It was to the point that my oldest sister had to vouch to my dad that I didn't steal it. And he would still bring up that the ring had something so if it was to every be 'sold he'll find out who did it. Going to each one of my friends asking if they seen it that had entered the house. My friends have anxiety issues and wanted to confront them. I let him confront two but one since she was still taking anti depressants and therapy. I didn't want her to stress out. He would complain about this for a while. We basically didn't stay in contact unless special events happened and he called to see if I was going. So about 3 times a year for nearly three years. 

My mother is not the most reliable financially however she is the most sweetest and kindest person alive. Treating me as her baby she always put my priorities on a stand . Bought me food because she thought I wasn't eating properly. Made sure I was alright and simply was there for me when I needed it. We had financial problems because she didn't want to take on a proper job anymore because of bad influences from previous partners. Anyways we moved acouple times so we were closer to my grandmother since she lived my little brother alot. Finding ways to complain that he should live with her instead we gave up and ended up living in my uncle's flat right next to my grandmother's. Without realising we learn that my mother hasn't paid the rent in 3months and tried to get money quickly. We were kicked out basically(monday). Telling us to immediately move everyone started packing. Originally the plan was my middle sister moves into a place near by with me and her bf. I'll pay rent whenever I can. However they had to find a place in 3 days which was basically impossible. So then my other plan was for me was to move in my other side grandparents since they raised me up I called them. However they didn't let me move there. So the only place I could go was my dad's. I skipped acouple days of school (Tuesday and wednesday) and moved out. At the same time I still did the work that school assigned that I wasn't class for and basically got into a mutual break up. We had relationship problems and I tried to break up the week before but then we decided to continue trying. For a week whilst I was trying to move we barely talked. He told me it was because he was sick. I was an emotional wreak and was lonely. Crying basically everyday for a week. He broke up with me early Sunday to only call me back midnight Sunday that he regretted breaking up and wanted me back. Telling me that really during that week we barely talked he told me that he was sick however he was spending that whole time in touch with his ex. Going to her place or she was taking care of him. During that Sunday after the break up he kissed her and realised he didn't have feelings for her and left to go tell me that he wanted me back and it felt like he was with the wrong person. Keep in mind during the last time I tried to break up he told me he couldn't trust me anymore which I understood and wanted some space. So I gave it to him. And we were in a long distance relationship. I didn't know he was with his ex at all during the time and he didn't want to tell him cause he felt like I'd break up with him at any point and time so he simply just didn't tell me. I told him i needed a break from all this so i told him i mjght talk to him in a couple weeks. During the day in between this I was building ikea furniture and tripped on a piece whilst holding another heavy one. Causing alot of bruising around my left knee. I'm the kind of person who likes to bottle everything up so I ended up tearing up alittle and then on the following week I decided to go to the doctors (as per usual by myself) and get a scan. And was prescribed some painkillers. 

As the time went by I studied 5 days a week and worked about 3 times a week. I decided to focus on myself and buy essentials that I've been needing for a while. However as soon as I got in contact with him my anxiety went through the roof and then I became self destructive. And told him I didn't want to have contact with him anymore and that I'm sorry because I need to learn to love myself first before putting someone else first in my life again. Blocked him. Tried to move on. I ended up taking a break from school since I got sick. Apparently I had laryngitis according to my doctor. During school I felt dizzy leading me to being sent home. After my break the school skeleton system was implanted in NSW Australia. So I was emailed by the deputy principle that everyone was to stay home unless their parents worked in something like health or essential workers and wanted their children to be supervised. As a child my parents weren't there for notes and shit so naturally I took this information and informed my dad and stayed home. Listening to the deputy and started doing school work at home. Then I got called out by my dad's wife stating I don't know what im talking about. As a student who's in the education system I know what's happening goddamn well cause I have to stay updated since I'm in my largest and it's affecting me one of the most. I told her that they implemented the skeleton system currently and that we were all told to stay home unless our circumstances state otherwise. I've always been home alone whilst they went out even when they were said to have financial issues they would go buy food outside. She told me off stating there was no skeleton school system (I'm pretty sure she didn't understand what it meant) and then asked for my evidence. I brought out the email that was sent to me and pointed out that even if I went there we would only be supervised. As said so in the email. We would all be assigned work online. She asked my subjects and I answered ancient history,music,drama,standard english and biology. To only get laughed at and she told my dad to just keep me home as if I was a joke. Skipping to now all I ve ever been doing to accommodating to others during this quarantine and I want to be away from them. Critised for not doing work when I am or having to much fun. I willingly took care of my baby sister until I had a work shift which I told them before hand. This whilst juggling my assignments and other assigned school work.

 I've been mentally struggling recently and attempting to cope. I haven't seen my mother since the move and I miss her alot but I can't go see her. I'm just really tired from everything. Thank you for reading this far and dealing with my horrible English. 

Tdlr: Within a week I moved,broke up with bf and still went to school and work. I'm an emotional wreak. I live with my father and his wife and i don't think I'm getting any better since I have a bad relationship with his wife and trust issues with my dad."
1165,Have I been lied to?,"It was November of 2018 after a panic attack at 3 am that I got sent to the ER and subsequently admitted into a mental health program in the hospital. Two weeks go by and I've learned much about myself and self therapy. I get sent home and everything is good and I'm really happy.

A few months go by and my situation starts declining again. The amount of pills I have to take increases as well as the dosages. I feel like I'm going insane and some things in life hit me really hard from losing friends to barely finishing high school. I was a mess. 

In the past year I had been told that I have anxiety, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, potentially bipolar, etc.

I got sick and tired of the amount of medication I would take daily on top of other medical issues I have. 

Come February of this year I move states to live with my brother and his family. Everything is going fine and dandy when I get a panic attack after talking to my mom. My brother and my sister and law stay with me through it and I calm down, but everything just feels ruined by then...

Ruined in a sense that I thought I could escape my life back in my old state... it feels impossible now.

A few days later, my brother... he tells me a lot of things that we feel and the things that happen to us are greatly impacted by the way we think. In addition, a lot of things that we think are true about us are only true because others tell us it is. An example: I got diagnosed with mental health issues, so therefore ""I am depressed and anxious"". Often times he tells me it's not true. I feel like I don't know what to believe. I feel like no has ever asked HOW I FEEL.

I've been through therapy, countless psychiatrist appointments, and even therapy groups. I don't feel particularly wrong, but it just feels empty. I feel like my therapist would be the only one to listen to me. 

I'm really frustrated. I feel empty, alone, and unheard. I feel as though no one I'm supposed to be close with validates my feelings. 

Anxiety is often correlated with paranoia right? I constantly feel this way. I'm always afraid of the worst possible outcome to any situation and I feel as though I'm just a disaster waiting to explode. I feel useless and tired. 

What can I do? I want to be happy and feel validated. I don't want to be stuck in an endless cycle of feeling nothing at all."
1166,everyone hates me and its never going to get better,"college was a chance to get away from hs and all of the negativity it brought me but since the quaratine ive had to stay in my home town and it’s bought up past problems.

i had my friends in hs and i just tried to live my life and b happy and stay out of everyone’s way. but id always hear ppl talking shit about my saying that they dont like me or someone trying to start beef w me, ppl that i didnt even no. and its like what did i ever do to u? like u dont even no me? i try to b friendly and nice to everyone but ppl r still out to get me bc ig im an “easy target”. my close friends try to reassure me and told me that it’s just because they’re jealous of me but jealous of what? Like I wasn’t the most popular girl in high school and I was pretty smart but I wasn’t very smart either. Like I can see what they’re saying that if anyone doesn’t like me it’s just because they’re jealous, but I don’t like to think that because I’m not really a self-absorbed person and I just assume that the reason people don’t like me is because there’s something wrong with me. 

i’ve also just been really stressed out with all this online work and it just never ends like I never get a break, and everything is just piling up and i think about how everyone’s just out to get me sometimes. i wish i could not care and usually i dont but sometimes i just wonder where i went wrong and what im doing wrong for so many ppl to hate me. 

i have such bad trust issues too from ex friends that sometimes i dont even want to put myself out there bc im afraid of being treated like shit again. 

i just feel like the drama of hs will never go away and im trying to move past it and move on but it just keeps coming back up. it feels like it’ll never get better."
1167,Social distancing and getting help,"Hi, new person here. Ive been seeing a psychiatrist for several months now for general anxiety and PTSD. My dr finally said we could discuss medication to help handle the anxiety, and it could be discussed at our next appointment, since we were having a phone appointment and he did not want to discuss medication without being face to face. Due to COVID-19, my insurance has moved all in person appointments to phone appointments. This is supposed to go until the end of the crisis, which is going to be at least 2 months. The anxiety levels are so high that I haven't been able to sleep or hold down food well. Is anyone else having similar issues, and were you able to get help?"
1168,Is this a symptom of an illness or just a bad habit?,"I’m a senior in high school, and I’ve yet to get diagnosed with anything because finding a doctor is so difficult. I’m pretty sure I have at least depression, but that’s going off topic. Anyway, since freshman year I’ve been doing this really odd thing. I spend at least an hour or more every day kind of running/skipping around my house. About 90% of the time I do this listening to music that triggers vivid daydreams about imagined trailers for shows, edits, stage play choreography, fantasy lives and scenarios, compositions for art pieces, etc. Yeah, I’m an artist. These can even cause me to show emotions, mouth out phrases of make facial expressions that I imagine in the daydreams. The other few times, I might be watching something for an interest I’m very passionate about at the time and it makes me excited enough to get the urge to run and jump around. If I can’t find time to do this, or if I’m in a place where it’s inappropriate to, it does make me feel uncomfortable and antsy, but it’s not debilitating either. Sometimes I will be doing something at home (like drawing) and a song will come on that triggers that urge, so I put down what I’m doing to satisfy it. My brother does it too, though not as often, and the rest of my family makes fun of us for it. I’ve only heard of a few other people who do this online. Is it just a weird thing that I’ve conditioned myself into doing or is it apart of a bigger problem?"
1169,Toxic people are destroying life,"If my English is broken I'm sorry, why when i see any Goddamm there must one asshole who sent hateful comments or calling name.. i know, ignore it, well talking is alot easily then reality.. i can't fall in love with myself when all i see are bad comments about one race or other places, I'm tried.. and disappointed in humanity..  i know life isn't like that.. if you see a hateful comments and leave it... that person.. will continue.. you must fight back to shut them.. all i want little more love"
1170,I don’t care if I become another stat,"I’m in the military, I don’t think I can do this anymore. It seems like everyone back home already forgot about me, I can’t make friends here, and one of my higher ups even said they think lesser of me. I can’t seek mental help because they’ll just kick me out, then I’ll have to explain to my family why I’m home so early not to mention it’ll be on my record forever. My family will see me as a quitter, and likely call me that for the rest of my life. They would likely see me as just another loser in a family of losers. I can’t go home, and I can’t stay here. I only see one way out. Honestly offing myself would be one more nudge towards the military to finally fix their toxic hierarchy, and a big middle finger to the rest of my family, who wouldn’t support or be understanding towards me if I came home. Fuck it it’s my only way out."
1171,Covid and PTSD,"I’m a college student home from school due to the coronavirus, and living at home like I did in high school (which is when my trauma happened) is giving me very intruding flashbacks and I can’t make them go away"
1172,corona makes me depressed,All the time alone leads to the invasive thoughts in my head to run unchecked. It's like a never ending loop. Doesn't help that i was sexually assaulted in october and never got proper help for that.
1173,My step-dad,So basically I hate him with all my heart he was a drug addict and an abusive person towards my mom but when we went to church he changed but you know what i hate is how inadequate he makes me feel and how many times he forces us to go to church because then he'll go back on the coke. Hes still a fuckin asshole. I just couldn't find the vaseline and he gets really angry at me while pulling a fucking vaseline bottle from the fucking ether. He just loves to make me feel worse so I'm more prone to take orders. He really tries way to hard to implement the Christian way in our home and its fucking annoying.
1174,looking for advice?,"A little backstory; (Or just skip to the issue at hand below)

My dad wasn't the nicest of people and he mentally hurt me a lot to the point where I would be a stupid attention-seeking teenager (because I guess I just wanted, and I really still do want, attention from literally anybody) by slicing up my arms and posting it on social media or keeping it to myself or what have you, and I never stopped wearing hoodies blah blah blah, and my mental health got worse and worse until my dad decided that he'd take me to the hospital and get me sent to a mental hospital, which happened multiple times until finally I was put into DCFS care and put into a 6 month long in-patient hospital in Atlanta, GA, which really changed my perspective on things and when I got out I was sent to live with my grandmother (who I still live with) and started to get better and better, but I don't feel like I really got better because I've always been the fat, ugly, and anti-social kid in school and I really just still am, but I want to work better on myself, which here comes the issue at hand;

I need advice for this;

I don't shower often, and when I do it's only at nights before school or when I go to see my girlfriend, and I haven't showered in about 2 or 3 weeks due to the COVID-19 outbreak because of schools being force closed and I can't see my girlfriend because of the mandatory social distancing, and I'm 15 and only have my learner's permit. I don't brush my teeth and I work out with 100 jumping jacks, 30 pushups, and 30 situps every night because I don't want to be fat anymore, and I'm doing hella good and I've lost hella weight which has motivated me a bit, and I want to become a law enforcement officer later down the road, and I want to work on my social anxiety and I want to stop being the person that people don't want to be friends with because I'm weird, don't know when to shut up, and say stupid shit all the time and I never know how to act. I just don't have any motivation to do anything, and I know this, and I want to help myself get better but I just can't, I tried to start showering and working out more and brushing my teeth more but I just don't like getting up and doing things, I'm sad all the time and my depression has gotten better and I've stopped taking medication but it's only just sadness about my situation in life because I'm always secluded, there's no neighbors to hang out with, I live in the middle of no where so I can't walk or ride a bike anywhere, because I don't even have a bike, and my computer that I loved with all my heart got seized by police because I'm a fucking idiot, and sometimes I have thoughts about how much I want to just fucking end my life and I've thought of a sure-fire way to do so, but I don't want to do it because I don't want to leave my girlfriend because I love her so much and I know she loves me so much, that's my only motivation to live, but what if she leaves me? What the fuck do I do? I'll never find a girl like her again and if I fuck it up then that's it, I'm ending it. I just want to be normal and do things that normal people do, like take showers and brush my teeth n shit like that but I don't fucking want to, and I can't go back to therapy until this COVID-19 shit goes away, which won't be for a fucking while, and I don't know if I can handle it much longer. I only have 2 friends, one being my girlfriend, and one being a german guy who I talk to a lot about my feelings and he doesn't really help that much besides make me feel better in that moment and my girlfriend doesn't know how to deal with my sadness besides just asking if I'm okay or saying ""awh :/""

What the hell do I do?"
1175,I have episodes where I will write messages and codes without remembering,"This was a paragraph I sent to my friend a week ago everythjng was find but then I just snapped and sent stuff like this :

It watches afar, just staring at me, I can feel it all the time the eyes of something looking at me. I've only seen it once with my own eyes and I never want to again the state of fear and panic I was in when I looked into the void I was left motionless all I could do was cry, the nurses had to calm me down for hours and move me into a different room. I believe it's that keeping me alive, I think it brought me back to life when I died when I took that overdose I should of never of woken up but I did. It speaks to me but I don't know what it says its all too quiet and hard to make out, I have moments where I zone out and draw pictures of him and what he tells me but I have no memory of doing them. I believe his plan will end with me hanging from the branch of a oak tree It's not like I get distressed over this all the time. I can live with it. I just have accepted I am going to die of my own hands one day. If anything I'm happy it's at least me dealing the final blow and not anyone else. I want to be put down but camhs won't let me. I dont think they understand I want to die not because I hate my life but for that is my purpose in life. The cycle must be broken for the loop to break. I'm glad I have found the cure

I've been obsessed about this symbol I guess idk what it is :

...///...
It reminds of more code and but the morse code for sos is :
...---...

I will always draw pictures of this figure of which I have seen with my own two eyes only once but I have. I can swear on my own grave.

I don't really know what this is all about but maybe someone might"

Now i am stuck at home all day because of social isolation and the fact i dont drive and all of the places i like to go to cope when i am home are closed or are places of high risk exposure. I try to do what i can by limiting media and what not but its just hard. I just dont feel like doing a lot of the things i love, which is why my dr. upped my prozac to 40 mg a few days ago but im just so axnious and nothings helping anymore.

1180,Can not stop repeating the same word and hyperventilating,"I was wondering if anyone on this subreddit could give me a diagnosis on what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got mad because of something that my parents had done and decided to go lay on the couch. I then repeated the word ""why"" over and over to myself. It felt like only a a couple of minutes had passed but I was later informed by my mom that I had been laying there for over 30 minutes. This of course scarred me because I was unaware of that much time passing so fast. She had informed me that my sister and her had come to me multiple times to try to talk to me. She told me I gave them no reaction and also didn't respond to being touched. Afterwards I went to my room and began to hyperventilate to the point of almost passing out. The only reason I stopped is because I broke out into tears before calming down because of fatigue.

1182,How do I work with my boyfriend to come to a better understanding and conclusion?,So I struggle with bipolar depression disorder and my downs make me extremely tired no matter how big or small they are. I get emotionally tired and my brain requires sleep so I sleep a lot after fights bad day etc so he's normally by himself trying to entertain himself. It's became an issue in our relationship. I've tried to figure coping skills in the past but I struggle with them because I get seriously tired. He knows why I do it and why I sleep so much. I understand where hes coming from and I personally would enjoy being able to do more in my day without needing to sleep so much. Itd honestly be helpful for any relationship I have with whoever not to be the person who can hangout for an hour without needing sleep.
1183,I’m scared of myself again.,"Hi reddit. 

I don’t have anyone to talk to hence why I’m reaching out to strangers on the internet. 

I have diagnosed Anxiety and Depression. And I live with a house full of snakes. Bad combo right? 
I usually can control my anxiety and depression, but I’m unfortunately on no medications and no longer seeing my therapist. I want to blame my family’s pressure for the absence of both but I know it’s partly my fault. 

Long story short. I am scared of myself. I have no motivation for anything. Anything at all. And the way I think of myself lately is just scary. 

I am the sad girl. 
I am the scared girl. 

And I don’t know what to do or where to be to fix myself anymore and I don’t know how much longer I can do it. 

So if any of you strangers out there can offer any advice I would be eternally grateful."
1184,I don't what these thoughts anymore. I want to feel 'normal',"At a very young age I've been having these thoughts. Not suicidal anymore, but more murderous. I'm still young and this is not normal. I hate the thoughts and I don't like how they make me feel. I haven't been diagnosed with anything because insurance and my mother doesn't believe in mental illnesses. I'll always have an urge to kill someone. I always want to hurt people. Hell. I even wanted to kill my cat that I love dearly. I would get sudden bursts of anger and want to punch something. I always think about death and how 'good' it is. I'm currently lying in my bed crying because I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to have a peaceful sleep without a thought of murder. I don't like how I feel. This isn't ok for an freshman in high school to think about a shooting. And how funny it is that I could die and others will die also. I want to be happy, productive, and know what I want to do with my life. Not upset, a large procrastinator, and have no idea what I even like anymore. I used to love so many things, but the moment I hit high school. It felt like I had no interests. Only death. All I want to do is to find out what's wrong with me and with these mood swings. I don't know. Help me please."
1185,How do I stop hating myself for a diagnosis I have no control over?,"23F diagnosed with ADHD-C 13 years ago. The older I've gotten, the more I've hated this part(?) of myself. There is no clear line between me and ADHD either. It colors every single thought and interaction in my life, just like the character Sadness touches and colors the ""core memories"" in the movie Inside Out. ADHD has made my life an anxiety-riddled disaster and I hate it/me for it. I don't feel I can be myself anywhere and I hate who I am and what I act like if I don't take my meds or stop actively policing/filtering my thoughts and actions. How could anyone possibly love the shitshow that is me? The real me isn't ever good enough for anyone...."
1186,I don’t think I’m going to make it.,"I told two people this week that if treatment doesn’t work I don’t think I am going to make it.  I told my psychiatrist on Thursday that I am so scared he won’t be able to help me because I don’t think I can make it a few more month.  I told my husband today how scared I am.  I didn’t think he was able to understand because he never reacts.  I have forgotten that even if he does understand there is nothing he can do so I’m not sure it matters.  It’s all invisible after all. Anyone have any advice on how to ask ppl for what I need from them to be ok, until I am able to get on meds?  I just have so much guilt asking for what I need which is just to wear noise cancelling headphones playing podcasts or music or audiobooks to drowned out the voices in my head."
1187,"Dad sent me an Email (TW: trauma, violence, suicide)","For context, my parents got divorced when i was barely 3 years old so to my knowledge, i've always had a very dysfunctional family. My Father started dating this woman i can't stand when i was 5. She was racist, homophobic, uncultured, etc. On top of that she was pretty abusive towards me. she would gaslight me, degrade me, she even punched me in a supermarket where i fell and cried while she laughed.

My dad wasn't very present in my life, he became less and less there for me when he started dating \[C\], because he tends to become the person he is with. His whole identity was formed by his family when he was young and therefore doesn't know any better. Under all the layers of the personalities people have formed around him, i know deep down is a wonderful man, which makes this situation more awful than it already is.

Around the 5th grade, i started to get extremely depressed. I had been seeing a therapist for two years but it was mostly on how to deal with my adhd until then. I was diagnosed with severe depression and was advised to get anti depressants ASAP.  Our healthcare system required that i see a pedo-psychiatrist before. There was a two year waiting list. That's when i started cutting.

6th grade arrived and it was time for me to chose where i wanted to go to high school. My father and i were progressively getting on worse terms. He would act impulsively like a bratty child, i felt like i was the parent at 11. I wanted to go to a private school and my father categorically refused. He threw a whole fit about it. His reasoning was that if he hated the private school he went to, i would too. I still took admission tests and got accepted with some of the highest scores they had received. I was so proud, he shut me down quickly. He and his wife started calling me a sneaky lil' whore because i took the tests for a school i was very passionate about. That was the last christmas i saw him, back in 2015. he and my mom got into a serious argument about child support that he was barely paying, we desperately needed that money at the time. So without even telling me or asking my opinion he decided he could only see me on ½ the weekends because he would need to work more (but specifically on the days i was with him), mind you he worked on the weekend. He used me as a token in their childish fights. So id see him a total of less than 20 days per year. I took the decision to cut him off, he was toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

later that year i had my first attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

i started to have health issues 2 ½ years ago. Chronic migraines. I'm in unbearable pain 24/7

&amp;#x200B;

i had my second attempt after 6 months of pure physical torture, i was hoping to receive a diagnosis of cancer or something that had a cure but it never came.

&amp;#x200B;

in those past couple of years, i cant got in details, i was abused by a partner. I'll let you connect the dots so i dont have to.

&amp;#x200B;

i suffer mild PTSD from my childhood and relationships, i tend to dissociate from situations when they get too dark. But this time, i couldn't. In january, my brother(on my dads side)  got in a serious accident at work, broke both of his legs, open fracture and all that jazz. he woke up from surgery the next morning the first question he asked was is \[me\] alright? i hadnt talked to him in years and i missed him so much, i felt like a dick for indirectly cutting him off. i contacted him on facebook, which took a LOT of courage and gave me panic attacks just thinking about it. i got extremely depressed. i had spiraling thought where id scream at myself in my head even outloud at times «im going to kill myself» over and over. i couldnt think, i stopped going to school,

&amp;#x200B;

And here comes the shitshow. i see his name in my inbox. I started at the subject line for two days before opening it. it was full of triggers for me and him explaining why he did that dick move 4 years ago, He still doesnt see where he messed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

that night, After two years clean i relapsed.

i was prescribed an ssri, it made things worse, i was hearing voices, seeing things that werent there, i was seeing «shadow people»

&amp;#x200B;

last week i threatened my friend that i would do it again, for a third time.

i cant take it anymore, my trauma is always right behind me, chaising me. nothing is worth it anymore, 

Help, please, i needed to get that off my shoulders."
1188,I feel like I’m losing it,"My sleep schedule has been messed up recently as I’m sure most people’s have, but it’s starting to really effect me. I have dealt with depression and  ear suicidal experiences and have come out of that really dark place in my life. It’s just recently I feel like I’m losing it and I don’t know what to do. Sleep was a big controllable for me and regulating that helped me a lot. I just can’t seem to fall asleep anymore and the more I can’t the more anxious I get. I feel like a kid again. I’m actually scared of the dark right now and cry a lot at night and it’s scaring me.

I don’t know what to do, but I can feel it coming back and I’m scared."
1189,My emotions are gone?,"Not a throwaway, just made a new anonymous account for more personal stuff like this.

So, I’m confused and a bit concerned. I had all of this stress, anxiety, and disappointment in myself balled up inside, like when you feel emotions physically in your gut. But then one minute, suddenly, it was all gone. I was just sitting there on the brink of crying, failing to hold it in, and now there are no feelings inside of me and the tears stopped. I couldn’t cry if I tried to. I’m not numb but I don’t feel anything really right now?

I’m not necessarily feeling numb in an empty, depressive kind of way. I’ve been there and this is not it. Not apathy... it’s not that I don’t care, it feels like I have nothing to care *with*. Anybody experience something similar?"
1190,I like feeling shitty,"Hello! I've never liked feeling energized or focused, or even aware for that matter. For the past 2-3 months I went through a serious eating disorder where I lost 20 pounds, and I would constantly feel unaware, confused, dazed, you name it, but I loved it. Everyday when I woke up I felt happy, like I was doing the right thing. I finally started to feel like I was acceptable in the eyes of others because I looked significantly better. Every time someone commented on my weight loss I would feel this indescribable feeling of happiness, but now I've upped my calories slightly from \~500 to \~1,200. However I constantly feel energy and awareness, and I hate it. I feel more aware of my body and it makes me anxious because I feel like people are always looking at me. I get terrible anxiety when eating in front of people, and prefer to eat alone. I have begun to crave those feelings of ""shittyness"" so much that I have resorted to messing up my sleep schedule (fall asleep at 3am, and wake up around 2am), but it's just not the same. I have already started to fall back on my old habits, but I don't know what else to do. I just want to feel numb again, although I wouldn't say I'm depressed. I also know this is bad for me especially because I am only 15, but I don't know what else to do. Does anyone else feel like this? What can I do?"
1191,Can someone nice please talk to me :(,Hey my only freind wont talk to me and not ok if your a nice person and have some free time please talk to my I need good vibes really bad rn pretty please
1192,"Life is bad, I usually want to die, but when I derealise I think I will end up in some sort of hell if I were to die",
1193,I think I have PTSD,"I know that a lot of people have been raised since a young age or birth in abusive households. In my case, I was introduced to one last year, at 16. You know the effect of having higher economic standards? Like how economic ruin affects the mental health of people in a wealthier country in a different way than those of people raised in say, 3rd world countries. Like the Great Depression caused many suicides, whereas there are poor people living in slums and they're not having depression to the same widespread extent as those did in the GD, because that is how they were raised, how their parents were, and their grandparents, and how they know their children will be because of the economy.

I know children raised in chronic abuse for years develop PTSD. But is it possible for someone who has never been abused before to have it after a few instances of assault? Because I find myself getting triggered. I have so much hurt and anger, and do several things to cope with it: I bottle it up, I let it all out rarely, I am passive aggressive about it, casually almost, and I vent about it to people I'm close with. But often when I am alone with my thoughts I have flashbacks, and get this emotion turn into a physical sensation in my chest and then involuntarily let it out in this physical jerk, almost like I was boiling for a few seconds and then it pops out from my chest to my mouth, but I don't vocalize it, it's gasp and then I take in air because I didn't have any in my lungs for a minute, like I'm being decompressed. It's a really, really strong feeling and I don't want to hurt anyone, but it's the flashbacks that cause a mental image of me fighting back, and it just makes me have these short, awful bursts. I just feel so violated, like something was taken way from me. And I want to try and get it back by force in those moments, when really, I just wish it would all go away, I just want to leave her, or have her leave, and live a peaceful life away from the possibility of being around anyone hurting anyone. 

And then I get nightmares, too. It's like being trapped, whatever my dream came up with that she'll do next, each time worse than the last. I don't tell my family about this because I don't want them thinking I am having any ""after effects"" other than obviously being hurt about it in general, because I don't want them to worry more than they do already. But now in concern for myself, I wonder if this is a thing? Like will I have these flashbacks forever? Will I get triggered in my adult life? Is this something I'm should get therapy about, even though so far it's only happened three times?"
1194,Relationship please respond ASAP.,"So my girlfriend and I she has BPD I have intense paranoia and OCD. I have been having thoughts about like my exes and just remembering them and it is really bothering.

My intrusive thoughts really get the best of me and I need advice. I do not know what to do or what to say. My girlfriend ask come if I was still sexually attracted to them and I said well I dated them so I had to of liked them.

She has really low self esteem as is and she suffers from depression and a lot of self hatred. She says she is not mad at me or upset but I feel she is. I just want things to be okay and I do not want to have to think this way and it really hurts me and my relationship. Please anyone if you have advice share it."
1195,I've been having a rough year,"Ever since I lost one of my closest friends to suicide and my girlfriend essentially broke all my trust and cheated on me, things have been spiralling out of control. I fell into a deep depression summer of last year and had problems all throughout, and eventually ended up in a relationship with someone emotionally unstable and it ended up with her taking her own life. Not to mention losing another friend to cancer it was a very rough part of my life and right at the beginning of sophomore year to boot. Now I'm having extreme trouble trusting anyone and have been hurting myself for about a month, not cutting but just trying to harm myself in any way I can, weather its burns or just general bruises I cant really stop. I dont know what to do anymore and now I'm feeling so alone and detached from everything I used to love, and the only thing I can really do during this Covid-19 is visit a friend of mine whose also had quite alot of trouble in her life, much worse than mine, so I find it difficult to help in anyway with her. I know its alot but I really sont have anyone to talk to"
1196,My abuse lead me to not being able to feel emotions,"For starters, I don’t like this kind of thing infact I hate this kinda thing. I don’t like confronting my problems and I definitely don’t like reflection. But I think it’s time. I believe that nobody is perfect including myself. I also know that there is different levels of abuse. So abuse means a lot of different things to different people but I’d like to point out my definition. Abuse is treating someone in a negative/harmful way over and over again. This can either be mentally, psychically, or both. So quick backstory, growing up my dad really wasn’t there but It didn’t matter because my amazing mother did her best and had amazing support behind her. But because my mom always was juggling all this stuff she didn’t really have time for me or herself. Her mental health and our relationship suffered from that. But she needed to pay the bills so I understand now that I’m older. During that time both my parents weren’t really around, so I spent a lot of times with my moms family. They really are the ones who watched me grow up and raised me, while my mom was doing the hard stuff like bills. So as a young kid I normally became attached to them. Now it feels as though my aunt is my sister and my grandparents are my parents. Since we live across the street from my grandparents I usually spend a good amount at both houses. But I prefer my grandparents because it’s as if it’s become my childhood home. One person that I am especially close to is my grandfather. When I was little he was the life of the party. He always had a story to tell and a thing to do.  We’d go on his boat and he’d tell me about the time he traveled to Korea for his music career or the time he sung opening for prince at Madison square garden. He’s the type of man you want to be and the type of one you admire. But during the past few years his sickness and age has taken a toll on him. His illness is genetic so he can’t fix it. But because he’s ill he doesn’t always know what he’s saying or doing. He goes from a 1 to 10 real quick and can sometimes just wake up being a 10. He insults everyone now and then but he takes it out on me the most. I guess it because I’m always around him. He calls me names and curses at me all the time. He often says remarks that make me feel like I failed him and that he’d be better off without me. Now remind you I’m still a teen so I’m very energetic and can be annoying sometimes I get it. I also understand that he didn’t ask to raise another kid. But sometimes he takes things to the next level a little game of tap becomes a full blown fist fight and a small argument about politics and I’ll get kicked out for “disrespect”.  Tonight was the last straw though. I told him goodnight after I “followed him into the kitchen to annoy him” and he threatened to “punch me and fuck me up” I was just so struck in the moment when he got in my face I could do or say nothing except a calm stop. It was like I’d been hypothesized like I couldn’t move. He continued to terrorize me till my grandmother (who breaks up these “fights”) calmed him down. She’s copes by agreeing with him to get him to shut up though so it isn’t much help. But that’s usually. What really got me upset is that i think I’m emotionally damage I’m not afraid anymore or sad or angry I can’t feel anything but nothing if I get pushed down I don’t feel it I just stay calm and forget about it.  I feel broken like I should feel anything but nothing. I believe the constant abuse and mental fitness of my family is affecting my sense of emotions?  On one hand I understand that he’s physically and mentally ill so I brush it off but on the other hand I can’t live the rest of my life with this being my reaction to dangerous people. I can’t go to therapy because I don’t have time. And I hate to complain because I really do have a great family but it’s just everyone family looks perfect from the outside. What do you think?"
1197,anyone to talk to or some advice?,I don’t feel anything. I kind of feel empty. At first I was beating up my ass because of so many things. Never feeling like I’ll get out of depression or anxiety or eating disorders. But now I just....don’t feel happiness or sadness. I just feel like I have no emotion now and I’m trying to make it out everyday. I kind of feel like I’m avoiding ... facing my mental health issues. I know that I’m mad. really mad abt so many things. I’ve just kind of lost hope. Ppl tell me to “meditate” and I see these stupid schedules to make your day better? And then it’s the same coping skills....I don’t know what to do. I just want to give up.
1198,I've been having a horrible 10 or so months,"Ever since I lost one of my closest friends to suicide and my girlfriend essentially broke all my trust and cheated on me, things have been spiralling out of control.

1199,"slipping into another severe depressive period, suicidal thoughts are becoming more severe by the day, please help","most concerning, the fear of death that was always in the back of my mind is gone. If I had a gun I would have done it days ago. Despite the chaos in the world right now, things are going really well for me. I got a raise at work, I kinda like this social distancing stuff (I have autism, I hate being touched or people being close to me.) Most importantly corona isn't even bad in my country, and especially in my Provence. 1200 cases, over 700 of witch are recovered. 

out of 5.1 million people. 

Yet I'm sitting here freaking the fuck out, preparing to take myself out, printing off paperwork to buy a gun, tying a noose looking on google earth finding a cliff to jump off of. I'm just being irrational and paranoid."
1200,what could this be,"Whenever i’m in public places, especially school, and when people are laughing i think that they’re laughing at me, talking about me etc. So i always think something is wrong with me, I sit there and I change posters, fix my hair, look down, or try and hide myself. I can’t be out in public places without thinking that everybody is making fun of me, and i spend a lot of time trying to look for any small detail that i could possibly be made fun of. I don’t know if this has any relevance but I was bullied for years during school with no end both verbal and physical. So, does anybody have an idea of what this is? Or is it normal?"
1201,I don't know if this is just anxiety any more. My fear of time and schedules is getting out of hand. Does anyone have any advice?,"Hello there, long time lurker first time poster here. Sorry for any wrong formatting or anything, I am on my phone. Please let me know so I can correct it. So without further ado... I would love to know if anyone else deals with something ike this and how.
So, I have extreme anxiety and mild (mostly seasonal) depression. I am not on medication as a personal choice, not because I don't believe in it, I just know that I am young (19) and still developing chemically upstairs. I do take CBD oil and it has helped me a lot! (Not here to preach this is just what works for me) The main cause of my anxiety has always been Time and Schedules. It doesn't matter what it is or how early I have to get up I am an hour early or I feel my whole world crumble. I have been managing this a lot better with the help of my absolutely wonderful boyfriend (bless his heart), however it's schedules that really have a grip on me. I am obsessed with having a set and regular schedule. If something happens to through it off for any reason at all I spiral into full blown panic attacks. It feels like there are angry bees buzzing in my head, I start uncontrollably crying, and I find it very hard to recollect myself. This can effect me for a while 12 hours if I can't find some way to occupy my mind (usually with an art project or puzzle works best). I should mention I have a really bad habit of working so hard and such long hours that it keeps my brain from wandering enough that I stop taking my CBD for months at a time. I recognize this is a really bad thing to do, especially since my episodes seem to get exponentially worse each time I am off it. I could really use some reassurance that I'm not just losing my mind, and a few tips would be great my appreciated if you've even managed to read this far. 
Thank you so much, and thank you to the moderators for having such a wonderful resource out here for people!"
1202,"My friend will vent to me about a lot of his problems, but I feel like I can't be the help that he needs.","My friend has had issues involving perfectionism and overthinking a lot of things. He's never been to therapy or talked to his family about it because he has never seen it as that serious. Honestly, I don't know his mind so it might not actually be a serious thing. However, the way that he talks about it makes it seem like it has had a big effect on his life. He has seemingly had a fair bit of social issues from it involving him being nervous about what to say in a lot of situations. I've asked him if he considered therapy or has talked to his parents about it, the answer to both of those is no. He said he doesn't feel comfortable talking to his parents about that stuff. Idk if he has a bad relationship with them or if he is just nervous about that like he is with a lot of other social things. From what context I can gather, he seems to have a fine relationship with his parents and i think the main hurtle for him not talking to them is just his nervousness regarding in-person conversation regarding serious issues like that. I could be completely wrong about that though.

My main point is that I want to help him out, but I feel like I can't. He has said that just venting to me helps him out a lot, so I'm definitely gonna keep doing that. I still feel like even if i help clear his thoughts and express himself, I'm not helping to actually make his issue better, I feel like I don't have the expertise to help him. I have my own mental health issues, so i don't know if that makes me better or worse with talking to him. On one hand, i feel like my own mental health experience could help me relate to his problems. On the other hand, I have thoughts like ""If I can't get over my own mental health issues, then what makes me fit to help him?"". At this point I don't really know what I should do to help him."

A 3 month old daughter. 3 other step kids ( not married yet but we should have been but Covid kinda messed that up) who I treat like my own, but I just feel lost. Days just seem to go by so quick for me and I feel like nothing matters anymore. Life just seems like a joke nowadays. I would never kill myself because I don’t have the balls to do it and I think about my daughter and step kids and how they would react to that but I constantly wish something would happen to me on it’s own. It’s fucked it really is. I fake every thing in my life. I’m the funny guy who makes people laugh but it’s all for show but I’m so good at it. I can fool anyone into thinking my life is great. I’ve never been one to reach out to someone about my problems I just keep everything inside.  To be honest I dont even know why I’m posting this. I’m not looking for sympathy.

1206,CALLING ALL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND EPIDEMIOLOGISTS: WE NEED A GUIDE FOR HOW TO PREVENT SUICIDE WHILE SOCIAL DISTANCING,"I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts and I was searching for suicide prevention resources online. The problem is that all the resources I found don’t take into account social distancing. For example, most resources say to avoid being alone when your mental health is a risk to your life. That is a complicated piece of advice for someone who is social distancing and lives alone. We need advice on how to handle suicide prevention under the strange circumstances of social distancing.

I agree that crisis lines are important and helpful, but I am focused more on written information on websites. 

I want this information for myself, but more importantly, I’m very concerned about the mental health crisis. People need more guidance on how to handle mental health EMERGENCIES during this pandemic. (Advice must be available for people in danger as well as the friends/family of those in danger.)"
1207,I feel utterly alone and hopeless tonight and my mind is going to the darkest places,"I’ve been doing well, being holed up at home but today was different. I went out for a run today and I’ve been spiralling down ever since. I wish I could speak to my therapist because I haven’t felt this low in a while. I’m feeling really alone tonight and my most awful demons are coming out to play

I feel utterly alone. I’ve felt alone most of my life, but I was working on it. With quarantine, I’ve lost another year to loneliness, it seems like. I’m turning 28 this August. I’ve wasted so much of my life. I want to get there and change that, but it’s feeling really pointless. Working towards a university degree, and working on my fitness and appearance were the things I called my own, that motivated me, but that all just seems trivial and silly. 

My brain is consumed with awful thoughts of what I did wrong, what I could’ve done, what I didn’t do. My chest feels heavy with regret, panic and I’m overcome with hopelessness tonight. I’m not that young. I’m in my late 20s and I feel like a failure. There’s no going up from here. I want to give it all up already, I want out of my body, weirdly enough - and I’ve never felt such a strong urge for this before. 

I needed to share this somewhere."
1208,How the heck can I negotiate for therapy sessions while on lockdown?," My country is on lockdown due to coronavirus. I live with a severely immuno-compromised person and so does my therapist, so we can absolutely not meet each other under any circumstances. But I'm desperate for therapy.

He offered me therapy over the phone. Even disregarding that I can't pay him in person, I live in a toxic and controlling family that cannot know of my therapy sessions. I've thought of lying about going for a walk and having a therapy session on the phone in a quiet public place. But as I've now realised, a 1 hour phone call would cost me about 10 euros in addition to the therapy money.

I've thought about having an online chat-based therapy sessions and paying via Revolut, but I'm afraid he'll refuse on the grounds of the therapy's quality going down."

1210,mental health inporatance :Mental Health Check-Ins Are Critically Important Right Now,[removed]
1211,I have imaginary people in my head and they won’t leave.,"Hi! I have no idea if this is the correct subreddit for this, but I wanna attempt to find out a little more about my broken brain. This is going to be incredibly hard to explain, but I’m going to try to do so without it turning into a novel.  If you have questions, please ask! I will not be offended. I know it sounds insane and creepy. 

Little background info: I (20f) am a pretty normal person in real life. When I was about 12 was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD, and trichotillomania.  I am not currently depressed or on any medications. I have friends and family who love me. I’m in a happy relationship and have been in many before this one. I have no recollection of being abused. I was not neglected. I don’t actually see them and they don’t tell me to do bad things or hurt anyone. No one knows about this, they all assume I’m normal which is hilarious.

Ok here we go. So for as I can remember, I have had “imaginary friends”. The farthest I can remember them back to is around 5th grade. I made up a world in my mind, and there I am nothing like i am in real life. The real me doesn’t exist there. The “me”(let’s call her Sam) in my head is gorgeous, has a great body and incredible boyfriend named Ryan. I have created every single detail of their lives. Sam and Ryan were 15 and 17 when i met them, they’re now in their mid 20s. Ryan is 1 year and 4 months older than Sam. They have twin boys who are 1 and a half. They live in an apartment in Brooklyn.  They have friends, family. I sometimes find myself acting out their conversations or smiling about something they did. I have noticed that they tend to go away when I’m extremely happy or busy. They come back if I’m feeling lonely or just sad. It happens subconsciously. Over the years, they have grown and evolved with me, which is what makes them feel so real. 


I really hope that made some kind of sense. This is the first time I’ve EVER talked about it because I have been so scared to seek help. So is there anyone who can relate/ tell me some psychological disorders that may describe what I’m going through? I’m not looking for a diagnosis, I just want to do a little research on what’s going on in my head. Thanks in advance :)"
1212,I’m at my breaking point,"Trigger warning, loss, bpd, and depression mentioned.

I don’t even know where to start.
About two years ago I had a mental breakdown, became an inpatient, got properly diagnosed, and put on new meds. I never really went back to normal after and I don’t know why. I didn’t handle things the same anymore, I didn’t have the same capacity. I never found my match with the right meds because I have bpd. They tried a lot of combinations. 
A year after the breakdown my fiancé and I moved out our toxic environment and bought a house. I really thought that would be the saving grace. Right after we got our house his mom got evicted from her apartment and hadn’t told anyone, and she left her dog in the apartment. The landlord called us and we went to get her dog. She told us she would call shelters, and friends to try to find her a home because her dog and my oldest dog didn’t get along. A couple months pass and her dog had gotten out with mine and while trying to round her up they got in a fight, I broke it up and got bit by her dog. I know That’s what happens when you get between dogs, can’t be mad. We told her what happened, and found out she hadn’t been calling anyone and was just hoping we’d keep her dog. When we started calling shelters all of them in our area were full, and no one was able to take her. So we were just trying to hang in there until we found somewhere. Fast forward to a couple days ago, I was home alone letting my dogs out and her dog slipped out with them. I ran out to get her, she attacked my oldest dog again. My neighbor was trying to spray them with the hose. I had to get in between them. Her dog bit up my face, arm, and leg, but I finally got them apart. My dog almost didn’t make it. I asked animal control to take his moms dog, they said they couldn’t and she’d have to stay with us because the shelter was full. I couldn’t really do much for the dogs the day after. I couldn’t really walk or use my arm. I felt pretty worthless. I couldn’t even protect my dog. His mom had tried to contact me but I don’t want to talk to her. She always tries to spin the story and say my dog instigates, and that she’s “trying” to find a home for hers. As life is, it doesn’t stop there. 
Unfortunately a day ago my dad passed away. It was really sudden. He just got out of the hospital and was doing better. None of us could go see him at home though because of the corona virus. Suddenly he declined. We all had to watch him go over a video conference call because none of us could be in the room. I feel like it only gets worse. What’s the point anymore? I feel really broken, and being in quarantine is so hard, I can’t even be with my family. I don’t even know how to process any of the feelings I have right now."

I was journaling just now and this is what I wrote:

I am not well, this is bad. Really bad. This virus shit is literally driving me crazy and I don't know how much more I can take. Germs. There are germs everywhere. I touch a surface - BOOM - got COVID-19. I wash my hands and wash them and wash them and wash them. Sanitize, disinfect. I touch my face when I'm lying in bed. I am touching my face for the majority of the time I'm in my bed. Which, I'm in my bed all day and night unless I'm working. I've been as careful as possible, but I think I have the virus. If I am hospitalized, I will refuse a ventilator and I will sign a DNR upon admission. I'm not suicidal, but I cannot live like this any longer. There is no end in sight. I have constant anxiety and I obsess all day and night. If I contract this virus, I will not survive. I don't wanna leave my family, but I'm ready to go."
1214,Recurring theme of sexual abuse in stories and dreams - possibility of forgotten trauma?,"This post might be triggering for those with similar experiences so please at your own risk.

Ever since I was little (read 4 or 5 years old) I remeber making up stories about all sorts of things. It started with colorful shapes dancing on the ceiling in kindergarten, continued to fairytale-like stories about princesses and ended up in full fledged fantasy series some of which I am trying to make into real book series.

I was always using these stories to escape reality, where I was constantly bullied by my peers (all the way to the age of 15, then it stopped). I also wanted to escape my abusive mother, who regularly made me feel as an ungratefull, completely useless piece of garbage that only exists to make her miserable. 

I was also escaping difficult relationship with my father, who didn't live with us but we were in regular contact. He had a problem with alcohol and even when sober would emotionaly blackmail me as in: ""You don't do 'insert an activity', you don't love me anymore?"" Usually it was about spending the weekend with him but could be about anything. He has died a few years ago and I think we all felt relieved that we won't have to deal with his alcoholic episodes ever again.

Those stories had a lot of things in common, mainly main female character suffering all kinds of abuses from the world around her usually mimicking what I was going through at the time. I think I was trying to relieve the pain and stress that way.

As part of my theraphy I have decided to log as many of those stories as I can remember and analyse them in hopes of understanding my past a little better and to make it easier to accept. Most memories from my childhood are clouded and fuzzy but I have a few vivid ones and a general knowledge of what was happening at school and at home. I was able to match themes from my stories to what was happening to me.

Only one theme remains a mystery to me and that is being raped and getting pregnant, followed by being shunned by family and/or friends and ending up alone. I cannot pinpoint the exact time when this theme emmerged for the first time, but I am relatively sure it was before I was 11, which is what bothers me. I would also like to add that this theme is present in almost all of the stories I can remember like 90% of them so it is more like a pattern than random idea.

Sometimes I'd have dreams about being sexually assaulted to various extents - from inappropriate touching to full blown rape. I used to ignore such dreams and write them off as immersing too much in my stories with similar themes.

Last year I have started theraphy to resolve the issues I have around what was happening when I was a child and it has been progressing very well from my point of view. My sleep has gotten better and I started dreaming more often. At first it was only fantasy stuff like learning how to cast spells or raising dragons. Then I started having dreams about being socially excluded from various groups (bullying reference), getting into car accidents (I totalled a car about 3 years ago) and getting sexually exploited, abused or assaulted.

I always wake up in almost a panicked state and sometimes have trouble falling asleep again. The anxiety usually sticks with me for most of the next day and sometimes I am afraid to even go to sleep again which leaves me awake into late night and totally exhausted the next day.

I wanted to write those dreams off as my brain being messed up anyway, but the more dreams I have the more I have to ask myself if there might be something that happened to me when I was a child that I don't remember at all. On the other hand I wouldn't want to instill this thought into my brain, as it could create an event that did not happen and I'd have no tools to identify it. (Sometimes I have ""memories"" of things that did not happen and have to consciously work with them to uncover all inconsistencies to dig out what really happened.)

I have yet to discuss this with my theraphist as I was concentrating on different problems during theraphy and to be honest I was also afraid of his judgement. But the dreams are becoming more and more frequent, which makes me believe it is time to take them to light. The only catch is that my next session is planned for May so for the next month and a half I am on my own regarding this matter.

That is why I have decided to try this community to see if anyone has any insights on the matter or has maybe dealt with similar problem and might be willing to share strategies in how to get over it in order to lessen the impact these dreams and subsequent feelings and thoughts have on daily life. 

I am not looking for an answer or a solution to the problem. I am well aware of the fact, that this is something only I can solve since it revolves around my past and my experiences. I am also not looking for any sort of replacement theraphy, since it would be impossible to properly explain the depth of my circumstances. 

As I wrote, I am looking for insights, thoughts and possible coping strategies from people who have experienced something similar, themselves or with someone they know. Anything will be appreaciated.

Thank you for reading."
1215,Help me ASAP,My girlfriend and I of two years has been really upset with me talking about balky my exes and I have thought of them because of intrusive thoughts and triggers but I remember using Kik and stuff a hit while we were dating but I can not remember if I sent any pictures to someone when we were dating I remember what class I was in during school but I had the same teacher three times over three different time periods so I do not remember when it was and I am worried she will leave what do I do? She has very low self esteem I can’t stop shaking and I’m freaking out because there is not a way to really check when it was. I do not want to lose her.
1216,Thoughts,I’m close to losing it. I have been fine for so long. It’s been 3 years since I went to a metal hospital and I’ve felt a million times better since then. But I can feel myself slipping back. I thought once I found the right balance I would be okay. I thought I was getting better. But I can’t stop my brain. It keeps thinking and thinking. It thinks of bad things. It thinks of different ways I could hurt myself. It thinks of different ways to self destruct. It thinks everyone is out to get me. I can’t make it stop. I have no one to talk to. I am close to ending everything. I can’t think if I’m dead.
1217,What do you do when you have again lost the hope you’ve gained after getting over a depressive episode?,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit to go to, if there’s a more fitting one please let me know. 

I had a very bad depressive episode last year. I believed that life never would get better. I was basically a frame of a being walking around, to be honest, I don’t even remember much of that year despite how much I remember the emotions I felt back then. However, things were starting to turn up. It was a slow progress but I was happier, of course it lingered a bit on some days but I knew I was better. 
But now I’ve fallen back into it again, and this time I have no idea. I don’t know what I want. I know this depressive episode will end sooner or later and it will get better. But I also know even after that it’ll get worse and then, again, it’ll get better. I feel like I’m in an endless cycle, and I don’t know if the good will outweigh the bad. I’m not strong enough to go through this again and again."
1218,I’m so tired of being scared all the time,"I normally have death anxiety in general, but it is at an all time high in quarantine. I’m having trouble falling asleep because I’m afraid of dying in my sleep. I live with my sister, and she works for Amazon so she still has to go to work so technically we aren’t ‘quarantining’, and I am so terrified of her getting sick and dying. I don’t know how to not be afraid and it is at a level where I feel crippled by it. Worst of all, I can’t even tell myself that we’ll be okay, because the illogical, superstitious part of my brain thinks that that type of cockiness means that karma will make sure we die. I just feel like I’m so scared of dying or losing my sister that I can’t enjoy my life anymore. 

I also do this weird thing where I assume how long I’m going to live and I count how many years I have left. Or if someone older than me tells me how old they are, I always do the math on how many years I would have left to live if I lived to be as old as they are. I feel like I constantly have this timer in my head for how long until I die. 

I don’t know how to stop and it is a miserable way to exist."
1219,Making effort with people mentally drains me,"I’ve [24/f] always been terrible at responding to texts, answering phone calls, joining FaceTime group sessions, and being outgoing. I don’t know if it’s some deep rooted fear of rejection or what. I remember when I was younger, I was so so scared of going to peoples doors to ask if they wanted to come out and play, and the one time I mustered up all my mental strength to do it, the mum told me that my friend didn’t want to come outside to play. It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. 

Now, I’m 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them. I adapt, and have done for years, and it’s tiring. I’m just at a stage in my life where I want to address what’s going on with me, and try to better myself. My flat mate has just messaged me asking if I want to renew our house contract for next year (which I don’t) and as a result I’ve been suffering from crippling stomach knots all morning and have been running on and off to the toilet. 

I don’t know if any of this makes sense at all? Or if my point is even clear? I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It would really help to know I’m not alone. What have people done to overcome this?"
1220,"If you lose someone to suicide, just get over it","What, that sounds cruel?

But you always said it to suicidal people. Why can't you get over it? Funny how it bites you in the ass? Your bootlicking bullshit suddenly backfires?

I have little sympathy for suicide grief. Very few people can actually care about suicidal people. It's virtue signaling."
1221,I heard voices yesterday and I’m so scared,"Yesterday I was having a really bad day. I’m in a psychiatric facility but we are in lockdown so no visitors are allowed. I already felt trapped and alone. Now I feel it tenfold... My best friend lives halfway across the world and he said that we could talk but he hasn’t been on much at all the last couple days. That’s fine, and he’s allowed to be busy or have a life or take some space but it hurts. And I just want a hug... I don’t know. Sorry. My thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

Sometimes he sends a voice message when I’m panicking to help calm me down because it’s nice to hear his voice. Yesterday I started hearing his voice when I sent him a message. He told me I was selfish and horrible and didn’t deserve to be alive, and he kept getting angry and yelling at me when I was apologising. He’s never said anything like that before and I think I heard voices but I’m confused and scared because it sounded exactly like him, and it felt so real. 

I’m so scared that I’m going crazy because I’ve been locked in here for so long. It really hurt to hear him say those things. I miss him so much. I don’t know"
1222,"I can asure my best friend and his girlfriend can read my mind, or at least my dreams","I will say my current situation and then elaborate.
Last night I had a dream where I could see some things that I shouldn’t be able to see, and now I have this very strong sensation that leads me to believe that they know about that dream and that’s the reason they’re trying not to talk to me. Also I feel like they know I feel guilty and they find it funny.
Since I was in kindergarten I felt this weird sensation that all the other kids could see what I was doing at all times. I remember being 3 or 4 and wanting to dance alone in my room because I was so sure they could see me that I didn’t want them to have a reason to laugh at me.
I couldn’t think freely in school because I knew that everybody could see it as long as it was something I wasn’t supposed to think.
Nowadays I can’t have a conversation with anybody because I feel like they know something I was ‘hiding’. I want to know if this could cause any major harm. I don’t mind being alone, I’ve been alone most of the time I can remember, but I don’t enjoy feeling anxious about things like this. Any sincere help would be appreciated."
1223,In need of some external input,"Okay so for the past four years now I’ve noticed more frequent and severe changes in my mood. Initially, I thought I was depressed, I was always feeling like nothing could go the right way and feeling an empty hopelessness and guilt (amongst other things but I don’t feel like listing all of them out). Along with this though I would have terrible outbursts and I was extremely irritable, lashing out at the people close to me for no real reason. I just pushed it to the back of my head and disregarded it, but now for almost the last year I’ve found it almost unbearable and endlessly frustrating. I’ll have a week to two at the most where I feel really good everyday, be more motivated than normal, more talkative, and have much higher energy to the point where it’s even weird to me. Unfortunately though the highs are always followed by the lows, which thankfully usually last only four days to a week, but I’ll be sleeping most of the day, not leaving my room, not eating etc. I’ve also noticed that I’ve gotten more and more anxious and I’ve recently started to have anxiety attacks, which I’ve never had before. I went to a couple therapy sessions at my school, but now campus is closed and they’ve switched to phone calls or zoom sessions (which I really don’t feel comfortable with). Now I KNOW I shouldn’t diagnose myself and that’s really not what I’m trying to do, I just want something to make sense of what I’m feeling so I can stop feeling like I’m going insane. I’ve done some research and I feel like my symptoms match up with bipolar ii or cyclothymia, but I’m not a doctor nor a diagnosed individual; so if anyone who has experienced what I described or has enough knowledge to have an idea of wtf is going on with my brain could you please respond, it would be greatly appreciated :)"

1226,I (17m) can’t get over my ex completely,"I was with my exgirlfriend for about 6 months until I decided to end it. It was a pretty unhealthy relationship lots of useless fights, she was very untrustworthy and manipulative. I tried my very best to keep it going and she gave little effort. I honestly really loved this girl and it broke my heart finally coming to my senses. This was a little over a year ago, and I have a new girlfriend now and we’ve been together for 4 months. It’s been great and I’ve worked out things in myself and she is an amazing person. But every now And then I’ll see something that reminds me of her, or even one of her Instagram posts and it just makes my heart ache. I don’t know why I still get this feeling and I feel horrible because I have somebody else now and I just do not understand why I’m getting these feelings. I try best to ignore them but sometimes it’s just really hard because I don’t have anyone to talk to about it."
1227,Voyeuristic Disorder (18 yo) HELP,"Throwaway for obv reasons

Hello,

I am an 18 year old male that is doing pretty well in life. I am heading off to a great college soon and worked my ass off in school, played a lot of sports, and created some hobbies (music, programming).

However, I have been struggling recently with voyeuristic disorder. I've always been surrounded by ass and girls in provoking clothes at my high school, and combined with a chronic use of porn and masturbation, I soon turned to masturbating to changing room vids and upskirts. I felt very sick at myself for jerking off to this kinda stuff but the urge was incontrollable. This escalated, and I soon used my phone as a spy camera, taking creep videos of ass and even tempted to do some upskirts. I would masturbate to these videos but then I would delete them right after, feeling sick at myself. The problem is, I want to free myself of these voyeuristic urges, since after doing some research, I found that voyeurism can escalate very quickly into far more sinister things (the worst being rape). Is there any way to treat this? Support groups/therapy is not an option right now, so I was thinking of going porn/masturbation free, but the urge to just wank it to some upskirts or pictures of people I know at school are just too incontrollable. Please help me, I realize I can have a beautiful life ahead of me but I feel like my voyeuristic disorder might shatter everything. Should I jerk off without porn instead? Will masturbating to regular porn (not voyeur porn) help me rid my voyeuristic urges? I feel like I get a different ""rush"" from watching/commiting voyeur than just watching regular porn..

Please help, or at least refer me to a subreddit that can help me."
1228,[TW] Trauma is going to ruin my current relationship. I'm scared of men.,"So 2 years ago, I was Sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend and someone I considered a close friend. Two separate events but it happened and it haunts me. I was groped by my math teacher last year and he nearly lost his job because of it. Anyways, In the past two years since my ex boyfriend, I've came to the conclusion that I am Bisexual. I thought i was lesbian because I could never see myself with a man again after what happened. But no, I am bisexual. Now, my sexuality has nothing to do with the assault, and about a month ago this guy I know messaged me on facebook. We've known each other for a long while now and there is feelings attached. Exchanged numbers etc. We are basically together, just need to make it official. 

So, he is genuinely nice and i really like him, but here comes the problem. So we started talking dirty and immediately I felt the anxiety and trauma kicking in. The past few nights i've been getting flashbacks from what happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm becoming more scared by the day because it feels like i'm being used for my body. I don't know what to do, and i'm too scared to tell him about this. I get anxiety attacks at night and I can't sleep. When I do sleep, I sleep for like 12 hours a day. This is driving me insane, and slowly making me suicidal again. I've been clean for about a month now, but i want to grab the blade again to make the stupid scares go away. I can't get therapy, because well, we are in a pandemic and we don't have the money to get therapy either. I'm supposed to go to 51 compulsory sessions because i'm highly suicidal. What do i do? I almost threw up typing this because of the trauma.  I should probably add that I had sexual encounters with my ex girlfriend, and it was relatively fine....but now with my boyfriend, this is happening and i'm scared."
1229,What is a crisis team? (UK),"I've been referred to a crisis team today but I've no idea what they are or what they do. Google is giving me mixed info about whether it's at home or hospital and what they actually do apart from monitoring you. I'm also worried they'll call social services (UK CPS) and my son will be taken away because of my mental state, the fear of him being taken is actually one of the reasons I've fallen into the pit I'm in currently. Any help or advice would be appreciated."
1230,I need help getting out of my own head today,"I wasn’t an angel when I was in my late teens/early 20’s. My father was incredibly emotionally distant when I was growing up and my mom wasn’t much better. It was one of those stay together because it’s the ‘right’ thing to do type marriages. Well I’m not going to say because of that I made bad choices, but I’m sure it didn’t help..... 
anyway I am having a lot of trouble lately worrying and obsessing over my past. A lot of it has to do with sex and choices made around that. All of this is from @ 20 years ago give or take. I have 2 wonderful kids (from different fathers) that I love dearly. One father is involved - the other is not. This is part of my constant guilt. I am now engaged to a man that I can honestly say is the only man I’ve ever loved. 
I’m constantly obsessing over my past ruining what I have now somehow. I am catastrophizing and I can not stop myself. I think I slept maybe 3 hours last night :("
1231,I want to disappear,"Do anyone feel like god just screwed them? 

It's like my impact on earth is zero.i could die tomorrow and I think the world would be better for it. 


My friends care about me. But I feel like this person that will always come last. I'm tired of being this sensitive fat girl. 

When I was younger I didn't take my classmates jokes and insults well. Once I started crying in class. I'm in college now and they still mock me. My friends only talk about themselves, I maybe have two friends I can be honest with

My mom and step dad just went through a divorce. And Covid-19 is making it hard for my mum to get a job. And I don't know whether I will be able to attend college. I am 20 and I have never been kissed. It's just I hate myself. I'm fat and ugly. And I want to just give up"
1232,I'm so not okay with any of this. I feel like I'm the only one who is crying every damn night.,"TL/DR at bottom

If I have to read one more fucking Facebook post about looking at the blessings in this situation, I swear I'm about to go off on a bitch. 

No one is talking about mental health and what effects Covid, self isolation, lockdowns and social distancing will have on us. Are we going to come out ok on the other end or will this be added on to the pile of shit we carry around with us now? 

I'm bipolar with panic and anxiety disorder. Every night I'm playing ""is it a panic attack or Covid?"" My meds don't seem to be helping. 

I'm a hairstylist that had to close the doors to my shop. I lost my identifier and the one thing that keeps me grounded. 

I want to scream at these people who post continually about what a blessing this is, such a wake-up call..blah blah. Bitch, I can't see my daughter who lives 10 minutes away. I can't see my mom who lives 5 minutes away. It hurts. That is not a blessing. 

I don't know where else to go except to you guys. Please tell me I can't be the only one who's panicking every damn day, who's trying to hold it together but doing a shitty job at it. 

TL/DR - I'm mad and panicking and I want to know I'm not alone."
1233,I'm scared that nobody cares about me,"I've been battling anxiety and panic attacks for quite a while now. The whole situation with Covid-19 kinda even makes it worse. And for the past 3 days I also have been isolating from all of my friends/ online friends with contacts.   
I honestly don't really know why, it might somehow be related to my birthday that was on 3rd of April but I don't really know. I disappeared from the net on 4th of April. And like... It might kinda sound selfish now that I think about it but I really wish someone would phone me or send me an SMS to just check if everything's ok but so far nothing.   
So here I am scared to contact anybody for no actual reason and wondering if I'm selfish for wanting someone to check on me. Any tips?"
1234,I need help,So I was diagnosed with BPD and I lost my medical insurance soon after. I just got my medical insurance back and I can finally go see my mental health provider! These last few month have been hard and I have self medicated because I wasn’t able to get my medication (I couldn’t afford it) I know my mental health provider does drug test. I haven’t done hard drugs just the occasional THC use which is still illegal in my state. I’m going to pee dirty. I already no. What happens if I do? Should I tell them immediately I’ve self medicated?
1235,Share your favourite uplifting songs!,"Songs about overcoming difficulties, using inner strength etc. I have to be really careful about what I listen to because I used to listen to some really dark and depressing shit as a teen and it honestly just made things 100 times worse.

1236,Anybody else aware of themselves as a person within their body?,"So I don't go through depersonalization, but it may be similar(?). Does anyone else start crying and internally realize your crying, like a narrative? ""Woah, I'm crying"" kind of realization. Or when high, just watch what you're doing like you're trying to persuade yourself not to do what your body is doing? Or like, look in the mirror and think about how you're inside the body, and that the body isn't really you, just a face? And that face is looking at YOU.
I promise I'm not high right now. The last time really freaked me out."
1237,"How do I deal with this empty feeling, especially during quarantine?","
I’m 21, uni student in my final year.
Early February: I broke up with my first girlfriend (about a year, broke up a few times beforehand, very toxic, but I did love her)

After that I started going gym which was great, mentally. I was also going out a lot more as well, trying to get the most out of single life, n it was fun. But every night, that’s when my brain would decide to have deep thoughts about me and my ex etc (I miss the good parts, I miss the love but I don’t wanna get back with her, we was toxic and she was aggressive)

Even now in quarantine, 2 odd months after everything, my brain still has deep thoughts about it, especially at night.  I don’t know if it’s love or the affection I miss. I understand it was my first love so that’s always gonna hit harder.

At the moment life just feels pretty empty, I work out at home (though feels lacklustre due to no equipment) and I call my friends and family (as I’m still at uni house). But besides that I don’t really know what to do, I just wanna get my head on probably and stop thinking negatively, and deeply about the past, but I’m struggling to. 

Anyone ever felt this or have any advice? 

(I’m not depressed cos I’m fine 80% of the time, it’s just those late night deep thoughts sucker-punching me)"

In our day to day lives, how do you not constantly think about the problems in your life. I am for one such a person that will constantly think about all the problems which I am facing and any positive moment I will turn into a negative one. I want to stop that. 

Like for instance I will be cooking and one thought of xyz problem in my life will come and ruin my day. How do you stop such thoughts or how do you deal in such a situation."
1240,my friends don't want me around anymore,"they're online friends,  but the only pastime other than my parents who I even talk to anymore. 
I only ever annoy them and bring them down....  I should just leave them alone. 
I've been trying to just chill and not really say anything, but itd be better if I just weren't around anymore.
I'm completely alone.   I don't feel like I'm a living person anymore.   I'm just waiting to die."
1241,I have attachment issues. Need coping skills?,"When my SO leaves, even just to ""go to the bathroom"" I feel as if he's leaving me. When he goes to work, I think about my late doggo and how a year without him is fastly approaching, and then I think, ""my bf is cheating on me,"" and other things. I Just don't know what to do or how to cope with this anymore. 

How does one overcome attachment/abandonment issues?"
1242,I think I had a panic attack? I'm not sure,"I'm a little emotional right now so this isn't going to be very to-the-point, but I'd appreciate if you read it

So, I was on the nosleep subreddit and I read this story where the main character accidentally snapped his neighbour's neck without realising (it makes sense in the context of the story). Since I was little I've always been scared of accidentally killing people/things because when I was very young we had a pet duck and one night it was quacking so I thought it was cold and I brought it to my bed and crushed it in my sleep. Since then I've always been really cautious about stuff like that. Whenever I have any animals on my bed like kittens, I always put them on some raised blankets or pillows so I wouldn't be able to roll onto them and crush them.

So I'd been reading stuff all day and after reading that I started to feel a little odd. Like the whole bit disconnected from reality thing. I was really wrapped up in my thoughts and not really focusing on anything. Like, staring into the distance as I was walking around and doing stuff. I decided to have a shower and I kept having thoughts like I could die so easily if I just slipped over, my parents just cleaned it and what if that reacts with the body wash and creates a toxic gas and a whole bunch of stuff like that.

My thoughts were kinda distressing me so I went over and talked to my parents about them but I noticed my thinking was really disorganised and I was stuttering and struggling to use words to convey my point, something I never struggle with.

So then I went to my room and started thinking about it more and I started crying and shaking and hyperventilating and I felt cold but I didn't want to do anything about it because I didn't really see the point in it and my head was feeling really heavy and my neck ached but I couldn't lie down because I was so afraid it'd snap my neck and my body started to feel numb and I curled up in a ball and started rocking back and forth and my perception of everything like time and the space around me and my own body seemed all fucked up and I started getting terrified of myself and thought I might accidentally gouge my eyes out because my face went numb and I was so amazed by the feeling of my face being numb that I ended up shoving my hands into my mouth and making myself throw up, which only made me feel worse.

And after probably only minutes of this is finally clicked that I was having a panic attack. And I calmed my breathing almost instantly and as soon as my breathing was back to normal, I felt completely fine. The panic stopped. I still feel a little paranoid I might accidentally kill myself/someone/something and that I might hurt myself, but I'm honestly really confused about all of this. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before and it really slowly came on after thinking about it for a while and it stopped almost instantly once I realised what was happening. It makes me feel like I was faking it because it feels like I forced it onto myself by thinking about everything then I was able to stop it on command. But it also felt so real"
1243,Any advice and side effects to watch out for aripiprazole,"Let me start off with ive suffered from issues with mental health for as long as I can remember. I could remember when I was younger and I was always the one in my class who was playing up and experiencing stuff like extreme low mood and voices and no one else really did in my classes and it made me feel not normal and a outcast and a freak and all sort of self negative views bht as I got older I was able to know about stuff Into detail and realised I was not one jn a million and a lot of people suffer from stuff like this quite commonly and it made me feel some what normal and better. Both of my parents suffered from severe scizophrenia and killed my dad at a young age due to heavy smoking and drug usage to try and self medicate but my mum has some what recovered from all her demons and is living relatively normal life with symptoms cropping up when she’s experiencing intense stressful situation I think she is in remission with it though. Anyway let’s get too me the past say about 5 months I’ve been experiencing extremely messed up thoughts and visions which aren’t mine and occasionally they are repeat and distract me from doing anything else I’ve also been experiencing my name being called from another room when no one is in also increase paranoia about people like for example I’ll be on a public bus and a random whitr guy will come with a backpack and I will instantly get extremely paranoid to the point where I’ll get off the bus because I think he was going to blow us all up I also experience Akathisia regularly to the pint where I’m pacing early into the morning of days I also find I used smoke cannabis heavily but now when I try it I have to keep moving my hand and body because I feel really uncomfortable. This all started 5 months ago when I od on md and ketamine my heart was struggling and I felt like I had a massive elastic band around my chest but when I was in hospital it was like I was in hell I felt like the nurses were taking about me and I was sent here to die and I csn remember briefly I’m the ambulance that these thoughts they were going to take me to kill me were getting wuite strong but due to the dosage I took I couldn’t even move and was in severe pain. I guess what I’m trying to ask is when do all these symptoms go after starting aripiprazole and will my memory and stuff like that slowly come back ?

I do apologise if this is hard to understand or read but recently what ever is happening in my head is distracting and making me not type or write the best. Anyway thank you for listening"
1244,"I'm suicidal even though I'm not depressed, anxious, or anything really.","I'm in a good place in my life. I was depressed before, and epileptic, but that's all in the past now.

I finally started doing chemistry research, nano-composites, and it brings me a lot of pride.

I feel neutral about self esteem for the most part. I used to be needy, but I don't have that need to vent to friends or anything anymore. I keep a healthy distance from people. Not because I can't get close to them, but because I genuinely don't need or want close friends nowadays.

I'm playing violin again, a hobby I abandoned for a while. So I'm not sitting around depressed and watching a wall like the past.

Over all I feel pretty good. However, I avoid old close friends because I want to completely remove my old immature phases. I actually have fantasies about poisoning these people I ""opened up to"", even though none of them responded negatively to it.

Ofc such fantasies are are casual, not serious at all. the only intense one is suicide.

Looking back at myself all I want to tell that tween is ""stop throwing your problems at people and just get to therapy dumbass"". I've heard the self acceptance speech a million times, and it never helped me in the past and I don't think it'll help me now.

So does anyone have actionable tips?
Not interested in feel good comments atm.

I'm using an anonymous account because like I said, I don't want this small part of me seeping into my life."
1245,Life feels empty.,"I (M/17) have felt depressed for almost 2 years now. My parents divorced the summer of 2018, right before high school started so my first year was a wreck. I started to feel better after a year, but it's like this feeling has crawled back into me. I just feel really empty inside. I look around and I see... no one. Both my parents are a wreck from the divorce (Though they are getting better), I have one semi close ""friend"" (We don't talk about our deepest feelings). I guess I'm just missing someone in my life - that someone would possibly be a partner. It seems like everyone is getting into a relationship nowadays at a young age, and I wouldn't wanna miss out. Young love seems like one of the best and cutest things ever, and I'm afraid I'll look back in a couple of years and wish I did something with myself. I'm a really introverted and shy guy. I don't really have any friends at school, and all of this has made me to believe that I'm either not good looking, a bad person or just not enough for everyone around me. My grades have started slipping, I have no motivation to study, I got no idea what my dream job is yet - life feels pretty shitty for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Would talking to a counselor help?  I appreciate any answers to my problems. I don't know what to do."
1246,How to deal with unwanted thoughts?,"I’m not sure what is causing this, I have never in my life experience something like that and have been overall mentally well so its a bit of a shock that this is happening to me.

I’ve been struggling to keep certain disturbing thoughts away (nothing grazy but I dont want to get i to the details) and i have no ideo how to stip them. 

They happen mostly in my dreams where I guess my subconscious kinda just takes over and throws all this shit on me. 
In the real world if those thoughts come to me whenever I feel relaxed, so my brain is kind of like “to u cant enjoy yourself because every time you do you will thing of THAT”. 
I hope once I move out it will be easier...okey now i feel like I should say it. Its a person who I live with, someone who i have grown to absolutely despise and I guess im deeply afraid of never getting rid of them. I want to forget them, like i never even met them in my life but i know that’s impossible.  Im afraid i can never live in peace again and not think about this personality when I am feeling most happy and relaxed."
1247,Strong difficulty breathing caused by months of constant anxiety and stress.,"I am really struggling, not with anxiety and stress so much anymore, but the physical leftovers of it mostly, having huge difficulty breathing deeply, yawning (sometimes I can yawn like 20 times in day and none of them end up being completed, I just kind of open my mouth wide and nothing happens) and feeling bad shoulder, neck and upper back pain and tightness, and I don't know what I can do to recover in these things. 

Exercising works, but is hard in itself as I am struggling for air quite quickly, (I used to be very fit and capable so it's not like me) and it seems to only help for a few hours or a day, then I go back to feeling crappy, tight, and struggling to breath well.

What else can I try? Has anyone had this experience and found a way that helped them feel better and back to normal, where they weren't any longer struggling for breath and in pain nearly every day all day?"
1248,Is it strange to sit by yourself in public?,"I know It’s a dumb question. I used to have sever social anxiety, I’ve gotten much better over the years. 

I don’t get to socialize much on weekends, if the weather is nice I enjoy sitting outside, sometimes in the town centre.

I just feel less alone, I don’t bother anyone.

But I still get anxious about it, I don’t know what to do with my hands, I don’t know where to look, don’t know how to sit etc...

I feel weird if I just sit idly doing absolutely nothing. I sometimes glance at other people (I don’t stare) but I’m afraid that I’ll give off weird vibes.

I’ve overheard groups mock me while passing by, it’s rare and know I shouldn’t care, but it bothers me. If I have company I don’t feel anxious at all.

Makes me feel like a lonely old man. I’m 23, Feel as if I should have more friends."
1249,Everything seems F**ked,"Every aspect of my life feels fucked, no support from anyone, toxic parents, partner (kid involved ). I want better to do better, I feel I am but these key people are disappointing me, always letting me down. Yes expect nothing less but how when it's these key people. How? Do I disconnect?"

1251,"I realised today, my parents did not think ahead very far at all","My parents have been seperated since I was 16, but they have resented each other for as long as I have been aware. Some of my earliest memories are of them arguing. Why would they marry? More importantly, why did they have children? Both are still in jobs they hate and pay poorly. My dad works a physically demanding job, I wonder how much longer he can continue. As far as I know he has no pension. My mother works in teaching. She dislikes her job too. Why do they remain working where they are. If they had no plans for betterment, they should not have had two children. I was most likely a new year's accident though, maybe there was no plan at all.

My mother is depressed, she would hate any job. I am unfortunately like her. I will never achieve anything because I sink into depressiom with any exertion. This is what happens when a person with significant mental illness has a child. Genetics and upbringing, it is almost inevitable. If you have clinical depression: do not have children. If you have any significant mental illness: do not have children. You do not deserve children. You are naturally lazy and unfit to have children. No one should have to carry your genetics. No one should have to be bought up by you. They will resent you. Remember this.

I do not love my mother. I think I am incapable now, I have forgiven and hated so many times, she does not change. I feel she displays some narcisistic traits and she projects those onto my father. Since my father left she has fed me and my brother ready meals almost exclusively, she does not allow either of us to use the kitchen. She complains I am not feeding myself properly at university. Do you see the insanity? She is stuck like this and will never change. It is always my fathers fault. If the blame can not be shifted to him, it is my fault.

My father doesn't talk to me much. We have nothing useful to say to each other. My father knew she was depressed, it is his fault I am here as well.

Do not have children. They will hate you."
1252,Nothing excites me no more.,"Pretty much as the title says I feel so drained and bored can't go outside neitheh time is tough for me now I suppose I gotta deal with it by just putting up with it.

Sorry for bad typing/spelling I haven't been sleeping much."
1253,should school come before mental health?,"all my classss are online which i wouldent mind doing but this has made me incredibly depressed to the point that everything feels like it is spiralling out of control and i want to just end it all, i feel like i'm gettting a bit better though trying to catch up on classes but i just have that question"
1254,I’m afraid to be mad at people,I’ve developed a weird thing where i am afraid to be mad or angry at somebody when i’m really mad at them. I’m afraid they will hurt themselves because of it and i dont know why.
1255,Trigger warning: suicide,"Yesterday my uncle killed him self. He has a wife 2 children, a mother, a stepmother, a father. My point is many people are devastated right now. Idk what he was going through but I do know that we are all distraught and heartbroken. I’m mostly posting this because I feel awful and I need to talk and I just want to let people know that someone will mourn your loss, and someone will be heartbroken. Please don’t make a drastic permanent choice like suicide please choose to try and get help. I know it can be hard, I myself have made multiple suicide attempts and this event just reminds me of those attempts and make me feel so ashamed and upset I put my family through the fear of possibly losing me to suicide. If you read this I’m sorry if I made you upset but I needed to say this"
1256,I obsess about murdering someone.,"For months now, I’ve planned each and every detail of her death. 

I crave it. 
I obsess over it.
I get a rush just thinking about it.

I’d slit my own throat after.

I only posted here to vent in a way, I didn’t know where else to put it.

Don’t urge me to go to the hospital, I am a pussy so I probably won’t go through with it.

Never have I hated someone so much before, she ruins lives. So I end hers. Severely abusive. Nobody would miss her.

Just needed to vent, sorry."
1257,Does this sound like a mental health problem and can anyone relate?,"So sometimes when I read/see something. Even if someone is telling me something, it wont go in if that makes any sense. I really have to think about what im reading or being told for me to understand it, its like i cant process the information. As i start to try and think about it I start getting really anxious and start to tense up. Does anyone else have this problem?

&amp;#x200B;

I also start to feel hot when it happens. Which is why im wondering if its anxiety."

1259,How do I believe?,"I'm sitting here in quarantine contemplating what to do next. Waste some time procrastinating, enjoy myself self or do work. I'm a doctorate student getting a third scientific degree. I am almost guaranteed to become a scientist unless I screw everything up. And that's exactly what I have bee doing these past 2 years. I don't feel accomplished or happy that I got this far.  
  As days go by I do less and less. I feel less and less. I'm 26 yet I  feel like most of my life is not worth anything. I feel both old and stunted. As I continue to rot in my room I realized that I never thought any of this to be possible. I never believed that I would live this long. I never believed that I will ever be able to achieve something.
 And despite being proven wrong again and again I still believe life to be impossible for me. I'm but a few steps from achieving my dream but despite having overwhelming amount of evidence I just can force myself to believe in...... myself I guess."
1260,I’m scared of what will happen when the crisis is over.,"About 6 months ago my mental health started going downhill, fast. I was putting extreme pressure on myself. Health wise, looks wise, smart wise. Everything had to be perfect. This caused very high anxiety and school was the main cause. 

I started going on auto-pilot as a way to cope. Didn’t talk to anyone, didn’t hear anything, barely noticed the leaves turning red when autumn came. I barely remember most days.

I didn’t know how I would manage 1.5 more years of school. It got a bit better during breaks, but then school came back again and my brain just turned off.

Now we are having school from home because of corona and I feel better than I have in a long time. My mental health is still not good, but I feel like I have the energy and time to recover when I am at home. I’m starting to feel like myself again.

The thing is, eventually school will begin again and honestly I’m scared. I can’t go back to the mental state I was in and I’m scared that it will start all over again when the crisis is over.

I understand this is selfish. Many people are suffering and corona has brought very much pain into the world. But for me, it’s done a lot of good."
1261,What to do?,"Ever since COVID-19 forced us to be quarantined, my mental health has been degrading. I just feel so useless and I'm crying a lot more and I just don't feel happy unless I'm with my girlfriend or my best friend. It's like outside of people, I am nothing.  I just don't feel really any happiness outside of people or my sport. I went to tell my mom that my mental health was feeling worse and she said ""No, you are fine. You have us so you are fine"" Completely blew me off. That hurt really fucking bad. My own mother just blew me off like it was nothing. I've just been lost on what to do at this point. I honestly don't know anymore."
1262,Zoloft taper ranting,"Taking a look at this subreddit it feels like I might actually be heard. Really just venting so it's a little all over the place. 

Withdrawal from these psych meds is no joke. It's caused more problems than what I went on them for, and sunk me into the deepest hole of my life. 5 years after seeing a psychiatrist it's prob one of my biggest regrets...don't really think I needed one.

Really struggling with Zoloft taper right now, I've cultivated and fortified many organic coping mechanisms I wish I took seriously before going on meds (like working out, cardio, meditation, yoga)- These reasons + the numbness the meds caused, I decided to begin a taper. However that was now a whole year ago which blows my mind. Each dose drop has been a mini-withdrawal of it's own, stabilizing after about 4 weeks or so. I'm finally down to 25mg but I think the organic depression, and the anxiety that was there previously is dragging me down again. 

Getting off klonopin knocked me into social isolation for 6 months (before it was cool); that was a hell in it's own. 

My career prospects are probably what's depressing me the most nowadays, I am at an IT job that I'm not  a huge fan of. I don't want to go into IT. I studied marketing and information systems and then got my MBA. Financially illiterate parents (and by chain rule I was financially illiterate at the time) decided to go to a super expensive private catholic university...so now I have 100k worth of debt to pay off and an immensely deteriorated psyche. 

Started a business out of school with the help of the meds (Zoloft, dexedrine and klonopin), I did have a lot of social progress mostly induced by the meds, networked, got out of my comfort zone, made a little money but emphasis on a little- it all went back into the business. 2 years into the business a psych took me off the klonopin and adhd med and the business fell apart, I couldn't even leave the house, answer emails phone or text. This alone was enough to cause a deep depression. 

Now a year and a half off klonopin I'm struggling getting off this last med and anxiety is back through the roof. 

I'm trying to get a new job in NYC (where I live outside of) and I'm too hesitant to reach out to alumni network or people I know who can help in this situation. I don't know how stable I'm going to be from one day to the next to be honest still. The meds alone have caused a lot of cognitive dysfunction and I'm often more confused than thinking clearly. I really want to move into a field that I know I want to grow in (which isn't IT), something I can be somewhat proud of, and know that I'll be able to pay off my loans eventually. 

However with all this aspiration, my motivation seems to have gone out the window to learn, it feels almost like I can't even learn if I try. Brain is still full of sludge, and despite being on amphetimine most days I still can't seem to break the habit of procrastination...I apply and apply to jobs but haven't gotten one positive response yet. Know I need to change but can't seem to push myself to make changes, or else I'll just fall back into old patterns and hate myself more. 

Anyway thanks for reading my ted talk. TL:DR Feel stuck af in a shitty position because of my mental health issues, the meds' withdrawal."
1263,School feels impossible,"My college switched to online school and I hate it. I thought focusing in class was hard enough, doing school work and home and learning at home feels actually impossible. My depression is at an all time high. I really want to drop this semester to focus on mental health."
1264,I wrote a little story about what how I get lost in my own head sometimes. I think some of you may kinda feel the same,"Drifting

Here I find myself hesitating on which story to illustrate. Which path I want to elaborate on. I see all the 
different avenues that my pen can take me, and yet I choose none. Slowly drifting from dream to dream, I 
close my eyes, then open them once more. I see no difference. 

Living under the stars is something many long for; living among them is something you cannot choose to 
do. To see the glowing patterns of light all around me, inside and out, to feel the position of the planets as 
they orbit the sun, to see the constellations as they drift above my head- this, is the story I wish to tell. No 
words can describe it, and no artist can depict it. My life among the stars cannot be translated; it can only 
be felt. One life at a time. This is the story I wish to tell. 

I look down. What was once a pen clutched tightly in my left hand, is now a map I have seen many times 
before- a guide to the cosmos where I now find myself. It has no pictures, no markings or text. How I 
long for someone to find me, for someone else to hold what I am holding. These are the moments where I 
look to the stars, for guidance, perhaps. I look up and ask what they are doing here. Surely, they too have 
a purpose. 

I know that somewhere, might turns to day and day turns to night. Somewhere, eons away, seasons 
change. Beauty lives in smiling faces, it howls through the wind and spreads from being to being. Planets 
rotate, somewhere, around one common sun- a sun that everyone I have ever known has shared. I can no 
longer see it, but i feel its light gently raise me up, farther, higher, further away. Up, up, up I go, past 
entirely new suns and countless specs orbiting in perfect unison. Although every star I pass is one farther 
away from home, I know I will return. 

Suddenly, I see. I see exactly what I want to write about. I see the story I want to tell.

Gently, elegantly, I drift down, following the same path to which I ascended. Down, down, down I go, 
saying hello to old friends and remembering all the places I have been. A small speck of light emits 
against the endless curtain of black. I see it grow, little
by little. I close my eyes, and open them once more. The light remains. As I pass familiar solar systems 
and drift past burning stars, I remember what it’s like to stay up there forever; I remember what it’s like to
have no star to return to, no origin from which I came. I remember what it’s like to be a very small part of
something so large that I simply could not understand it. But that is not me. Not anymore. For I now have 
a way back home. wherever I go; no matter the distance, no matter how long a journey, I can now return. 

My sun welcomes me back, and does not ask where I have been. I find my pale blue dot, and point my 
finger. “There. That is where I want to go.”
I am met with a light gravitational pull. How I longed to feel the weight of something, anything, holding 
me in place once again. I shut my eyes one last time. As I pass through clouds, and feel the wind upon my
face, I smile. I am here. Finally, I am home. 
I awake. sitting in my desk, I look around to see what has changed. Some things are new; a book now 
rests upon my nightstand. The ink of my pen has changed from blue to black. A small rocket ship is 
etched in pencil in the corner of my page. I smile. 
Thanking the stars for allowing my visit, and promising to someday return, I pick up my pen and begin to 
write."
1265,What's wrong with me?,"Hello, sorry if I make any grammar/spelling mistakes, English isn't my first language. Also, I apologize if this doesn't fit in this sub.

I'm 16 years old, I live with my parents and I have a pretty good life, I don't have any kind of issues with my family nor my school. However, I've been feeling really weird lately, and I don't understand why. 

It all started about 2 months ago, I was just sad but I didn't worry about it. 1 week later, I started having mental breakdowns every single night, with no reason at all. Another day my mom asked me if everything was okay, and I instantly cried. I still don't know why. I tried really hard to stop but I couldn't. And this happened two times. 

But now that we're all in quarantine, it's just getting worse, and I try to understand what's going on in my mind but I can't. At first I was just bored like pretty much everyone here, but I still did my homework (even though I procastinated a lot) and talked to my family. But then it got worse. As I'm writting this, I just stay on my bed all the gosh darn day, I don't do any of my homework and I don't want to eat anything. And I know that I can get out of bed and get my life together, but I just don't want. I'm too lazy. I can't. I also feel really down and I don't talk to anyone, I blocked all of my friends and I deleted their phone numbers. When I feel like I'm starting to feel better, I feel guilty and I do everything to feel bad again (for example, I think about all the productive things that I could have done when I was in my bed so I feel like sh*t, or I think about cringy stuff that I did in the past and tell myself how stupid I am and that I don't deserve feeling okay). I've read some articles about depression and even though I have a lot of the symptoms, I don't think that I have it, because I *know* that I can feel better, but I don't. By the way, I hear my parents argue more often, and I know that it is because of me, so it makes me feel even worse. I feel like this might just be a lack of motivation. Does anybody know what's wrong with me, please? Why do I act like this and make myself feel miserable?

1266,How come?,So I've been seeing a lot of posts where people say they have brain chemical imbalance. My question is how come? I mean how do they come to this information? Who are the ones who determine and come to such a conclusion? A psychiatrist or other kind of specialist? Is it assumptions based on theory or physical testing is being done? I mean I've read a lot of information that it is likely that there's a relation between mental health and brain chemical levels but is there really a reliable way to measure so called chemicals?
1267,Healing Yourself Through Your Reality,"**The reality you’re having experience of is simply an extension of your state of being, this is why the fastest way to grow in our spiritual &amp; emotional journey is to learn directly the lessons from what we’re manifesting on a moment by moment basis**

There are certain problems and situations that will keep manifesting in your reality till you’ll be ready to integrate certain lessons and raise your level of consciousness as a byproduct of it, cause when we learn the lesson we won’t need the experience anymore, the reality will stop mirroring back to us that belief/program cause now we’re free, we’ve let go of it.

Here we realise that reality is a mirror that is serving us in the highest good by reflecting us our distorted perceptions so that we’ll be able to come a step closer to the infinite love that we’re all part of:)

1269,Coping with interruption to your routine,"Hello! First time posting on reddit so I apologize if I get something wrong.

Anyway, for those of us who relied on routine to help cope with our issues, how is everyone doing with the interruptions to life because of the pandemic? Many of us are now furloughed, working from home, etcetera, which I know has really messed me up.

I used to have a routine where I'd snooze my alarm a couple times, get up, take my meds, get dressed, and so on before I went to work, did my morning file sync, check my email, and have my morning meeting. Now, I roll out of bed 15m at the earliest before my meeting and usually forget my meds, don't bother to eat breakfast or shower, and it's really hurting me.

So, TL;DR, how is everyone dealing with the sudden changes to life?"
1270,I will never be good at anything.,"Hi

I will never be good at anything. I have never won an award in anything. The only hobby I like is reading. I love books. I used to write poems but they are mediocre. I also like to write in general but there are people out there to write so much better than me. Yesterday I read a friend's essay and cried because no matter how much I try, I cannot write like that. It was very well written. I like to draw and do art but I suck at it. I always have to look at a reference, even then it looks terrible. It looks like a child did it. I always have to force myself to do hobbies because I don't have any. I don't have any particular skills besides browsing the internet. I can't play an instrument.

I feel like I have disappointed my parents. I didn't do well in high school, I wish I did. I'm in college now and chose a major that I don't love anymore, and it won't pay me much. My courses are pretty easy, anyone can do them. I'm not sure what degree I want to do afterwards. I really don't know what I like.

I am not good at math. I can't help it but compare myself to others. So many families in my community have kids that are successful doctors and engineers. You would think that they're doing it for the money but they are actually passionate about it. I will never be like them. I don't even know what I want. 

I have anger issues sometimes and get really affected by what people say. Everyone in my life leaves me on read. I feel like I have no value at all.

I have disappointed myself and my parents so much."
1271,Is it normal to hear voices sometimes?,"(Cross-posting this a few different places)

Pretty much what the title says. To clarify, this doesn't happen super often, but it's been happening for a while now where suddenly I'll just start hearing people talking even though nobody is. It typically happens when one or more of the following is true:

1. It's really late at night
2. My eyes are closed
3. I'm really tired

When it's really late at night, I figure it might just be paranoia because I worry that somebody else will still be awake without my knowing or that I'll have woken them up. If I'm really tired, I figure maybe it's just exhaustion or I'm half asleep and my dreams are bleeding into reality? But there have been times where I was very well-rested, it was the middle of the day, and I closed my eyes and I could hear people talking -- even though nobody was. It differs in what it sounds like; sometimes it'll be several people speaking softly and indistinctly (as if they were far away but without sounding far away, if that makes sense) so I can't tell what they're saying, sometimes it's just one person and sounds very loud and distinct, sometimes it sounds like people I know, sometimes it sounds like people I've never met, etc. But it always comes and goes very quickly -- almost as soon as I notice it, it disappears.

Could it be stress or something? I'm not super-worried; like I said, it's fairly rare and I'm not in my 20s so chances are it's not schizophrenia. They never tell me to do things -- in fact, most of the time I can't even tell what they're saying, or if I can it's usually just a word or phrase, *maybe* a sentence and I forget it almost immediately (probably be my ADHD). Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

He has some serious trauma because of his past, and sometimes it affects our relationship, especially when we're having an argument. I would like to talk about things calmly, but he tends to overreact and he just starts to panic. He gets very melancholic. He is scared of losing me. This is very draining for me, since I have my own mental health issues that I'm dealing with.

We live in different countries, so the healthcare in his country is very different from what I'm used to. He lives in the UK. He's said that it's too expensive to go to therapy and that the psychologists and are shit. He'd need proper therapy, not just a nurse to talk with.

I'm scared that his trauma is going to come between us. I want this relationship to work. He is very loving and caring, and I really want to be with him. What are his options? Therapy would be really good for him.

1277,Coronavirus: Motivational Quotes To Help During This Difficult Time,"&gt;""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us."" \~ J.R.R Tolkien

**My interpretation**: The world is ruled by both karma and chaos, and since we cannot control everything, we should focus on the power that we do have, and use our time in the wisest manner possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Yet is it far better to light the candle than to curse the darkness."" \~ William L Watkinson

**My interpretation**: No matter how bad circumstances are, or how much you would like to complain about the world, doing something positive, no matter how small, will always be the better choice.

&gt;""Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise."" \~ Victor Hugo

**My interpretation**: Just as the sun rises again every morning to cast its light and warmth back into the world, so shall our times of darkness and despair pass. All because you cannot see the light right now, it does not mean that it is gone for good. Hold on a little longer and have faith!

&gt;""You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."" \~ Marcus Aurelius

**My interpretation**: A key principle of stoicism is learning to accept the external factors in our lives with minimal resistance, whilst focussing on what we do have control over—our mind. The more we do this, the more resilient we will become, and the more we will be able to flow throughout life with relative ease.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""This too shall pass."" \~ Persian Adage

**My interpretation**: This old saying is an extremely useful one when going through difficult or troubling times and is almost always true. The mind has the tendency to lie to us about the transient nature of negative feelings, emotions, and beliefs, and what may seem like a never-ending thunderstorm, is really just a passing cloud with a rainbow on the other side.

&gt;""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."" \~ Reinhold Niebuhr

**My interpretation**: This quote is known as the Serenity Prayer, and is a profoundly simple yet wise piece of advice, which is applicate to many situations in life. When things can be changed we may require courage to overcome any fear that is holding us back, but other times simply accepting the situation is the best response. One could argue that acceptance also requires courage.

1278,Not sure who to talk to about this,"Hi everyone, I am here for some guidance. I think I may suffer from some form of depression due to certain feelings I have been experiencing over the years, which have gotten stronger in the past months. 

For some back story, I lost my mother to cancer back in 2011, and wasn't allowed to see her during the 6 months leading to her death. I admit I feel betrayed and angry because of the decision my parents made to hide her from us so we don't remember her in a bad light, but I wanted to be there and I remember her in bad state when  she was still at home anyway. Following this ordeal I was told to keep living life normally, I graduated, got in a serious relationship, travelled, got a job, etc... Not once being allowed to fully express my feelings of sorrow or seeing a therapist in these 9 years. Over these 9 years I have become more shut off from people and have a problem trusting people with being my true self, so I just show my happy normal self instead. 

Things got to a head around a year ago, I left a job that my family was happy that I got (I hated it) without telling anyone, I left at the time everyday until I had a few interviews and got my current job with an airline. I didn't care what my family thought about it and I was happy I made this decision without consulting them. I also ended my relationship of almost 6 years because I was starting to feel like I would be stuck here taking care of someone and I couldn't bear the thought of feeling trapped. 

Now I am at home (due to the circumstances) on forced leave, and I feel like I am a burden on my family. I feel very low and upset sometimes at home as being here brings back some terrible memories and I have found that trying to talk to my friends about this only brings short answers from them. So what on earth can I do? I just stay in bed and out of the way, let them have the space for themselves to be comfortable, as when I am in a common space (such as the living room) they don't come to hang out there anymore. 

I am at a loss, I don't feel comfortable at home, it's not a good time to move out, I feel lonely and like a huge burden. I feel deeply unhappy and at this rate I just want to hide somewhere alone and never come back. I'm not sure what I can do at this point, if I show that I am sad or upset to anyone it's generally brushed off. I can't cry anymore and I don't want to feel like life is not what I dreamed it would be like when I was younger."

1281,I’m disconnected with everyone,"People around me tell me I’m friendly, I can make friends easily, I think? I’m easy going, a happy person. Until I felt myself drifting away from who I think I am. I couldn’t feel any connection with everyone. I’m afraid to meet my friends because I might not be able to form any topic to talk about since they knew that I’m kind of a conversation starter. I’m scared of dead air that’s why sometimes when they invite me somewhere, I decline and make excuses. Since own country is on lockdown, my only communication with them is messenger. I still talk to them and pretend everything is fine and push myself to tell them something but I couldn’t feel anything. I feel like I’m just fooling myself. Same goes with my family. I get annoyed easily and cry when things doesn’t go on how I want it to be. Or because of the smallest things. Even before all these, I question myself who I really am. If I’m just making things up and if I’m just pretending to be someone that I’m not I don’t really know."
1282,Confused by my own thoughts,"I have been pretty sad lately, but I’m definitely not feeling suicidal. I don’t want to take my own life and have no plan to. But yet I keep thinking things like “I could jump off that bridge” or “I could drive in front of that train” and today I thought “today would be a good day to die.” I don’t know why I keep having these thoughts."
1283,Mental health in students and developing proper care method.,"Hi :)

Without giving too much information I work for a state official and have been developing a series of laws that can aid mental health in students, teaching them how to manage any issues they have, along with encouraging them to seek help, a big issue so far has been the stigma sadly. I am reaching out to this community to see if I can get first hand experiences and suggestions on would have assisted you. I am primarily focusing on high school years, but any suggestion that would help is welcome. I am in NY, but laws are a method of states copying from each other to be the best. If you don't want to publicly comment please PM, I am all ears!

Of course passing the law is always a challenge, but there is victory in putting the law into suggestion which is a great method to raise awareness and to garner support."

And not too long ago I told my mom that I was suicidal and she said that she didn’t care and that it would be better without me. Please help."
1287,How can I be diagnosed???,"Hi there, 

So i've always struggled with anxiety but I could cope so ignored it. This developed into a mega panic attack which made me feel like I was going crazy. Since then, I get spurts of existential intrusive thoughts, derealisation episodes lasting days, anxiety, and occasional attacks. Its really worrying and  I haven't felt the same in a while - it preoccupies a lot of my time and thoughts. 

From what i've googled I have Generalised Anxiety Disorder and i'm convinced perhaps Existential OCD. I've been to see the campus Nurse and tried to make it clear how distressing everything was and she agreed it was anxiety and prescribed SSRI's. But that was that. 

What I wanted to ask is how can I be properly diagnosed? It didn't feel like a diagnosis- I don't know what I was expecting. This might sound silly but I feel like I need some sort of validation from a professional. She didn't tell me whether she thought I had some form of mild OCD, she didn't tell me I had an anxiety *disorder*, she just followed my lead, agreed I have excessive anxiety and then prescribed some pills and that was that.. 

It doesn't feel like its enough. It seems so wishy washy, and so I have constant doubts that there's anything wrong with me and that i'm just 'self diagnosing' and because nobody has affirmed that anythings wrong with me this constituently fuels inaction until I have big attacks again which knock me back into believing something is wrong. 

Is it strange that I haven't been diagnosed as having a disorder? Or does nobody actually get 'diagnosed'.. I'm not asking for a certificate I just want to hear the words. Can I ask for this? A diagnosis? I Guess I don't really understand how doctors and stuff work, this is all so new to me."
1288,Please help me leave advice,"Help me ASAP

My girlfriend and I of two years has been really upset with me talking about balky my exes and I have thought of them because of intrusive thoughts and triggers but I remember using Kik and stuff a hit while we were dating but I can not remember if I sent any pictures to someone when we were dating I remember what class I was in during school but I had the same teacher three times over three different time periods so I do not remember when it was and I am worried she will leave what do I do? She has very low self esteem I can’t stop shaking and I’m freaking out because there is not a way to really check when it was. I do not want to lose her."
1289,Dealing with a child who is struggling with trauma. Help?,"TW/CW: abusive relationships  

Hello people of Reddit. Sorry this is an absolute novel. Hope you are all doing ok during these difficult times. I (34f) would like some advice on this tough situation my best friend is in right now. For background she and I do not live in the same country as I moved abroad for work.

So here goes. My best friend (28f) is my favourite human being. We are cousins and grew up together and we talk pretty much every day. For privacy I will refer to her as Tina in this story.

When Tina was 20, she met a guy who we’ll call Kurt, who was 26 at the time. About 10 months later they got married and 2 months after that she got pregnant. So basically, within a year she was married and pregnant.

I’m going to fast forward and leave out the meat and potatoes of their horrible horrible marriage but she went on to have two kids with this man.

Tina suffered some of the worst sexual, emotional and mental abuse I’ve heard of during the subsequent years, none of which she let on about until after she had split up with him for good. Eventually she did and I was very supportive of her choice. When she told me I played it cool but internally I was throwing a fucking party. That was 2.5 years ago. He didn’t make it easy on her, and he still continues to be a dick but at least she’s out of that situation.

This story has a happy ending for Tina though. Since she left him she has turned her life around completely. She went to therapy and has gotten great support from the local womens crisis center. She is now enrolled in college and absolutely killing it. She joined a crossfit gym and lost 40 pounds. She’s a total beast now. She’s got more energy and her sense of humour came back. She’s way more present with her kids now, who she has sole custody of (Kurt sees them every other weekend when he bothers to show up). Generally, she is feeling strong and confident and I’m so proud of the person she has grown to become through all of this.

So that’s the back story. Fast forward to now, she has a boyfried that she met at crossfit (who is awesome and a total snack btw). They recently moved in together and are slowly ironing out the kinks of their new blended family (snack has an 8 year old son).

Her oldest son who we will call Greg is now 7 and a half. Her youngest who we will call Barney is 3 and a half. Barney is doing fine; he was too young to understand most of what happened. Greg however, is not. Greg is highly intelligent and does really well in school but at home can be explosive and really knows how to be annoying. He can fly off the handle and will scream bloody murder when he is upset. Sometimes when he doesn’t get his way, he will make these high pitched screaming noises over and over and over without relent and poor Tina wants to tear all her hair out. It is so hard for her to deal with him, especially when he screams and says he wants to go see Daddy. He gets really upset when his Dad bails last minute on his weekends with them, which happens ALL THE TIME. Considering Kurt only gets to see them every other weekend, when he bails it means the kids go a month without seeing their Dad. Two months if he bails twice in a row. When Kurt bails he does so very last minute and blames his anxiety, says he’s feeling suicidal, or says because of his child support payments he cannot take his kids that weekend as he can’t afford food. Since the pandemic he has lost his job and has asked Tina to cancel his child support payments as he is out of work. Tina, also being out of work due to the pandemic, said fuck no to that.

So this past weekend, Kurt had the kids. Tina got them back this morning. Barney was fine but Greg was in a state. Since he came home, Greg has refused to speak to his mother and when she asks him a question or to do something he kind of just stares right through her. If he wants something and she says no, he will do the high pitched screaming thing. She basically said dude, until you calm down and relax, you’re in your room. Go read a book or do whatever.

I realize it is a pandemic. Everyone’s life is fucked. Greg’s school is closed (a place where normally he really excels and it’s a really positive thing in his life). He’s not been seeing his Dad regularly for the past two years. He’s adjusting to living in a new house with a new step sibling and mom’s new boyfriend. Tina thinks that Greg blames her for him not being able to see his Dad that much anymore. She obviously cannot explain to him much about what happened, but fears that Kurt is telling him all sorts of things during their weekends together.

Kurt plays the victim through everything. He cannot keep a job, is horrible with money and blames Tina for his life falling apart. Nothing is ever Kurts fault. In his mind, he was not abusive and in fact was the victim of abuse himself. One can only guess what he says about it to Greg when they do see each other. Greg is usally a mess for several days after a visit with his Dad.

So with no school, no family therapists being open or available, and Tina having the kids basically full time she is REALLY STRUGGLING and doesn’t know what to do. Greg’s behaviour has worsened and there’s just so much going on that she doesn’t know what to do. She finds herself snapping at him and not being as patient as she normally can be. I think that’s totally understandable but I have no idea what to do to help her out. I’m a first grade teacher so I’ve been helping her out with giving the kids stuff to do education wise. But this stuff which I consider to be deep emotional childhood trauma stuff, I really don’t know how to help with. And everything is shut down so she’s not got much available in the way of outside help.

So dear Redditors, help my best friend out. If any of you were in a similar situation, can you share how you coped? What strategies did you use that were helpful? Are there any youtube videos or ted talks or books or literally ANYTHING on the subject of dealing with this kind of behaviour in kids that I can share with her? I know she wants the best for her kids and loves them and I hate to see her struggle. I know this pandemic is fucking up all our lives so send a little love and support this way if you have the time. Thanks, and hope you are all stay safe at home."

1291,My friend can’t sleep for days at a time?,"My friend has been staying up for days on end and just recently came to me and said it was involuntary. He hasn’t had problems with insomnia before, so I think something is keeping him up. Does anyone have any ideas as to what it is? (Have any of you had a problem like this before, and if so, what kept you up?) I’ve offered my ears and been very gentle and caring towards him, but I’m not sure what else I can do."
1292,At the end of my rope.,"Honestly this whole nightmare situation is starting to slowly collapse my sense of well-being. I’m a student but the health services in my country make it near impossible for therapy (aka will be a 10 week waitlist minimum). I was feeling hopeful but a couple things are bothering me most:  I’ve lost motivation to study because what’s the point if I can’t get a job in the looming recession. Also- The person I was dating and very into got mad at me over not seeing him enough and now we’re not talking and can’t see each other until July. I can’t repair or grow a relationship over FaceTime. 

I honestly am at the end of my rope and don’t know what to do. No one in my life can relate as they’re all married with secure jobs. Is there anything I can do to overcome these hurdles?"
1293,Quick Vent.,"Like a lot of people, I was getting everything in my life together. I went back to school, I had A+'s in all my classes, I found motivated friends, found someone I wanted to pursue in dating, I had hobbies. Everything was going great. Then, quarantine and university got canceled and I've been stuck inside for about a month with my brother who either explicitly or implicitly gets the point across that I'm mentally ill and need to go on psychiatric medication. I've been in therapy since I was 15. It's been 10 years. I'm actually quite mentally well now. I don't need medication. I'm not depressed. I treat people well, I work towards my future, I develop my hobbies, I look after my things and my cat. I am actually well, but I am constantly having to defend my mental health against my family because of my past and they now use that as a way to focus in on something so they don't have to deal with their own shit. 

I'm super fucking sick of it, because it's only after a very thorough discussion that they finally lay the fuck off and the amount of times I have to do that is so god damn annoying and quite frankly, very exhausting. I have my life relatively together and I journal almost everyday and I'm STILL in therapy to hopefully catch any slip ups before they happen.  

I do the work. I've done the work and if they could all fuck off and look at their own damn selves in the mirror because their reflection looks pretty fucking dirty to me, I would appreciate it. 

And also, just because you act out your emotions and don't acknowledge that they are there, when I attempt to talk through them before (so I hopefully do not) act them out, doesn't make me dramatic. Don't tell me to call my therapist up when you know I have regular scheduled appointments and you have never seen one once. Fuck out of here.

1295,"My long, rambling post about why we get suicidal thoughts. (CW: suicidal thoughts)","**(I’m not a mental health professional.)**

After doing research and self-reflection over the years, I’ve developed my own understanding of why the fuck our brains give us fucked up suicidal thoughts. So basically, this is my interpretation.

**When do suicidal thoughts occur?**

First, there’s some kind of trigger (external or internal). For example, I may feel overwhelming loneliness. The feeling of loneliness is the trigger. Then, the brain (limbic system, specifically) reacts with “Fuck, this is so painful. I’ve activated fight or flight mode bc this feeling is so painful, we must be in DANGER.”

Then, the anxiety and depression kicks in. Something to note is how the limbic system doesn’t take any time to identify why the trigger caused distress and what actual emotion you are experiencing. The brain basically just detects a vague negative feeling, and then freaks the fuck out. It basically overreacts without even trying to understand the source of the problem. It’s lame.

**Why do we have suicidal thoughts?**

I’ve often wondered, why the hell would humans be evolved to have suicidal thoughts? It doesn’t make sense because our brains should be focused on helping us SURVIVE. Suicidal thoughts obviously don’t promote survival. The only logical answer to this question is that the limbic system is well-intentioned but dumb as fuck. The limbic system is overreacting and putting you in fight or flight mode. It’s actually trying to help you by doing this. It’s detecting danger and discomfort. The brain thinks “what is the easiest way to get rid of this pain?”. When the negative emotions are so strong, suicidal thoughts emerge because it’s the only solution that the limbic system can think of. I believe this is a normal response to deep emotional pain.

So, I think the brain ultimately wants you to survive, but it’s accustomed to overreacting to negative feelings/triggers. The brain wants you to survive but it also wants you to not experience pain. When you go into fight or flight mode, the focus is on ending the pain even if that means ending your life. It’s quite ironic because the part of the brain focused on survival is telling you to kill yourself. (My sense of humor might be terrible but I think this irony and the misguidedness of the brain is hilarious.)

**What is the point of understanding the brain’s reaction?**

I think understanding this can help you be more compassionate toward yourself. It’s not your fault you’re experiencing suicidal thoughts. I actually think it’s quite normal to have suicidal thoughts, but that doesn’t mean you have to cling to them or act on them. It’s just your brain’s normal reaction to emotional pain.

**We should be compassionate toward our silly, well-intentioned brains.**

Although I describe the brain’s overreaction as “dumb as fuck”, I shouldn’t be so derogatory. We should be compassionate toward our limbic systems. Even though the brain is sometimes horribly mistaken by suggesting suicide, the brain is ultimately trying to help. I’ve heard suggestions for thinking of the limbic system as a child that doesn’t know any better.

NOTE: I suppose this may all sound like a bummer. The bright side is that through neuroplasticity, we can consciously change the way our limbic system reacts to certain triggers. If you aren’t happy with how your brain reacts to some things, you do have the ability to change it. It takes time, effort and repetition but it is possible. 

**Suggestions for responding to suicidal thoughts:**

(IM NOT A MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST. THIS IS BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS A FELLOW DEPRESSED PERSON.)

When you’re in an overwhelming trance trickled with suicidal thoughts, the main thing to do is to SLOW DOWN and calm the nervous system. The key is to get out of fight or flight mode. I prefer taking deep breaths and/or listening to calming binaural beats. There are also “grounding techniques” that may help. Find what works for you.

**Look Inward to understand yourself more.**

\*\*\*\*DISCLAIMER: Please note that if you’re struggling A LOT, you may not have the energy to dig deeper into your feelings. That’s okay. If you are responding to **trauma**, investigating your emotions may not help. Trauma is complicated so I recommend seeking trauma-informed resources/counseling. Whether or not your experience is trauma-related, If the idea of looking inward is too overwhelming, you should just focus on calming your nervous system. (Then, perhaps distract yourself with positive activities/media until your mood improves.)

Anyway, If you have the mental energy, you can investigate what led to your suicidal thoughts by doing the following.

Think about what triggered all this in the first place. Identify the emotion. Write it down. Identify any external events that pushed you into a negative mood. I think it’s important to name the negative emotions you feel. We are so used to saying “I feel like shit” or “I’m depressed”, but that is so vague. I think our brains think that if we identify our actual emotions, the pain will get worse. That is not true. When we slow down, identify our emotions and allow ourselves to feel those emotions, it’s a bit easier.

For example, I may realize that the insanely uncomfortable feeling that led to my suicidal thoughts was related to vulnerability. I find that when I pinpoint the uncomfortable, triggering feeling as “vulnerability”, then I can do research or talk to my therapist about the specific challenges of vulnerability. If I don’t pinpoint the problem, then the problem is vague and it feels more overwhelming, mysterious and scary.

In my experience, I felt much more hopeless before I understood everything I wrote above. I think understanding yourself  and m human biology in general, can help mitigate the scariness of suicidal thoughts. It’s easy to think that your brain is against you but when you understand the response, it’s easy to see that the brain is trying to help in a terribly misguided way.

I hope this helps at least one person. I wish I knew this stuff when I was an extremely depressed teenager. I still struggle with suicidal thoughts especially during this quarantine. I don’t have everything figured out. All I can say is that understanding why suicidal thoughts generally occur can make the experience less scary."
1296,Had a very upsetting dream and now I might relapse,"So, for background, I have depression and I used to take Effexor for it. But it didn’t work for me and actually made it worse because back in December, I looked for my dads gun and put it in my mouth to see how it fits and made plans to pull the trigger the following week. I told my best friend about it and she worked with me to get me out of the house everyday so I couldn’t do that. And it worked. And eventually I had a change of heart and decided not to do it. 
But last night, I had a dream. I was walking down a dirt road in some run down neighborhood when I found someone having a kind of yard sale. I stopped to look and she had a white plastic bin and written on it was the word “Gun and Ammo”. I asked to look at it and how much it was. She opened the box and told me $20. It looked exactly like my dads gun. I asked if it worked and she told me it’s as good as new. So I bought it and I hid it from my girlfriend (who was majorly upset by what I tried to do back in December). I remember sitting in my dream, waiting for my girlfriend to leave at any moment so I could take it out and put it to my forehead. When I woke up, I was a bit... upset that it was a dream. I thought I had a gun in my closet right now. And now I want one. But I know I shouldn’t have one because of what has happened before. Even though I thought I was doing a lot better with this new medication. I literally haven’t had as many suicidal thoughts as I used to. And now this was just too much. I feel shaken and scared. What’s going on?"
1297,"I'm going insane and I feel that I'm going to lose control over my own mind and one day do something bad. Before any of that happens, I need to end myself.",I'm going insane. I can't control my mind.
1298,Does anybody else feel like they would rather not be here than spend a whole year or however long doing this?,"I’m not having active SI but definitely have been feeling passive SI. It just seems like a lot of suffering to come. I’d rather just get infected and if I die, I die. I want to get this over with. I hate feeling on edge and anxious all the time at home. with a loved one being an essential worker with the public, it is just a matter of time. I don’t want to spend months and possibly over a year like this. I’m sorry. I know everyone is struggling but I just needed some people to vent to about this outside of family and close friends."
1299,Pregnancy daughter,"Hi I just wondered if it is ok that my daughter told me about her pregnant at 3 months,  when you are told about such news is it not what you tell your mum straight away.  My daughter told her husband but waited for 3 months before she told me.  

I’m super happy but I wondered why she kept this from me, even though she’s currently living with me due to work commitments

I would like you get your advice if I’m over exaggerating ?"

1301,Painless methods for suicide?,[removed]
1302,I don’t want to live anymore. 22m,"I’ve been living with a subdural hematoma brain injury that almost took my life years ago. I can speak and walk fine. I’m smart so a random person would never know. But mentally I’ve never been the same, I’m impulsive, depressed, filled with anxiety, my anxiety has givin me performance anxiety, (which means my dick doesn’t work even on 100mg viagra!) and my newest symptom is relentless insomnia. I’ve had to take Xanax to combat anxiety in the past but recently have been trying to wean myself off. I’ve tried all of the non benzodiazepine options for sleep aid and none (including ambien and lunesta) even work. I’m in college and hate it, it’s way to hard for me, tried the military recently and was talking to recruiters and obviously I’m a walking and talking disqualification. I’ve lived such a crazy, interesting, so out of the ordinary life. I love to talk and listen. I love art and at one point I was a glass blower, wasn’t too bad at that. But it always seems like my passion in everything is short lived. Since childhood I’ve been through trauma after trauma after trauma. I’ve only lived this long because I know my mother and my sisters would crumble. I’m so tired of living for other people and I feel like no one understands me. I can’t take anti depressants because they make all these symptoms worse. Everyone who I’ve ever loved has seemed to betray me (girlfriends and friends). I don’t know why life has thrown so many obstacles in my way. I try to be so good to people and I care so much. Shit I’ve even tried sobriety from everything and it makes no difference. I can’t get more than 750$ a month in ssi. Like I’ve explored so many different options and I’m tired of everyone being more capable and have it way easier than me. Yet they don’t understand that because they have never stepped in my shoes."
1303,Why can I be happy without feeling happy?,"To explain this, I need to go a bit further. I had heavy depressions, borderline and schizophrenic since I was 14. As I grew older, some symptoms got better. I'm 29 now, and I'm kind of mentally healthy for about two years. No borderline, no schizo, I'm thankfully rid of it. I would describe my symptoms now as mildly depressed, but it is by far the best mental health I've ever had. 
I'm still on antidepressants, like I will be my whole life, but this doesn't bother me. In Germany it's ""Venlafaxine"" I googled what it's called in English: ""Effexor "" (?).

So, to come to my problem. All I've ever felt were extreme feelings, like pain,  sadness, fear and other negative feelings. But somehow it seems like I can't really FEEL happiness and other feelings. Today the sun is shining and I heart someone beautifully whistling in the streets. I smiled and thought the thought of happiness, but didn't feel it in my body/heart. I smile alot and would describe my charisma as friendly, quiet and positive. But feelings? Not so much. I mostly feel nothing, it's like my heart isn't connected to my brain. All I think of are the ideas of feelings in my brain, as long as the feelings aren't extreme. Same with ""soft "" negative feelings like stress for example. I can't feel the warning signs,  I just recognize that I'm really tired or nauseous when I'm stressed way too long. But I wouldn't think of myself that I'm stressed. 

When someone asks  ""how are you?"", I have no idea. I usually answer ""normal"".

It just feels like I have no connection to my feelings at all, even though I can think of them in my thoughts. 

Is this normal? Am I just overthinking? Does someone have this, too?"
1304,Why do I perceive my good thoughts as a whole different person?,I’ve been struggling with depression for about half of my life and only recently I’ve started treatment. Majority of the times my thoughts are not good. But when I have a happy or self soothing thought it doesn’t feel like me. It feels like someone else is saying the “Hey yknow what it’s alright!” if that makes sense.
1305,Trying to find help,"Hi everyone, 25m in the US of A here.

Amid all the pandemic craziness, I've been feeling my anxiety and disorganization really spiral.  
I used to struggling with this, and mood severely in college (\~year ago) but working from home and being cooped up have not helped.

I'm lucky, because I still have my job and insurance. (HDHP, which I'm sure will fuck me with behavioral health costs.) But I'm trying to figure out how and where to get help. I think a psychiatrist would be one need, because some of my siblings have ADHD, and I relate heavily to their descriptions and things I see online. Of course this would play into mood and such, but in general I'm feeling out of control. I don't want to assume I know anything, but I'm assuming getting help would help, ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Any online Behavioral Health resources in the US (got this pandemic/shelter-in-place situation), and/or where to start, trying to be seen/diagnosed for the first time? Thanks."
1306,Advice for a tired teen,"Hey all,

I'm Lauren and I'm 19.  Since my freshman year of high school (five years ago), I believe I've had depression.  It's affected me enormously, and it's getting worse.  I frequently have suicidal thoughts (don't worry, I don't believe I'm in any danger to myself.  They're casual thoughts).  The problem is, my parents believe they've given me the perfect life so there's no way I could have a mental illness.  I'm too afraid to go the therapist I have on-campus (and she's backed up over a month anyway), and I can't pay for an online therapist because a) I can't afford it, and even if I could afford it, b) my parents check my bank account weekly.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do? I'm tired of life feeling like this.

Any and all help is appreciated.

Thanks and much love to all of you"
1307,Relapse while in quarantine,"Happened to not be able to swallow one of my meds one day. The same night was a party I drank and smoked. The next morning I didn’t take my meds because I was hungover and got offered repeatedly my drug of choice. Happened to result in a month long binge relapse. It’s very hard doing it alone, during quarantine. I’m still in highschool, and almost got kicked out from not showing up. I moved out of my house. My job is gone. I have no friends. I’m paranoid , and always tired. I haven’t used for like 3 days, but when I wake up I can walk to the bathroom and be winded. Anyone else relapse during this? How do you cope? It’s hard being suicidal and needing someone when texting about this type of stuff in detail is not an option."

1309,Struggling and in need of a boost/advice (m20),"

Recently struggling to not feel like a failure, in almost every aspect of life. 

I was a very bright student in school but when it came to my A levels I really did tail off only achieving sub par grades, I was told by my teachers the best thing that would happen to me would be to fail and that I’m just another statistic.

I ended up working at a hotel and I’ve been there almost 4 years. When it comes to work I’m very passionate about the hospitality industry however I have been stuck on a 0hr contract since starting, repeatedly asking for a full time contract yet change of management etc has seen me slip down the line and be forgotten about yet working very hard.
I now find myself out of a job as the hotel is closed and it’s very challenging to keep occupied.

I moved out of my parents house 6 months ago however with there being no job for me I now have had to move back in to my parents with no job. I am one of 5 kids, the youngest, and with this comes a lot of expectation, my parents do not understand my situation. I used to work 60/70 hour weeks at a hotel however they insist it’s time I get a “proper job”. I couldn’t agree more however the lack of full time contract where I work it’s easy to agree with them and beat myself up over it.

Few and far between unfortunately, I have always been a popular person but when it comes to relationships I freeze, I have no confidence in myself to try and start something, now everybody is isolating it will now be a longer wait until something happens.

Currently living with my parents I find them hard to open up to , we argue a lot but considering I have comments across the dinner table of “you don’t know what work is” I find very hurtful and feel like I have no one to speak to.

I’m feeling depressed about this, any feedback is greatly appreciated, opening up anonymously helps as not many would understand my pain if I explained, trying my best to stay positive. 

Thanks"
1310,Quarantine feels,Does anybody who’s 25 ever feel embarrassed or feel bad if you’re still a Virgin and haven’t met anybody new yet since your last first real relationship ... or is it just me.
1311,Please help me :(,"Hi everyone. I'm 20 years old and apologise if this isn't the right place to post. Yesterday I stood up to my abusive, toxic friendship that I've had for two years and the friend left me. (Please see pic, they did not apologise). They've made me feel terrible more times than I can remember and their apologies didn't have any action behind them. I have fear of abandonment and watched them unfriend me. But now it's starting to sink in, I had an attachment to him and the story we were both writing together. I stupidly feel worthless without him even though he makes me feel worthless. I was weak and begged him to stay but he told me I made him throw glasses and punch a hole in his door. I'm fighting every instinct not to message him. I want to feel better off since he's toxic and only ever used me, hurled insults or just swore and yelled. Always managing to spin it on me. But beneath that, my brain will only think about the good times. The times where I should've kept my mouth shut and he wouldn't have left. I'm so hurt he could just drop me so easily. It feels like my fault. I wish he cared about me and I could know the ideas he had for our story that we'd been developing for the two years but he deleted it and blocked me there too which is so so painful. I wish he'd reach out because he thought our friendship was good, but here I am really upset about it all while he's probably celebrating. There are so many unresolved things and we spoke nearly everyday so it feels so horrible and weird not to. I'm thinking of just saying hi, sorry, anything. I have been crying a bit. I'm sorry if I sound lame. Please please any advice? This is killing me"
1312,"Struggling with Getting off this Last Bit of My Anti-Depressant (COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP, ADVICE, EXPERIENCES, POSITIVITY... ANYTHING)","So I've slowly tapered down to my last 25mg of Pristiq from 150mg of the past 2 months. It was very difficult to say the least, BUT getting off this last 25mg seems like hell. Pristiq doses don't go any lower than 25mg and at this point I'm so low in dose, the using another SSRI with a longer half-life like Prozac isn't really worth it as far as adding a whole other antidepressant (my psychiatrist agrees).

He wants me to go every other day on 25 mg, and then every progress to every two days, etc.  
But getting off this last bit is like DEATH, anxiety-insomnia wise, on my day I don't take it. Has anyone experienced this (as far as getting off the last bit)? Also how do I know if this is withdrawal or returning anxiety? I've only been doing every other day for 3 days now, but it's just next level hard. So much anxiety/mentally exhausted I feel too paralyzed to exercise or get a walk in and release some of that energy?

Advice, experiences, or just positivity would be very much appreciated :)"

1314,Going insane,"My mental health has tanked over the weekend and I'm back in a state of perpetual frustration...

Pre-pandemic I was creating and building up a social network as well as looking around for possible job/study to do next year. 

Prior to that I spend around 6 years in social isolation of which 3 while being severely depressed. The other 3 years has been about relearning social skills and gaining confidence. 

The past weekend however, everything is coming down...I havent seen anyone face-to-face since measures have been put in place and it is seriously fucking up my brain. Seeing people through skype or teams isnt doing anything for me and my ambulatory worker is just through phone. 

I dont feel like I can leave the house cuz I've had a fever for about a week now, though without any symptoms of anything. My soar throat is more down to my swearing at every little thing that even dares to annoy me even the slightest....

I don't have anyone to talk to cuz my new social circle is not established at all. I have got to know people but its not that I can call them friends, there is still a lack of trust on my end towards them.

This afternoon I just lay on my bed simply because I didnt want to do anything lest it woukd bring out a burst of anger. 

I really dont want to break any of my stuff nor do I want to hurl my anger at my pets but the danger of it is there. 

I know I'm far from the only person having to deal with loneliness at the moment and I absolutely fucking hate asking for help or god forbid....express how I feel but if I don't...I may hurt my pets in a flash of anger...

I know my anger is merely a mask for all the pain and sadness in my life. The pain that no one has bothered to ask me how I'm doing aside from the ambulatory worker, despite me asking others how they were doing. 

Hsck, today I was thinking about how nice it'd be if I was in a mental institution, atleast there would be people around...

All this fucking work I done and its all falling to pieces because someone decided to eat a pengalin that ate a bat or whatever the fuck cause of it....today was the first date of measurements to be lifted ...now its the 28th of April....

I really am scared that I might hurt someone, or myself if these bursts of anger keep going because I'm unable to release whatever the fuck gets stuck in my head...

They say only the unloved hate....guess I'm unloved then"

But anyway, while she's talking really loudly to this guy -- and i can't even block it out because it's so friggin loud -- and so i'm like, fuck it, i'm going to be present and experience this feeling. it feels like someone's shoving shards of ice, nice sharp ones, into my heart, one after the next. My neck is all tense. tears are welling up in my eyes. i'm invisible to her. i don't matter in the slightest. i disgust her.

I know that a lot of you are just going to assume i'm a creep or a loser or something. that's why i haven't told any of my friends or my parents. i don't want to appear weak in front of people i know, especially as a guy. i used to think that i could ""toughen up"" and get used to it. but it's been 8 months and why haven't i gotten used to it??"

Well I found out a couple days ago he’s been in hospital. Struggling. So I reached out and he says I broke his heart and he wants to give up. The only way he’ll survive is if I give him another chance. The women in me, has a need to care for others who NEED me. But I feel that I want to be happy on my own, without him.

I haven't told my friends because I'm scared what they'll think or say about me and I'm scared to go see a therapist because if it ends up on my record I'm scared that it'll ruin the career in the Army that I want.

This is also probably a dumb place to post this hear because validation over nothing is meaningless, even though it's something we all crave. Nobody understands how worthless someone is besides themselves, and escaping that is just falling back on lies, I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want in life. I know there isn't a point to it and that I--just like everyone else in the world--am a bundle of meat, emotions and instincts. That is something that I have accepted for a long time and it usually doesn't bother me, but sometimes I just lose the point of it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be frank, I'm in University because I want to find purpose or meaning. I care about money, but my goal is to do something that makes me feel good, or makes others feel good (which would make me feel good, selfish right?). My program is good and it excites me. It feels like I need to change the world to feel worthwhile, but I'm not skilled enough to do that and even if I was, what's the point in that? I probably won't feel fulfilled and even if I do, anything that I can do is pointless. 

&amp;#x200B;

This feels like a bad representation of my feelings, but I figured I'd try. The reason I'm posting is because I've felt afloat for awhile (it comes and goes). Today I was having a conversation with a friend through Facebook and voiced my beliefs about everyone being a bundle of lies, and that it's just part of who we are and the faces that we wear. My friend was fine and didn't say anything wrong, but I just felt the urge to delete facebook and all of my other apps. I waste time on them and I don't see the point anymore. We're all just talking about ourselves to other people, no matter how much we pretend otherwise or try and hide it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long and rambling post. I don't know what you can say, but I just don't understand how the world has meaning and how anyone does anything. Not sure if I'm depressed, in a mood, or something else, but I don't want to talk to my family or friends about this."
1326,"My family is toxic, and manipulative, I have no friends, and still two years to go until I'm an adult. What the hell do I do?","I want to have hope for the future, but when I look at my current circumstances it's hard to imagine that things will get much better ang time soon. My mother is a manipulative, and narcissistic person who will bend every truth to fit the narrative she's attempting to push, and at the end of the day is only worried about her image, and social status. She's basically turned my siblings against me, and is attempting to bend me into an obedient sheep, like the rest of my siblings. I'm stuck at home with these people, and it's driving me insane. If anyone on here has any idea of anything I can so to even slightly remedy this, please tell me."

1328,Plz help,"I can't deal with my own problems right now. If anyone could just tell me I'm going to be alright, plz do. I miss someone very special to me and it's killing me not to see her. I'm content and happy being independent but I really need some love right now."
1329,I feel claustrophobic in my own body,"Not  sure if this is exactly the place for this post but figured I’d give it  a try. I sometimes get this feeling that’s hard to describe, the best  thing I can think of is that is feels like I’m claustrophobic in my own skin. I feel very antsy and like I wish I could just take off my skin. It first started a few years ago and would  happen mostly when I was trying to go to sleep but sometime it just happens randomly. The last week or two it's been happening every single night and often throughout the day. 

When  I google this the most common result I get is that it is a symptom of anxiety or a panic attack. I'm not sure though, I'm not generally feeling anxious or worried when it happens, mostly I'm just doing whatever and all of a sudden it hits me. Has anyone experienced this, does it sound like anxiety? If anyone has experienced this do you have a way of dealing with it? It's really starting to drive me crazy."

Dr. Benjie Stern explains what health anxiety is and how you can overcome it. Dr. Stern explains that our desperate attempt to avoid discomfort and uncertainty fuels anxiety, and avoidance locks it in place. Yet we can take back control. We can learn to face our fears rather than running from them. Part 2 Two Most Important Mindsets in Overcoming Anxiety: MINDSET # 1 STOP THE AVOIDANce (COMPULSIVE) BEHAVIORS MINDSET # 2 FACE YOUR FEAR AND LIVE WITH UNCERTAINTY YOUR NOISY BODY Everybody has a lot of fear, panic, and anxiety, but the most important thing is our mindset and how we think about this.

1331,Getting rid of the negativity in my life...,"I deleted all my negative tweets and retweets, unsubbed from negative YouTube channels, and distances myself from politics, and I feel great.  I’ve also stopped watching the news because that’s all negative as well.

It’s stupid, I lived most of my life isolated from society. My family made me be a “family” person and keep a tight leash on me. As their grip slowly broke I loved the freedom but now here I am. It’s bullshit, I gave my friends everything I could but I’m still alone. Damn I miss talking to those others then my partner, no fault on them..."

I overthink every intricate detail and I think about all the relationships I messed up and I just think about how much my anxiety and depression messed up things for me. I went to 2 high schools plus online school for my senior year. I gained so much weight and I feel like the entire world absolutely hates me. I decided to do online school so that I could just get away and focus on losing weight and be around people that support me. It’s gone pretty good but I just can’t get over how much I messed up in the past. I’ve changed so much and I feel like if I could go back, everything would be different and I could’ve had a great experience in high school. I don’t know how to prove that I’ve changed and show the world that I’m better. I just feel so hated and can’t stop overthinking. Please help."
1335,I'm worried for my mom's mental health,"Hello,

I'm not sure if these kinds of posts are warranted here, and if not I greatly apologize. My mom has progressively been getting in a state of psychosis (I think) for about a month and a half. She started watching The Bachelor back in February, and slowly started to make up stuff that was totally off the charts. It started with this show, but started to get worse and worse, until a little over a week ago, I believe she personally snapped. I never knew it would get this serious, and have felt terrible about it. At about 3:30am the day it started, I heard her screaming crying and I was scared to death. I'm home from school so I was staying at my house with my mom. I ran in there and she started talking about people physically harming her, how I wasn't her child, how family members that had been dead for years were alive and that I had been pregnant and had multiple abortions. These are just some things of course. Some are worse. Her main source of these delusions was her phone. Well my dad has been keeping her at my granddad's house where he is my granddad's personal caregiver. He has frustrated me to no end. In this time of COVID-19, the hospital situation is tough and he doesn't want her there which is completely understandable. We've called a psychiatrist, and they have prescribed her medication to help her. This past week has been absolute hell, she has had multiple moods swing, very easily aggitated and sadly she still believes these delusions. She had been taking the medication since Thursday. Well she refused to take her medication last night, and my dad didn't ask her to take it because he didn't want to argue with her. In this instance, I felt like he needed to push it because she is still not mentally stable and she believes she is being treated wrongly because she thinks she's fine. I want what's best for her but I feel like I'm hitting a brick wall with trying to do what's right. I want her to get better but be doesn't listen to what I say and my mom doesn't either. Again, I apologize if this post is not warranted here, but I had to vent somewhere about it. It's been bothering me so bad."
1336,I don’t know if it’s okay for me to feel this way.,I’ve had anxiety and depression for a while. And stopped cutting around January and things were slowly getting better once again. there have been those days/weeks where it’s been hard to move past everything. like I know things take time. I think that’s something I’m always hard on myself for. I always think I’m gonna be stuck. but quarantine has made it a little harder. But like it hasn’t been too bad since I wanted to isolate myself way before this happened because I just couldn’t take being around people. I always need time to be on my own for a moment and just calm down. But now that everyone is in isolation I have people coming to me for advice. Or when I try to reach out to somebody they end up talking abt themselves and I’m the one giving them advice. I don’t want to be ignorant or selfish but it really has been making this even harder for me. It just upsets me that close people to me are struggling too and I want to help them. Sometimes I can’t and I just end up blaming myself. It makes me so anxious. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to turn them down but it really has been affecting me lately. I care abt friends and family and I want to help them and be there for them. But I feel like when they ask for me I have to mask myself and act like I’m okay so that I don’t make it all about myself. I don’t want to turn them down either because I know it’s hard to open up to people so the fact that they are coming to me. It’s hard.
1337,Had the worse case of night terrors last night.,"So I went to sleep without my meds. Sometimes I can actually fall asleep without them. I woke up around 3 AM and I was soaking with sweat. Like I just did a triathlon.  I sleep with the heat off because the cold helps me sleep faster. My pillow and sheets were soaked and my body was like 102 degrees
 I was hot as hell. I know a dream caused this. But I couldn't remember what it is. I have had this happen before. But it was never this bad."
1338,How do I take life not too seriously?,It feels like a fear that keeps coming back of adapting to others.... HOW TO STOP?
1339,Parallel Anxiety,"My depression hasn't been this bad since I last ran away from home.

Firstly, I wanna say that I don't plan on doing this again . I have friends who are my family and who always will be my family so I don't plan on running away. Nor do I have any 'other' intentions like I have done before for the same reason - I love them all and care for them all.

Part of the cause of my poor mental health is the isolation, I've always struggled living at home even if it's only a 'normal' holiday. I struggle to be myself at home due to transgender issues (it took me running away across half the country before they accepted my name but I still can't wear proper clothes at home) and there's nearly always a negative atmosphere which hasn't helped my mental state at all.

Another cause of my poor mental health is being scared. I've had a really bad past with friendships and with my own self and I'm scared that it's happening again . Last time this happened, it took a lot out of me and mostly destroyed who I was. Lots of people have helped bring me back up , and honestly it meant the world that I had everyone's help, but I'm scared that I'm slowly going back to who I was before and that I'm letting them down  . I also lost a lot of other friends and people I loved due to having the depression which just makes things spiral out even further.

There have been some tearful nights lately, and plenty of dramatic mood swings but I am doing my very best to get better and I am trying to get as much help as I possibly can - which is where you guys come in. University is only 5 months away and I'm sure that things can only get better from there.

Any advice or support would be well appreciated.

Thank you"
1340,My Mom didn’t care that someone said something sexual to me,I knew this kid and he would always say sexual shit to me and be crude but he took it too far once again. He basically said that I was masturbating on my damn couch because I said I wasn’t doing anything. I told my mom and she didn’t care. She knows I get really angry when people say that kind of stuff to me because of stuff in the past.
1341,How can one manage time based things consistently,How can I ever manage time based things professionally? If the positive things that I'm supposed to retain in my memory and have on my mind always dissipate from me with time. I'm in introvert (currently) and need to have a private alone time space I can occupy from time to time in order to feel like I'm *acquiring* energy during that time. I haven't really been able to have that (even though I have money to spend) and private rooms are wildly unreasonably expensive around here. I feel like I don't have the energy to even send real text messages and make phone calls in a normal logical manner. Any advice and recommendations please? I will keep trying. I would gladly pay for space and have a little bit of savings. Thanks for listening.
1342,I need therapy-but I don't know how to access it,"The country where I am in has state funded mental health services (which is great honestly) and I have been going for the past 5-6 months. I got discharged because I am no longer a danger to myself, and I assume if you're not a danger, public services aren't going to keep you on. 

I still want to figure out a lot of stuff with my mental health, and access some type of service because I am aware, just because you don't want to die doesn't mean you're okay (at least this is the case in my journey, for a lot of that is a huge thing and I'm super proud if you can get to this stage, even if you haven't yet, proud of you for keep on keeping on).

 It's just, I was suicidal for 5 years, in an awkward limbo for 2 (sometimes very suicidal, sometimes not), honestly very mentally well for 1 year but had a severe re-lapse towards the tail-end of last year. And when I FINALLY got to therapy, it helped me get past the re-lapse. But the main purpose was to get me away from a very, very suicidal mind. Which it did, but in doing it I learned a bot a lot of emotional baggage that I got to unpack in the 5-7 years I was suicidal. And I KNOW there's a tonne more I am not aware of. 

I have saved a bit of cash- but I can only attend private services for a month or so. And I'm feeling lost-any ideas?"
1343,Fucked up personality.,"My parents made sure to destroy my personality. I am not gonna lie, I've never been alright or normal, but their upbringing made it even worse.

I was sociopath with paranoid personality disorder and had problems with anger and from time to time depressions. It was consecutively replaced by bipolar, which was dominant from 10-17.

Now it's weird. I fit in bipolar perfectly, BPD is also very accurate. But I am also schizoid for a pretty long periods (weeks), which is incompatible with bipolar and lately I have also short phases where my childhood personality comes back. 

Sometimes it changes within hours for few days, in these days I crave for anything constant even depression or physical pain. Usually it's (1-4) weeks of one dominant with short flashes of the others. Longest was 2,5 year long bipolar with very few flashes, which I thought I won't ever survive.

The question is: What the fucking fuck?

There's still possibility that I made this all up for some reason.

Thanks for reading and replies. Stay strong."

1346,I've been struggling with my self-esteem since I gained a significant amount of weight.,"Back in October I had surgery to biopsy and resect a brain tumor. Turns out this tumor is what has been making me have bad headaches and always be sleepy and thirsty for about a year prior. They started me on a bunch of medications, and I wasn't able to work for 3 months. I had to back out of nursing school or fail. I was basically at home for 3 months. I gained 30 pounds. Went from 120 to 150. 

I now have a round chubby face, emphasized by my short hair (shaved in January cuz I lost a bunch of hair from radiation). I have red stretch marks on my love handles, inner thighs, and outer thighs. I had to buy all new uniforms for work and I went from a size 4 to a 10/12 in womens pants. I barely fit any of my bras, panties, or tshirts. My fiance wants me to lose weight and he's not shy about his opinions on my weight... so much that I started sneaking junk food... that's how ashamed I am. 

I feel ugly. I know my fiance still finds me attractive. I've asked. But I want the comments to stop. I wish he would stop sending me all these weight loss and exercise videos. I want to feel okay with how I look now. I want to feel beautiful."

In addition, I self harmed because they were pushing my boundaries and pressuring me to not walk out of the situation. Do I really need to be committed?"
1348,Please help,"Hello everyone,

Over the past 6-8 months I've gone through some major changes in my life and I cant seem to find out why. My everything is bad now. I cant seem to focus, remember anything, or understand anything new. I cant even understand math anymore which I was really strong in and was ahead by 2 (now 1 year) years and had straight A's in and AP stats class in 9th grade and now I'm now struggling to maintain a C in pre calc and my algebra is much better than my stats. I feel I have literally no motivation to study or work anymore. I can barely read anymore and I think so freaking slow that a 6th grader could probablythink faster than me. I also cant sleep and will go to bed at 10 to fall asleep around 2 or 3. My personality has also seen a major hit over the past 6 months. I have turned from an extreme extrovert who was funny and felt like conversation to anyone was the easiest thing in the world and now I have turned into an extreme introvert that can barely speak properly or make conversation and now prefers to be alone more often. I feel I'm kind of pushing away the people that mean the most to me. I have also become more hostile and pessimistic towards others randomly. I also feel like my emotions are sometimes numb and feel I should feel (as an example) I should feel sad but I'm not. I just feel sort of uncomfortable like I want to just teleport or go back in time to get rid of any emotion that occurs. I have been diagnosed with extreme undiagnosed ADD but I'm not sure that's the only illness at play at the moment. I feel many of the following: ADD (Obviously), Bipolar disorder, ASD, and OCD. I seem to match around or over 75 percent or more of all those illnesses. The list is in order from the most agreed to least agreed. I have no clue what the hell is going on with my life but I want my old life back and I dont know what to do. I am looking for some advice or what you did in a similar situation.

Thanks yall"

1350,I'm confused on where my mental health stands.,"It's weird writing this down. I feel like there is nothing wrong but I know I shouldn't be ignorant to these huge factors..? When I say I dont know I honestly don't know where my mental health stands.
I'm almost turned 17. I'm in transition year in school (in Ireland, it's an optional, easy going year).
I've stopped caring about school, I cant say why. I still do well naturally but I dread going.
Some days I think I'm perfectly fine and I'm happy as could be. Some days I'd cry myself to sleep with suicidal thoughts racing through my head. I never have any sense of commitment to these thoughts but they're so very real. 
Socially, I'd say I'm pretty well liked by most people in my year but I do have self confidence issues, but nothing out of the odd for a teenager. I'm pretty outgoing.
I'm uncertain if I can say I have bulimia, it wouldnt be unusual for me to purge, but I've never done it long term or lost any weight from doing so. Im pretty sure my mum has found out about it, but I deny it to her. I'm not skinny in anyway from it. 
I used to love music, I was really amazing at playing guitar for my age when I was 14, but since then I've made no progress. I started piano two years ago and have advanced pretty far, but only because I'm afraid of my teacher. I dont really enjoy playing any of my instruments anymore. I don't remember where that passion came from. I think ever since I started piano the stress of it has built up. I wish I could take a break from music, but I've built it up to be so much a part of me I feel like my parents would be disappointed. I've told my mum before I dont like my piano lessons and she'd get angry, saying thing like ""I've put so much into this and you're going to quit?"" But I dont want to quit. I can teach myself at this point. I want to take piano at my own pace, not my teachers.
Recently my brother got engaged and has asked me to play the music at his ceremony, I feel like I should be honoured but honestly I am almost angry at it. I love all of my family and they're very supportive.
Today is a good day, quite relaxed and stress free, I think the social distancing has helped as I no loner have lessons. I'd commonly fake being sick to stay out of school for no reason before, and wonder why I did it. I'd actually be annoyed at myself for doing it because it didnt make sense.
I've had a fall out with my best friend recently. It wasn't dramatic, and were still friends but were just slowly distancing and I dont know why. She started hanging out with new people in her class, not in a way that she was trying to become more popular and ditch me. It was almost the opposite. I know it's bad saying this but shes started hanging out with the weird people. I've never said anything about then to her, I'm not gonna stop her from talking to them I'm not that kind if person. It's just since then weve grown apart. She often would leave a text I sent to her on read. Or one of the two new friends would try to start a fight with me over text. I feel paranoid that they're talking about me. I have other friends of course but this has made me feel that way about everyone. Maybe secretly my friends cant stand me. It sucks.

I realise that maybe it's not best to use reddit like a therapy session, but maybe that's not really the idea. I just want an outsiders view on this. Sorry for the long thread."
1351,I just finished a 2 hour long meeting and am now crying in bed,"Just wanted to tell this to anybody lol

I love my job but having meetings everyday is kinda socially exhausting. They usually don't take up TWO HOURS though wtf."
1352,OCD can be difficult to live with specially without understanding and support,"For some of us who has been diagnosed with ocd in some part during their life, we know for sure that we are the less understood of all the mental conditions. It’s not just about the out there common symptoms of repetitive activities, and perfectionism which in itself can be pretty bad if it’s out of control for some. But it’s definitely something related to how the habitual impulsivity of our mind creates certain tension in the thoughts we have every day. Thoughts, relationships, jobs,careers that take our importance and everything pretty much turns rigid, and then we get in the way to the things we need or want to do. Can you see my point? Who is struggling with this? And how are you coping with this?"
1353,I sometimes just really hate my parents,"As the title says I sometimes really hate my parents. Probably bc they are bringing my mental health worse and don't even give a shit. But I can't blame them after all they don't know that I'm struggling. But they always have to put high expectations on me but I just can't it is all too much for me. I have to deal with my trauma, mental health, bullies and and at home I also always have to be the perfect behaving girl that everyone ""likes"". I'm often on my phone bc it is the only escape that I have. And my parents complain about it which is normal but they don't even try to find out why I am like that. And they don't want me to become who I am. They always want to form me to someone that I am not. They are good parents but at the same time they are not. And in quarante it is only getting worse. I know that it is not good to hate your parents but I just can't help it."
1354,Not a big issue but just wondering why I do this (read below),As I have been alone a lot since this lockdown I have noticed myself doing weird things out loud like singing and pointing finger guns and saying pop pop. It’s really fuckin weird I know. Anyone else get this or something similar. Curious...
1355,"18M, severe anger problems","My name’s Greg, I just turned 18 a week ago, and as the title reads, I’ve recently been experiencing some very intense fits of rage. I’ve put several holes in my upstair’s walls, and likewise have begun randomly screaming obscenities to myself. 

I blow off steam by hitting baseballs and lifting, but that’s not enough to calm things down. The rage gets its worst at night and in the evening, though I don’t entirely know why. On top of this I suffer from insomnia as well, so bear that in mind. 

I’m confused in life right now, with my future, and I’m just so god damned angry all of the time with everything. I talk with friends about my mental health, but they don’t seem to care much, I suspect, so no help there. 

I’ve been suicidal in the near past also, and was for an extended period of time even taking a lethal dosage of benedryl nightly, by accident. 

I’ve had repeated homocidal fantasies starting from my childhood at that too. 

This post is beyond stupid, I don’t know why I bothered to probably just bother others, but shit, it’ll feel maybe better just to know someone else out there hears me I guess. Thanks"
1356,I have alot of issues with family friends and even excitement,"My sister's birthday was today and I got forced to come sit out with them in the living room. Instead of giving the tired little old me a decision. They are threatening me. (A threat doesn't have to be physical or even mental) first they physically threatened me by telling me they were gonna come in with a wooden spoon. Then my sister asked me if I was retarded because I wasn't coming out. Then they told me I would have more chores to do stacking wood by myself. (Typically a tier or two but I usually do it with my sister). Then they told me to leave because I wasn't excited or happy in the least. My mother made fun of my voice because it isn't amazingly cheerful or excited in the slightest. Then everyone told me to leave because I was ruining the mood and now I feel wonderful about being tired and bored. So now I feel like shit (I didn't read the rules I just figured this was a mental issue support website) and I honestly think about suicide all the time. I've tried reaching out to support lines but I don't know what to say. It feels like people around me hang out because of pity rather than actual friendship

TLDR
I feel like shit and wanna die"
1357,"an entitled, emberressing, lonely, narcissistic, judgmental, attention seeking, peice of shit with a huge moral complex","don't think i know myself, dont think i want to. dont think i ever did. dont know what to do. just going through the motions for the last 12 years. more than half of my life. i dont know. cant even stop using 'i'. nothing feels really real. just a jumbled mess. crying but it doesnt register. feels like im acting for more attention"
1358,Are there any online counseling resources?,I made a therapy appointment over a month ago and they kept rescheduling it now it’s 2 weeks away. Then I went online through my college’s free therapy resources to have an online session and they say they can’t see me until the same day 2 weeks from now. I’ve been struggling in new territory for a while and I really want to get help but I feel like the world is tying me down. Any advice?
1359,For 2 years I've been feeling disconnected from my life and reality.,"Sorry if my thoughts will be all over the place.   

 I'm a bit scared because I woke up from a long ""brainfog"" and even now I don't know if I'm fully recovered or what the heck even happened because I don't know what I have even done to have this switch inside my mind. It's not a different reality that I'm living, but a life with more merit. Everything feels the same but better, my reality feels more real than ever before, music sounds more real, better, i can sense the deepnes of the melody I can see colors brighter I feel like I'm in more in place in space, I feel like my mind is working properly, but at the same time I feel so scared because I have no idea what happened in the past and affraid that I will go back because i have 0 control over it.

 So it started 2 years ago my mind ""got shut down"". I remember even now that i've read about determinism, not having free will and I remember It fucked me up really bad, because then on I felt like nothing matters, because I'm not even in control of my actions, the actions, the life I've been living is a lie, the lie of the chemicals and electric current in my brain. I woke up I wanted to study a new language but I couldn't focus at all, I couldn't enjoy anything, even if I studied words didn't stuck, days went by fast, months went by fast, I just had this mundane feeling all day long everyday for months, but yet no one in my family noticed anything, even I didn't notice anything, it felt normal in a sense but I knew something was off, something was not quiet right with me, its like I lost my personality, my dreams etc. and I thought it is normal to function like that, i still woke up everyday, i still did my daily things but I felt so soulless, so out of touch. I had OCD thoughts about what other people think of me, the interactions I had with people came back with emotions daily, even the ones I had 2 years ago it came back.  Everything felt like going 100% speed and I was going only 40%, i felt out of touch with the real world. Corona happened and I was like what? who cares? I didn't feel sadness or anything I felt nothing, i felt nothing for months because everyday felt the same, I felt the same emptiness, unableness to do anything meaningful, even if I wanted to study a language I could not bear myself to do it for a prolonged time. So I played videogames because that were the easiest things to do that gave me slight pleasure.  I also had derealisations for exampe I was sitting at a table with family and I had this weird sudden feeling that life is a simulation, the people around me were robots and everything is planned and I've been lied to. 

 A bit about myself: 25 years old male 180 cm 75 kg I excercise a few times a week mostly cardio. I sit in front of the computer everyday for 10+ hours. I dropped out of college, studied marketing &amp; commerce but felt so disconnected from people and life that I had to drop out, but planning going back to study Computer Science. Now what I've been thinking might have caused this is coffee/caffeine consumtpion or the supplements I take, porn/masturbation, staying up late everyday."
1360,depression and work,"I don't know what to do, I feel stuck and lost a lot. iv had 4 jobs in the past year, I leave(because I feel I don't fit in or my depression is misunderstood) or get sacked due to time off with depression. I overthink like crazy when working so I try to cope by keeping myself distracted by listening to a podcast or music which can get me in trouble at work (factory or warehouse-type environment). I have walked out of work a couple of times due to being embarrassed to explain myself or unable to, I know this is wrong of me and I always regret it after, but in the situation, I feel very overwhelmed. currently, I'm looking for part-time work so I can focus on bettering my mental health and study online, but it's very difficult to find work due to the coronavirus.  I currently work in a warehouse but the job is awful and I feel as if I'm due to be sacked soon like many other people working there.  My irresponsibility is disappointing my dad and giving me a horrible feeling of guilt as it also puts a strain on my girlfriend. iv tried many different antidepressants at different strengths which never really worked. I'm no longer going to see the doctor about my mental health because iv been so many times and still feel the same way. I know they try there best but there is nothing they can do anymore and I also had a terrible experience at a GP when I went for my mental health. that was the last time I went. iv also contacted companies about over the phone counselling. I was giving a one-hour phone call questionnaire and chat, I was told I fit the criteria and was put on a waiting list which could take up to 3 months. that was 8 months ago. 

that's all I want to say. there is much more but this is more personal that id like to be. I may remove this at some point and I hate to bitch and complain when people have it worse. I just don't know where to go from here"
1361,Is this normal or should I be worried?,"After arguments with my wife it's fairly common for me to spiral into feeling trapped in the marriage (we have a child, so now there's REALLY no way out) and about half the time I arrive at thinking about how driving out somewhere and killing myself would be preferable to all the arguing.

I am on Wellbutrin and have had two major depressive episodes in the past, but feel pretty stable and happy on the average day. Anyway, I get this could be run of the mill ""self victimizing"" as a coping mechanism, or out could be something to worry about. It just scares me a little and I need an outside perspective."
1362,Is schizophrenia really a bad thing? It's benefited me tremendously.," 

I just want to clarify a few things before you read this post. I really enjoyed writing this post because I feel like I truly have a chance of spreading understanding and reducing ignorance around schizophrenia. The two 'beings' I talk about in this post are obviously not physically real beings. They are 'real' mentally or metaphysically, as in I experience them. They are real in the same sense that dreams are real, they are seen by the self. I don't get open eyed visuals except for typical early morning hypnagogia. I don't get auditory hallucinations other than in dreams or in rare instances of extremely random tinnitus. When on psychedelics, I still don't have auditory hallucinations but I do get some open eyed visuals. The two beings are not auditory so they instead speak to me visually. Visual communication might be hard to understand if you've never taken a psychedelic. They don't say anything to me. They show me what they want me to know through closed eye visuals and ideas.

I truthfully believe that the main causes of delusion are ignorance, overconfidence, and fear. I really doubt that all schizophrenics are delusional. Imagine growing up in a society where nearly everybody tells you that you're dangerous, mentally inferior, evil, and delusional. Don't you think that that would drive you a bit crazy? What if it gets so stressful that you start to believe it? And on top of the shame, stress, and suicidal ideation caused by societies collective gas-lighting effort, schizophrenics have one big hurdle in their way. Language is useless to them. Think about it this way. Let's say you have a speech to present. If you walk in and just give the speech normally then it should all work out ok. The people who listened will learn and the people who didn't listen will just pretend that they were listening due to conformity. However, if you announced that you were schizophrenic at the beginning of the speech, well, good luck man. Good luck because absolutely no human would listen because schizophrenics aren't seen as members of society worth listening to.

Let me start off by saying that it's obvious that many people with schizophrenia suffer. But is that suffering from the schizophrenia itself or is it from the way society treats schizophrenics? SWIM is obviously schizophrenic and sees no problem with it because it affects his life very positively. He has these entities in his head that act exactly like advisers. If he does something bad or immoral, then the beings/entities/archetypes or whatever the hell they are, will start making him feel bad through guilt, regret, shame, fear, etc.

Speaking of feelings, do you consciously make your feelings? I'm guessing most people will answer no to that. Feelings just happen to you, as if they're being served to you by the subconscious mind and it's your duty to interpret the feelings. For example, if I miss a workout day I can choose to view it as a good thing and just grind harder next workout, or I could view it as a reason to quit. I believe that life is entirely about the choices you make in it.

Speaking of choices, what makes someone suffer from schizophrenia? Think about it like this. You're born into the world and you, like other humans, start to grow and develop a personality. Throughout early childhood you have an intensely strong and visual imagination and love having it, although everything good has it's negative aspects. The imagination can be a source of great fear, shame, and cowardliness if you pussy out and don't accept it's challenges. This reminds me of a while ago when I thought ""Damn, I need to go for a ten kilometer run"". I went the whole day thinking about the run but never did it and instead played video games or wasted the time some other way. My brain punished me for that because I knew what the right choice was and I decided to make the wrong choice.

You might wonder, how and why does the brain punish me? This is how I see it. There is a force/being that has been guiding me my whole life to do the right things and follow love, learning, growth, responsibility, laughter, and all the other things that are worth struggling for. This force of good, lets call him Henry, is the force letting me write this post in hope of piquing interest in others and reducing stigma, hate, and ignorance towards schizophrenia so I can maybe one day open up to someone about it without being labeled as some useless, delusional, evil, sub par member of society. Henry is such a good dude. I associate my boy Henry with virtue, responsibility, love, sacrifice, and anything good. Henry grows stronger, hangs out with me more, loves me more, and improves my mood when I make the right choices like working out, doing homework, going out of my way for people I love, practicing ukulele, etc.

Henry is the force of good but every yin has its yang and there is indeed a force of evil. This force can be described as evil, satan, or 'the shadow', but for now we can call him Hank. This douche-bag uses fear, weakness, shame, jealousy, greed, laziness, etc. He uses these to manipulate me and make me stray away from doing good things. To give some more understanding of this Hank fellow I will try and show you how he operates. Let's say you have two plates on a table. One of the plates has plenty of good, healthy food. The other plate just has Doritos or some other junk food. This is where the advisers come in. Hank will be like ""Bruh Doritos taste better than healthy food, you can always eat healthy food some other time"". Henry will be saying ""Hank wants you to eat those Doritos because he wants you to suffer, pick that healthy plate and you'll function better in the future"". This is a very important thing to realize. Henry (good) is a man of delaying gratification and making sacrifices in the present to have a better future while Hank (bad) is a lazy, cowardly, hateful slob whose sole purpose is to make me like him. Without Hank constantly posing a threat to everyone life, things would get boring and Henry wouldn't really serve a purpose anymore. I hate to get all cringy and bring up the movie Mega Mind but writing this is reminding me a lot about how Metro Mans absence caused Mega Mind to make a new villain. A consistent battle against evil and reinforcement of virtue gives life its meaning.

People will inevitably ask ""If the hallucinations are not real, how could they possibly be helpful?"". Let's say I've oriented my entire life around hanging out with Henry and avoiding Hank. Henry is associated with good so If I hang out with him, I succeed more. Hank is everything that I do not want to be, so he belongs in my mind to make me hate the evil he is associated with. Sure they aren't real people that I can show to my friends, but maybe that's how it's supposed to be. They belong in the mind, where they guide me along my life journey. These two characters of my imagination compose the moral system that I live my life by.

Regardless of all the misunderstanding and hatred surrounding schizophrenia, I would truly, absolutely, frickin hate to be born any other way.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I know this is a big post but please at least read the first paragraph or skim through. I tried to make it entertaining and interesting while also explaining my ideas."
1363,dealing with non-understanding parents during the pandemic,"being bipolar with ADHD is hard; I feel whiny

hi i’ve never posted really. but this is just a rant because I hate to burden anyone around me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 1) about a year and a half ago after five years of struggling with what I thought was just basic depression and anxiety issues. My family does not recognize mental health illness and that has undoubtedly made it harder to deal with. Last November my psychologist recommended I get an ADHD evaluation and my college funded the testing. After the long evaluation, I did end with an ADHD diagnosis with more hyperactive issues than attentive. I have been on and off of Zoloft (Sertraline) since I was 16 (currently 21) but it doesn’t seem to help as much as it used to. This time around, I have been on 150mg daily since October. In February, my psychiatrist prescribed me Adderall (Amphetamine Salts) as needed (Up to 30mg twice a day but I usually only take 15mg once a day because the 30mg interfered with my heart condition). Being home from college due to COVID-19, it has been so extremely difficult. My doctor had suggested mood stabilizers or antipsychotics before but I always said i’d rather keep trying zoloft because if my parents found out about the different medication, they would flip out and make me stop it or I would never hear the end of it. I just don’t know what to do because sitting in my house with no one that is comforting or loving or caring or understanding towards what I have going on is so trying. On top of that, the new online course format from my university has clashed severely with my ADHD. At college, I lived on my own in university housing but I had a routine, and I had physical classes and attendance to keep me accountable and on top of things. The lack of structure and routine has hindered me in trying to get work finished. I don’t blame only ADHD because I am not disabled and I deserve no pity or accommodation. I have never asked for learning/classroom accommodations after my ADHD diagnosis because I feel like it is unfair to all the other students. I just wanted to get off my chest how stressed I am because I have no one to turn to at home. I feel like such a burden to everyone. All of these “battles” I face everyday just stay to me because I can’t tell anyone without repercussions. 

TL;DR I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, with not a great home life and forced to be here due to COVID-19 pandemic.

1364,Anxious about my future,"I’m 16(f) and have had really bad anxiety for the past couple of years, my trigger is public speaking, and I know it sounds cliche, but in some cases, I can’t even talk in front of my family during a party. I know that being able to present your self is one of the most important skills in life, and i (a sophomore) don’t think I can overcome this. In freshman year of high school, I missed 30 days of school trying to avoid speeches and discussions, and it came to the point where I was granted a 504 plan in school which excuses me from anything I don’t feel comfortable doing, which led to me avoiding my fears even more. Now I feel that i have fallen into an idea that I will never have to face my fears again. I question how I will get through life and sometimes think about giving up on trying, I have big goals in life, like being an anesthesiologist, but my anxiety makes me feel like it’s impossible. I have tried therapy and I absolutely hated it, I couldn’t even sit in the room alone with the therapist. Please give me advice."

1366,What has been your number one resource for improving your mental health?,"Hey everyone,

I have been listening to podcasts and reading books for the last few years working on improving my mindset,  mental health and general well-being.

A few of the best resources that I've found so far:

* Books and podcasts by Tim Ferriss
* Joe Rogans podcast
* Meditations by Marcus Aurelius 
* Impact Theory podcast with the founder of Quest Nutrition.

For the past week I've been putting together a list of free resources for people to check out while they are stuck on lockdown.

The next section that I am working is ""self improvement"" and I would love to hear from you on what books/podcasts/resources have had the biggest impact on your mental health and self development. 

The site for your reference: [https://lockdown.community/](https://lockdown.community/)

TLDR: looking for your recommendations for resource to add to a website.

Thank you and stay safe!"

I can't tell any close friends or teachers about this either, since they're very likely to report it and I'm very afraid of what might happen if they show up. Is there anything I can do given my situation?

I'm also 15 years old. If possible, I don't want whoever I'd be speaking to to have to tell my parents or anyone about it.

Please."
1369,No other way than death,"I would really appreciate if you could sit throught my entire story i just need someone to hear me out. During this quarantine i haven't been able to escape from my problems by going on little highs such as going out or something, i have been with myself this whole time, well with my family but I've been in my room.

I dont know where to start but here it goes. This quarantine was the first time i ever remembered anything from my childhood, i was never in my life able to remember anything from 1 year ago let alone my childhood, that should be easy since im only 16. I have completely blocked off everything from my memory its just a blank space. My childhood was filled with fear, darkness, and sadness, thats why i always thought i blovked it off, even tho my past was dark i was a hard working kid, i would never stop working or studying or just being productive in anyway possible, however that has changed alot.

But now some memories are flying by. I remembered seeing figures and demons and characters and hearing sounds that weren't there, i remembered the dark aura that always followed me, i remembered all the times the family was fighting, i keep having the same dreams i used to have when i was a kid, now i keep feeling scared and down all the time, the same way i did when i was a kid.

Ive formed many anger problems breaking walls and shit, ive isolated my emotions in the back of my head, ive been never stop thinking about homicide or genocide or just simply hurting others, and well myself. And now sometimes i wish i was that scared productive kid everyone was proud of instead of this pathetic douchebag that I've become. 

If you read till here, thanks i love you."
1370,Help please?,"So I'm a teenager and recently I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I get anxious whenever I do something, because I feel like I'm going to get yelled at. Every time someone I'm texting leaves me on read, I feel like it's my fault. I feel like I push people away, but I know I don't. I don't know if I have any real friends, but I know I do. I just feel like such a horrible person. I get like this sometimes. I just don't know why, and I feel like with answers I might feel better. I'm not sure."
1371,"Intensified emotions, anxiety and depression","Hi, I want to start from what i believe, is the root of my problems, my mother lost her mother at the age of 7, and my grandfather married another woman that was abusive, my mom told me she would get beat by her step mother very badly, she once told me she got a bad grade at school and her step mom banged my mother's head against the wall until she got her nose bleeding, she was very abused all her life by her step mom, first husband and my dad.
My mom is a very very deep thinker, I dont know how to explain it, but she gets the worst  of any situation and intensifies every situation and second of her life, she is very stressed, she plays with her fingers all the time, she doesent speak normally, she screams.
When I was little I did normal things as a normal child, but if I broke something or did any bad thing, she would scream at me, make me feel horrible, she did not beat me.
I started overthinking every second of my life wondering if what I was doing is good and would not lead to anything bad, I am always stressed, anxious, and sometimes depressed.
If somebody speaks to me, I get verry happy and my heart is pounding and I shake sometimes, I started controlling myself through the years as I realised I am emotionally unstable but I dont know how to get rid of my mental trauma and be calm and normal.
If a girl texts me, as I said, my heart starts pounding, I shake, I sweat, and overthink every letter of her text and I think what to say and I imagine how the conversation would go if I say the thing that I think at the moment, then I realise that it takes very much time and I start saying nonsense, I think I am annoying, I worry about my future, I worry that girls wont like me and I would be lonely.
I had some girlfriends but my anxiety kills me, I am a very cringe and awkward, and its because I cant be calm.
I hope I explained myself so that you understand, if you didnt, you are free to ask me anything"
1372,"I want to know what is wrong with me. Cannot connect with people, insecure, grown 30 year old man.","I have zero confidence when talking in front of another person. It absolutely blows my mind that some people can talk in front of a crowd of people, and I can’t even talk to a coworker without trembling. It’s an innate insecurity that has never gone away no matter how hard I have tried.

I’m 30 and have no friends. I can’t communicate and connect with people. When I do communicate with another person, it feels like my mind is working in overdrive mode and I get filled with adrenaline. It feels similar to the second before a roller coaster drops, except it is a perpetual sense of tension and uneasiness for the duration of the conversation.

I feel emasculated and similar to a child. I’m not sure how long I can live like this. I was very, very suicidal a few years ago. But I’m worried I’ll get back to that state again. That depth of loneliness and dread is something I would never wish on anyone."

My issue has always been how freaking long it takes to get an appointment that is actually helpful. When I make the appointment I need help ASAP. They set me up with an appointment two weeks out and it’ll just cover my basic information. Then another 2 weeks for an actual appointment. 

I’ve ended up in the mental hospital twice in the last few years bc I get so overwhelmed, I need therapy right then, so I go to the ER because it’s an emergency. Well, they hear emergency and assume I’m suicidal and send me away. 

I need someone right now. I have awful depression and everything I’m depressed about has layers and layers to it, like so many dimensions and one thing can give me anxiety or depression for a million different reasons."

1377,How to stop self loathing?,"I’m 21 and I’ve hated myself for as long as I can remember.

I’ve been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses, I was trying to go to therapy more and get back on medication before covid. Not happening now. Being in isolation is becoming very difficult.

I’ve been lonely for so long, always shy and awkward but wanted friends. I’ve realized recently that its probably because of how internally negative I am, its impossible to hate yourself so much and still project positivity to others. People can see that.

I’ve known for a long time that I need to change my self image to keep living, its not an option anymore its a necessity. I cannot keep living like this. But I’m stuck in this rut of hating myself so much that I see nothing good and feel I deserve even less than that, how could I try to love someone who deserves nothing? 

I don’t know how to get out of this. I’ve been trying unsuccessfully to change my self image for years."
1378,My family targets me personally and laughs about it.,"It’s specifically my brother who is younger than me and who I am stronger than. He’s 12 but he constantly physically assaults me all the time for no given reason. Today he chucked a baseball at my head and kept throwing really hard balls at me. I’ve complained to my parents and they don’t do anything about it because they favor him. They tell me to man up (I’m a 14 year old girl.) I do have a pretty thick skin, I don’t get offended easily, and my family’s always been rough and tough, but, my family seems to specifically target me due to my mental health issues and suicidal thoughts/ tendencies. The way he is has made him a sexist, racist, pig. I fear for his first girlfriend. I live in western New York, and my family prides themselves of being “YEEYEES” I hate it and that lifestyle. Today he mocked me and threw a baseball bat at me for wanting to get out of here as soon as possible and go to the city. I’ve always loved the city more because you just kind of blend in. I try to love my family but all they do is shame and bully me about everything I do. It has taken a huge toll on me mentally. Like I mentioned earlier, I am much stronger than him physically. I easily can beat him up back, but, since my parents love him so much more, I get in trouble. When he does that to me, he gets patted on the back. My family badgers me for staying in my room, but, when I do come out they harass me. I have had severe depression and chronic anxiety since I was 6 years old (that’s when my first verbal suicide thought was), I’ve been in therapy for a year (a new diagnosis of “developing Bipolar depression” has come up.) They love it because mentally, I’m weaker than them. They don’t understand it at all. They pretend to care about me, but they don’t. As of right now, I’ve been in a 3 month long depressive episode. I have no motivation. I’m suicidal as all hell, and everything that I ever loved is shattering all around me. My grandparents are the people who I’m closest to in life, I almost lost my grandpa this year due to a seizure and stroke in unison. He and my grandma are the only people who seem to love me and care about me. I’ve only ever been shown love from them and my 3 best friends. 
Right before my 14th birthday (in February), I had to be evaluated for verbally expressing that I was suicidal. My mom told me “you have no good reason to kill yourself.” When I hold a sharp object, those words repeat in my head.
I know I sound like a baby, complaining about how my brother hurts me. But, I have  bruises on my head, back, neck, wrist, and both legs. Typical “boys will be boys” behavior? I’m sick of it. Although I am strong physically, I’m very weak mentally. I used to get bullied pretty bad until 6th grade and it kind of died down. I get bullied a little bit still but, that’s my fault apparently. I feel so weak and confused, I don’t let anyone see me emotional. I save getting emotional until I’m alone, then I allow myself to break down. Is it because I’m a girl or because of my mental illnesses? I wish I could talk to someone more, someone who won’t just reply with “oof” or someone that gets paid to listen to me. 
(I’m sorry this is all over the place, I’m not good at explaining emotions and feelings exclusively.)"
1379,I just want to end it,"I've been suicidal for over a year but with the current situation, those feelings are far stronger than before. I am too scared to reach out to someone I know, even though I know I should. I always prented to be hapoy and say I'm fine when inside I want to die so now I'm struggling alone. I plan to take my life in a day, I just can't cope anymore. The only reason I am still living is because I don't want to cause pain for my family and friends and I had some things I was really looking forward too, but now those things have be cancelled. All the work I have to do makes me feel so overwhelmed that I just keep pushing it away and I spend all day on social media to forget about reality and keep my mind occupied so I'm not having suicidal thoughts. Everyday, it just gets harder and I already know I'm destined to fail in the future since I'm useless and good at nothing so why stick around anymore? I know it's selfish of me to end it, knowing my family will be in pain but I can't deal with it anymore. I don't know what to do."
1380,How to deal with a judging friend,"Before I get to this I want to say that I like quarantine because I don’t have much friends at the high school I go to and I dread going to school everyday because of the fear of getting bullied. So anyways since this online schooling started happening, I wanted to stay in touch with the few friends I have. So I text them sometimes. The friend that I text the most is being judging to me now. He found out that Reddit is the only social media I use so he makes fun of me for it. I can’t even say something to him without him saying a dumbass thing about me liking Reddit. He knows that I don’t like things like Fortnite, TikTok, or Emojis. Ironically he likes all of those things. So he keeps saying positive things about them to me just to annoy me and spams me with Emojis. I’m not a judging person at all but when he judges me about this, I have to judge him back, talking trash about the things that he likes and I call him toxic. He thinks every person on Reddit is toxic and immature, which definitely isn’t true all. He thinks that people on TikTok are more mature for Gods sake. This friendship isn’t going by well at all and I don’t know what to do anymore. Maybe I should block him."

1383,Thinking my GrubHub is late because the guy at the restaurant...,"Recognizes my name and knows me from school and is purposely trying to mess with me and delay my order more and more.

I know because of Coronavirus everything is busy but I ordered three hours ago and it keeps changing times to 30 mins, 30 mins.. I'm just confused. I tried to contact GrubHub they told me my order should eventually get to me but now over 3 hours I'm thinking someone at the restaurant I ordered from must know me and hate me for some reason, trying to annoy me on purpose.

What is this? I even do this when I'm talking to someone over the phone. Could be some support person and I'll just assume they put me on hold extra long because they somehow know me and are trying to make my life worse on purpose.

I don't even know what this is.."
1384,Dad's depression has killed my love for him.,"My dad has been suicidal and depressed since I was 18, so for about 5 years now. Living with him was what I can only call a mental hell. He'd ignore me for days and lay on the floor in the living room. He'd explain the ways he wanted to kill himself and why. I had a 11 year old brother (then) who was comforting  him because he would cry daily in his room and leave  the door open so we would see and hear him.

He has never, not once, spoken about how he regrets any of it. He has towards my mother but never towards us. I live on my own for 3 years now and he has never visited me and only contacted me via text about 10 times. When I come over there he barely looks at me. We used to have a really strong bond but I now feel nothing but hate for this man and it crushes me. I block it away but sometimes it all hits me. The funny dad I once had has been lost for years and I don't think he will ever come back. I feel like this is worse than him dying. My dad is gone but he who crushed my heart took his place."
1385,How do I start?,"I know I need counseling or therapy. I've suffered from self injurious behaviors for over 15 years, and have a family history of mental/psychiatric/personality disorders. 

But how do I go about finding someone to talk to? How do I know if I want a social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor. I just feel so overwhelmed and keep shutting down every time I start looking. 

My thoughts and moods are just getting too much for me to handle especially with this quarantine. 

I feel so lost and upset."
1386,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I feel like I’m in an eternal conflict with myself and it’s consuming me slowly. I try to always think rationally as to not make any choices that will hurt anyone. I don’t ever want to hurt anyone again but the urges nearly take hold of me and I try my best to hide it from my family and I’m afraid to tell them. It’s usually the smallest things that get me going or even nothing at all but I feel an intense desire to hurt whether it be myself or others but I never do that’s why I don’t think anyone knows but it’s best to keep it that way, when I was younger I hurt many animals and I regret it to this day I try to tell myself that I didn’t know what I was doing but I was fully aware, I was around 5 or 6 I’m not sure but I haven’t done that to anything after that. Sometimes I break down in tears because I don’t want to and want the best for everyone even my worst enemy I keep in my prayer but idk, I feel like I should disappear because I randomly feel these intense emotions that don’t make sense but I plan to help myself but idk how. I’ve never had therapy and I feel like I can handle this myself. I’m only a teen."
1387,Depressed venting,"As the title suggests, I'm in a fairly depressed mood. I've been thinking a lot about relationships. Both romantic and platonic, in particular believing I'm weak for craving them. 

I hate that probably the most about myself. I feel disgusted for wanting to rely on other people. I feel weak. But at the same time, I cant avoid it. Avoiding it will only make the problem worse. What do I do? I believe everyone has ulterior motives and therefore not worth relying on. Happiness will end, people will eventually betray you or leave you or use pieces of you for as long as they seem you're useful.

I cant stand this. I want a relationship and to have multiple close friends and to have friends. But. I feel weak for wanting those things. Advice or conversation or both wanted. Thanks for making it through my rant!"
1388,My sister (13) is depressed but my parents won't let her seek therapy or any sort of help because they think she will get over it and it is self-inflicted.,"My (F19) sister (F13) severely struggles with depression, I personally believe. Let me first start with some back story so you know how my parents are. About 9 months ago I finally realized that I needed to go to therapy because I am depressed. I have felt this way since I was about 14 and even told my mom around 15 or 16 that I wanted to talk to a therapist but we both kind of just put it off. Then, when I decided that it was finally time to seek therapy, both of my parents were not happy. My mom said that I would get over it and everyone goes through depression at one point in their life. My dad just said that I needed to go to church more and read my bible more, which I had been doing all the years before that and had prayed about it but nothing really happened. We are a very religious family, both of my parents have gone to church their whole life, my siblings and I have grown up in the church, but the last year and a half I started to pull away after not really getting better with my mental health and seeing a lot of hypocrisy from people at my congregation. This has sort of led my younger brother and sister to follow my lead... 

Anyways, my sister is 13 and very depressed. She's always moody, which is typical for a 13-year-old, she's a majority of the time sad, stays downstairs in her room and is just on her phone/social media. I do think that being on social media has 100% contributed to her depression because I know that's where some of my depression stems from, but she's young enough that she has basically grown up with social media. I have told my mom for over a year now that I think my sister should go to therapy but every single time I even mention it, she freaks out on me and says that it's normal and you don't have to see a therapist for everything. Mom always uses her excuse that we don't think she has been depressed before? My mom did have a pretty rough life growing up and I know that she has been depressed before, maybe even now, I just don't know how to explain to my mom that my sister NEEDS to talk to someone. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared for my sister because I know if she doesn't get help soon, she's going to be really messed up in the future and potentially have a bad relationship with our parents. I don't see her as suicidal and she has never talked about that or self-harm, but it still makes me scared. What should I do?"
1389,Seeking to understand a loved one,"I hope it's okay for me to post here. A very close loved one was e periencing a psychosis 2 weeks ago. The covid19 worry started it and other life stressors added until my mother said ""He can't hear you. He's talking out of his head."" That was 2 weeks ago. He went to the ER the day before with a blood pressure of 240/180 after his dog came back from the vet (that was one of the stressors). He has been in a facility since. Im missing him terribly and want to help more, but delusions and paranoia that accompanied his psychosis are beyond my understanding. The doctor put him on risperdal then seroquel. When he refused his medications, he was given a shot of geodon and ativan. He refused again and was given invega sustenna. He was on suboxone for 8 years, but the doctor didn't order it- we even brought it with us when he was given a bed. I've learned how super under-served mental health is. I've googled and worried and called people. He sounds a lot better since the second shot, but I'm scared. Will he get better? What can help? Just listening?  What are some things to keep in mind to keep him recovered? What else could have been triggers? My mother had a chemical imbalance 30 years ago and that's what they dxed him with. Could it be something else? 

I appreciate any responses. I'm just trying to understand."
1390,Scared of schizophrenia relapse.,"Hi all...I'm 18, almost 19, and I've been suffering with schizoaffective disorder since I was 12. The journey to recovery has been a long and arduous one, but after a 7 month long hospitalization in 2018 into 2019, I finally got on the proper medication and went into partial remission for the first time since the onset of my symptoms. Since 2013, the early months of 2019 up until the present has been the only time I have been without prominent delusions, and without hallucinations that dreadfully impact me. Yes. 6 whole years, while I was a teenager. It was hell.

And this past year has been, in contrast, heaven. I am more much functional, and I very much enjoy sanity. However, in light of the COVID-19 crisis, I'm thinking that all this self-isolation is getting to me. These past 1-2 weeks, I've been noticing my ability to keep my thinking clear and organized has suffered... And I'm writing this while trying to ignore the thoughts in my head that I cannot control telling me there are people out to get me.

I don't know what to do. I just started at a new clinic, and I have an appointment on april 10th. I'm just scared. I don't know what's going on, I know I've experienced some set backs over the past year but those were because I wasn't taking my meds. I'm on my meds. I'm taking them nightly. But still, something feels wrong, and I'm scared. I don't want to lose myself again."
1391,Please help with my videogame OCD and ERP,"Hi, I know many of you (myself included) have experienced very distressing OCD. This obsession may seem trivial, but it is seriously affecting my enjoyment of one of my main everyday activities. So if any of you could take the time to help me out with this, I would be very grateful. Thanks

My obsession is about an important decision I made in a videogame, which is affecting my enjoyment of the game (this game is important to me). I obsess over why I decided to make the decision. My problem is that although the obsession bothers me at the back of my mind, I'm finding it hard to actually trigger it and therefore do ERP. Simply playing the game doesn't seem to be enough to trigger the obsession, I have to actively examine my reasons for making the decision to trigger it, which only feeds into the OCD.

If anyone could suggest ERP exercises, resources or even other therapies or advice that might help in this case, please do so. Cheers"
1392,Do I have any recourse to be psychologically evaluated/diagnosed during the quarantine?,"Hi everyone, 22 year old college student here! I've long suspected that I've had something bigger going on, because I've had mood and anxiety problems for as long as I can remember (although I've never been diagnosed). This last week I had a really bad episode where I didn't feel in control of my thoughts, emotions, and actions. I've had episodes like that occasionally, but this one served as a wake up call. Given that coronavirus doesn't have a reliable end date, I wanted to be proactive and look into possible ways to address this in the near future."

1394,Telling my therapist about sexual assault,"Tomorrow I’m telling my therapist about the time my ex abusive  boyfriend d coerced me intohaving sex.  I’m feeling so anxious and my ptsd is bad toniught because I know I have to speak about it tomorrow. 
I’m just praying I won’t be dissociated all day afterwards.   My heart races everytime I think about it. And it’s phone therapy and I’m quarantined alone.  So it’s just a disaster waiting to happen because I’ll be all alone after the call.  
I’m going to try do some art or call a friend if I feel up to it but otherwise I’ll probably just sleep the dissociation off."

1397,not liking medical professionals and being harsh to them,"I don't like them. they have plotted against me because they have denied me normal things they tell others. most have aphasia and don't interpret their shit properly.  I told a therapist this, and she asked me why. I said that because of their perceptions, they allowed others years ago to get tattoos, and not rely on basic practice. And that kept me back in life, and I'm only now just catching up. So I despise them, all. 

my therapist said it was harsh, but I didn't agree. I said as a HUMAN I don't have to like anybody, and I can hold any prejudices I choose. I asked her to section me but then it would prove the plot, since everybody has prejudices and they aren't sectioned."

I moved back home with my parents as a Junior Engineering Student to do 16 credit hours of Electrical Engineering online. Living with friends and having the pressure of in-person classes, I procrastinated a lot, but was able to get things done. Now that I am home, and can't go outside.

1400,Has anyone else experience a relapse during the pandemic?,"In the past couple years, I have drastically recovered from a severe eating disorder persistent for 4 years. I have managed it relatively well until this pandemic. The stress it has caused has deteriorated my mental health. I’ve spent the past few weeks having issues with my relationship with food barely noticeable but a cause for worry. I was hesitant to eat and overeating or under eating but it hadn’t spiraled out of control...until 3 days ago. The only things I’ve eaten since is one egg with hot peppers, one cup of soup, and a lot of low-zero calorie coffee, tea, soda, and flavored drinks. I can’t seem to force myself to eat. I feel like it’s all I have to control. What should I do?"
1401,Need help understanding if I have intrusive thoughts or something else.,"I struggle a lot with negative thinking to the point where it upsets me and lowers my self esteem. I'm not hearing voices or hallucinating. I'll be doing something and automatically have ""someone"" in my head make fun of me or criticize my actions. The ""person"" in my head isn't myself but usually a friend or coworker I knew. They are usually people who have bullied me, made fun of me (not teasing or in a friendly way), or criticized me when it was uncalled for. 

For example, I've thought of visiting church but then one my friends in my mind would tell me I do not belong in church because I am not actively religious and am a poser. It makes me feel guilty and that I don't belong there. 

I've looked up intrusive thoughts but to my understanding, these are thoughts that compel you to do something bad."
1402,I'm a human and have the right to say I'm not religious - i want therapists to section me away for it,"It's pretty fine that they allow everybody else to not have religion. so why me? because their perceptions of ""how life is""?

1404,Need advice!,"My sister who is 22F is struggling with extreme anxiety depression. She is staying at parents house at the moment due to the lockdown. Staying at my parents house, has made her mental health worsen, her decisions are starting to become erratic. She has also started to secluded herself into her room more often and I'm really worried. My sister has insisted on going back to her college town, but my parents won't budge on their stance of keeping her home. How do I help ease her anxiety? Any help is greatly appreciated! By the way we live in the US."
1405,I’ve officially had the worst birthday of my life,"Today was my birthday, not a special one but something we always valued highly in my family. 

Not only are we currently in “shelter-in-place” status in my state, but I’ve been ill for the last week with COVID symptoms and was tested yesterday so I am on strict quarantine at least until my test comes back negative and I’m symptom free for at least 3 days. 

I had so many people wishing me a happy birthday and every time I just wanted to cry. Everything about my day was awful. I felt awful physically and mentally. 

My husband spent all morning on the phone with work trying to figure out if they still want him to come in and if so what protocols he needs to take and then got supplies we may need for a 14 day quarantine just in case. 

I spent all day not only feeling physically ill, but guilty and worried about this whole ordeal especially pertaining to how it’s affecting my husband and work. I feel like no matter how the test comes back I am going to feel even worse: if it’s negative that I’ll look like I was faking it to get attention wasting everyone’s time and if it’s positive then my husband and I have to quarantine for 14 days and it’s even more chaos because of me. 

No one else can adequately do my job at work (a new promotion I just got at the beginning of this year) and I had a lot of big projects I was supposed to do this week. I feel like everyone is mad at me and I’m letting everyone down. Everyone at work already judges me because according to them I’m “sick all the time” (I have had bad health the past year or so but almost always have brought in a doctors note and have never played hooky.) 

Anyway, the only thing I was looking forward to all day was playing Animal Crossing with my husband and having a nice dinner with him even if it has to be 6 feet apart (he was going to make steaks on the grill.) However, he got really tired and his stomach was upset so he slept while I ate leftovers and played by myself and tried not to cry. 

I just long for normal life back where I can hug and kiss my husband, see my family and friends, go to work, be productive at home, and go out eating/shopping/etc (especially on special occasions.) I know I’m not alone in this so I try not to get too upset but it’s difficult because I am someone who thrives in routine and don’t know what the future holds for me right now. 

Thanks for reading my rambling I just really needed to let this all out. Any kind words or advice are appreciated. 

TL;DR A birthday with no physical contact, limited interactions, and the small plans I did have cancelled really made me feel more down than I already did due to everything going on with the pandemic, especially since I am awaiting test results on the virus myself since I’ve been ill the past week."
1406,What to Expect with a Therapist,"Hello fellow Redditors. I am planning on moving a few states away after the lockdowns end (was on final steps of transfer) and am considering seeing a therapist.

I was depressed for most of my childhood, a lot due to parenting but it took a lot of different forms. After college, I reluctantly moved back home to pay off debt so I can breathe easily when I move away for good. I have been putting a lot of work into my mental health the past few years and feel like I made a lot of progress and am a lot more in control, but I want to make sure that I am still moving in the right direction and doing the right things to give myself the best chance of this working out for me.

Aside from the movies, I don't know much about therapy, what are your experiences with it, does it actually work, and how should I approach it?"
1407,Just need to rant.,"Hi all, I have a lot on my chest right now, and I want to keep it anonymous so here goes. The pandemic was already bad enough, but now I have a family member practically on his deathbed. He is on life support and has a lot wrong with him. Everything in life right now is going against me, and so many other people. I am a student, and everything I cared about has been canceled. I can't see anyone I care about. (I know a lot of you are in the same situation, please reach out if needed). I know everything is going to be fine and get back to normal soon enough, but it just feels like nothing is going to get better. As though I've hit rock bottom. I am coping well enough, I have been writing down my thoughts and talking to a close friend and family, but I just don't know how much longer I can go without therapy or something. Best of wishes to anyone reading this."

1411,Anyone else feeling like they’re at a different age developmentally?,"I feel like I’m mentally stuck at 14. I’m not sure how true this actually is, because it’s mainly just how I feel. And thinking back to all the bad things that happened around this age, it wouldn’t be unusual for a person to just break down mentally and stop development. I can’t be picky with the type of therapist I have, there aren’t many, and I’m afraid with ending up with one that cares even less than my current one does. My psychiatrist is a godsend though. I see my therapist once a month, she’s working on getting me therapy that is twice a week, but the wait is long, and so far I’ve been waiting for two months. I feel like I’m hanging from a thin strand.. and the only thing that’s really keeping that thread hanging is the love of my life, music, and dancing. Even then.. everyday is a struggle to try and keep my emotions in check. Without the love of my life with me I feel like I’m dying. I feel like I’m drowning. I have no real hobbies, and it’s so hard to stick with one. I’m directionless.. no job.. not going to school. No social life. I’m tired of crying.. I just want to know how to get better. All of this would be so much easier if life came with an instruction manual. But of course it doesn’t.. and hardly anyone knows what they’re doing. I feel like a lost kid in a forest. Wandering, sometimes going in circles, not in complete isolation, yet I feel so so alone."
1412,Is that anxiety?,"Guys i don't know, but I'm sitting in my room but now I'm  feeling my heart beating fast and feeling uncomfortable and down, does anxiety make you feel like that I'm kind worry and sarced?"

Wake up sit cry sleep repeat, I don't seem suicidal right now but just defeated like I've reached the end and there's nothing more to do but wait. But I don't know what I'm waiting for or how long it will be."
1414,How do you know if the meds are working?,"I’ve been on meds 3 times in my life and every single time, I haven’t been able to notice a notable difference.

1416,Am I a bad person because of an attraction?,"So, I'm a pedophile. I'm sexually attracted to kids, but I'd never, ever do anything sexual to a kid. My attraction feels like something I can't control, no matter how hard I try. I can control if I act upon my attraction, which I absolutely will not ever, but I can't control being attracted. I've tried so, so hard to get rid of it, but I can't seem to. I see people that say pedos should die, that they don't deserve to live. If anyone in my life knew about this, they'd probably hate me and leave me. People just seem to hate everything about pedophiles, and I've been feeling really horrible lately because people would hate me for something out of my control.

A recent thing for me was reading this: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fqq4tl/you_are_allowed_to_erase_anything_from_existence/flrs5mi?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

People say pedophiles should vanish and be forgotten by everyone. I don't know anymore, does this make me a terrible person? Is there any way I can get rid of this?"
1417,I think I have masochistic tendencies and I don't know what to do.,"It's hard to be so blunt about it, and I'm not sure if I should be posting this here or elsewhere, but I feel lost upon finally having to acknowledge that I find small amounts of physical pain pleasurable. I don't know why, but I have since I was quite young; I remember enjoying imagining myself in situations in which I went through physical pain or died. In more recent times, I had started to cut myself, not out of a depressive state or anything of that sort but solely because the pain is somehow fascinating to me. I don't want to die and I don't enjoy intense pain, but it really bothers me that I seek out small levels of pain or situations to imagine myself in. I don't know if I should embrace it or run from it. I don't know if it makes me gross. I don't know who I could ever admit this to, if I should seek help, if this is a part of me that I need to cope with something."
1418,"Student, want to rant about my life :)","I want to preface this by saying nothing I have to say here is too serious, and I understand many people here have experienced or seen a lot worse, especially now. That said, I've been feeling angry and sad at random times and I decided for once in my life I should say something. I'm a 21 year old guy in the US, and I've put on a front of ""nothing can affect me most of my life"". Just writing this down publicly is cathartic for me, but if anyone wants to share similar stories or offer advice, that would be awesome.

They've been many things bringing me down. I'm afflicted with a rare condition that impacts my vocal cords, making my voice come out nasally and apparently heavily accented. I've been bullied (verbally) for this in middle school, but I had friends to support me and this never really affected me. However, recently it's undermining my confidence when speaking publicly or to people I don't know, although my close friends always make me feel comfortable. Around Christmas this year, I was speaking to the plumber fixing the faucet at my parents house, and as soon as I began to speak he gave me a very patronizing appraisal—he did this thing a lot of people do, which is assume from my voice that I have some type of mental disability (I don't). 

I was talking to this girl a lot a few months ago, and I developed a crush on her, as guys do. I thought why the hell not, so I asked her out. She said no, which stung, but was no less than I expected. However, I encountered her again in front of a group of her friends, and she proceeded to mock me for it, implying she was somehow better than me. That really hurt—partly because though I think I'm an interesting and intelligent person and have my skills, just from talking to us and based on our appearances, many people would agree. Furthermore, I found out that a guy I'd considered a friend had told her about my crush shortly before I'd asked her out, and they'd been making fun of me around my back. The worst part about the whole thing was that while I was incredibly angry at him and did confront him, he issued a half-hearted apology, and although that by no means made me feel better about the situation, I didn't want to split my school friend group up, so I didn't make a big deal about it.

This alone, I 'd normally rebound from after a time. But a lot of other things in my life also feel like they're going downhill at the same time. I can't see any friends so I'm spending too much time alone, thinking. I started off last year excited about my research, but things went awry somewhere along the way, and my research mentor told me a few weeks ago told me to step up, that my project so far was a disappointment. I'd saved up for a trip next month to Cabo with some good friends, which I was really excited about, but now it's cancelled. My internship for this summer was cancelled last week—without that, I'm not going to have the money to do a lot of things I wanted to do next year, and my job search next year is going to be much more stressful. I was going to meet with my doctor last week---he was going to talk about some new operation that might be able to help my condition, but all that is postponed indefinitely due to COVID. All in all, I'm seriously starting to question my own competence, which is out of character for me, and I have nothing to look forward to to take my mind off things.

Anyway, if you actually read through all this, you have my respect (and thanks!)."
1419,My Mother won't get Help,"For about eight years of my life now my mother has struggled with a mental illness. It was diagnosed but it wasn't diagnosed as a specific illness. Symptoms are related to bipolar and schizophrenia. She doesn't see people or anything like that though; she's zoned out 100 percent of the time, never has a smile on her face, can't pay attention to anything, laughs to herself occasionally, cannot hold a conversation without going on a tangent about some weird conspiracy, and never things she's wrong. The worst part is she thinks (or at least acts) like there is nothing wrong with her. There are plenty of other things I could say but hopefully you'll get the very basics of it.
She's been to the doctor before and has been put on medicine but either won't take it or won't go back to get it refilled.
Me father, brother, and I have tried relentlessly got eight years to figure something out and it never sticks. My father has finally come to his breaking point; he admits he's still madly in love with her but he has had enough. The mental stress it's put on all of us is immense. He's going to have one final discussion with her but he's made his mind up about leaving. 
She thinks there is nothing wrong when there obviously is. Is there anything we can do, or is it better to just leave?"
1420,Yet another horrible appointment with my doctor..,"I don't know if it's just me the last 4ish months but I feel two things pretty strongly more so the past 2 month.

1. I don't feel like absolutely anyone is listening to me..

Not my doctor, not my shrink, definitely my family never has or will and considering I have no true friends who actually care it's brings me into my second feeling...

2. No one really gives a shit about me, to help me or just anything and in all of it I'm starting not to care about myself much.. Never really have but the feel just keeps getting worse...

I tell my doctor flat out instead of medicating the problem how about you actually fix the 30 years of trauma not just throw pills down my throat.."
1421,It feels like nothing is important,"Not even suicide. Not even getting help. Not even the solutions are important. Nothing is. Nothing will give my life meaning. I'm worthless. The most worth I have is a price if someone were to harvest my organs. Everything has been so gray and the world is feeling less like the world more and more. Being stuck in quarantine, everything is so surreal. The only thing keeping me okay was being forced to get out of bed everyday and be okay. I still do that but it's different. I cant walk throughout my day. I stay in my room, facing my problems. I dont want to die I want to be dead because I dont want to exist and that's the only way to erase my existence. I'm never getting help unless I survive a suicide attempt. I dont want help I just want this to be over. I'm weak. I've tried to fix it by myself. Focusing on hobbies, exercising, fucking coloring books. The only thing that makes me feel alive is cutting. I need to stop cutting. I hate this."
1422,Here's a comic I made coping with feeling left out and being treated differently by people,"[LnR: Season 2, Episode 2- Lingering Thoughts](https://tapas.io/episode/1696280) (Putting this here to understand the next episode more)

1423,Need to stop getting angry at mentally ill daughter,"My 30-something daughter (depression-PTSD-anxiety) is living with me during the pandemic and I have a difficult time not getting really pissed that she is capable of doing little except sit at the computer all day--and I do mean all day. Doesn't bother her but it bugs the shit out of me and I have a hard time refraining from critical or sarcastic comments, and then feel really shitty about my actions.
She sees a therapist, is heavily medicated, is not capable of working, no outside interests, virtually no social contacts during the pandemic (and very few before that). Anyone else going through something like this?"
1424,"When does ""passive"" ideation turn into ""active"" ideation? Is ""active"" the same as suicidal?","I had a plan 1 month ago. I aborted the attempt when it was wrapped around me. I think about trying again almost everyday but haven't followed through. Now, I try to distract myself with self-harm but only gets me so far. 

I told my psychiatrist about the attempt 2 weeks ago   but was left on ""read"" 

I had a crazy bout of depression since Friday. I was in mental anguish. It actually hurt. Not once did I think about suicide. I guess it was because I was having a stable mood at the time. I didn't zone out, i felt connected with myself,  and was able to feel. 

Now that the depressive stage is done for now, I'm back to the person I was 1 month ago."
1425,I feel... nothing?,I don’t know what’s happening but it’s been happening for as long as I can remember. It used to happen a lot more often but recently my life has been a lot better so I thought it would go away. It didn’t. It feels bad. I think of things that would normally make me sad and I don’t feel sad. I think of things that would make me happy and I don’t feel happy. I think of suicidal thoughts and my body doesn’t tell me not to. I thought it was because I wasn’t happy in the past but it’s still happening. I don’t know what’s happening or why it’s happening.
1426,I don't know what to do,"My dad asked my why I'm not taking care of myself and I couldn't bring myself to say the truth, which is that I hate myself and I don't personally care if I die.  I stayed silent while he hugged me and told me his nagging is because he loves me and wants to see me in good health...   
I've been avoiding my family because I'm mad at them but once he asked me that, I realized I'm not mad at them... I'm mad at myself.   
Because a part of me knows they're correct and looking out for me but I don't know why I can't bring myself to admit and accept that.   
I know I should seek therapy, but between college, CoVid19 economical issues and other family matters, it isn't an available option.    
I don't know what to do."
1427,I am still here...,"Unfortunately, the Depression has again head-butted me and has left me scared and confused. I don't know what I am complaining about, just...the same old shit. I wish there were someone here that would post that says ""hey, I get what you are going through 100% because I am also like that exactly..."" meaning my Pyromania, not my Depression or my Anxiety. Pretty much the whole subreddit can identify with those things. 

I hate having a rare disorder. I am so fucking alone. My family is being sweet. We were at the Dollar Store this morning getting some very necessaries when my attention was pulled (I had no control over the thoughts) to the sight of the train cars on the railroad tracks about 200 yards away. That is where I used to set my fires. That is where I enjoyed my Animal fully and freely...and safely. Except for a few times when I (unsuccessfully) tried to burn down the deadfalls of old trees and old lumber left from long-ago construction projects (didn't work because at the time it was way too wet and it was all half-assed on my part), I have set all my fires in the area that is all shale leftovers from building the railway years and years ago. So no plants, no vegetation, nothing that would burn when I torched my paper and boxes. I was very careful, even delaying a burn because it was too windy and I didn't want to chance it. That is all ... just a memory now. That area is NO TRESSPASSING (there are signs, but the police don't seem to give a shit except if I went up there) and it really was infuriating when I did see someone walking the tracks and I know I can't...so fucking unfair, but it is my damn fault for that. I got my stupid ass caught...I paid my due to society, and I am a pariah now in my part of the city.

I am going to cry. Fuck my life, this is why I keep wanting to kill myself. If it weren't for my family...I would be just a memory to you guys too. Of course, you would forget me easily...in a few months, I wouldn't even be a memory here.

Someone tell me again, why (besides my family, who would also get over me eventually) I am still living? I can't have what I need, I keep being told that I am a dangerous ex-con who needs to just ""get over the fire thing""...

I want off this ride. Now."
1428,Does it even make sense?,"Does it even make sense to just up and leave from temporarily staying with my family to go back to the city I reside in just to end my life? 

4 of us, including me, are staying in a basement bachelor apartment of my aunt's house. She lives upstairs with her son and her friend. That's 7 people total in a 3 bedroom / 1 basement bachelor house. 

This pandemic was going to happen either way, and it was the most opportune time for entities who were already targeting me to make me a sort of prisoner. They have done it in a multitude of ways previously, primarily in psychiatric hospitals and wards. 

I'm a starseed, and they have done so many things to target me into killing myself. I can sadly say these beings or entities are winning. Everything is full of turmoil, especially my family's place, because these entities pass through everyone in my life. I don't sleep much anymore because of all my research, it's the only time it is quiet (late night/early early morn), etc. They made my aunt seriously ill (not with COVID-19) and a voice had told me ""(her name) is dead."" Which she survived but still. There's a whole history to this but they added so many things to cause turmoil in this reality.

It's really hard to say this is just a mental health issue when the evidence is clear, especially because I get my invega trinza shots and all. Plus, it's questionable now if they are just lying to me about everything at the psychosis clinic. Either way, I speak to my psychiatrist weekly now via phone appointments. 

I don't want to kill myself where my family could find my corpse even though this body I made a deal for at birth. I'd have to go back to my hoarder den of an apartment. The beings have won. I'm giving up because even though I'm meant to be a double agent and plant seeds, it's all too much.

Does it make sense to go all that way? Or is it better to just run off somewhere in my hometown?"

1430,Does anyone else feel comfort in depression?,"I don’t know how to explain this, so bear with me. 

I’m 20, and was first diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety, as well as put on medication at the age of 12. Since then, I’ve been off and on different medications and been in and out of different counseling centers. I’ve noticed lately that I’ve abandoned taking my medications that i started within the last couple of months. For some reason, taking my medications and feeling happy and anxiety-free... scares me. 

Feeling the depression and anxiety is what I’m used to. It’s awful, and I’m sure many of you know that too, but for some reason, it feels safe to me. It’s what I know. And I feel awful when I don’t take my medicine. It’s almost like there’s some part of me that’s self sabotaging myself and screaming for attention by making myself stay in this illness. 

Can anyone relate or give me any words of advice? I don’t know if this is normal."
1431,Healthy ways to cope with suicidal thoughts?,I’ve always had suicidal thoughts for quite some time now but they’ve worsened over the past few months and I find myself I guess fantasizing about hanging myself or just overdosing...please give me some healthy ways I can cope with these thoughts I do not want to do drugs anymore to cope.
1432,"An actual question, why is it bad to self harm?","I know everyone sees self harming as bad and i did too. Im in recovery as i had selfharmed for 3 straight years. But after relapsing quite awhile ago i realized how it can help relieve emotions. Now thats not the question. The question is why is it bad to self harm? Im asking this geninuely because say your a mentally healthy person and as a form of art you use ur skin. Your completely stable so why should people prevent you from doing it? Yes you can get a infection but if you treat ur wounds 100% of the time there should be no problem. If your mentally sound then you dont want to die. If you have no want to die then why would people stop self harmers. I get it can get to a point where its really severe bodily damage but if your mentally sound i dont think you would even cut that deep in the first place.. 

Am i wrong to think self harm could be a positive outlet?"
1433,I’m afraid of having kids if it means they will inherit my mental conditions,"I don’t know if this is classified as mental condition or not. Years ago, I had very disturbing thoughts, like very disturbing thoughts. I don’t know if it was because of the way I grew up or my family situation or whatever... 
Looking back, I would ask myself, wtf man? Why did you have these thoughts, and why did you enjoy thinking about them. These thoughts were, of course internalized and I never acted on them.

Now, I’m a lot better. I’m in college, and my future is looking bright. I don’t have these thoughts anymore except for the usual intrusive thoughts. I read a reddit post on how these intrusive thoughts may actually be OCD. My mind is in tip top shape and has never been better. However, every night I think about my past and am very afraid that when I have kids, that they might go through what I went through. If that’s the case, it might be better for me not to. Sorry for the grammar."
1434,How do I stop cutting?,"I’ve been dealing with PTSD, depression w psychosis and anxiety for about 5 years now. I started cutting about two years in. At first I did it because I felt nothing and needed to feel anything. Now I think I do it more to relieve extreme emotions and to distract myself from suicidal thoughts. Something about the blood running down my arm is comforting to me and I sometimes take pictures of it to look at later. 
I can’t sleep without a knife nearby, and I even snuck one into the psych ward last time I was admitted. 

Why do I feel better when I have a knife nearby? Why am I so fascinated by the blood? 
But most importantly, how do I STOP?

I hate that I cut. On my good days I look at my scars and just cry. I can’t believe I’d do such a thing to myself. I feel so embarrassed and shameful. But on my bad days I’m drawn to it. 
After my 6th month anniversary of not cutting I got tattoos to cover the scars. But I’ve relapsed since and have so many new scars. Every time I think I’ve kicked the habit something happens and I relapse. And when I fall, I fall hard. It’s seldom a single session when I relapse. 

I’m looking for advice and tips on how to quit cutting. I’ve tried a few alternatives like clutching an ice cube or drawing the blood on with a marker, but the alternatives just aren’t the same. Nothing seems to compare to the knife. 
Am I just doomed to repeat this cycle of quitting and relapsing?"
1435,Dreading the end of Lockdown,"I want to start this by saying that clearly, if I could snap my fingers and end this pandemic, I would do it. People are suffering and dying and what follows is in no way meant to take away from that in the slightest. I don't wish a single day more of this on anyone. However... 

In the last month, I've been doing better mentally than I had for a long time. I don't have to go to work. I don't have to go to bed or wake up at specific times. I don't have to go out in public and trigger my social anxiety. I don't have to worry as much for the safety of my family and friends because they're all at home and staying there. I finally have the time and energy to read books again. I'm playing some of my favorite video games and enjoying them because I don't feel guilty for not doing anything more productive. I've actually cleaned my house. And my student loans--one of my biggest stressors-- are on hold. Meanwhile I'm actually talking to my loved ones more, and since none are local I feel more connected than usual, not less. 

My fear, outside of someone I love contracting this virus, is what happens on the other side. I know my social anxiety will be so much worse than it was because I haven't been out in public for so long. All the stressors of life will come back. And honestly, I can't imagine when I'll feel safe risking exposure to this virus. 

I wish I could stay like this forever."
1436,Need Help.,"Recently, I feel like I’m going insane. Everyone around me are constantly on their phones or watching T.V. This is the future I absolutely dread. I can’t stand it, am I the only one who realizes that this isn’t how life is supposed to be. My life has no meaning and I can’t stand the thoughts going through my head. I can’t take anything this world believes in, everyone is brainwashed. No, I’m not suicidal but I just don’t know what to do. Everyday I wake up and it’s worse from the last day. I just want to leave the country but I can’t. I want to leave the world but it’s impossible, I just can’t seem to be happy. I try talking to people about my problems but everyone blows me off and doesn’t listen to me. I’ve started hating T.V. and social media, I even deleted all the apps except reddit on my phone. I don’t think people understand what the world really is, it isn’t just staring and screens and I want to do something but school requires staring at more screens. I can’t focus in school and I think I’m going crazy. If someone has ever been in my shoes, what made you get over this."

1438,please help i'm suicidal," 

I'm 13 years old, I suffer with chronic depression. I used to have a psychiatrist but my parents won't let me see him anymore. I am extremely suicidal and I self harm constantly. I have broken so many self harm contracts it's insane. I've been depressed for about 3 years now. I have antidepressants and sometimes i take more than I'm supposed to hoping I feel somewhat better. My sister tried throwing my pills away because she thinks I'm faking everything and I'm only feelings this was because I want to get high. My parents think I'm doing this because I want attention, I was at the doctors and I had to take a depression test. I was completely honest because I really wanted help. They told me I needed to go to the ER or they'd call cps. My father was furious and told me that no one in my family would ever love me or care for me again and that I've ""lost"" everyone. Currently, I've been getting worse. I used to self harm by digging into my skin until I bled or it ripped, but now I cut and take too many pills. I even have my suicide planned. I just don't know what to do anymore my sister won't let me talk to my nephew anymore because she thinks I'm a threat to him. I've had my antidepressants for a couple of months and I'm not getting any better. I love my parents but they don't seem to understand the whole mental illness thing. Funniest part is I told my dad that I was going to kill myself and I told him exactly how I was going to do it and he laughed at me. My parents do not care if I live or die they constantly tell me I'd be better off dead. But I love them they show me love sometimes. I'm supposed to move in with my brother next month because he thinks I'm not safe with my parents and sister. He thinks I'll be mentally healthier with him. I don't know If I'm going to make it that long, my suicide date is April 25th. I don't wanna hurt anymore I've tried everything I used to draw but that doesn't help me at all. Nothing helps me I feel like a lost cause. I have nothing to live for I'm not excited for the future as much as I used to be."

1442,Can’t sleep.,"Ever since my last psychosis episode about a week-ish ago, followed by endless nights of panic attacks, I can’t sleep. 
Well I can, but not until 4 ish in the morning. 
For a while I was taking NyQuil because melatonin and other sleep aids don’t work for me. But I know that’s not good for me. 

It’s currently 2:30am and I’m barely tired. I can’t break this. I used to be such a good sleeper, and even on nights I couldn’t sleep I’d watch videos and asmr, then fall right asleep. 

Now my mind is so awake it won’t shut up and I can not sleep. But I need to sleep. Even with my usual sleep distractions I can’t sleep. I hate waking up at 3pm because I couldn’t sleep till 5am, then have to go to work for 4. And by the time I get home my whole day is gone. I hate the night time, I always have. 

This has to change bit I can’t force sleep... any advice?"
1443,"My boss is a dick, what do I do?",After being off work for 4 months at the end of last year with anxiety and depression I was recently questioning my bosses policy during the COVID-19 pandemic and was told “it’s not like you turn up anyway.” Now I feel like I’m back to square one and if I go back it’s only going to be a matter of time before he invents a reason to sack me. I’m thinking of making a complaint to HR. What do u guys think?
1444,I don’t know what’s happening to me,"I. Don’t. Know. 

I don’t know what’s happening to me. Let me start y giving you a quick backstory. My boyfriend broke with me last December. He is my first love and fought hard. He didn’t want me back, whatever. I start therapy to get over him and trauma caused. I’m on antidepressants and taking Xanax for anxiety. But it’s not helping and I don’t know what I even need help for to be honest. I feel like no one can understand the pain and agony I’m going through. I’m obviously not over my ex and I don’t think I’ll ever be. I didn’t even believe in love until this happened so now that I don’t have that, I can’t function. Whenever anyone asked why I loved him so much, I always had one answer. He gave me peace and calm. It was a long distance relationship but we talked all the time. I went to him for everything. My therapist told me that my anxiety has an attachment to him. Makes sense because he was the first person ever that I opened up to about my anxiety but it wasn’t anything too bad in the beginning. Ever since the breakup, I literally can’t shut my brain off. I’m constantly thinking about stuff and can never relax or feel at ease. NEVER. I’m already taking anxiety medication, so I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want to die or anything but I also don’t want to exist. My life is great on paper and yet I’m always worrying about million thing. I don’t know what is happening to me. Send help!"
1445,Advice on how to move out?,I’m not sure what specific info I’m asking for.
1446,Angst and Joy,I go through periods where the darkness and doom am anxiety are so intense I would welcome an end but would not create one for myself. Today I told my family in a group message that if I were to die in this pandemic I would want them to know that I would consider an early death to be a merciful one. I don’t know why but I felt strongly that I needed to tell them that. I would want them to know that I was finally free from the angst and that I had been saved from more years of the same. And then we had our daily group video with my precious grand baby. Those moments are priceless. Life itself is such an oxymoron.
1447,I’m frustrated that I can’t kill myself,"This is a really weird thing to complain about, but this is kinda a venting post I guess. The idea that if life ever gets too hard, or to stressful, or too much, or whatever, I could kill myself, was always comforting to me. I doubt I’d ever actually do it, but it was a comforting thought. After my uncle passed a few years ago, I realized how easily death can devastate family members, and after some thought I realized I could never kill myself. My parents are great, and my little sister and maybe older brother wouldn’t be able to handle it. That’s it I guess, people often talk about how important it is to remember these reasons, but to me it’s only frustrating and depressing I guess"
1448,Can't. Stop. Thinking.,"Apparently I have ptsd. That checks out. I can't stop thinking about this thing that happened. Remembering it. No matter what I do my brain continues to torture itself. The funny thing is, from an outside perspective what happened doesn't even seem all that bad. But you don't know what it was like, ok? You don't fucking know. I can't take this. I just want to sleep. Or die. Actually preferably die. Please someone make it stop. End it. Kill me before I do it myself. I've had just about enough of this."
1449,Periodic Mental Functionality,"Is anybody else in the boat where on the first of December you can remember your friends names, brush your teeth and floss twice a day, and form a cohesive verbal sentence, and on the first of January you're making loud noises in your head to get the barber to stop reading your mind?

1450,Struggling to manage my mental health during quarantine.,Feeling more and more depressed as this goes on. In the past I have realized that spending too much time at home with video games and shows makes me depressed. Obviously the solution to that was going out more and seeing friends irl but now that I can't do that I feel like I have no choice but to be depressed again. The way I feel is pretty much a feeling of boredom but not enjoying anything I do. Any tips to alleviate this feeling. When this goes on too long it leads to more serious depressive thoughts and it is just terrible.
1451,The Rut,"My default position is at the bottom of a ditch.

I have aspirations, I have hope, and I have a purpose, or at least something close to it. I know what I want, and I have a general idea of how to get it. I should be fine.

But I'm not. Because despite all of that, despite the light at the end of the tunnel, my default position is still at the bottom of a ditch. I hope, but I don't do. Instead, I sit here, amidst the mud and the sewage, and I think. I think and think and think, but never anything more. 

It's been three years since I started writing, and what do I have to show for it? Where are my volumes of text? Where's the progress? Because right now, I can't see it. I can't see anything but what I want to do but haven't done. And it makes me feel like the worst kind of failure imaginable.

I'm afraid. I have so much that I want to do, so much that I want to make. I don't think it's even possible to fulfill all of my ideas, but dammit, I want to try. But sitting here, that doesn't seem possible. It feels like I'll be here forever, hoping and dreaming but never following through. That one guy who had a few nice ideas and everyone thought was really smart but never actually did anything. Could have been, never was.

There are so many people that have done so much more. People that had so much less than I, but still dragged themselves out of the rut for good. And I have to wonder, if they managed to do it and I haven't, do I even have the ability to?

I don't know. That's why I'm here, I guess. This entire aimless rant amounts to a desperate plea for understanding. I want to know whether I have a chance. I want to know if this is something other people feel, or have felt. I want to be able to trust that the future holds good things, and progress, and growth, and fulfillment, and anything other than the rut."
1452,I get heartaches so often it's becoming annoying.,"So I've never spoke with anyone about that, not even my therapist because I don't want anyone to know that about me, but I've had a rough childhood imo, atleast I might just be a whiny kid, idk. I grew up kind of, not wealthy enough to be comfortable I guess. And I've always felt subordinate to everyone around me, family, classmates, etc so I just distanced myself from everybody so I don't get into any situations that'd upset me, I just played games, with games I mean like 1-2 games tops at a time, and basically had no real life since I didn't want anyone to know that I ""struggle"" with anything. I just lived in my little world online, where I could be who  I wanted to be without being judged I guess. So i've had no friends for most of my life. Now I can't really interact with people without feeling self conscious as hell and people think im doing it to be the cool mysterious kid, which doesn't help. so whatever, I now when people talk to me/become my friends I just feel like shit and get heartaches from the smallest conflict/problem or if they do the smallest thing I feel like they don't like me and just pr etending to do so, which makes me act a little different because I feel like they don't really want to talk to me, and just doing it out of pity, so they feel like they did something wrong. even if they get close to someone I get the stupid heartaches and feel like shit, I feel like I'm so toxic and annoying as a friend but I can't stop my feelings, I try to not act upon it but that doesn't stop me from feeling like shit. idk what to do if there's anything to be done anyways"
1453,Will I ever achieve “normal”?,"I’ve come to the realization that I’ve been mentally unwell my whole life, and I’ve never had a “normal” state of being. Just better times and worse times. Recently I’ve started medication and taking recovery more seriously and I can’t help but wonder will I ever feel normal? Will I ever stop feeling like there is something wrong with me? I just want to reach that point in my life where I am content with everything, and I can go out and do activities without hinderance from depression and anxiety."
1454,Schizophrenia OCD?,"Hi guys,

Recently been working my way through tonnes of information on schizophrenia and read one story which panicked me and made me think I had schizophrenia. Why, when I read a more likely fact that it’s probably just OCD, why don’t I just accept it? Why do I keep looking it up and having horrible thoughts about harm coming to myself?"
1455,Emotional numbness while depressed?,"Ever since I’ve become severely depressed, I don’t feel any energy, and I’ve been really emotionally numb. 

I just feel angry and irritated and that’s about it. Has anyone else felt this?"
1456,Too much,"I’ve had enough with myself 
Not letting my words come out like water but to curl back in my throat to feel but not to feel good 
I don’t want to be here anymore. 
It’s harder and harder to even explain the depth of this sorrow I have the pain that runs completely from head to toe just trying to gasp for air and I just can’t can’t go on my mental health has been the most time consuming I’ve ever had to deal with. Takes away from my smile and replaces it with a frown with dark thoughts that run and run until I can’t think no more and lay on my pillow until I don’t feel Any more pain I hate it here and I don’t ever imagine having a genuine smile I have about to be a two year old daughter and she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me but this mental health just eats me alive without chewing just whole without any explanation to know my worth or who I am as a person with a layer of heavy garbage that is so hard to just pick from and just to let me sink down with it and let me convert with that pile of that filthy garbage I’ve became and just so off with myself don’t even recognize myself or my smile I  can’t even look at myself in the mirror why does it have to hurry so bad? Why do I have to feel like a piece of shit who just hurts every time I  speak, breathe, see or just to walk in this earth in general I don’t feel like a good mom or anything in ghat matter I’m just a piece of shit living with a narcissist who is in denial so he makes me feel like I’m crazy when he obviously doesn’t understand to the core and it hurts more then ever where was my best friend who betrayed me ? Where are you? Your there but your someone else but a complete stranger someone once I shared a smile with someone who loved me when I didn’t love myself to come to know that it was all bullshit . I’m never gonna be me I hope I do be me I miss her she was fun and happy. I’m sorry I’m all over the place but sometimes you gotta let it all out to be all out"
1457,This Is Driving Me Insane,"Because of this ""situation,"" my mental health is going sliding downhill faster than ice. I haven't been taking care of myself as I should be. I feel like I'm running in an infinite loop of insanity.

I have this close friend that usually talks everyday to me. I wake up, and poof, there's a text from them. But this time, something changed. They stopped talking. It's been over 2 weeks now, and I still haven't heard a single thing from them. This is extremely unusal for them. I've tried texting them EVERYWHERE. Their number, their social media, their gaming accounts. But nothing. No response. The last time I talked to them, they seemed absolutely okay. Just annoyed with this whole quartatine thing. Now, this friend sometimes gets extremely tired of everything. What I mean is, they don't want to talk to anyone, or be on any media or do anything as it just makes them mentally exhausted. You'd think that this is probably why they suddenly disappeared, right? Well, not really. The difference here is that when that happens, they actually tell me beforehand so that I don't send my hounds after them out of worry that something may have happened. And I obviously didn't get any warning for that type of situation this time. The point now, I don't know what to do. Or what happened to them. At this point, I'm afraid. Help! How can I find out they're okay? If I don't, I know my mental health is just going to get worse by the minute out of how much I'm overrthinking every possibility there could be."
1458,How were you accurately diagnosed for having a Bipolar Type-1 disorder?,"To those who are having a Bipolar type-1 as diagnosed by a doctor or knows someone else who do, how were you or that person you know diagnosed with Bipolar Type-1 disorder? 

What were the measures your doctor employed in order to come up with that diagnosis? 

Physical exam? What were those?

Interview? What questions were asked?

Medical tests? What were they?

For clarification, I am not asking these questions in order to save myself the money from an actual medical consultation. This is for the essay I am writing which requires a streamlined series of events that happen when a patient consults a doctor for a potential neurological disorder, like Bipolar Type-1 disorder."
1459,"Uni acceptances have got me stressed, looking for advice","Hey guys, 

I'm a grade 12 student from Canada waiting on uni acceptances. I'm currently waiting on an acceptance to my dream school, and I'm getting really sad every day that I don't get an offer. 

I've already gotten into another school that's basically the exact same, with a few minor drawbacks, but I'd much rather go to the first school. 

Honestly just really sad bc of the whole corona thing and stressed over this uni acceptance. Looking for advice on what to do. Should I just give up at this point? There's still a good chance I'll get in but I feel like stressing and getting sad over it isn't worth it at this point. I feel like I should just stop worrying about it, and just let it be, if it happens it happens, but at this point it's so hard to just let go. 

Any advice would be much appreciated :)"

1461,Am I getting closer to suicide?,"I’m not really sure what going on in my head, but up until now I’ve always gone on walks in the afternoon to help clear my head, where I walk to is an open grass area with powerlines running along, really nice relaxing environment. But recently I’ve started having these pictures in my head of being on top of those powerlines, like climbing up them, then jumping, I don’t really want to kill myself, but this idea of killing off keeps coming into my head, furthermore, when I have this image of jumping off, I see myself giving a final message to those few friends I love.

This thing is a bit all over the place, this is the first time I’ve opened up about anything really on reddit, and to the public 

So my question is, am I suicidal? Because I don’t want to kill myself, but this idea of doing it keeps popping into my head, and it’s always that one specific way..."
1462,Is it normal to feel sudden explicit moments of pure rage and violence?,"  For a while now I've been feeling sudden, explicit moments of pure rage and/or violence. I have issues with anger that I can sometimes control. But there's moments, whether I'm in school, or just playing around that for a moment I have a strong feeling of emptiness and rage. Many times I find myself stopping Myself from harming others. Physically. I don't believe this is normal but according to others I'm an ""edgy teenager"". I don't know how this affects me or what's going on but I can't seem to stop myself. I'll suddenly become very.. rough. I fear that I'll hurt someone I love one day. There's also another thing, I crave friends.. no, I long for friendship(s) that will last year's on end. Making memories. I find myself thinking about things that will most likely never happen in my life. Like going to a friend's house and 2 am just to wake them up and take a long drive with me to look at the stars, or to just simply drive around. I read these stories of such great friendships forming yet.. why can't I find something like that? Everyone usually leaves in the end. But I suppose that's predictorial seeing as ""friend"" has ""ends"" at the end. See, I've never truly had a friend. Just some kids to hang with during school hours. Been like that all my life actually. I don't know if that has to do with my depression or anger or excruciating emptiness and loneliness. I do not know how to stop these things.."
1463,I don’t know if it fits here but I seriously just need someone nice to provide some kind of support,
1464,I’ve sent my husband my emails from therapy,"I have no idea why, but I absolutely cannot open up about my mental health issues. My therapist is the only person I can talk to openly about it all.

Last night I was silent and the guilt I felt for subjecting my husband to more of my fallout from bad mental health, with no explanation was agonising. He doesn’t deserve to live his life like this, with someone who is awfully depressed all the time. He’s the happiest, care free soul I know and I feel like I’ve poisoned him and his happy nature.

I decided I couldn’t bare to carry on putting him through that, and with his permission I have sent him all of my therapy emails. 

He’s reading them now and I feel so sick. I’m a mess. He’s going to see just how much I hate being alive and now all my cards on the table for us to discuss. I’m terrified and I don’t know why."
1465,Is it weird,Is it weird I like the taste of paint? I like the bitter metallic taste as well as the smooth texture that coats my mouth that has a somewhat grains but silky texture?
1466,Is this normal?,"Hi everyone. I posted on another subreddit last night and I was told this could be a mental health thing, so I'd appreciate if you could tell me what you think. 

All my life, my emotions for people can change very fast. Sometimes I know what triggers it, sometimes apparently it's random. 

For example, I can be very happy with my boyfriend but in seconds I will feel disgust for him, or really really dislike him and forget all the good things I love about him. This is always temporary, it lasts minutes or hours, never more than a day. 

This has happened all my life, I think. I can't remember when it started but I know it was already happening as a teenager. It's happened with friends, family and romantic partners. 

I don't act on this anymore, because since it's been happening for so long, I already know that it's temporary and I'll change my mind again and think positive things. But I used to be more impulsive and end the relationship if I felt this dislike or disgust (because it feels extremely real and ending the relationship feels like the only way to stop feeling so bad). But like I said, I don't do this anymore. I try to get away from the person for a little while and calm down so the positive can come back. 

In the other subreddit, someone said it could be bipolar disorder or borderline disorder. I googled both and I can't see any of the bipolar symptoms. For borderline, I think I can relate to a couple (like obviously the quick change of emotion thing, some confusing identity things, some abandonment fear) but definitely I can't relate to the more serious symptoms. 

My question is: could this be a mental health thing or am I maybe just still a bit immature or bad at relationships? (I'm female, 21)

Thank you"
1467,Can't find any real options.,"Living in the US northeast. Short version of this story- Was part of a weekly dbt group, no counselor because my work schedule did not fit with anyone's schedule, then there was no one available. Other places locally I have had bad experiences with or now work for (they do behavioral health and in home care services). All physical locations are closed and I can only get answering machines. My job has me regularly visit 4 immunocompromised elderly clients. I also have to visit every single client in our roster every 3 months (up to an hour drive to get to some, one way). I didn't know what this job entailed when I took it, not fully trained. My boyfriend who I live is ""high risk"". We have lost around 40% of our work staff due to lack of childcare so boss is pressuring me hard to take on more. Can do job at work, cannot properly do what I need to at home 75% of the time. Looked into apps to help- cannot afford even the reduced cost and I don't trust dr to ask for a temporary anxiety RX. I am lost on what to do or where to go."
1468,My Mother[52] thinks my[20F] life is hers...Need Help and Advice.,"My [20F] Mother [52] thinks my life is hers. I'm a single child and my father passed away when I was 17. I've been a bright student all my life and I'm in one of the top colleges in my country. My career choice is a very competitive field that can take me years to get in. 
My mom thinks I can change her life. We are not so financially well, we live on rent and she's the only source of income. According to her, I cannot pursue masters/ or any other higher degree even if I get a scholarship because I'm not in a condition to do so. I should earn as soon as possible to support her, buy her a house, a car, and free her of all the burdens in life. 
I've been hearing this narrative since I was 13. I'm tired of it. I've thought of ending my life if I'm not able to secure a job as soon as I get over with college( that's in 1 year). She thinks my life is hers to control. I'm not a reckless child. I don't have a boyfriend, I don't party, I have no friends. I just focus on my studies because that's what I have been told to do since my childhood. 
I've had anxious and depressive thoughts since 3 years but my mother does not believe in therapy. 
I don't know what to do with my relationship with her. She constantly reminds me everyday that through me she gets to redeem her life.
I'm exhausted. 

TL;DR - I'm 20, living with my mom who thinks that I'm her token to a good life and she reminds me everyday about that. I'm tired of it."

I don't know whats wrong with her but I just want my mom back."

1471,Any tips for getting over mistakes you made as a child?,"I’m almost 30, yet my intrusive thoughts are obsessing over things I did as a child under 11. I’m still not sure the exact details of all of it, but what I do remember it’s really upsetting me and making me hate myself. 

I have OCD which makes me obsess over these things, and my illness is even trying to add false memories to it to make it even worse than it is.

I just feel hopeless. I’ve talked it out with others but it’s not helping. My brain is still tormenting me, and not letting me forgive myself."

It doesn’t happen often but it happens, and that was the first time I cried over it.I also don’t have any kind of ptsd, idk if that means anything here though."
1473,How do you support a spouse who is depressed without burning out?,"I feel I have compassion fatigue. About once a week for years my partner has an emotional breakdown for one reason or another. I’m not a therapist. I can’t solve these deep-rooted emotion problems. I love this person very much but I feel I’m starting to check out bc I just don’t have much empathy left. Recently I got a therapist for my partner and it seems to be going well, but the breakdowns are still happening. 

What else can I do? Is it inhumane to just let them cry alone sometimes? I have responsibilities and can’t just be there all the time, soothing, comforting, being the strong person."
1474,My partner's OCD is driving me insane,"I'm aware people will tell me I'm a horrible person for venting about my partner's mental health but I need to let it out somehow.

First off I want to say that I do have my own issues with depression, anxiety and PTSD so I very much understand that things can't be helped. His OCD can often make my mental health worse though. My partner's OCD is largely focused around hygiene and contamination, which is being made worse by COVID and the UK now being in lockdown. I am trying to make the best of things but today has just hit me as being particularly difficult. His rules and rituals are really getting to me.

I don't know what to do. The weather outside is lovely and I would like to go spend some time in the garden. However if I do gardening I have to have a shower and wash all my clothes when I come back inside. I also need to go to the pharmacy to pick something up after which I also have to have a full shower, wash my clothes, decontaminate my phone and any possessions I take with me (I admit I understand this fear of COVID). Some people would say  ""So just take two showers"". However this ends up with 2 sets of dirty clothes, 2 dirty towels and my skin getting even more dried out (even with moisturiser). I have to wash my hands so much that even with extra strength hand cream my hands end up red, cracked and bleeding. 

Alternatively, to avoid 2 showers I could just go sit outside and read BUT I'm not allowed to take books outside because that will make them ""dirty"". I even have two shelves of books that I'm only allowed to read while sitting at the dining table as he says they will make the sofa ""dirty"" because I had them at our old place where we had some mould (not on the books though). I would like to sit outside and draw but I'm not allowed to take my art stuff outside because then it will be ""dirty"". We have been at our current place nearly 1 year and we still aren't fully unpacked because I am having to disinfect every single tiny item we own and he won't let me unpack anything unsupervised. This is compounded by his health problems meaning he doesn't always feel well enough to do anything. Referring back to the books I have to read at the table, I am still not allowed to sit at the table as not everything has yet been ""organized"" so I have a small handful of books that I have bought since living here that I store separately that I can read on the sofa (I can't read in bed unless it is a book on Kindle as this can be disinfected).

I have my guitar that I am learning to play, which is great but I just get so frustrated not being able to do other stuff too. I am also my partners carer and have to do all the cleaning, cooking, laundry, help with bathing and medications etc so that takes up most of my time too. The only reason I have time to do gardening and such is because of lockdown. I am crying and depressed  because I am so trapped. I love him so much but his OCD is crushing me. He needs to get therapy but can't at the moment. 

I know I will get hate and be called selfish for not being able to cope with his OCD but I have to vent somewhere. There are so many more ""rules"" I haven't covered and it's driving me nuts. It always feels like my mental health is second fiddle to his. Anyways, I guess I'll go wash dishes, do laundry and cry.

TLDR: My partner has OCD and it is restricting my life and impacting my mental health."
1475,How do I reach out for help without people freaking out?,"My head hasnt been like this for almost a year. 

Back story: 
Beginning of february I moved to korea (military). Before coming here I had to stop taking my antidepressants for a few months to avoid complications with coming here. All was going well till about a month ago. The depression has slowly been getting worse and more unbearable. Today it has finally hit me full swing. I havent been suicidal since about june last year but now it's a constant thought in my head. 

I was supposed to get put back on meds today but it was cancelled due to covid. When it got cancelled I tried reaching out to one of my friends to see if I could talk to her about it. She sent me a long message back saying that I'm too much right now and that she will talk to me again sometime in the future but not soon. It definitely felt like a punch in the gut. But at the same time I get it. Dealing with people going through this stuff is exhausting. I don't blame her but it's been a constant thought in my head today that I ruined that friendship and that I'm not worth the shit on my shoes.

1476,Internal struggles...,"Sorry guys, very long post but wanted to get opinions of what people think.  
Whether or not anyone is a therapist or has knowledge on mental health issues I would still like to know what people think.

For the past few months I have been writing a list of all the things that I struggle with mentally.   
I did this for myself and for my therapist as I found it very hard to explain a lot of these feelings in person. I suppose I just want to know if anyone else feels or does the same things as I have listed below  
Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

*  Always living in the past and allowing the past and it’s experiences to ruin what I have in the present (relationships mainly) 

&amp;#x200B;

* Get extremely angry and irritable at the smallest of things yet can normally stop this when in public or around people I am trying to impress or I respect

&amp;#x200B;

* Am extremely paranoid and constantly over think things in my head. For example, If i have a conversation with someone in authority or someone I look up to, once they are gone I will run through that conversation numerous times in my head to make sure I didn’t say anything offensive or anything that could be misconstrued as bad. Linked to this is always caring and obsessing about how other people may see me. I will always think people are thinking the worst about me and look down to me, these people don’t even have to overtly do anything for me to feel like this

&amp;#x200B;

* Have really bad OCD where I will make constant mental lists in my head throughout the day up to 30 times a day about things that need doing when I get home. Doing the washing up, putting on laundry, mow lawn, etc. and cannot relax or do anything until that is ALL done. It’s good as I get things done but other things get pushed aside such as gfs, going to the gym etc. I cannot relax until all these jobs are done and once they are, all I want to do is relax and not go to the gym or anything 

&amp;#x200B;

* Have rapid-cycling, bipolar-like symptoms where one hour I can be very happy then something comes into my head and it will put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. As the thought has gone on in my head, this confuses the hell out of anyone I am around who instantly think it’s them who have annoyed me. Will also have days where I have no emotion at all, i can have intrusive thoughts about family members dying etc and not care or feel anything, yet other days have too much emotion and something like a horrible news story will set me off crying

&amp;#x200B;

* Always feel like I’m a burden on people which makes it very hard for me to ask or seek out help for my issues as this will make me feel even more of a burden. Will find myself always putting people before me and helping people out as much as I can which I think is a subconscious way of trying to alleviate the burden I feel on people

&amp;#x200B;

* Will always hold a grudge and find it very hard to forgive even if it was minor. Will wish death and violence on people even over the smallest of things. If I'm in a bad mood, I could happily watch someone die if they wrong me or upset me as to me that seems like a fitting amount of justice.

&amp;#x200B;

* Hold my self so low that i will look up to everyone regardless of whether they are more successful than me or not and will resent them for it whether it’s true or not

&amp;#x200B;

* Had a few times where I’ve been extremely happy in the company of friends or my girlfriend then in 1 second I have suddenly felt empty, irritable and angry without a single thought of sadness even entering my mind. Not only does this scare the hell out of me it also scares the person I am with and has resulted in a recent break up from gf and many previous ones

&amp;#x200B;

* Will always think the worst is going to happen and catastrophize every event. I will see it as being a realist not being pessimistic and would rather not get my hopes up and expect the worst than hope something will work out and be disappointed. It’s almost like I find comfort in being sad because then I can’t be disappointed, when it does go wrong I will say to myself “Yep, see, told you it wasn’t going to go my way - it never does”

&amp;#x200B;

* When hearing a loud noise like a door slam or a bang, I get very irritable and angry and shout because it has made me jump, the same feeling goes for anything that has caused me pain, if i trap a finger in a door for example, I will instantly lose my cool and kick or punch the door

&amp;#x200B;

* Have extreme anxiety and will sometimes have panic attacks in new places or in a situation where I don’t know where the exits or toilets are or if I cannot leave without drawing attention to myself (eg. meetings). I panic about needing the toilet and not being able to go which makes me panic and tightens my tummy which makes the symptoms worse. This has put me off so many events from new job interviews to dates with girls etc. Not sure if it is related but have always found it impossible to get aroused and ready to have sex with a new girl for the first few times. After 3 or 4 times I am fine but by this point it is normally too late as she has already been offended thinking it's her. It is definitely psychosomatic as I have never had issues getting an erection at other times in life

&amp;#x200B;

* I find that drinking is the only way my inhibitions cease and I can finally relax and stop the worrying and constant carnival that goes on in my head 99% of the time, this has also ended relationships but not through violence as I have never been violent towards a woman. This said, I have started drinking less alcohol since being on Sertraline

&amp;#x200B;

* I regularly experience hallucinations when waking up from sleep. I will normally dream of something unpleasant (e.g. spiders in my bed, water leak in my house resulting in a torrent of water running alongside my bed) and then wake up and still see the spiders running about. My eyes are open and I am actually looking at the duvet cover and can see them, this isn’t a dream. This will normally result in me jumping out of the bed to turn the light on, as soon as the light is on the objects disappear. (hypnopompic hallucinations I think)"
1477,How the coronavirus has been affecting me mentally,"Okay so, I don’t have the coronavirus, but It’s been affecting me negatively a lot.

Since more stuff has been happening with the coronavirus, my mental health has gotten progressively worse. I’m trans and prone to stress (I’m not diagnosed with any stress disorders, but I’m easily stressed). Being around people (aka my family) who don’t use my proper pronouns, and not having the structure of my traditional school has been messing with me a lot (it’s been mainly stress and depression) I don’t have my usual support system and I feel like I have no one to go to 
I’ve been experiencing suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm a lot lately as well 

Is there any way to keep my mental health and spirits up during this whole deal?"
1478,"I (19F) have always felt like there's something wrong with me, like I have a mental illness but I don't know what","I must've read about at least 10 mental disorders/illnesses such as ADHD, OCD, schizophrenia, BPD, autism, etc. trying to find something that would explain how I feel. But I can't find anything. 

I have trouble focusing, to the point where I basically hardly ever studied for a test while I was in school. I remember studying only one or two times. I also get very easily distracted and can't resist temptation. I have very hard time trying to stop myself from eating even though I am not hungry. This is why I thought I had ADHD.

I get extremely caught up in my fantasies. I invent extraordinary stories in my head with people I will never meet in my life (celebrities) and then get really sad once I realise there isn't a chance this is ever gonna happen. Sadness then turns into anger where I feel like punching or breaking something. But then I realise I'm being overly dramatic and pathetic and just kinda stop...

I used to daydream about some celeb crush having hidden cameras in my house and everywhere I went (much like the truman show), and I'd act differently around the house trying to be cool, because someone was watching me. Even though I was aware no was watching.

I don't think I have my own mannerisms. I just copy off of other people. People who I think are cool and funny.

I feel so pathetic now that I have written this down."
1479,How often does everyone else want to do things they need/want to do?,"Hi, I recently started to take a good look at my habits and things that I do in order to sort out my life but first I wanted to ask if my attitude about is 'normal'. Basically, I look around at the people in my life (friends, family, etc.) and see them get up everyday wanting to do things they actually want to do. My sister will get up at 9 am and work on sewing something, my mom will get up the same time and go out to work in the garden or help my dad fix something. These aren't things they have to do, they are things they want to do. And I see it on television shows and movies as well, people having the motivation to do things a lot. And I feel like I have never had that. Sure there are things I want to do but I can very rarely seem to push myself to do them, maybe 2 days every two weeks and evwn then I still don't get things done. This is for things I want to do not have to do, I get up for work and whatnot. So my question is, how often do you, other redditors, actually have the motivation to do the things you want to do? Is this something everyone experiences or is it just the people around me? Sorry if this is confusing, I don't really know how to explain it but I figured this would be a good place to ask."
1480,I ate magic mushrooms and had an identity crisis.,"I tripped and had an identity crisis.

Apologies for the long read.

I took mushrooms. I don’t know how many. Supposedly 4 grams, but I just took some of whatever was in the bag and gave the rest to my friends who bought some. I was alone in my room and talking with my Xbox friends when I started to feel a rise. I felt weird. Thinking weird. Even though I was trying to think good and right. I asked my friend “What do I do?” and he told me that I don’t have to do anything and enjoy the trip. Do whatever I want. But that wasn’t an answer I was looking for and jusy kept asking him what the fuck do I do. I started to panic. I didn’t know who I was supposed to be or what i’m supposed to do. I didn’t know where I was going in life. I felt so trapped. I started walking everywhere in my room and could barely breathe and tried to call my one real life friend. He didn’t answer. I tried to call my mom, who was mad at me for finding out I do psychedelics, and she declined my call immediately. I have never been so scared in my fucking life. I had nobody to call except my other friend who I gave some shrooms too. He picked up immediately and I started crying my fucking eyes out. I explained everything to him and how I feel like i’ve been an asshole for so long and I want to be better and care about what people say and not always have negative thoughts. He was blown away because he didn’t know I had problems like this and tried to reassure me that i’m a good person and I do selfless acts for so many people. He was confused about what I want and what i’m looking for and I just wanted things to make sense. We got in a facetime call with my other friend and they tried to take my mind off of it and I started bawling more. He offered to walk to my house and come and walk with me outside to our other friends house and watch a movie. 

We hung up and I called my mom again and apologized for everything and we talked it out and I told her everything and told her I want to be better and i’ll finally get a therapist and I want to focus on school more and actually care about it. She told me she loved me and she will help however she can. I apologized to my sister and a few girls i’ve talked to in the past that I feel like I had hurt.

My friend got to my house about 20 minutes later and I tried so hard to keep my composition, but I just broke down. The stars and moon were out and we took a long walk and told me how he wants to see me and our other friends go far in life. How we’ll always hang out in and out and after college and if he makes it and succeeds and if I don’t then he’ll always have a place for me. But he said he was fully confident that i’ll succeed and be okay. He assured me that I have a family that loves me, friends that care about me and a good situation and that i’m just letting shitty thoughts get to me and I had been for a long time. He told me i’m going to be okay and he’s always going to be in my life and we’ll even be each others best men at our weddings. 

We made it to our friends house and they put on Fantastic Mr. Fox for me and everything was okay. I walked home alone and thought a lot and knew my life was going to take a change now.  When I got home I sat in a lawn chair and looked at the clear sky and the bright moon.

This morning my mom told me she has therapist’s lined up for me after this virus ends and we called all my professors and explained how i’ve been struggling with depression and mental issues and how i’m going to do my work now. They told me it’s not too late and I can do my late work and still make it and pass these classes. 

I will always be grateful to mushrooms and LSD for helping me make a change, but I will NEVER do psychedelics again. I’m done. 

Psychedelics are a push, not an answer."
1481,Shit scared of going to a psychologist cause I don't want to know what's wrong with me.,"So I eventually built up enough courage to tell my GP that I'm feeling depressed a couple of months ago, sent me for some bloods, I was just low on Vit D but have been supplementing and it's come back to normal levels, he has now sent me to see a psychologist under the care scheme free of charge (so greatful to have it).  

Like Ive only shared little bits of my mental health with some of my exes but they seem to freak out and I've kinda hidden it away. Like the main one that is always noticible is that swing from being extremely sociable to struggling to even get out of bed let alone leave the house, which occurs several times a year. Usually during these times where I'm not leaving the house I struggle with some suicidal ideation. 

One ive struggled with my whole time during school was difficulty concentrating, like when I used to be in highschool I would consistently distract other kids, never study and still manage to get pretty high grades, without studying. When I moved out of home for my first year of uni things just ran so out of control, I couldn't go to class, I couldn't study even if I knew I had to. My assignments were constantly late. I moved back home where I was able to get a bit more support by staying with my parents and changed course.  Ive currently completed my current course, with a distinction average, with barely having to study and now completing my honours on a subject I thoroughly enjoy but it just doesn't feel real that I'm doing it. Like Ive barely studied and I somehow made it to the top of my class. Like 90% of my time studying as was looking for away to pass the time while I pretended to look busy. still struggled with deadlines not having my parents ride me for them like I did when I was in highschool. 

At work focusing is like a million times harder and I really get distracted but I kinda know that if I don't get things done I'm not gonna have a job, I feel like the people I manage get annoyed at me cause I have the tendency to get distracted and then be overly productive. Recently had one of the other managers make the accusation to my boss that I'm taking drugs. The same on I was insistent that was trying to get me fired.  I also have these weird tics when I'm at work which I'm sure gets incredibly annoying, consistently have to make these clicks in chirping noises when I'm not with customers.   These tics be come really apparent when I have high energy and being really productive.  Productivity is really erratic and high for weeks at a time and low for a couple of weeks. Usually sinks up with not wanting to leave the house. 

I think I'm absolutely terrified to tell the psychologist this cause I'm scared that I actually have a mental illness and there is something wrong or, worst comes to worse there isn't really something wrong with me and I'm just faking it."
1482,I'm tired of fighting,"Where to even begin a post like this...

At the center of my mind is a black hole, sapping all my willpower, all my motivation, all my desires. Life is about taking risks, but i cannot seem to stop focusing on guilt, regret, and pain over my past actions (even though for a long time I have felt like I have not even been able to control my own two hands) long enough to leave my minimal comfort zone.

My family is there for me, but I can't communicate what I feel for some reason, so their support feels vacuous to me because I cannot share my real concerns and vulnerabilities without being judged. My mind and my life are a mess and a string of mistakes after mistakes, and the world is a horribly harsh and judgmental place. I barely have any friends I keep in touch with anymore, and I am honestly just tired of myself, and of the innumerable demands of life that I'm just too stupid to keep up with diligently. I know life isn't 'supposed' to be fun or satisfying, but I honestly have such little interest in what's going on around me that I cannot put any work toward long term rewards without being totally distraught at how boring and unsatisfying any of this feels, even when things do go well for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rambling incoherent post. I guess I just need to vent somewhere. I don't even really understand what I'm venting about. What I do know is that it's massively tiring to feel this 24/7."
1483,Crisis Text,"So I texted them. I’m not suicidal or going to hurt myself or others, but I am at the start of a downward spiral so I thought reaching out might nip this in the bud. 

They have been downright terrible before when I was in actual crisis, but I thought since I am just trying to find resources and am not in critical need, maybe it would actual help. I mean, my therapy clinic is closed for the pandemic and I really need help. 

What a damn joke. 

I am a 33 year old man with a diagnosis of complex PTSD. Some of that is sexual trauma, some medical and some violence and a lot of grief. My sexual trauma is all more than a decade old but haunts me nastily. 

First he hyper focused on the sexual trauma and kept trying to refer me to rape services. I have been raped yes, but more than ten years ago. I don’t need guidance on going to the ER for a lot or talking to SVU. That’s not what I am asking for. 

When I pushed back, he sent me a link to a wikihow page on managing your pandemic related anxiety. I don’t need help with pandemic anxiety, I need help with increased flashbacks, hyperviligance, and destructive behavior as my entire routine and support network are gone in the shutdown.  

So here I am an hour later. I am incredibly insulted that he reduced a lifetime of pain and trauma to “pandemic related anxiety” and still have zero resources."
1484,Is anybody else sometimes scare of themselves?,"I am sometimes scared of myself. I don't really like it, but I know I should embrace it. It is because I have some very depressed thoughts, ups and downs. A lot of fantasy at my high and low moments that I sometimes drown in it. Sometimes I don't know what is real and later I cought myself with that feeling. Does anybody else experience this and how do you deal with it?"
1485,How can I not hold grudges of things that happened in the past?,"My parents didn’t believe me that I have mental problems so they kept assuming that I was a normal person until late 2019... I am angry about how they treated me before that... now they are so supportive and they understand my mental problems...

Also I am very angry at some people and things that happened 10+ yrs ago (we were all 10yr olds back then or even younger) I kept on comforting myself that maybe they died of the coronavirus or they died of a car crash or plane accident etc...

My grandma as well, she has mental problems so she did and said a lot of crazy things when she had the energy and that made everyone angry. Even mum. I blocked her WiFi as a revenge but it still feels weird. 

Seriously, I want to live a happy life not like this!"
1486,I don't know what i feel,"First of all i have never done something like this so sorry for my bad English I'm only starting to learn.

Im 24 years old. I have a girlfriend and few friends .
I don't have a job right now
I just have the feeling to die all the time. Its like im soo stressed all the time and i can't sleep, i tried telling my girlfriend about this she said it'll be ok but its not . I'm afraid to tell her more because i can't deal with a breakup now.
Did anyone ever had this experience ?how did you deal with it?"
1487,why do i have a self destructive mentality?,"one week i want to be skinny, so i starve myself for a period of time that makes me drop and faint at some point. 
one week i don’t care that my body isn’t perfect so i eat everything in front of me.
i know some stuff i do makes me really really sad and i still do them anyway, with no one pressuring me to do them and the longest i’ve been avoiding doing those ugly stuff is 2 months (which i was really happy in), then i break down and convince myself to continue doing ugly stuff."
1488,Body aching from inactivity,"I lay in bed watching tv all day and every 30 minutes I roll around and try to get into a new comfortable position, but no matter how I lay my body aches. Saying I'm not active is an understatement, I only move to get food or use the washroom. I can't exercise because my body feels restrictive. I've been depressed and too anxious to go anywhere for years."
1489,Just a rant.,"Damn, ten years ago when my Grandma (schiz) died my mom went down a rabbit hole of conspiracy theories and all that shit. Since then I became aged and moved out. Since then she’s crazy into the bible in a “I understand it and nobody else does” sort of a way. I can’t have a bloody conversation with her that isn’t gonna end up on NWO or whatever, especially with that CoVid shit going on. Like i didn’t want to invite friends when i was younger cause she’d be listening to that shit on youtube and would make me very embarrassed in front of friends.
I was t too far from jumping on that boat myself.

Now I live in another country where I moved to catch up with my dad and who was never there when I was a kid. I’m here with my sister too. Now nobody wants talk to my mum, cause those conversations are extreeeemely taxing. 

This is where my dillema comes in. My mother is living in another country on her own now. Putting all her thruth up on facebook(honestly breaks my heart to look at that shit) my sister doesn’t wanna talk to her. My dad even more so. Im the only one who’s able to at least listen to her for a bit without losing my shit. But it still throws me off the rails like nothing else. I mean i got off the phone to her a while back and I’m still agitated and confused. She doesnt have any contact with her side of the fam and is pretty much alone. 

Now I feel like an absolute shit cause thats my mother. She raised me and put food on my plate and i know she shouldnt be alone like tha and i love her, shes my fucking mom. But FUCK that conspiracy shit is pushing my buttons like nothing else. Im a very calm and keen person but that shit, oh boy that shit just throws me right out into the stratosphere.

I don’t know what to do, im regular on this sub myself so its like double trouble.idk what to do about her. It’s like something i cant do anything about. But if i stop talking to her in concern for my own nerves i feel like an absolute fucking bell end leaving her like that. Idk what to think nor what to do, but i sure feel like shit with that"

1491,TW: attempted suicide,a few days ago i tried to kill myself by swallowing a ton of my anti-depressants. if you havent figured it out by now i didn’t die. the next morning i was super dizzy to the point where i couldn’t walk straight and i fainted outside my bedroom. i’m at home with my parents and they took care of me all day but they don’t know it was from the pills.  i’m pretty much better now but i don’t want to take my anti-depressants.  it makes me feel nauseous thinking about it but i can’t tell my parents why and i don’t know what to do. that’s all
1492,Nice weather=anxiety,"I live in Northwest Indiana/Chicago area. Our weather has just started to be nice spring weather. Is there anyone else that gets terrible anxiety with weather changes?

I don’t know i can’t explain it. Something about the way the air smells, or just how all 5 senses are affected. Similarly this happens when it becomes fall as well. I think something about how it’s perceived as time to be social, and have fun with the nice weather. Fall is my favorite time of year so maybe i feel pressure to be happy at that weather change. 

I don’t know.., it’s just so odd. I’m bipolar and i had my first bipolar, severe depressive phase at around age 22, and it was from june til October. I hated summer, the sun, being alive. I don’t know.. like do i have seasonal affective in a different way or does my body just remember trauma.."
1493,I'm starting to feel suicidal again and I'm really scared.,"I had gotten to a place where I felt a little more settled within myself. However, I have to leave my home of 7 years this month, which means separating from my pets and moving back to live with an abusive parent. It's hitting me really hard and I feel like I can't do anything. I can't move, I can't stop crying and I just want to stay in bed all day.  
I don't want to seek outside help, as I feel like that's admitting that it's serious and I'm too scared to admit that. I thought I was okay."
1494,I have a boyfriend who disappears.,"I have a boyfriend. He is amazing with me whenever we talk. We’re always laughing and smiling about stupid things that aren’t even important, even when I am in a bad place (I got diagnosed with bipolar 1 year ago). He’s always caring for me and for everyone around him even if it comes at his own expense. My boyfriend, let’s call him John, has a lot of family issues. And I don’t mean like his family fights sometimes. I mean the kind of issues that can result in the suicide of one of his family members if it gets too out of hand. So, sometimes when John and I are on FaceTime or we’re out together, if he gets a text that his family is fighting or if anything tells him that they are, he always has to hang up and leave. Which, of course, makes sense. John always wants to protect his family. So he leaves. I’m okay with it because I understand the situation. But I can’t help and get sad sometimes because he’ll leave and I won’t hear from him for hours. I’ll text him and I might not get a response for 18 hours, a whole day, or two. And when he does answer my text, or he calls me and I ask what happened, he doesn’t get into it at all and so I never know what is going on. I know I can’t complain because he’s trying his best with his situation, but I still feel sad and anxious because I’m worried about him. I don’t know what to do because I can’t complain to him, but it is making me feel very anxious sometimes. I know I’m not being a good girlfriend even though I try really hard, but I don’t know what to do."
1495,how to mute memories?,"for a while I am troubled by the ever-recurring memories. I wouldn’t say they’re important just memories from various moments in life whose reflection makes me feel negative. Sometimes when I think of a moment from the past I frown or sigh. I’m afraid it’s gradually getting stronger. I would like to get rid of it, because it prevents me from concentrating and also makes me feel bad (unexplained shame, resentment, etc.)

sorry for grammar"
1496,Here’s Why Therapy Could Be the Answer to Your Relationship Troubles,"Every relationship is different. No one has a readymade answer to your relationship questions. Looking for inspiration or answers in someone else’s relationships or Googling your problems at 3 o clock in the morning is something we have all indulged in while feeling “stuck” in a relationship. While only you can be the judge of whether you both deserve to be with someone else or actually fight for this relationship, it is worth noting there are many ways in which you can fix a seemingly “broken” relationship. Going to a [relationship advisor](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) is a great start, and a statement of intent that you both actually want to be with each other, no matter what the current circumstances dictate. What a counsellor brings to the table is a breath of fresh air and perspective to the relationship. It can help the two people look at their problems in a lot more different way and look at the issues in isolation, rather than a long drawn daily issue. 

A lot of the times, when a relationship is going through a rough patch, it can make both the people feel that they are stuck in a rut with no way out. In such times, it is extremely important to remind yourself the reason you got together. The reason, the core emotion that binds you two together. Because in difficult times like these, it is very easy to forget that. A [family therapist](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) does that job. A therapist brings new perspectives and a fresh energy to the dynamic. Different exercises are also designed to bring this feeing out in a lot more organic way. More than anything else, just the feeling of remembering the good times in such difficult situations can be a turning point in the relationship. These techniques work best with a therapist because they can guide you to a better place with their experience and calmness. 

Another issue that couples face while going through a patchy phase is the inability to recognise toxic behaviour patterns. [Family therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) can help couples not just recognise their partner’s behaviour, but also their own. Sometimes, in a relationship where you are so used to blaming your partner for everything, you forget to keep a check on your own behaviour. This can lead to even more issues in the relationship and snowball into something a lot more serious than it should have been in the first place. Counselling can help partners realise their own personal issues that can lead to further problems in the relationship and work on it. Only when both the people in a relationship have solved their own toxic issues can they work towards reviving their relationship. This is only possible with consistent therapy and maximum effort from the couple. In conclusion, if you feel like your relationship has reached a point of no return but you still want to be with that person, it might be time you look at family counselling as an option. Before it is too late."
1497,Klonopin for self harm,"Hey y'all! 
Hope this message finds everyone in high spirits and good health. 
I am have been taking half of a .5 klonopin for anxiety for a year now. When I feel an attack come on, I take my half. It takes about 30 minutes before the fog clears and I can think rationally. 
Let me get to it... about 4 months ago, during an anxiety attack I had this uncontrollable urge to bang my head. It's as if my brain tells me that if I bang my head it will all be over. I try to take medicine and calm down before it gets to that point, but I have had a few bruises on my forehead :/ 
The scariest one happened a few days ago. I woke up from deep sleep, instantly banged my head on the nightstand, and went back to sleep like it was nothing. I remember doing it like my life depended on it. I woke up to blood on my pillow, and i realized what had happened. 
This symptom is rather scary. I am ashamed to tell my therapist about it.
I am also on 150 xl wellbutrin 1x daily. 
I am just wondering what this head banging urge is all about. The klonopin helps, if I catch it in time, but any tips on what else I can do?"
1498,How to get rid of intrusive thoughts?,"For the last 6 months I have been experiencing frequent thoughts about statues ,I try to break the statues mentally but they keep coming to the point where I can't continue normal daily tasks since these thoughts are annoying, recently i have been diagnosed with OCD and am on a medication ,but is there something I can do to get rid of these thoughts?"
1499,My anxiety is through the roof right now.,"My entire family and I got tested for COVID-19 on Sunday. My aunt got her results and she is negative. Meanwhile, my dad and cousin are positive. Meanwhile, my grandfather and I are (im)patiently waiting on our results. 

It is very anxiety inducing to wait for your results. And even if I myself am negative.....I am very worried about the rest of my family. I am pretty certain that my cousin will be okay since he is fairly young (27), healthy, and his symptoms seem to be mild (at least for now). However, I am concerned for my dad who is 54 and has a mild heart murmur (it is very small, in his ventricular walls, and he does not require any medication for it). He seems so fine to the point that you never would of guessed that he had it but what if this is just the calm before the storm. And even if he will be find.....there is the stress that this will spread to my grandmother who is already dying from COPD.   


We are now trying to practicing house quarantining in my house but what if it’s already too late."

1501,Staying Sober,"Hi there!

So I am sorry if this sounds petty or like a pitty party (it autocorrected to potty party and I am still sitting here laughing on the toilet) but I was looking for some validation or support today.

Those of you who are recovering addicts, can we all just agree that this pandemic is making it SO hard not to cave?! I have been sober for just over a year now and this the loudest my inner voice has been trying to rationalize why it would be totally fine to star abusing again because when else am I going to have the time. I mean really, I just miss how drugs and alcohol could make a 500sqf apartment feel like 500acre.

I am fully aware that this all sounds stupid but can someone please just be like, I feel you man, this sucks.

Thank you!"

1503,I'm really struggling dealing with my boyfriend's Learned Helplessness amidst my own Coronavirus- and life-related anxieties.,"**I'm sorry this is so long. The last few days have just been a lot.**

So my boyfriend and I have had a rocky relationship the last 4 years. I feel like I'm really, truly seeing parts of him while we're quarantined that have made me question this relationship more than ever before. He and I both had abusive parents -- I myself have clinically diagnosed PTSD(I suspect it's C-PTSD), depression, anxiety, and my therapist suspects bipolar disorder and OCD. However, after living with a physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive parent for 8 years, losing everything I loved in Katrina, having my father die, and going through three years of homelessness from 17 to 20 after my mother tried to choke me to death, I'm still here. Not only that, but I worked really, really hard and through this nonprofit programming bootcamp, I now have a job that treats me great, I have great hours, and I'm not doing dangerous work anymore. I put in the work, and it paid off.

My boyfriend, while also coming from an abusive parent and family members, kind of pivoted the other direction. Subconsciously, he looks for every opportunity to quit something. He has TONS of negative self-talk, and it's been a large factor in killing our relationship (he's threatened to leave me so many times because of this, among a mountain of other issues he's caused). I decided to give our relationship one final stretch this year since he's agreed to therapy, (One of the biggest reasons I am where I am today is because of almost 4 years of therapy, which I still attend) which is definitely helping. However, given the COVID crisis, his problems are really, really weighing on me.

I convinced him to leave his job (because they were continuously making him travel around the city for work, which puts me, him, and our roomate (we all have pre-existing conditions that can make COVID deadly to us) at risk. I'd talked him into joining a programming bootcamp months ago and began teaching him at home how to program, because I knew he'd love it, and he does. However, my boyfriend has always kind of had things given to him in life, so he gets demotivated SO fast at times. I feel like every time there's any kind of panic or uncertainty, he wants to bolt from any situation. He just got accepted into a programming bootcamp a few days ago, and we were super happy, and he seemed to be doing well with his pre-coursework (he's a smart guy). This morning, he was losing his shit because he couldn't find a download for an assignment, and the doom and gloom immediately started. ""If I can't find this assignment, how am I going to do when it comes to the real assignments?"" ""I don't know if I can do this."" etc. etc. I would empathize with him if it weren't for the fact that plenty of times when he gets like this, he just becomes an asshole. I offered to help him find his coursework, and asked if he could let me see his computer, and he got defensive and said, ""I've looked for it all over, I just told you. You're not going to find it."" Lo and behold, I look on the page with the same title as the coursework he's looking for, read instructions for a few minutes, scroll down, and find the large blue download button. Immediately after I find the coursework, he whines that he can't open the file. This is also a fix that takes 15 seconds, that he immediately panicked about before even Googling.

As I said, this shit is grating on me. I would be less mad and more understanding of his situation if it weren't for the fact that my boyfriend expects things of me that he himself won't do. For example, in previous years, if I was being a bummer like he is right now, he'd get frustrated with trying to comfort me as soon as I'm sad, but if I'm struggling to empathize with him, he gets really pissy with me and yells. After years of talking about it, he's finally come to terms with the fact that he has a lot of narcissistic tendencies from his father (his father is one of two of his major abusers, and is a huge narcissist). As I said, he's in therapy now, which is actually helping, but him not even making an attempt to solve some of his issues before bringing them to me, all the while not being the most supportive person himself is really hurting my mental health. We also have a roomate that has FAR more learned helplessness issues than he does -- this guy was supposed to live with us for 3 days, but then stayed for one week, then three, then the lockdown for coronavirus happened (It's my SO's moochy best friend from childhood). I'm now trapped in a house with two people that need to get their own shit together and I'm expected to have mine together. I'm even trying to prepare for the fallout surrounding a breakup during this difficult time, because my boyfriend really triggers my abandonment issues when he threatens to leave. We have couples and individual therapy, and our therapist made him promise to never threaten me to leave again, because she pointed out that it's pointless for him to be so hurtful and stress me out further if he's going to keep doing this and not go anywhere. He did it again a few days ago, and while he apologized profusely and blamed stress from the virus, I told him that the next time he does, he can just leave.

I'm sorry this is so long. I'm just noticing that his problem is picking up now that he's starting school. The bootcamp is for 6 months, and I can't handle 6 whole months of him whining every time he can't find a file. He wasn't like this when I was self-teaching him, and I feel like this is purely because he's actually ""doing it"" and going to school. But I really don't have time or emotional bandwidth for thsi shit."
1504,I feel like a complete failure (M21),"I am 21, and I feel like I have achieved nothing in my life. I studied for nearly three years, and my first bachelor degree I attempted (chemistry) I failed, and I feel like I might fail my current one. I have worked the same retail supermarket job for nearly 3 years, and honestly kinda glad I haven't been fired yet, so yay I guess. I still live at home with my parents, and haven't even learnt to drive. I have no talents, I have been learning guitar for 6 months now, and yet I still can't play a single song from start to finish. I tried to pick up drawing, but my drawings look like they were done by an 11 year old. My love life is also crap. I have been in 2 ""relationships"" I guess, I don't know what to call it tbh, and combined they lasted for 3 months. I just feel like I have achieved nothing in my life and don't know what to do. And it's not like I peaked in high school, it feels like I have never been relevant. Silver lining is that I got a fair amount of friends. But frankly I don't know what to do and where to go from here. Btw, since rules require it, I live in Australia."
1505,It’s either crying or Benadryl/Ativan (not both at once),I wake up to anxiety attacks knowing covid is the biggest thing I have to get through. I cry or take an Ativan each morning n maintain my composure til it kicks in. I kept in every bad emotion throughout the day. Sleep is the only way to not have the pandemic rush through my mind. If i don’t take Benadryl I’m not gonna sleep. I can’t be the only one 🤷🏻‍♀️ my ptsd is difficult to deal with lately. the chaos has brought back some of the most horrific memories and emotions I ever had.
1506,I think I’m actually going crazy,"I’ve lost all control. I feel entirely off my fucking rocker and I can’t do anything about it. I can’t talk to friends because they’re too busy or I’ve lost a sense of trust. I can’t post here because it doesn’t feel safe anymore. I can’t post on tumblr because whatever I write, people will take it as passive aggressive or attention seeking. Suicide hotlines just repeat whatever you say back at you, never offering any actual advice. Crisis lines just tell you to deal with it yourself. Family refuses to listen. I went to the hospital yesterday, but they discharged me because I wasn’t a danger. I am just so full of rage and I don’t know where to put it and I don’t know what to do. I’m scared it’s going to reach a point where I do kill myself just so I don’t have to deal with all of this anger anymore. It’s making me so sick.

I don’t know what to do."
1507,I’m lost,"I applied to become a police officer I past the entrance test with a perfect score basically. 
Spent the last 8 months committed to becoming the best me, 
Working out everyday, running twice a week, volunteering and dedicating any spare time to them for meetings etc. 
I got a email this morning saying I was deferred for something that happened when I was a kid.. 
I realize there are lasting ramifications from previous mistakes but I was just a immature kid. 
Now I’m lost. Don’t know what to do with life anymore, I feel like I let my whole family down.. I’m embarrassed to even mention it to them because it’s all they every talk about.. 
I’m having mixed feelings about everything but also know I can’t talk to my friends or family about it"
1508,Can't get rid of the noise,"Full disclosure: I already take paxil for anxiety. I had to start earlier this year when my panic attacks got too bad for me to work. Before I started taking it, I was puking all the time.

But that's not what I'm here for. I have this incessant mental activity that will not shut up. I spend all day at work stressed out, sort of just panicking my way through the work day, using the momentum of it to not fall behind.

Then I come home. My brain is still overwhelmed, but my husband will probably want to watch a movie or something. But I'll dread it. The minute he turns on Netflix, my heart will sink. It's not that I don't want to, but it's so much work to sit there and watch something. I don't understand how it can be so exhausting.

There's so much noise. All the time. Someone's always talking to me. Something's always happening. Even if I sit in a room in silence, I feel like I don't have time to relax my brain because there's always something I need to worry about.

What is wrong with me? Is this an anxiety thing? I'm just so tired."
1509,I don't know what is wrong with me. Depression? Anxiety? Bipolar?,"I started seeing a mental health professional for depression and anxiety after noticing my breakdowns of crying and sadness were becoming more frequent if not ongoing and beginning to have suicidal ideations. I am currently taking 100mg of Zoloft daily for this and continuing to go to therapy. 

I thought it was helping because I used to have monthly/bi-monthly breakdowns of crying and sadness over seemingly nothing. Since starting Zoloft those meltdowns were pretty much gone, but I had one again yesterday and I just don't understand. 

I don't know what triggers it, I'll go from being perfectly fine and having a good time to overwhelmingly sad. Like everything hits me at once and I breakdown even though there is nothing specific I am sad about. 

Does anyone else have issues similar to this? I feel like maybe I could be bipolar because my mood changes so much over literally nothing but I don't want to self diagnose.

I also don't want to change my medication necessarily because it really has helped with my day to day anxiety, but I feel like I'm missing something here... I guess I just want to have something reasonable to ask my therapist about because I do feel better but things just still aren't right. Thank you for taking the time if you read this far. &lt;3"
1510,Do you have the time to listen to me whine?,"TL;DR: I’ve felt off since quarantine started, it’s also given me too much time in my head, so I’m overthinking A LOT and have now concluded that everyone hates me, this is mostly because I have 0 personality 

Quarantine has given me way too much time to think and spend time in my own thoughts, so this confession will probably sound stupid, but I need to get it off my chest anonymously (so I know how insane or normal this sounds) before I tell other people. 

Ever since quarantine started, I’ve felt off. I don’t know how else to describe it. I’m getting more sleep, but am more tired. I have more free time, but feel more anxious and stressed. I’ve felt emotionally numb in the past five weeks, at least more than usual. That being said, I can’t remember the last time I’ve ever felt an extreme emotion. I’m always just fine. My personality, which I’m now starting to debate the existence of, reflects that. I don’t really show much emotion. I don’t show excitement whatsoever, but I can’t even remember the last time I felt really excited to the point where I felt like I needed to jump up and down or scream at the top of my lungs. 

Like I mentioned before, I think my personality has disappeared from my life. I was never a super emotional person but I was more carefree. I thought I was more fun, but now that I’m writing this I remember that someone told me that my entire 5th grade class hated me. I can see that. Oh no embarrassing memories are comin back. My god help me. Anyway, I felt less anxious. But now, I feel like there’s a weight on me. Thinking of trying to dance sounds embarrassing, as does singing and all that stuff. Im too reserved. I’m not affectionate either, I can’t remember the last time I’ve hugged a friend or family member. Hugs just seem weird now. But maybe if I had one I’d change my mind, I don’t know anymore. I think if I turned into this affectionate person people would feel scared.

I have friends but no BFF or anything like that. I just recently started hanging out with people again. Before that I just stayed in my room for 2 years. Those couple days within the last few months have been fun. I’m afraid to ask them to hang out sometime though, because I feel like I’m always invited out of pity. I’m in a group, but the other 5 are super close and I got invited last minute. We were planning on doing something this month, but, y’know, corona virus. I feel like I’m the person someone will talk to until someone else walks in the room. I’m the backup friend. Also, I’ve never dated nor kissed anybody, I highly doubt know that no one has a crush on me and I don’t blame them. 

I feel like my lack of personality has caused people to hate me. I don’t know why, I just do. 
I probably have no personality because I have no confidence. I feel really insecure about everything. I’m ugly, I’m untalented, and boring. 

The only mental illness I have ever been diagnosed with is anxiety. I’ve never went to a therapist about it, nor have I ever taken anything for it. Apparently it’s super noticeable. A friend of mind pointed out how anxious i was and was asking if I was okay. I felt normal when she asked me this, or at least before she told me about it. It was my default mood, I never thought anything of it. 

Ive never considered harming myself or committing suicide, I just want to fast forward until I get to a better part of my life. Like college? Maybe?  (Yes I’m still in high school). Thankfully, I have never experienced anything traumatic. The only death close to me was my grandfather who passed away 4 years ago. It hurt then but I’ve accepted it. But that makes this all harder, I don’t know why I feel this way and how it started. 

Anyways, I doubt anyone will read this mess, but I need to start somewhere. Maybe somebody has felt the same? Someone have advice?"
1511,Urge to vomit to feel relief not guilt/food related,"Hi,

I was wondering if someone had similar experiences or knows a name for this ""condition"".

Sometimes I feel extremely anxious, upset or nervous and it makes me want to induce vomiting. As if all the stress and negative feelings would leave my body with making myself throw up.

I don't really think it's food related. Because these sensations don't occur after eating or overeating. 

The 1st time I felt like this was when a co-worker left our team and I felt sad she was leaving us and stressed because she could work really fast, so I was afraid it would have a very negative impact.

It doesn't always feel the same either...  
Sometimes all these negative feelings just keep building up in me, until I actually just feel physically nauseaus  
But sometimes its only emotional

Which in my heart, I know doesn't make sense. I heard that when you vomit, your body makes dopamine.... so maybe it's related to wanting to feel that?

I feel like I'm dealing pretty ok with this ipmulse/desire. Except for when I drink alcohol (and get upset/nervous) bc it also upsets my stomach and makes me more prone to give in to the desire to do this."
1512,This happen to anyone else?,"I’ve noticed when I get stressed, my speech reverts to that of more classical English. As I am a teen I would say my English is very modern, “teen speak” as to say. However when in states of stress or generally upset my language becomes more classical, perhaps this is a strange coping mechanism? Does anyone else experience this?"
1513,First time asking for help,"This is my first time posting and asking for help with something like this. For the longest time I have had this feeling that I dont belong and that people are just putting up with me or just using me as a fill in till something better comes along. I have always managed to hide and deal with it, but recently it has been putting strain on my relationship with my fiance. i come across as smothering her because i am scared of losing someone who so completes me. 

I'm trying to find ways to help deal with my self value and understanding. I am also working on trying to figure out ways to occupy my time and thus give her space to be herself.

thank you for any help with this."
1514,I’m not ok right now.," I’m not ok right now. 

The first time I felt like this I was 12. I had a very tumultuous childhood where we moved regularly, abuse and neglect had always been the norm. I lived in and out of this until I was in my early 20’s when I received help for the first time. While the therapy was amazing the medication had negative effects so it was a short lived reprieve. As a student I didn’t have the funds to continue the therapy so I set it aside and tried my best with a half full tool box to forge forward. Another 10 years go by while I bop around doctor to doctor looking for help and the answers all while wondering if there was something fundamentally wrong with me. I am outwardly put together, excited, energetic and positive but in the evening I am scared all the time mostly of myself. Then the way I feel at night sneaks into the day I replay conversations over and over for hours. I can’t focus while speaking to people as it is too loud in my head. I become distant, stop calling, fade away until I can ride this wave of extreme depression out. I hold onto hope that this wave will be over someday. When I’m back I come back strong, re-energized, and the life of the party. I make plans, I make up for all the time when I was away. I fill those days weeks and hours with everything I can as it feels so good not to hurt. When the mania subsides and the darkness comes again it is in full force no easing into it this time. There is silence and nothing but time to think about how the hurt inside is too much to continue. It only takes a day or two more and that hurt is so much I become desperate to make it stop. I don’t just feel it in my thoughts my whole body aches, my chest feels tight and it is hard to swallow. I feel it in every part of my body it all hurts. I still get up every day and do my best to not play the victim. I try to be normal, I shower, I eat, I work, I go outside, I walk my dogs, I take my antidepressants, I hug my daughter, I kiss my husband, I try to quiet the hurt down for another day. I realized mental illness is a disease and it's not my fault. But it doesn’t matter where the blame lies with this, I am the one taking the fall. Please be kind to each other during this time the added stress is too much for many of us."
1515,Recurring dreams,"I keep having these recurring dreams, they usually involve things that I want or that is wish to happen, the most common ones are dreams where I met some love interest, it’s always a different person, we talk and talk and talk and get along so well, in my dream they make feel the happiest a person can make another person feel. For once i feel loved, I had one of these dreams today just a minutes ago, I woke up and quickly checked my phone to see if she had texted me, only to remember it was a dream. This keeps happening, and every time I get pissed off it wasn’t real. This sounds stupid but, even though those dreams aren’t real, I genuinely feel like those people really understood me, I miss them. Why is this happening? Is my brain telling me something? How do I make it stop? I’m sick of waking up and being disappointed. Also idk if this is an important detail or not, but always in these dreams I’m not my age, for some reason it always takes place several years from now and I’m older, does this also mean something? I’m so confused."
1516,Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?,"My dad used a handgun and ended his life recently. I’ve found myself having to tell people my dad died a lot, but I am increasingly wanting to be honest with how it happened. Instead of saying “my dad died suddenly and unexpectedly,” I want to tell people “my dad died from suicide.”

This feels important to me. If we are more open about suicide, about mental health, maybe fewer dads or siblings or friends will die this way. 

I mentioned it to a coworker today who, after I said it, was suddenly in a rush to get off the phone with me. I feel bad for shocking him and don’t hold it against him if he didn’t want to talk to me anymore after that, but I don’t want to hide how my dad died and I want people to know suicide is a real possibility for some."
1517,Help me find Christopher,"I was surfing through Omegle live chat through shear boredom of being in isolation and came across this kid called Christopher. He’s a 21 year old lad from Sweden and he’s very heavily depressed and suicidal. We got to talking about his problems and I tried my upmost hardest to convince him to add me on any sort of social platform but just as he was about to add me he said his Aunt was coming and that he had to log off quick. I really won’t be able to live with myself knowing that I could’ve stopped him from taking his own life if I’d of said something about adding me on a social platform sooner. I need to know that Chris is ok so please please please whatever you do today, share this tweet so we can find Chris and make sure he’s okay. 75% of all suicides are committed by men and when I seen that figure I was shocked to my very core. Please help us find Chris."
1518,Heartbreak in the Apocalypse + Mental Health,"Hi all,

I guess I just needed an outlet to a place where maybe people see me at eye-level.  I have tele-therapy today, but somehow that feels different.  My friends, who I've since muted online notifications from on all apps, are coping so much better than I am with their spouses, families, and roommates, and that feels *different*.

I think this quarantine, like I'm sure for many on this sub, has widened that chasm between ""us"" and everyone else.

To frame some context into my life, I was sort-of broken up with a couple weeks before the quarantine.  It was my straight best friend/neighbor (which I would get piled-on and ridiculed for if I posted this in r/gay) who ended up admitting that he'd strung me along knowing that I cared for him more than he did for me, told me that he never loved me (even platonically), blamed our dynamic on me (which is partially true...but according to our community was a mutual force), and that he had pretended to care about me more than he did and pretended to be interested in future plans for trips and events for who knows how long.

It was brutal.  I had a suicide attempt that day and called off from work for a week to get myself together.

We used to talk everyday.  Open up about our most guarded secrets, we shared hobbies and interests no one else in our life would indulge us in.  We planned to survive the apocalypse together and because he had diabetes, his condition was something we had to account for.  We'd gone on one-on-one ""outings"" the past two Valentine's Day--drinks and dinner, go to concerts, go for jogs, watch movies, encourage each other's interests or hobbies.

But I would also get upset when he'd pull away and be overly-irritated when he was inconsiderate or rude to me and thus, we fought more than friends should.  We've had extended falling outs over us ""being too close"".  He often said he felt like he was addicted to me and would resent me because he'd choose to spend time with me over his other friends or pursue romantic relationships with women.  Additionally, his parents were not big fans of me and questioned him on what it would look like when we are out and about.

After a couple of days, I miraculously began to heal from the hurt.  I felt a sense of relief to be free of something that wasn't real (although I struggled with my own perceptions of reality).

Then the quarantine hit.  I was stuck with my thoughts, with his energy just a few feet away.  It was truly fine at first.  He traveled, against county recommendations, presumably to his parents for a  week.  I cautiously texted him to make sure he was okay, but we both kept our language aloof and impersonal.

As the weeks have rolled on, I've dreamt about him every night.  Vivid, intense dreams that seem brighter than any waking day experience.  We've had overcast skies, often rampaging storms multiple days in a row.  The quick onset of trauma has made me question too, is this whole Coronavirus pandemonium yet another fabrication in my head?  To verify one way or another, I go down a newspaper-lined rabbit hole until my mind is totally numb from *data*.

I've worried about him and so many others with immuno-compromising conditions in my life.  I constantly feel his ghost in the only quarters I can inhabit and the only thing I can do to keep myself from reaching out to him is to relive the hurt of our last meet.  I feel both needy for company, but resistant to it.  Desperate for connection, but growingly terrified of even getting the opportunity again once the shelter-in-place restrictions are lifted.

The first few weeks of quarantine I really learned to appreciate my own company, and now I despise it.  I despise *me* more than I ever have, never felt more deserving of an isolation I can't escape from.

So I've since cut off all notifications and only communicate through my work e-mail.  I deleted every trace of my former friend's number so I'll never be tempted to contact him.  And now I really don't know where to go from here."

They also don't want me to have any electronics at all. Your probably still thinking thats no reason to kill yourself. The thing is I hate my life it's garbage for reasons I don't wanna say up here because that be paragraphs possibly pages long and the only light in it was having a iPhone now I have to use a TracFone. The only way I can get another iPhone is saving up until Christmas and maybe even up to my birthday which makes it minimum 9 months and max 11 before I can get another one.right now I'm so depressed I'm not gonna eat today and very much just thinking about ending it.

1523,How to be mentally strong?,"Hey guys. I've been trying to recover from my past terrible experiences. So recently I thought to myself that I should overcome my fears. 

I decided to force and torture myself by watching some disturbing movies. I watched the disturbing movie of all time. I do not regret watching it but I got mentally disturbed. 

I thought torturing myself will help me overcome my fears and take everything normal but I've decided not to torture myself anymore. 

I envy my friends sometimes because they take don't things seriously and carry on with their work but I use those things seriously and think about it most of the time. I'm even scared that those crap thoughts will ruin some good memories when I think about it.

I'm writing stories and reading books but still, I'm not improving mentally. I just want to know how to take things normally.

1525,Young narcissist,"Hi guys,

I am **16 years old** and I had recently taken [**this test**](https://psychcentral.com/cgi-bin/narcissisticquiz.cgi). I was just curious, what will be my score. I had taken the test and I had scored **38 out of 40** (higher the score, more narcissistic you are, test say that narcissists score over 20). Later when I had retake test to be sure that there wasn't error, I took more time, I tried to put some questions to translator. I got 40/40, I was answering completely honest as I see world.

I **didn't even know** I was narcissistic; I thought my behaviour was normal, absolutely healthy. What's I would say is even worse, is that, I don't see any bad thing about my behaviour. I think if someone doesn't act as I do, they are less of human, because they don’t use every opportunity. They don't use manipulation for their good. They don't fight conflicts via other people, make them fight and you watch. I am angry when I am not leader in any sort of group, when it happens, I refuse to cooperate, because I know always and everything best and if I would helpful, still the leader would get positive attention not me. I like to yell at other people when they don't do exactly to the last point, what I said them to do. My life goal isn't something exact, I only want to be CEO of huge company and have many people under me, who I would command and rule over them (I didn't write rule by mistake, I mean it). Maybe some of you would say that this is psychopathic behaviour from book. But as I said **see this completely normal**.

I don't see that my behaviour is wrong, but I know it's bad because every everyone tells that Narcissistic behaviour is bad. Maybe take into account that I am young and this is MAYBE just phase. (but I would say my behaviour had shifted minimally). I still don't know, if I am narcissistic (wasn't officially diagnosed) but I think test said a lot and many of you in comments will tell me that this is definitely narcissistic.

So maybe I **would like to ""cure""** from this disorder, disease. But I want to know w**hy is this considered disease** and why should I **change my behaviour.** Finally, how would **I cure from this.**

Remember I realized there could be mistake and I want to make something about it. Hope you can help me."

I don't mean loneliness in terms of feeling that there is nobody who love and care about you but i mean When it becomes very difficult to isolate myself for a while. I am always checking my phone and waiting for someone to talk to me. 

 I don't know if it is because this quarantine makes me feel that I am losing connection with the outside world or because I have a self-control problem. I have been thinking of shutting off my phone for a while to stop all this problem of losing control over myself, I am still afraid this might worsen it more though."
1528,Socialy Broken,"Hello M18 here :)
My name is Tom and i have a real Problem with Talking to Others, like my Family. I feel like i cant connect to them and i often dont even Approche them anymore, like i dont fucking want to. But they dont Understand that, they just say stuff like.

""Ah thats Tom, dont worry he was always like that""

And then i feel shit about myself cus i tell myself, i cant even talk with them. 

I was Diagnosed with Depression with 17 but dont take any Pills or stuff because i feel like i dont want get addicted to that, i want myself to break free of this Cicle of Trying, failing, feeling shit, REPEAT.

with Friends i can talk about stuff that REALLY Intresstes me, like normal Teenage Stuff.

But with Parents i feel left out, almost that none of my Family even want me. It Hurts really Bad i dont fucking know what to do. Im a Loser overall, i never acomplished things, have bad grades in School, and have kind of everything you would descripe as an AntiSocial Person, im the most AntiSocial Person ive ever Met. I have really big troubles with handling emotions and thought, they get really Difficult after Time. They stick like Glue in my Head. Everything ever sayed or done to me, is kind of part of me. 

Honestly i have Thought about Suicide way to much.
Like someone say,""wow you gained a little to much Weight, you should lose some""
And now its Glued to my head always saying to myself, Dont eat that! Because if you do, other people wont like you!""

I dont know what to do anymore. I really dont wanna even exist at this piont, i wish i was never born in this World. If only i could erase eveything that links to my existins. That is a Thought i think about everyday.

Its impossible for me to feel ""Happy"" and ""Satisfited""
Im always in a ""hm ok idk"" mood or in a ""fck this world, fck everyone, no one understands me""

Im really inscecure about my hole fucking LiFe!

Im Miserbale at everything and never did anything in this World, nobody wants me to exist, myself included.

I just wanna end it all."
1529,"Struggling, considering drugs","I'm not a happy guy. Never have been. I live up in a household with an emotionally manipulative mom who drinks too much wine and a dad who was physically there but may as well be a brick wall. They have a dog and he is their kid, I guess. I am just in the way. I get yelled at, hit sometimes, everything is always my fault and I am never good enough. I guess I'm always going to carry that through life.

I've never been good at dealing with emotions. I shut down or I ignore them. Sometimes I want to die, but I'm still here because I'm a coward as well. I think a lot of people can relate to that.
The problem is is I'm vulnerable. I'd form a habit, be it alcohol, drugs or cigarettes if it gave me five minutes of not feeling like I'm a freak wearing someone else's skin who will never amount to anything until the day I die. So I say no. I don't know why. But I've said no so many times people stopped asking.

Whenever I'm offered a drink or a smoke or a hit of whatever, I say no. I make up some bullshit excuse and say no, and I usually lie and say I'm straight edged so they'll leave me alone. It's okay. Still a lie though.

But that's what I am. A liar. I like to square my shoulders and pretend to know what I'm doing.

I'm transgender. I can't come out because of home life and I think I'm depressed as well. I don't know. Even if I was, I'm not allowed to go see a doctor (even though I live in the UK and it's free) because like I said my parents are not... great with my mental health. Last time I asked for help they laughed at me. That shattered my confidence. I'm a few years away from moving out but I have the same freedom as a toddler. They stalk my social media, check my phone, scroll through all my chats and go through my rubbish. I'm writing this on an old phone I'm supposed to have thrown away. And yet we still maintain the appearance of a totally normal family. I don't think my family is normal.

So I don't cope well. I'm not going to kill myself- psyched myself out of that so I guess that's a plus (?)- but I still don't want to be here and I don't really have any healthy coping mechanisms.

And that leads me to drugs and such.

I've always told myself I'd never go that low. But recently my resolve has started to crack and I'm not proud. I have no friends at all. I'm completely isolated. I call 'myself the loneliest whale in the ocean' if I'm being poetic. Which I'm not, because it's pretentious. Music is my only outlet and it just isn't enough against this absolutely crushing weight.

I started looking for ways to get a hold of tranquilizers. I know I'm so sick of feeling, but I also hope that I'm not always going to feel like this. And I know if I start I'll probably regret it. It's just a matter of not starting.

How do I stop myself?"
1530,I don’t like the person I’m becoming,"I had a pretty good system in place to manage my mood swings, depression, anxiety, OCD, suicidal thoughts, etc. 

I understand everyone’s world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19, but I am struggling so much right now, and don’t like the person I’m becoming because of it.

I’m difficult to be around or talk to, my highs and lows are all over the place, I feel out of touch with reality and the only thing that makes things bearable are a combination of drugs/alcohol. 

Before this, I was sober for a month. I wasn’t purposefully sober, but I’ve struggled with substance abuse in the past and found a middle ground of self control. After my sober streak though, I honestly considered becoming sober full time. I was the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been and I could see things clearly.

Now it feels like I’m at rock bottom again, the pain of everything crashing down feels unbearable. I don’t know what to do. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, not this time. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I feel like I’m crazy.

I don’t know..."
1531,Up and down (patterns?),"Up and down

Does anyone have a theory or observation about the general “rollercoaster” pattern in life’s moments- I’ve been working on myself- and now is a time of social distances so I understand that’s a lag - however I’ve been working through ways I’ve been hurting myself in relationships and I’d like to stop being sad about the ones that semi previously ended upsettingly - then I thought had a general guideline been observed- they say 8 months to get over torn relationships for me it’s been a year to be ok- ( if this factor is relative to ur theory ) I would think it may be due to varying people types - tho it seems to be agreed the universe has its own agenda/ timeline which we interact with- so has anyone seen the universes timed shifts- I would think it’s least varying compared to individuals and their vast temperaments and experiences- does anyone contest this not possible I’d love to hear! Is there any books or poems or films or songs or artwork that touch on this is love to absorb- I just really want the chance to make better relationships again because I miss everyone- so I’m just looking for a sage!"
1532,Guilt and Sexuality,"I'm struggling with guilt that I deal with after masterbation and I want to stop masterbating entirety. To be clear, I don't consider myself addicted to masterbating, I watch porn/masterbate around once or twice every 2 weeks or so. I go through periods of being sexually active and periods of being completely uninterested in anything sexual. After masterbating I'm always left feeling disgusted and mad at myself for wasting time on something that doesn't even make me feel good afterwards. When I'm in a period of sexuality I can't control myself and even turn to things like Omegle so that I can have an experience with strangers. It absolutely disgusts me that I could do something like that, I never considered myself to be a sexual or crude person and I feel immense guilt when I'm around other people who are more innocent than me. I feel like I lost my innocence and there's no way to get it back. Once I've done disgusting things I can't undo them. I want to enjoy my youth and have good social experiences, not just sexual ones.

So, my question to Reddit is this: How do I stop doing things I'm ashamed of, and once I do, how do I move on and stop carrying the guilt from it? I want to be a better person and I came here for help. Also if it helps in any way I'm an 18 year old male. Thanks everyone."
1533,Not suicidal but wish I was never born,I am NOT suicidal but I wish I was simply never born. I don’t see why it’s fair that I have to work and suffer and work harder to suffer less.

For all of those going through tough times, know that it will get better. If you carry on and don’t give up, you will feel so much better.

Your well being. Yourself! I love you. You are important. ❤️ Don’t give up. Not just yet. For there is hope everywhere. As long as someone believes, there is always going to be *hope*."
1535,Quitting my job,"I feel like my job is too much for my mental health and I can't take it anymore. For the first week or so, I was really happy to go to work, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me. But, the more I'm working, the more I hate my job because I'm always having panic attacks, my bosses don't understand that my mental health is not the best and they kinda treat me like my health isn't important. I've worked 8 days in a row, when I asked to work only 3 days a week.

Should I quit my job? It's just too much for me right now"

I manage most of this pretty well and work full time and also have lots of interests. One of the issues which is bothering me at the moment is that sometimes socially I feel like a rabbit in the headlights. If I am having a one-to-one conversation with somebody it is like standing in gale force winds, like there is just a huge tidal wave of information blasting me and I find it really overwhelming like I can’t escape and I’m rooted to the spot. Does anybody else experienced this? Is it a common experience and if so is there a particular name for it?"

1538,Does joking about an insecurity/slight trauma help the person suffering from it? Or is it worse off?,"To keep it simple:

Let's say my bestfriend is insecure of being fat, does joking about it help him overcome his insecurity?

Joke goes like: ""Yeah i'm not gonna be friends with you anymore cause you're fat"" sarcastically  
Not like: ""omg you're so fat no wonder you can't get a girlfriend"" type jokes... 

only jokes relating to me and him. I wouldn't wanna make jokes that could really hurt him. Any ideas how joking about a certain insecurity/trauma might help someone? or does it not?"
1539,Help?,"Hey so my friend lives in the UK and I live in the US. She has depression (not diagnosed but it's obvious) and cuts sometimes but she's trying to stop. It's hard for me to be there for her since I live on the other side of the world but I try. She really needs professional help but is a minor and her parents aren't really supportive. She's tried talking to them about it but always gets shut down and/or yelled at, they're the type that don't really believe in mental illness and stuff. I'm pretty sure they know she cuts as her dad brought it up off-handedly at one point but I don't know if they know for sure. It's hard for me to know the entire situation as, like I said, I'm on the other side of the world. We've been best friends for years and I worry about her. Is there a way she can get professional help online in the UK as a minor without parental consent? She's homeschooled too so she never really gets to leave her home, not just during the pandemic."
1540,I don’t know if I have BPD,"I don’t know if I have BPD

Hello! I am diagnosed with CPTSD and for 3 months I have been having this thought that I might have BPD which is making me really scared as I know is a personality disorder which is very hard to live with. My therapist is saying that I don’t have it, only some BPD tendencies. To give you some examples as of what I think are BPD symptoms: for example, when someone tells me “goodbye” in a cold manner, I get this fear of abandonment or rejection. But the thing is that I tell myself :”this is your fear of abandonment, maybe they are in a rush or something” and this calms me down. Another thing I have is this black and white thinking but not with persons, it’s more with ideas. “I am either perfect or I am not perfect”. But I can control it. Like I realise that I’m doing it and see in between. My therapist is telling me that due to the fact that I worry too much about hurting people is a sign I don’t have BPD. When I broke up with my boyfriend I didn’t move on fast as a person with BPD might do, or is it a stereotype? Sorry for my English mistakes, I’m not native. What do you think? Thank you!"

1542,DID or not DID,"My husband mentioned something to me the other day about something I said a few days ago. He explained to me the exact time and place and what was happening before and after I said something of cruel nature. I am a kind person. I am a humanitarian and animal lover. I am an empath and it kills me to hurt someone else's feelings. So this was completely out of character for me, which is why he confronted me with it. The thing is, I don't remember saying it. I remember the few minutes before but I have no recollection of the moment, and moments shortly after, he was referring to. He informed me that that is not the first time something like that has happened either. I decided to ask my mom and she said she does recall hundreds times the same thing happened while I was with her, spanning almost a decade. My sister as well. Then I asked my best friend who I see nearly every day (not lately though) and have seen for the past 3 years. I believe this is linked to my mood disorder, and that it may be something deeper than just mood swings. Just for some background, I have struggled with depression, ADHD, PTSD and anxiety my whole life. I don't want to labelled as crazy, even though plenty people have called me that in my 26 years of life."
1543,"Ive been feeling realy bad lately, and have been experiencing some scary stuff.","Hi, thank you for reading this. I'm 18, male, if any of this matters. Ive been strugling with depression and insomnia for about 6 years now. I'm not self diagnosed either, I went to a doctor. She didn't describe me any meds, and the only meds I'm on are for allergies and some vitamins. Nothing extra.

About a year ago I started experiencing visions of suicide. No, I'm not talking about just the thought of suicide. I'm literaly day-dreaming about it. Even when I'm not depressed. I can hear myself scream alot too. These visions come out of nowhere usualy. A few weeks ago I started talking to myself. It's always this dialogue: 
""-What do you want to do?
- I wanna die."" .... and that's it. Nothing else, just these 2 sentences. 
Oh, almost forgot to mention, I can also hear my brain ""click"". I can't realy explain this, but it's a realy loud click, and sometimes it even hurts.
All of these might sound random or dumb, maybe even fake, but these are realy starting to concern me."
1544,Anyone here take Vraylar to treat symptoms of bipolar depression?,I’ve just recently started taking Vraylar. It makes me sick to my stomach when I take it every other day. Does anyone experience this? Should I keep trying to take the medicine? I’ve tried just about every mood stabilizer there is and none of them have worked for me. This is my last medicine before the doc puts me on lithium.
1545,Slight weapon obsession,"So. This will sound really weird, and I dont know if this is the right place for this. But I want to talk about it because im unsure and this is the only place I could really fit this  as far as I know. So I really like weapons and their backstories and such but recently ive gotten the urge to make some myself. Not to hurt others or myself, but just cuz it in my head its really cool. But im scared of the idea of making one. Im scared that when I have it I will snap or something and do horrible things. But it just keeps popping up in my mind and its hard to ignore. I dont think there will be anyone here who has experience with that but I just wanted to ask for advice and what other people think of it."
1546,I’m changing and I’m not sure I like it.,"So, in case you can’t tell by my name, I’m big into music. It’s my passion and it’s what I had planned on doing as a career. Well, except I wanted to be on the teaching side of it.

Throughout school, music was always what I would look forward to. The only class that got me excited. This year things have changed. At the beginning things got rough for me, and they still are. If you’re interested in that (which I doubt you are), you can check out some of my older posts. Anyway, for some reason music has become less of a pleasure for me. 

I know people grow out of hobbies, but that isn’t what this is. I mean, I don’t mind playing it that much, but the classes, the people, my friends, it just sounds so awful to me. I guess the class is bad because I hate the idea of having to interact with people nowadays. I don’t want to talk to friends. In fact they just seem to annoy me all the time now, and it’s not like they have changed. 

Things got messed up with my college plans too. I got accepted to a 4 year college, but the plans for me going there are messed up, and I would have to transfer from a community college. 

Sure I was upset at first, but now it’s like I don’t care. It’s not like I’m upset about it anymore. It sucks but I’m over it. Part of me though doesn’t even care about college. I’m considering “forgetting” to defer and not even accepting their enrollment offer. Again, it’s not even because I’m upset. I literally just don’t care. I was pursuing my dream job, and now I don’t care about my dream job. I don’t care about getting a job. I don’t care about having a decent living. I don’t care about school anymore. I don’t care about myself. Heck, I can barely even laugh or joke around anymore. I can fake it around family, but with others it doesn’t happen."
1547,"How can I get my parents to understand the magnitude of certain triggers and their affect on myself, my behavior and my rationalization/ thought process.","A few years ago I went through an awful ordeal, I don’t want to get overly detailed but the bottom line is that I was raped. This was one of the darkest times of my life, for many reasons. The situation itself, “friends” not believing me, and my workplace taking his side because it didn’t happen on company property. I had to take a paycut just to get moved off the same shift as my rapist, which was the most infuriating and heartbreaking experiences of my life. 
The rape itself was obviously horrendous, traumatizing, and has left lasting damage on many aspects of my life. 

What bothers me at this point, is that my parents aren’t at all thinking about the thing that happened to me, 3.5 years ago now, and they make really insensitive jokes and remarks in relation or rape/unwanted advances/etc. 

I carry a lot of weight in my heart feeling so wronged, feeling like justice for me will never come, and when it feels like everyone is forgetting something that I have to think about daily, it is just so isolating. It makes me want to crawl up In the fetal position on a snowy mountain cave"
1548,Is It Possible This is a Side Effect of My Antidepressants? Really Messes with My Self-Confidence.,"My face is retaining water to the my cheeks are really really puffy. It is not severe allergic reaction level like someone eating shellfish thats allergic, it's primarily in my cheeks and makes me hate smiling and have self-confidence issues. And it is 100% not fat gain, because my weight is only 7 pounds different from before and after the anti-depressants. Only thing that makes it confusing is that I don't have a guaranteed time stamps of photos of when this started arising. People just started mentioning how you so skinny but your cheeks look like you ate way way too much salt. I've been on low carb diet, I've restricted my sodium, and I've had the typical family doctor blood work and nothing changes or is abnormal about my bloodwork. It is 100% water retention because I can just feel it and whenever I sweat a ton it goes down or do keto those extremely flush your body of water so naturally its going to come out everywhere even water below the skin.

1550,"I (15M) am ""dying"" inside, but have received no true help, or even validation, for the past 6 years","I am a 15 year old boy with high functioning autism, ADHD, anxiety, depression, etc.

Everyone around me who has had an influence in my life (parents, teachers, coaches, therapists, peers, etc.) has always pushed off my feelings as just attention seeking pity parties. Every time I tell someone, especially in my family, that I feel worthless or something like it, they always say something like ""We aren't going down this rabbit hole/spiral again"". I can't take criticism because that's all people do to me, a compliment towards me where that person means it might as well be one in a million, I can't trust anyone because I feel like they will betray me in some way, and I am terrified of any slight raise in someone's voice, to the point where I avoid any and every situation where that could happen. This has been the case for the past six years, maybe even longer.

Even worse, I have tried to kill myself many times, especially in middle school where the blatant criticisms of everything I did were at an all-time high, but I haven't succeeded due to fear of what might happen after death.

Things have gotten slightly better after I got out of middle school, but I still fear of the next time when someone close to me starts attacking me, mainly verbally, out of seemingly nowhere.

My family says they love me, but I can't even trust that claim.

And for all I know, once I post this, I am just going to be berated by hate and destructive criticism because that's all I have ever known."

1555,Feeling frozen after upsetting period of time?,"I have a history of anxiety and depression, but what I'm dealing with now is really hard to understand. I was in a high stress situation for over a week, trying to care for someone who was very mentally unwell. It took a huge toll on me and ever since I have been kind of floating by. I just don't feel connected to myself or what's around me, and I'm like, half way present for my responsibilities. It's really hard for me to keep up with school and I just feel like I'm half way depressed, and half way dissociated? I don't know how to understand this or cope to move forward. I have constant anxiety about classes and I half try and am in a perpetual state of catch up. I keep thinking that I'll eventually snap into my senses but it hasn't happened yet. It's getting better each day but, for the longest while it was so hard for me to do the most basic of things. Another thing is that the situation with the person I was caring for didn't have a positive ending. I was trying to find them help and they ended up going to an unhealthy environment. Any advice?"
1556,I'm afraid I'll get addicted to self-harm,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this kind of stuff, but seems so, so here I go.

So yeah. I am a 15 year old boy, and I haven't hurt myself in a way that leaves a mark yet, but I have noticed a pattern.  I, in the past, have scratched up my arm, sometimes bitten it too. Nothing too bad, the worst was a bit of bleeding that stopped after seconds. But lately, when I have something like a pen in my hand, maybe a pencil, I sometimes start just, poking my hand with it. And I have gotten used to that, but because of quarantine, I am always at home, and I have a knife on hand. 

I am constantly playing with it, and I have started to scratch myself with it, poke my hand, legs, stomach, and while in the beginning I was afraid to do all of that, sometimes even my face and near my eyes. I sometimes do it unintentionally, without even noticing it. I just after a while have a sensation, that something's there. I don't know if it's good or not, but I feel it. 

I do, pretty often have that, like, sense of anxiety that you get. You know what it feels like to be in sleep paralysis? Yeah, like that. I won't call it anxiety, because it's not diagnosed, I just feel it pretty often.

 I, in the past, barely got enough sleep to function, it's a bit better now because of quarantine, but sometimes I am still pretty tired. 

I also have a friend that I am pretty close to, that I barely meet, so I know I could reach out to her for help, but that would be very selfish of me, because she has way, way worse in her life. The reason I mention her, is because when she was basically what she thought was the end for her, she still tried to help me, because she thought I had issues. I told her no, I don't, and had a pretty good feeling she might not be ok. She was suicidal. (I use past tense because she isn't anymore, not because, you know.) But after some thinking, and looking at everything, I came to the conclusion that I might be a sadist. I was disgusted with myself, and had other feelings I can't put into words.

But after some more thinking, I realized I might be a masochist. So I am into some, pretty extreme sexual stuff, I won't say what exactly, but if you look through my profile you can find it. It's a way of causing yourself pain without it leaving a mark, or damaging your genitalia.

I did once put the knife away because I was scared I would do something. So yeah, that's my story. I am afraid the poking and scratching will spiral into a cut, into another, and another. What should I do?"
1557,Plane crash dream/flight anxiety/depression,"Currently I am in Hawaii staying with my father and his wife. Originally I was afraid to get on the flight to Hawaii because Right after I bought my plane ticket I was watching this movie called Richie rich and there was a scene in it where the parents are killed in a plane crash. I’m always trying to find meaning in things so I thought Of this as a sign. Ok so I eventually took the flights and now I’m here. Since being here I had a dream that I was kind of in the same situation as what happened in the movie, except we were over water, and I did not die but I was in the cockpit of the plane with 2 pilots. The plane crashes over water and everything in the dream is so precise I even had a feeling that the plane would fill up with water in approximately 10 seconds. 
I kept getting affirmation in my dream that this was just a dream and that I was not actually going to die. But it still lurks in my mind just because the only means of me getting back to Miami is by means of taking a plane. Funny because I would have been ok with having this dream if I were anywhere other than the middle of the ocean. -_-. Is there anything I can do to help ease my anxiety induced because of this dream? Or any advice someone can give me? It’s really ruining my whole trip. Please help."
1558,Quarantine making things much worse,"Hey all, so I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was in high school (25 now). I’ve been to multiple therapists over the years and they never seem to work for me. I always feel like they’re judging me and I can’t tell them exactly how I feel. I’ve never been one to be open about my emotions with anyone really. It’s put a lot of strain on my personal relationships and has caused a few girlfriends to leave and has caused me to be more distant from many of my friends. 

Normally I go through periods where I’ll be fine, get sorta bummed out by day to day stuff but nothing too extreme and then I’ll get into a sort of funk where for days or weeks or even months I’ll just be so fucking depressed I have zero drive to do anything. I won’t get out of bed to do anything other than go to work or surf. I’ll barely eat and I’ll just lock myself in my room and sleep like 12+ hours a day for a few days if I don’t have work. 

Now normally to get myself outta this headspace I go out and I surf, hike, ride my bike along the beach, skateboard, golf, really anything outdoors. But being in San Diego they’ve essentially banned all of that due to the current pandemic. Closed all beaches, trails, parks, skateparks, boardwalks, golf courses etc. I’ve also lost my job so have absolutely no reason to get up. I feel like an absolute piece of crap for doing nothing all day but then at the same time I have zero desire to do anything. 

Up until a few days ago I was doing okay. Bummed as hell about the restrictions but able to get up and do some workouts in my house and get outside to ride my bike around the streets. But then over the past few days I can just feel myself getting more and more depressed and I don’t know what to do. I don’t see this pandemic going away anytime soon and I feel like we’re in for about 4 more months of restrictions where it might even get worse. 

So I guess the reason for writing this is to see if anyone else is feeling the same way and if so how are you guys coping? 

Some ideas I’ve thought for myself are 
1. Cut out alcohol and drugs from my life. I already know that’ll help. 
2. Try and maintain some form of routine.
3. Try and find small tasks to do to keep myself occupied, eg. clean the house, clean my room. really anything to keep my mind busy

Anyways thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this. Any suggestions are welcome and if anyone’s in a similar boat I’ve got open ears for you."

1561,My bf is glad to feel bad emotions,"Hello guys, recently my boyfriend (23y) is being really irritated, pissed off and not very nice to closed people and I don't know how to talk to him. He changed his opinions and values (change is ok but these don't seem to be logical and profitable at all). 

Today he told me that most of the time he feels absolutely nothing. The only time he has emotions is when he is harming someone (emotionally, no violence). And he doesn't care it's bad behavior because he is glad he feels at least something. And it's better than emptiness. 

Please, have you ever experienced this or could you give me some advice? I don't think it's that bad because he likes playing pc games or talking some IT stuff or making music. Or at least that's what I see. Thank you very much and stay safe."

I constantly blame myself for everything bad that happens to me. It's like I attract shitty things. I feel like everyone hates me, judges me or just don't see me.

I used to hang out with my brother's friends but they never treated me like a friend, more like just luggage that my brother draged around. I'm 18 now and have no friends of my own, I was just starting to get to know some people at school and I hoped it would develop into friendship but now the country is in lockdown and it looks like I may not see them again, because this is my senior year. And to make things worse, even when I am around people it usually doesn't make me feel better. Seeing people with their friends having a good time just makes me feel more disclouded and jealous. I'm very introverted so it's much easier for me to be alone, but I still feel like I'm missing out on life. Even though it might be hard for me I think friendships would be rewarding and beneficial to my mental state.

Nearly every day following, I would fear for my life. Every time I saw Ray they would tell me about all the ways that they would kill someone, every time we went out to play after lunch Ray would either try to hurt me, hurt someone else, or would talk about all of the demons in their head; The 'demons' were telling them to kill me. I was so scared, all of the time. It was to the point where when I saw them I would just freeze and let them hurt me, because I knew that it keep them from hurting anyone else. I remember that they brought a dagger with them once. I spent so long in this environment where I was prey, that the stress responses leaked into the rest of my life; I flinch whenever someone so much as raises a hand near me, I can't handle people touching the top of my head because of the time Ray went to pat my head and tore out a chunk of my hair, I apologize for everything in anticipation of some sort of violent retaliation.  
  

Thank you, Ray, for my anxiety."

1569,Mental health got worse as I got older,I was just thinking I remember when I was younger I was so happy I mean I got sad sometimes or anxious but I don’t remember it being as bad as it is now I am currently 20 years old now. Does anyone feel this way?
1570,Insecurity,"I don't know if this can be classified of anxiety or if it has any other name, but when I was younger I have been diagnosed with serious depression and anxiety. Years off any kind of treatment, I still have ""glimpses"" of depression and I have what I consider to be anxiety  (I may be wrong), that reflects even on my use of social media.
Let me give you some examples: I follow people, then I feel stupid for following them and I unfollow them; other example is that I feel that I follow a huge amount of people or, here, subreddits, then I unfollow. This makes me feel stupid and I follow them again... and this is with almost everything in my life. Am I alone with such behavior and feelings?"
1571,"Anxiety, Depression but maybe more?","\[I am a 18 year old Male in the UK\] So, for about 18 months now I have been struggling with anxiety and depression, with some months being the usual and some months being very hard. I started with **propranolol** to help sleep and panic less. I had regular phone-call therapies, fortnightly. and then in say July 2019, I was told (in a phone call) I would be moved onto higher intensity face-to-face therapy. Come round to February 2020 and NO word from the NHS Health in Mind organisation thing. So i go to my Doctor, as the anxiety had been getting bad, due to exam pressure, future career / education worries and home life. So i get prescribed **sertaline** which i was to take for 4 weeks and get more and a check up, also Dr gives me numbers for mental health service I am supposed to get help from. However, I am an idiot and too anxious to call them, idk what i would say or do?? also i didnt book the appointment after 4 weeks because of the corona outbreak, and procrastination so i have stopped taking the pills, not really feeling any different though. I am having issues at the moment with my thoughts. I think about suicide multiple times a day, but not as in a bad way, more as of an escape, or ease of stress. I barely go downstairs to eat because i am in a house hold of 5 (including me) and only speak to my father, the rest are his wife and her kids, and i dont like being seen by them. at least until dinner. i feel whenever i get food around my step mother shes going to be mad and tell my dad that im useless or something because i haven't got a job (quit my last one because of panic attacks and crying all the time). its always been a battle between whose kids are better and i dont want to dissapoint my dad. i dont know why im even posting here, if you've made it this far, thanks. it feels good to tell the story straight and have the time to think about what i want to say. ANYWAY the reason im posting: i think about my future career and how hopeless i am and it sends me into a dark rabbit hole of thoughts and fears, and i occupy myself, usually playing games to help, but procrastinate. or whenever i think about past traumatic things. i dont really tell people much because i never know how to get it out, so this is  my best attempt. My mind is all over the place, self isolation - i dont mind it tbf im a useless human any way. sleeping is screwed. barely eating or exercising. ""friends"" are cunts. ah dear. suicide is a constant thought, but not a scary one. I ovbiously got people that care about me so my suicide wouldnt benefit them, it would be selfish on my behalf. i honestly wish i got hit by a car or something quick and painless that wouldnt make my family hate me."
1572,struggling to cope with my new temporary job,"I was transferred two weeks ago from being a busser to doing janitorial work following the issue of a state wide stay at home order. The work is slow, easy, but its disgusting and horrible. people are disgusting and ever since a specific incident I am physically ill every day after work, my cheeks get bright red, I feel weak and I come down with a fever. I have a better job that I should be starting soon but I dont know how much more I can handle. I have a history of giving myself mini heart attacks from stress. Ive never gone into cardiac arrest but Ive been trying to deal with my stress so I dont put unnecessary strain on my body. My doctor is out on maternity leave and my fill in doctor doesnt listen, she told me to take my wellbutrin, which i stopped taking because it worsens my anxiety and im not depressed. Its hard to talk to people in my life about feeling ill because of whats going on and nobody will interact with me while i look feverish, I understand why its just upsetting that they wont listen. So I guess I just wanted to vent where people wouldnt be afraid of me"
1573,"Hello, i need an advice.","I would like to start with apologizing for my next grammar mistakes. 
I am 22 years old. And i never felt empathy towards anyone. I know what lust is, hatred, fear, anxiety. But i think i do not know what it is to be happy, and what love is.
I was in army, and after i came back, i do think i changed. I started to feel slight positive emotions. And i realised that life can really be better. But still that change brought me overwhelming negative emotions. I feel guilty about not being good enough. I feel my parents hate me for everything i have done. I feel they are not proud of me enough. I feel like i have no friends., and i never did. I watch them meet, talk laugh. But its like im watching from behind the window.I fell so broken sometimes i literally have no strength to stand up. But after those breakdowns, i feel really better. Its like bipolar. But when im broken i start crying and laughing , both. I don't want to laugh. Its scares me. 
I don't want to be mentally ill person, i want to live a good life. But deep inside i know i want to be mentally ill, i don't know why, culture and fashion on depression perhaps. And suicidal thoughts and plans. I was really close to it.
I've had several online tests saying i have a borderline personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsion disorder (?) and depression.
I'm writing this because I'm confused about myself. I know i am not stupid. I know i am handsome guy. I feel girls watch on me. My ex said she doesn't know why i picked her, thought she isn't good enough for me. But i constantly seeking a confirmation. I trying to prove to myself i am able to do everything and have what i want, manipulate people to do things i want, and set them against each other. 
I feel like i have another person in my head, who is not me. Who wants to be some version of The Joker.

I am seeking for help now. But i am very afraid to find out i cannot be helped. That my life is a half of its actual potential. I really want to feel like you do. Stop pretending and be me. 

So i wanted to ask. How desperate you were before visiting a doctor ? What your life became after ? Do you think if i tell this story to my close friends theyll understand? Is there a medicine can help me ? 
How to find a good doctor who is really interested in his work ?"
1574,I’m not sure if I have paranoia,"Since I was little, I always thought there was someone behind me when there isn’t. I even believed that there was someone behind my wardrobe, and was really scared. Even up to now, I can only sleep with my back to the wall. I cannot sleep if I face the wall, as I constantly think someone is behind me. This feeling gets worse when I’m alone and in the dark. It even gets me when I play video games. I get stressed when I hear footsteps in game. When revising at home alone, I cannot concentrate if my back is towards a door or corridor. From what I found on the internet, I’m certain I have paranoia, but I cannot be sure. I don’t think a psychologist is an option yet, so I came here looking for help"
1575,I'm done.,"Hello everyone,

I don't know where to start. But what I know that in this post will be many bad words.

I'm lost, I'm fucking empty and disappointed. If everything bad you can only imagine.

How did I ended up here? Why I feel this way? Why, why, why... The question I ask but never get a response.

Today, someone that I think I love, told me something that hurt so much... But I needed that.

I changed... In a very bad way. I enjoy bringing pain to people, as it is only thing I feel. I know it's bad but I can feel at least something, not this emptiness...

My life is a mess, I can't concentrate on anything, I can't fucking finish anything. I find so many thing so amazing but after few minutes it's all gone. When I start doing something new, in hours the excitement is gone and I have to move to something else.

This text is a mess as I am. Nothing structured, everything thrown here and there.

Why I can't accomplish just small things? Small fucking things like brushing my teeth every day, or buying groceries. Why I forget or I am to lazy to do these things right now, instead I always do them later... Of course I fucking not because I forget what I even wanted to do.

Why it is so hard to do these easy things, it's almost impossible.

One thing I can do is to buy alcohol and get fucked up, or roll a joint and get fucked up again. Or why not do both at the same time!

I feel so not loved. I thing that everyone is so disgusting. Every single person I know ditched me for someone else. Why the fuck is that?! Isn't there someone that would exchange me for something better and just be happy with me how I am?

Fuck that shitty mind of mine. I didn't accomplish anything. I'm a total piece of shit. Fuck you, fuck me, fuck your mum, fuck everyone. Literally everyone.

I'm sorry..."
1576,U.S. - Suggestions for supporting a loved one,"Hi everyone,

Before I begin, I want to mention that I will be discussing suicide in this post. Apologies in advance for the novel.

Recently, I've found myself in a position where I'm (29m) supporting my brother (24m) through a difficult separation from his wife (22w). Now, I live in Maryland with my mom (49f) and my other brother (28m), while the brother in need lives in Tennessee. It is very difficult to drop our schedules and other responsibilities to travel there for any meaningful period of time. There is no internet, so working from home in some sort of teleworking situation isn't an option.

I knew things were difficult - he mentioned to me that he sat out on his porch one night with a gun in his hand and a drink in the other, thinking about just ending it all. This was the beginning of the Time of Crisis, as I'll call it. We upped our phone calls and texts to him, encouraged him to see a therapist (which he has), and for a while things seemed stable.

Cut to last week when he found his wife and best friend together at her temporary(?) apartment. My brother had one of his guns with him, but he didn't point it at her or the other guy. Evidently, he turned it on himself and closed his eyes. She was begging him not to do it, and in the end he put his gun down and walked out to be arrested by the police that had been called.

He was put into a psychiatric hospital, and prescribed two different antidepressants. While there, one of his neighbors came by and picked up all of his guns - the neighbor is still currently holding on to them. Thursday night he came home, and Friday night I went down to spend the weekend with him.

He told me that the doctors there told him that they felt his relationship with his wife was mentally and emotionally abusive - and from what I can see I think I agree with that assessment. She has - on more than one occasion - simply packed her belongings and moved into an apartment during the workday while my brother was out, only for him to find her gone with no reason or warning when he got home.

Now, my own personal assessment of the situation is as follows - the two got married in 2017 after dating for a few years after high school. They settled into a small starter but eventually purchased a small farm of their own. Over time, I think she started to realize that married life was more than the honeymoon period, freaked out, and started looking for an out. She's said that my brother doesn't ""treat her like a wife,"" but hasn't really provided any specifics into what that translates to practically. She's jumped headlong into Satanism, but the ""I want to conjure things"" flavor of Satanism - something that really doesn't sit well with my brother and his Christian beliefs. Still, he's said that he would be willing to take religion out of their marriage entirely, and each of them could just do their own thing. No dice.

Recently she's told him that she's not ""head over heels"" anymore, and that she was in love with this other guy. But, she hasn't said the words, ""it's over,"" and doesn't seem to be willing to. My brother keeps begging her to try and come back so they could work things out, but she keeps dodging that question. She says that she'll let him know after therapy, but it doesn't seem like that discussion ever happens.

Right now, I've used up my vacation days, so there's not a whole lot more I can do. Couple that with COVID-19, future trips will be difficult to manage. I know my mom is trying to make time to be there for a weekend or something, but she's in a similar boat. We've begged my brother to come up here for a week to get away and spend time with us, but he's so far flat out refused. And now he's alone there - his friends have all evidently sided with the wife, the few remaining family members in the area are useless, and as COVID progresses I'm sure times are only going to get more difficult.

I'm tired - I'm managing my own mental health well enough, but it's unsustainable as it is. I feel like I'm the only thing that can keep my brother safe, like its on me. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I'm angry at my mom, too. When things went sideways, there was no question that it would have to be me to go instead of her. It would have been better if she had gone with me. I don't know what to do - I'm not a therapist, and I can't make my brother see the writing on the wall, I can't make him better.

TLDR: My brother and his wife are separating, my brother was/is suicidal, and I can only support him from a distance - looking for advice."
1577,can someone explain what a panic attack looks or feels like?,ik experiences may vary but i’m trying to understand this better like i’ve heard it may exhibit very differently than the uh standard that they also often show in movies and stuff?
1578,Anyone else thinks that sadness or depression is a vicious thing?,"I was a depressed person, but now I'm completely ok, just take meds for anxiety, sometimes I feel sad and I remember the time I used to be depressed and start with a strange feeling and unconsciously I really find for things that I know will make me more sad and hate myself, like a vicious circle. Anyone else struggle with this?"
1579,ruined life,i've ruined my life to the point where i will never be happy and i don't think i have the ability to form  meaningful relationships with other people. why should i continue living? just to get a shit job and make money for some capitalist? i want to escape.

1583,Married to a mental health professional but living with (I think) depression,"I’m married to a mental health professional, but he has some serious health anxiety issues for himself and his family.  I’ve been living with (I think) depression for a long time, and am reaching out to my UK primary care (virtually, obviously, in the current health crisis). Any suggestions for how I tell (or not) my (expert) husband that I’ve been struggling? Not sure if or how to raise it."
1584,messy room and messy mind,ive been feeling down for quite a time now. i noticed that my room is in state of constant mess. so i was wondering if this can impact my mood.
1585,i seem to lack fear in chaotic times,"about a month ago one of my best friends and i were hanging out and he got a call from his sister saying their dad had a heart attack. we ran to the hospital and even on our way there i realized i didn't wanted to run. i slowed down a bit to question what the fuck i was thinking. ""how do i  not want to run right now? his dad might die in a few minutes. what am i? a monster?"". but the more i asked that to myself the less intense the self questioning got.

we finally end up at the hospital. they don't let us in so we wait outside. he's crying, his sisters are crying. his uncle comes out the hospital crying. everybody starts going crazy with the tears. my friend starts jumping around with both sadness and anger. i feel bad for him and follow him around to make sure he's safe and sound. this lasts for about 15 minutes. after that i only pretend that i care. i mean almost. i still care but not as much. at one point i see him, at his peak of sorrow, cleaning his shoes. at that moment it hits me that we over exaggerate even the ""biggest"" pain in our lives.

it's not a complete state of dullness though. i mean i still feel bad but mostly furious that people are just too dramatic about things. the ironic thing is that i am way too emotional at the same time. in any situation, under any circumstances, i'd be overthinking. say if somebody asked my favorite color, i said yellow, asked them the same question and they said purple. i'd be thinking to myself ""did this person say purple just because it's the opposite of yellow on the color wheel and they hate me so this is their way of expressing their emotions and feelings about me?"". i get attached to people way too easily and have a very difficult time leaving them. i get incredibly mad when my best friend says he's busy solving puzzles and will text me later but then he goes onto instagram to post a photo. and he says his brother changed the password to wifi. like bitch you've been on instagram for 4 hours without texting me and you said you were busy? that's nothing new to me, too. none of my friends text or call me unless they're bored, they need something or i call/text them first.

&amp;#x200B;

anyways. the bottom line is i don't know if i'm a sociopath because i'm sometimes careless when it comes to sad or stressful events. or way too stupid to think that i will ever be worth anything to anyone. i am reading this book called ""confessions of a sociopath"" by M.E. Thomas looking for answers.

though i'm afraid even when (if) i find them i'll be too desperate for someone's love and care that i won't accept the truth."
