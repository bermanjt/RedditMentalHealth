0,psychiatric evaluation?,"has anyone ever had one of these done? 

I know I have depression and anxiety and possibly some form of ADD, but I have never been diagnosed with anything specific out of these categories, and I'd really like to know more about what kind of brain I have. 

I struggle with daily motivation and always seem to be distracting myself from just being. Some days are better than others, I have pondered whether I am bipolar but I'm not certain because I only qualify for one or two of the symptoms. (if anybody knows about this please don't hesitate to correct me!)

I'm a bartender who works nights, so I don't have exactly the most fulfilling or active day to day life. First thing I do when I wake up is smoke a few  cigarettes and drink coffee, then I may run an errand if I have one, if not I will smoke a joint. Then I will try to write for a bit, usually my brain has so many ideas it can't even decipher what it wants to say or how. But I still try. Then I smoke another joint. Then I either take a nap or watch tv until it's time to go to work. On my better days, I will go for a run and workout or do yoga. I have a few friends, but now with the pandemic life has been extra lonely. I don't have much of a family, we are all kind of distanced from each other. I don't have a boyfriend, or anything close to it. It's hard to know what needs fixing with the chemicals in my brain  VS what needs fixing in my *lifestyle.* Does this make any sense?"

4,I feel like my teenage years are rotting away as I regret things already,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I feel this is the most appropriate place to talk about my thoughts 

After lockdown my state of mind just went downhill. I realized how much I might value a friend and maybe how little I matter to them. See social media shows me a bunch of videos of people who like live on the beach or adventurous places and spend all day with their friends just having fun and it makes me jealous and I feel like my teenage years are going to waste. Obviously life isn’t like social media but still it’s hard to see other people living your dream. I’m never any of my friends first options to hang out or anything. I have to invite people all the time if I want to do something because it just feels one sided. I just genuinely like to be outside with other people and just have adventures but nobody seems to share my passion, except a few friends. But I never ask those few friends because they won’t necessarily want to go with me. All of this has made me a lot sadder and just a negative vibe all around if that makes sense. I’m not self diagnosing depression because it’s not like I don’t do anything, I have swim practice and workout and other hobbies but my mood has been down a lot recently 
Is there any way I can try to make this feeling of regret dissapear?"
5,I'm gonna die alone,"My partner dumped me via text the other day. Told me I ""treated them perfectly, but they weren't ready"" and now they won't even talk to me. I've never loved a person so much. They were my best friend. I feel so empty and lost. None of my hobbies feel worth doing if I can't share them with the person I love, so I do nothing. The worst part is the loneliness. I just open my phone expecting a message from them, but no one messages me. I guess I'm curious if anyone knows of like a depression pen pal type of deal? Like meet people to talk to about your feelings. I'm looking into actual therapy, but it's expensive, and they're not gonna text you all day like a friend might. I just don't really have many friends either. Idk. I'm sorry. Doubt anyone not being paid wants to hear me bitch about my life. Probably a dumb question to begin with."
6,Losing a pet :(,"I lost one of my fish on the 4th of July, his name was Jack, I miss him so much, but today I lost another one of my fish and his name was Tyler. Why is this happening, I don't know what I did wrong, I am a horrible Mother, someone should just take the few fish I have left so they don't die under my care anymore, I'm sorry I failed you Tyler and Jake, I'm so sorry."
7,I feel like I have very little emotions.,"I do not feel depressed or sad, but not happy or almost no emotions at all. It has been like this for well over 3 years no, and I haven’t though mouch about it before. It was not before about 6 months ago i got a girfriend. We fit well together but I feel like I let her down. I feel like I can’t show excitement, and even when I try to ""fake"" the excitement it stops like I’m being choked when i do so. 

I haven’t really laughed anytime I can remember, and I haven’t been sad or cried even when I fell like i should be. I am not anxious or depressed and not shy either, but it is hard for me to participate in conversations, and if it is just me and any other person, it’s just extremely quiet. At family gatherings it feels a little akward as everyone jumps around superexcited and I stand there still having a hard time forcing a smile. 

For extra info I was recently diagnosed with ADD, and I feel like it has to do with the diagnose, but i feel like nothing changes under the effect of a full dose of medicine."
8,Discussion about Meds,"Hi, all. I'm a lifelong anxiety-sufferer due to C-PTSD &amp; CEN (Childhood Emotional Neglect) who has been very reluctant to take prescriptions for my issues. Until now. So, I'm seeking people's experiences so that I have some ideas of what to discuss with a psychiatrist.

So, I'm starting to recognize more and more that so many aspects of what I thought were my personality, but am starting to come to understand as likely results of my trauma. E.g., terrible sleep, terrified of public speaking and potential rejection of possible mates, frantically keeping my mind busy for fear of the self-loathing that will arise if given space for it, alcohol dependence, incompetent finances out of fear, regular anxiety attacks, constant body pain - back in particular, inability to follow through on most anything, irritability, always being on edge. I've long naively hoped that I could dig myself out of the whole just through diligence, and worry that if I ever tried to come off the meds, that it could lead to suicidal ideation.

I've been doing a lot of other things in the past couple years that have lead to vast improvements: regular exercise including yoga, meditation, journaling, limiting alcohol intake, whole foods diet, supplements, kratom &amp; hydration, psychotherapy, and about to start EMDR (tomorrow - yay!) But I'm starting to realize that this all might not be enough. At least for the time being.

As my understanding is advancing I'm realizing just how deep the effects of my trauma have been, including struggling to follow through with my mental health goals due to a kind of scatterbrained lack of consistency, fear of failure, and fear of facing my trauma and getting healthy finally.

So, who here has found a medication that helps them deal with the deep-seated effects of trauma? What have you tried? What are the side-effects? Any additional info that would be helpful in my research?

Thanks for anyone that read that whole tome and any info that might come from it!"
9,"Does the sentiment of ""Just keep going"" actually help people?","I've seen a lot of mental health posts on social media, as well as popular songs (Carry On by fun, and Keep On by Sasha Sloan), that carry the message ""If you're struggling, just keep going"", and I'm wondering how this sentiment helps people. I've been having a bad day so I put a Spotify Playlist on called ""mental health recovery"" to see if it could help, and I noticed the trend, and for me personally, I didn't feel like being told to ""just keep going"" when I feel emotionally exhausted made me feel any better.

I want to understand this better, hopefully in a way where the message could even benefit me when I start to feel down on myself, but if not for me, just to understand and empathize with others better.

Thanks, all. Much love!"

11,Why I had to change my circumstances,"Now that my schedule isn't as hectic and my mental health is pretty okay, I've been starting to dig deeper about where my depression and anxiety is stemming from with my therapist. My therapist suggested I look into codependency... while it's mostly used for romantic relationships, I could find some things relevant when it comes to how I interact with my students. I'm fully aware that mental health is on a spectrum, and I know loved ones who absolutely need medication to do daily activities (and it has less to do with circumstances). My symptoms are very mild, and I completely understand if you don't feel like reading a block text about where I am mentally. I'm doing OK and doing my best with self-care. This post might be more for myself.

Sometimes when my symptoms aren't amazing but manageable, I mentally talk to myself as if I'm my own student. I ask myself questions to get to the root of why I feel the way I do. It helps, but obviously I have a therapist for a reason.

A year ago, I attempted suicide and chickened out. I admitted myself to a nearby hospital. I surprised some close friends because I was always the type to give other people advice and kept a smile on my face. I took a sick leave before officially quitting my teaching position for a few months. I gave substitute teaching a try and luckily ended up accepting a teaching position at a school that I absolutely love (things could change depending on public funding, but that's a different issue). I also ended a 5-year romantic relationship and currently in a happy relationship. Changing circumstances made a huge difference in my mental health.

Prior to my first teaching job, I never had a therapist or took medication for my mental health. I can now tell I had depressive moods since childhood, but it was manageable. The school was clearly not a good fit for me. In retrospect, I can identify things that worsened my ability to self-care, grow as a teacher, and enjoy my career:

* The first principal's only feedback after criticism of poor behavior management was to attend more professional development (trainings). He was simply disappointed in teachers that didn't meet his expectations, but kids didn't really listen to him either. He rarely left his office. When I confided in him that I was really struggling, he said to just go to more trainings. 
* Deans were pissed off when you called them for behavior support. Sometimes they never came out of annoyance. Some deans were verbally abusive to misbehaving students and terrified even the brightest ones. One of the deans ended up getting arrested for hitting a student (outside of school). I taught one of the dean's son, and he was angry when I gave him consequences for misbehaving.
* School-wide consequences were inconsistent and unclear. Kids already knew that they would be pushed along to the next grade. This made enforcing discipline that much harder.
* The first principal was laid off (rumor was that he used funds for personal use). This actually revealed he was hiring non-licensed adults (who were also warned that they would be laid off if they didn't get licensed by a certain date.) This was a slap in the face as someone who worked hard to get her degree.
* I initially loved the new principal who kept pushing for positive changes for the kids, but she became more critical towards me when my depression got worse. She said that if teachers truly cared about the kids, they need to make that their top priority. She meant well. In a different school environment, I might've had a better relationship with her.
* Some veteran teachers yelled and scolded younger teachers in the hallways... in front of students.
* I got along with very very few colleagues. One of them happily transferred to a different school. My mental health became a wreck when my mentor and best friend changed careers. 
* There was attendance awards for teachers to be able to purchase more school supplies/books for themselves. I've experienced both sides, and I hated it. I either felt guilty for taking any days off or felt a lot of glares for purchasing extra books for my classroom.
* I switched to a teacher team my second year that I didn't mix with at all. The team leader scheduled herself in my classes once a week to ""support"" me. She pointed out everything that was wrong and told me what to do. I was actually starting to get colleagues commenting on how much I've improved, but she completely crushed my self-esteem. She later complained to my mentor that I didn't like her even though she was doing me a favor. 
* Staying and working late in the building was applauded. I felt guilty when I left right after the school day was over (even though I was taking work home).

I felt like a complete failure, but I was stuck. I couldn't find another school to work at, and I genuinely felt that perhaps this was the wrong profession for me. When things got easier inside the classroom, I rarely stepped out of my room. I didn't want to interact with other adults in the building. It became increasingly difficult to get out of bed and get on the train. I eventually had to depend on Xanax to calm myself. It was a matter of time until I just hated feeling like shit and walked to the edge of the train tracks. (I did not jump).

When I got out of the psychiatric ward, I took a few months enjoying myself. I was seriously looking into alternative careers, but my boyfriend at the time knew that I still felt passionate about teaching and helping others. I just didn't trust myself. I officially broke up with my ex before being a substitute teacher. He mentioned that my depression could be influencing my rash decisions, and I can agree with that. Taking a step back and focusing on my own needs made me realize that:

* My family and friends loved him and felt that we were perfect together. I didn't want to break that image. I didn't want my mom to get nervous about me potentially not getting married by breaking up in my late 20's. I'm not the most popular gal.
* I don't feel comfortable talking about everything with him because we have different values.
* I became way too dependent on him emotionally, and I resented myself for it. It became to a point that I felt that I couldn't do anything without him. 
* He compromised so much for me. Breaking up would completely crush him.

I still feel guilty for breaking up with him. He was willing to compromise even more for me. I chose a blank slate instead of working things out with him. I felt better post-breakup though, and I felt my confidence coming back little by little. I gradually applied to different schools. Subbing in the meantime was a game changer-- I saw different school cultures and classrooms. I also jumped into online dating and am now blessed with a boyfriend that still gave a thumbs up after I told him *everything*. 

I was overjoyed when I was hired by another school. Honestly, I did have *one* depressive episode, and I am aware that those things won't completely go away (at least not that easily). I absolutely loved working there though, and I hope that public schools won't be defunded to the point that I lose it. At least I know that this is what I want to do though. 

Based on my experiences and my therapy sessions, there's some things I am working on and figuring out:

* My confidence is largely dependent on what other people say to me. It's really difficult for me to really feel good about myself even when people don't say nice things about me.
* My therapist wants me to look into codependency. I am super compassionate towards my students, and I want to be needed. It starts to hurt my mental health when the guilt kicks in. I tend to blame myself when I fail to reach certain kids, or when my students are in so much emotional pain but I'm unable to heal them. My therapist said this would be a challenge if I become a mother. I take responsibility for things outside of my control.
* I still strongly feel that my purpose in life is to help people even if it means putting my needs to the side. I feel good being selfless. I like easing other people's emotional pain and letting them know I'm here for them.
* It took forever to break up with my ex because I felt he also needed me. I did not want to break him. He was not a bad person.
* I still have a hard time talking about childhood trauma with my therapist. I'm still making sense of it. My dad was abusive towards my mom, and I wanted to protect her. They are divorced now, and I live with my mom (who's a very strong person). I am still protective of her though. I don't know if that influences my current attitudes.
* I honestly told my current partner I appreciate that he's able to be an independent person outside of the relationship. He likes me, but I don't feel like he depends on me. I'm sometimes tempted to care for him, but there's no need-- and therefore, my current relationship hasn't impacted my ""codependency"" problem.
* Strangely enough, I do have confidence and pride in my work. I get very defensive when people dismiss teachers as glorified babysitters especially for those working in really challenging districts. I couldn't last at my first school, and I have 100% respect for people working in those types of schools. They need really strong and passionate educators.
* I've become much more outspoken at my current school. I'm more receptive of constructive feedback because it's genuine. There's a good exchange of resources and support. It feels good when my struggles are included in conversations of how schools can support the whole community.

Sorry for the super long post! I am currently off medications and taking online classes. I also continue therapy sessions over the phone. I'm a work in progress, but it's important to be selfish sometimes for your own mental health!"
12,I feel like im stuck in prison,"I was born to shy and Im still shy. Im 29 year old virgin male without job or girl. My family always pressure to get job but I just cant.. I  have suffered  from Social anxiety, panic distorter..Agoraphobia.. I know that many people have experienced this and I have personally gotten better from worst but it still hard to socialize... When I was in school it was just pure stress everyday.. I always afraid of rejection, bullying etc... All the  bad words I HAVE heard from my life.. has slowly killed my self esteem.. Im not sad or happy.. I just dont know what to feel and my parents does not understand which is pretty typical."
13,"If you want to read my story I think I need help, thank you","It’s going on for three years at this point. I think I have to give some background to help you understand my situation. 
#Background
I’m 21 yo and this all started on my last year of high-school (since I was 19). You don’t have to know everything but let’s just say it was a strict school.    

The year before was actually amazing. I felt really accomplished and successful in every field: in the studies I was second in my class and however very very good (the gap with the others was pretty big) and the same I felt in the sports and also socially I finally felt to blend in with the others (I’ve always been isolated even if I had my little group of friends, and also in that time and now I still am a ‘solitary’ person so I think it’s more a trait of my personality and not at all a symptom of anything).  

In the spring something started to change. As I really felt there wasn’t anything else to accomplish and as I felt (for kind of a stupid reason, but it’s more complicated than this) betrayed by the people closer to me I started to push everyone away from me, in a more or less drastic way. As this went going on I became close to less and less people until really remained only one.    
I think it’s worth saying this was a kind of school where we all lived togheter and that I’m bisexual and have known and accepted that since middle school but never stated it publicly. So with this friend I won’t go into details but I’ll say that he was into girls but I think he returned my feelings. So this is the time I lost control and pushed also him away. Other things happened but this is the time where I started having some crisis where I had to go away from everyone else to breathe and then start crying (I wasn’t really someone who cried, I knew it wasn’t wrong as a thing but or didn’t feel to do it or didn’t want to be weak in any way).    
So the summer came and it really passed away almost I didn’t notice it. However I had problems sleeping (at school I didn’t sleep a lot at night too but for other reasons) and I also think I started eating less.  

So school again at September and here is where things really went downhill. I started more and more laying around doing nothing and feeling bad. The best way I saw at myself was through the eyes of my friends: 
- they started to notice I was eating less and at some point insisted that I had to eat (one once said he didn’t notice I became herbivore bc he didn’t usually eat with me and I was only eating vegetables) 
- I previously used to watch movies and series on my laptop because I really enjoyed them and was kind of my trademark to do so even if something was due for the day after and I remember at this time one of them saying worried “you don’t even do that anymore”
- One of my closest one once said, as I was laying on a desk in class, that she thought I could have been depressed 
- The one I last rejected and for which felt something said it was like I was ‘degradating’ (don’t get it wrong, it was not in a bad way).    

My friends were really supportive, even if I was at some degree still pushing them away. At one point they also came in my room wanting to know what was happening and I ended up talking to a couple of them but couldn’t go over explaining my sexual orientation and what I felt for that friend. I also went to a psychologist we had there a couple of times but also couldn’t go over that.  

As for what was happening to me on the outside now that I think about it I think I reached my peak both physically and at school (I had the highest marks for a time and also won a prize at February).  

For what concerned me I felt dumber: I had to read a sentence multiple times to understand it and really felt like I couldn’t do some complex thinking I was able to do previously (this went down with the time and still haunts me).    
I also started working out even for several hours just in order to feel fatigue. I think it’s worth saying that I never accomplished fatigue and didn’t really feel either hunger, sleep or anything else. I just felt bad. I didn’t even feel pain after hours and days of exercising, and to me it was bc I was at the peak of physical condition. I also didn’t smell, only recently I have smelled my sweat again, along with a lot of other things of myself, and I don’t know if there was something wrong with me or it was just my nose.
##Conclusion
At this point nothing else comes to my mind just that I knew something wasn’t right and tried to fix it in different ways but nothing really worked and I thought it was a breakdown for all the effort I had put in the precedent period (seriously, I don’t know how I previously did and accomplished everything I did, at the time I just thought that those were my capacities and I could just do that but now I see that as inhuman).  

So to relax after graduation I went back home and restarted my life and tried to relax more, exercise less, enjoy video games and other things (and I really started enjoying that).    
Initially I had problems waking up and getting out of my bed but I’m getting better at it.  

Recently I also started enjoying reading again.
The only problem I still have with it it’s whit prolonged attention: I can’t read for long times and also tend to watch maximum 30 minutes episodes (mainly anime) even if I end up watching several of them.
#Problem
So it’s overall going better but I just feel it isn’t still right. My emotional status changes day by day and as I’m attending law school I struggle to study and focus.  

My overall problem it’s my memory. As I started talking with my old friends I noticed there were some things I didn’t remember, things from my past they would tell me and I could not remember, most of the times not even vaguely. At the beginning I thought it was normal since I went through some years of a completely different life and through some psychological distress but now not also I think it’s getting worse, it’s also becoming an impending problem for my future. As I can’t properly remember what I study it will affect my future and these ‘failures’ will affect my psychological status. So what can I do at this point?  

I know that probably I went through depression (and at some degree I’m still into it) since every time I read something regarding it I more and more identify myself into the symptoms. What pushed me to write this it’s actually that I read that memory loss was one of the symptoms.  

If your advice is to go to therapy: if you’re really assertive I might consider it but at the moment it’s not among the alternatives and, for personal reasons, I don’t think I will.  

I’m already regularly exercising, eating better and eating what I like (recently I have started having breakfast whit self-made pancakes and it’s really the best thing ever). I started watching tv and reading again and everything else.  

If something I feel lonely but that’s something that accompanied me for almost my whole life and also I don’t think there is an easy solution to that. Don’t get it wrong I have friends I just lack the right type of friend, someone I can deeply relate to.  

I don’t know maybe I’m making a big deal of something that isn’t worth such worrying but I just don’t feel right yet and I want to. Now that I have put it down I also feel kinda stupid because it seems so trivial and at this point I should just keep what I’m doing and wait for it to get better.  

As I said **my main problem is with memory** so if you could help just whit that I will be immensely grateful anyway.  

Honestly I don’t really know why I wrote the story of my life but I think it can be therapeutic by itself (I actually felt emotional in some points) and also I have a friend who is studying Psychology and hearing some cases he has studied of Freud I thought that adding my background story could be useful.    
Keep also in mind I didn’t include some events or details:
- to preserve my identity of the others surrounding me (I have also deleted something for this reason)
- because I didn’t think they were as important 
- because I didn’t remember them.  

Also English is not my mother language so if something it’s not clear I’m willing to further explain it."

17,literally no friends,"how does it happen that you area nice person, has always tried to not piss people off, yet you get to be almost 40 and realise you have no friends. that the people you invested so much time in while in school couldn't give a shit about you. When you know that for years it was only you that made the effort and when you stopped that - you  don't even register with them anymore. how do you square that off. I'm very lost"
18,"I want to check myself into a mental health residence, but I feel like maybe I'm blowing everything out of proportion.",I feel like I need help. I need something to change. I'm constantly anxious. I had to up my meds again. I feel like going to a facility to attend a 6-8 week program might do some good for me. But I'm scared that I'm being excessive. What if I can't afford it? What if this interferes with my job and I cant pay my bills while I'm gone. I'm scared to take the leap and not being taken seriously.
19,"I’m so hopeless, the more I look at my life, all I see is pain and I see suicide as my only solution.","I’m writing this at 1 am, crying and thinking about suicide. I need to get these thoughts off my chest. 

My “life” right now, isn’t even a life at all. I spend all of my days sitting in my bedroom alone, friendless and feeling sad, angry or numb.

 Right now I’m feeling sad and angry as usual but I just can’t bottle it up anymore, I need to tell someone.

 Nobody gives a f*ck how I feel, I don’t have anyone and I’m just a massive burden, wasting space.

 I used to study and be athletic but not anymore. I’ve given up, I’m useless right now. I’m such a disgrace. 

This has been building up for a long time. Throughout my life, my OCD and autism has chipped away at any sanity I had. 

I can barley function anymore. I have no motivation or confidence. I’ve always struggled with confidence in life but nowadays I can’t do anything without thoughts of self hate and intense anxiety. I can’t do anything right. My social skills are nonexistent, I can’t talk to people. I’m too weird, I wouldn’t want to bother others. I actually feel sorry for anyone who has to put up with me. Because of this, I’m friendless and alone. I feel so worthless, like I’m not worth sh*t. I don’t believe in myself, making it impossible to achieve anything, even basic tasks. I’m convinced I can’t even do simple things like brush my teeth right. My OCD is so distracting, I can’t concentrate. I’m constantly doing irrational compulsions instead of doing something productive. 

I couldn’t hate myself more. I’m a complete mess. I’m a hateful angry person, I’m afraid of what I’ll be like in a few years. I get worse every year, the pain just gets worse. 

There’s no way out of this, I’m tired of false hope and fairytales. I want to die, but since I can’t do anything right then of course I can’t do that either. I’m too afraid, I’m a coward about it. 

So to distract myself and in an attempt to bring myself some happiness I waste my life on my phone. My screen time is around 12 hours a day, everyday. I can’t really go wrong, it’s not like the real world. 

I’m going nowhere being like this but I can’t get out of this. Sometimes I just sit and think about suicide and it actually brings me happiness. Anything is better then what I’m doing now. 

I’m going to post this because I’m desperate for someone to listen. It’s embarrassing but I’m not even going to lie about it anymore. Reddit is all I have when I’m feeling this down, sorry for being so annoying."
20,Why am I overwhelmed with sadness when I should be happy?,"I have Major Depressive Disorder, so this may be a contributor.

When I do something nice for someone and/or I do something that makes me happy, I momentarily feel the happiness but am overwhelmed with sorrow and want to cry. 

I don't understand it, could it be my brain isn't processing the dopamine correctly?  

Due to Covid and my Psychiatrist moving out of state, I'm not in talk therapy, but I am taking Zoloft for my MDD. This has happened before the medication, and before my diagnosis."
21,How to stop the bad thoughts in my head?,"Every night for the past few weeks, when I go to sleep, right as I put my head on the pillow I see one image in my head: me pointing a gun to my head, and hearing "" you *should* kill yourself, it'll take all the responsibilities away, it'll take all the worries away, you should do it, you should do it* (also I dont mean hear hear, but like you know, my brain talk). Now I dont even own a gun, I dont have the means or the abilities to kms, I wouldn't mind disappearing but I'm not suicidal. I just want the thoughts to stop, they make me very uncomfortable, they dont shut up, they make it harder to sleep, they make me feel guilty,, and they just overall suck. Any advice on how to make them stop?"
22,It haunts me knowing that I used to think I was fat and unlovable at 10 years old.,"**Trigger warning**

I was looking through my old iPad mini. Seeing if anything was worth saving before I sold it. 

I came across a lot of pictures of my stomach, food and Diaries talking about my journey of rapid exercising and starving myself. 

Most of this was at 12 but it all started when I was 10 because an adult called me fat. 

I’m 15 now and looking back I was just a little chubby, cuz I was a kid. But my mind was so broken then. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/AbQ8Ymy) is one of the pictures. I was 13 in this photo.

You see the little bit of fat poking out of the waistband? I cried over that. 

I would make hundreds of videos on my iPad of me just standing up and turning around so I knew what I looked like from all angles, it’s a habit I still have before I go out somewhere. but I delete the videos after. 

I just want to let every adult know to never call a child fat or ugly. Because it seriously impacted my mental health. My entire family has had a history of suicidal thoughts, depression. Anorexic etc. But I would have never become so aware about my body if that Adult hadn’t said I was fat. 


At 15 I’m proud to say I’ve finished my battle with anorexic and depression. But I’ve ended with a horribly low self esteem and just problems with food, in that. I don’t know how much food is actually normal."
23,Childhood friend is worrying me.,"I’m a little afraid about the direct my childhood friend is going into. 

I suspect these 2 have engaged in having sexual intercourse. I don’t think it’s gone as far as I have suspected, but nonetheless it happened or was lied about. 

He’s also listened to this person lies when I wasn’t around, off the clock from his job as a lawyer? Which means... I’ve recently found out that he has a GF/fiancée who has a child of her own but I believe he’s lied once about the child being his. Its been a year since I’ve accidentally ran into this girl so she should still be in his life because i heard she wanted to be with him but she was just as messed up as he was for what she also did to me, and I didn’t know her. 

His parents as well as I are worried about him. He’s not himself to his parents and the fact he has sex with my family member who’s my relative isn’t okay as well as admitting to wanting to murder someone? Which he’s then turned around and said wasn’t true. 


My relative (59) fed this (25) year old lies and he didn’t even check to see if it was true or not. Why would a 25 year old mess with my aunt who’s almost 60? Doesn’t society shame this? 

Can someone tell me what they should do and I should do? I’m afraid he’s just losing it because he thinks she knows me when she doesn’t. Everyone is looking at me ultimately to send him to jail also because of what he’s done to me."
24,Would it be okay if I take a year off of college to treat my ADHD?,"I am from a middle eastern country. I was diagnosed by inattentive ADHD 5 by 5 different psychiatrists from 4 different countries, but that is besides the point. After graduating highschool, I decided to continue university in Russia. I had absolutely NO idea that all ADHD medications are illegal here under all circumstances. I only learned about this after a year and a half of learning Russian to a good enough level to which I can read, speak, and think in it given that information concerning living in Russia with ADHD is only available in Russian. Before, I thought that I can bring my medications from my home country with a legal prescription as in most European countries, but in Russia there is no such thing. Consuming and buying Ritalin and Vyvanse is as big of a crime as abusing heroine here, which can land a person 7 years in prison. Despite how difficult it was, I managed to pull through and passed the entrance exams for medical school here, but I cant realistically continue like this. This was all a big mistake. Knowing Russian now is nice, but I spent two years of my life for nothing. Before corona hit, I was accepted to study in Spain, but that didnt work out in the end for obvious reasons. After that, I applied to a couple universities within the EU, and it didnt work out in the end. On top of that, I have no idea where my highschool diploma is since I sent it to my home country via a Russian post office to fulfill requirements to apply for EU universities. Things been stuck in Moscow 3 weeks now. Now, my only choice is to go back to my home country and prepare again on my own, and redo the SATS and TOEFL. Is that wise? What should I do?

TLDR; I have ADHD, and I am finding myself to quit college for a year to treat my condition and apply to study in a country where ADHD medications are legal."

An Attempt to Save Yourself

July 12th, 2020

This was a “spur of the moment” decision. Seems like I have a lot of these moments. Well, because I do. I go through my hoard of stuff from time to time and just find my ramblings written across random old journals. Never did I find one with more than one entry, that changes today. (That sounds so determined, but fuck it i’m sure i’ll skip this like all the others.) I want this to be a rather *critical log of my thoughts* moving forward.

I often think “Okay why is it such a big deal if I do X or think like Y. Tons of people do (this) with no fucks given, so why am I being harsh on myself?”

While I feel like this is a very healthy (To an extent) mindset, I also think about the things i’m doing that make me feel this constant guilt. Most of which are not considered “healthy” or “mature” actions. *Relativity is so important, yet impossible to truly pin down.*

So, I think this might be where the root of my constant inner conflict and unpredictable outer nature comes from. Think of these 2 examples. Try and break them down. One, more concrete and obvious while one is more, challenging, involving a more direct conflict of emotion. Example 1. Everytime I go to the gas station to buy a pack of vape pods, I feel judged. I appear and hold to this kind, friendly and good kid demeanor and then I ask the clerk “Yea, can I also get the menthol pod, 2.4 nicotine.” immediately I feel like less of a man. Maybe it’s because i’ve half-convinced myself for years that I WANT to quit. Or maybe because it’s for me and a proper man shouldn’t need this nicotine crutch. Or maybe it’s because I told my Ex, that I would &amp; did quit, but just began hiding it instead. Well… I guess realistically it's all those things. But then, something happens. I just get this feeling of.. “fuck it.” I want to vape so i’m going to do it. And then the cycle repeats.

For this second example, I should probably write the backstory associated with it. I loved my best friend for always, until she caved and we got together. Things didn’t work out. But I felt tethered to her. I was always anxious or depressed when I wasn’t with her. So screw it, I’ll stick around. Years pass and I remain single. No crippling anxiety. No fucks given. Interested and focused in my career. That’s when I made the connection. My anxiety and depressive feelings were always centered around her. Thoughts like “What’s she doing right now?”, “What does she see in this fuckboy… He’s going to hurt her.”, “She makes me feel so warm, how will I live a content life if we can’t remain together?” So without her in the picture, I was confident. Successful. While the depressive habits would creep in from time to time, they were always manageable. Now here we are. 2 months post-break up from a different girl I've dated for nearly a year. From the start, my mind has been in a whirlwind. We would click and be great, then weirdness. Next comes discomfort. Then a break. And repeat. Was it love? We were so different emotionally at least, but the same in a lot of ways. She would do lots of inconsiderate things, I would get hurt, then upset and either lash out or become reserved and uncomfortable to be around. A month passes after our actual break up with no communication really. The first week was hard, but I'm no stranger to numbing my feelings. Next couple weeks i’m filled with confidence and hope. BOOM. Depressive brick wall. I think about all the things I did that were really hurtful or inconsiderate, things that I’d get so defensive over at the time. I reach out to her. (Hey, you know how this road goes. If you gush your feelings, it’s really over. You know that right…?) I don’t care. I cannot keep this in. \*A heartfelt message returned with a comforting denial.\* (You know she’s just saying that to make you feel better right…?) Yeah, but what’s so wrong with that…? You keep talking. Frequently at this point. Feels like years ago… Like i’ve learned no lesson. I was a confident but defensive guy in our relationship. Isn’t that a contradiction..? Oh well. But now I just “simp” because the conversation is good. We click without the drama of romance. (Okay but you still want to be with her…) But I start realizing things. Why did I take some jokes so seriously before, when now they have me rolling in laughter? Was it love? Can I love? Or do I obsess…? Even now, she’ll hint at being jealous about me casually talking with a girl, or hint that she’s lonely and wants some company.

Here’s example #2 of your inner conflict (As if that wasn’t enough baggage already dude.) Is it bad to “Simp?” To have so much care and desire to give someone anything they could need, even if they don’t give that much back? Of course, thats a subjective statement. She would and does give a lot back, but is it to the same degree that I consider my own involvement BUT ALSO why should that even fucking matter? But then I think, KING get out there and get shit done! Screw these women, you do you. And I do. I feel the confidence, the pep in my step, even if just for a day or two. People notice. Girls notice. She notices.

How do I become a “Simp King.” How. How do I maintain healthy confidence, where I can brush off a joke and laugh back but also give anything and everything for someone…

I think many of my love issues spark from my inner ashamedness/hate of myself. Should I stop doing these things that make me feel ashamed, or can I just own them without caring? I’m worried in doing so, I would be the fool and not the King…

**Below is a list of things I do even though i’m ashamed. Imma just be brutally honest with myself here.**

* I Drink, Like ⅓ a bottle a night. Usually alone, and I don’t tell anyone when I have.
* I Vape. I am fully addicted. I don’t see any gain here, but I don’t really care enough to stop.
* I leave my room a mess, cleaning it maybe once a week.
* I Neglect my pet lizards. I provide the absolute bare minimum care and I hate that…
* I'm too uncomfortable to make use of the rest of the house (I’m a 24-year-old living in my grandparent's basement ffs)
   * Idk why. I know they don’t mind, I just don’t want the interaction.
   * I will pee in a jug, just because I don’t want to go out into the bathroom if my grandpa is there…
* I don’t reply to friends or family, randomly.
* I eat in my bed &amp; leave the dishes all over until I finally clean up.
* I invest time, money and effort into making masturbation more realistic
   * I’ve tried to sew a “pillow” in order to replicate an ass.
   * I use a fleshlight in different scenarios to simulate sex positions, etc.
* I take viagra sometimes just to get a good masturbation session.
   * I occasionally took it before seeing my ex, hoping we would have a great time (Rarely happened anyways…) And I never told her.
* I drop food or drink on the carpet and rarely give a shit unless it’s a pretty bad spill.
* I only brush my teeth when I remember/care too… (3x a week?)
* I’ll waste a whole day watching youtube if i’m not feeling productive.
* I drink a lot of caffeine (3+ red bulls a day)
* I will eat out for almost every meal and the meals i make at home are pretty easy and unhealthy.
* I rely on the Adderall i’ve been prescribed to get stuff done. While it changed my life for the better, I feel like it’s made me a less *real* person and idk if I like that.
* I tell everybody i’m going to take my GRE soon, and I haven’t even checked the testing dates… Why. I just… I don’t feel driven too. Fuck.

Well damn. That’s quite a list… I don’t like any of it. I don’t want anyone to see any of it… How do I change? Some of these make me happy on a “guilty pleasure” level, is that so wrong? Probably not, but there’s a lot here… Lmao. I just feel like a live a double life. The life of sin I need in order to give everyone the life of joy, positivity, and energy that I genuinely have when i’m around them. No one could know this shit. Would telling anyone help? I don't know. I’d rather just tackle them one by one and make myself a better person. Is this why I couldn’t love? Even to those that mean the world to me, I still live a life of lies behind them…

Perhaps I’m a psychopath? I mean, I read other people very well. But no… I’m low-key too emotional haha and at the very least I can sympathize with people’s pain. Idk. Hopefully, this journal will help me figure out.

I just want to be a better man, I just don’t know where to begin

**The hell of being a man of endless thought &amp; insight bound by the shackles of his inflexible emotions.**"
26,I feel as though I'm constantly being watched and I don't know what to do about it.,"Let me explain. Ever since I was in kindergarten, I have always had this sense/mental image of all of my close friends and family, sitting in one room together, watching me and my every move on multiple televisions. As if there were hundreds of surveillance cameras all around me at all angles, showing my every move to said friends and family. Its like, I can be washing dishes, right, but in my head I can see myself washing dishes as if i were standing right next to myself. or behind myself. or even above myself, looking down. basically i can ""see"" myself all around and in turn, my friends and family sees me from all around too, via the television surveillance. They watch me and they have BEEN watching me since I was 5 or 6. And they all talk to each other about me, positively or negatively. And its just something I've always lived with. However, I know fully well that this is insane and this is not happening at all, but no matter how hard I try i cannot make myself stop ""thinking"" about it, if I try, one of ""them"" always says something like ""look she's trying to get rid of us again, it isnt going to work"". Please, I know how crazy this makes me sound. I know. I just dont know what this is and if anyone could at least tell me what might be wrong with me it would help me so much. I dont want to feel or think this way anymore. To be clear, I have good relationships with my family and friends, I dont think anyone is out to get me. I just constantly think that I'm being watched and idk what to do anymore so I figured I'd make a post here. I dont want to explain this to a therapist and have them
lock me up somewhere."
27,POCD or not?,"I'm 15 trying to figure myself out. I get sexually arroused by literally everything from the opposite gender that has a butthole. Animals, old women, girls my age. Everything.

Anyways, I also get aroused by children (mostly over 12). And that surprised me. Surprised me so much in fact that I went through a severe depression for some days. Took anti depressiants and they helped. Anyways, lately I can't look at children without getting this butterfly-in-my-stomach feeling. And I don't know if that's because of arousal or anxiety of being aroused. 

The thing is, I usually don't get the ""intrusive thoughts"" that comes with POCD whenever I see a child. But sometimes I do and I try to convince myself that it's just hormones and puberty. It usually goes away but not always. 

I haven't talked to a therapist yet, since my appointment is in 1 month due to her going on vacation. 

I just want to know if this is because I'm still confused about myself or because I have POCD. 
Thank you."
28,Motivational Support Video (New YouTube Support)," Raise your hand or click the like button, if you’ve ever felt, lost, broken, misunderstood etc. I was inspired by a subscriber comment that I got and boy…do I have some encouraging words to tell you! I’m super proud of how todays video turned out (I cried watching it back) but before you watch, read some of the thoughts I have: 

As “adults”, we have to unlearn most of what society piled on top of us as kids. The things that made us feel broken, unseen, undervalued, unloved, unworthy etc. The things, that made us see ugliness and not beauty in every living thing. 

The older my physical body gets the more I have to “unlearn” and expand my mind. I strive to “unlearn” at least one thing a day, to heal the inner child. 

What are you unlearning today? Where do your beliefs come from? Do your current beliefs and systems support your mental health? Is everything in your life in alignment with your eternal soul? Do you believe everything to be true to yourself? Or do you believe it because it’s what you’ve been told? 

If you’ve ever felt lost, misunderstood, purposeless, I have a new YouTube video out that might help. 

I hope you Subscribe, (its free to you, and helps Youtube algorithm push out my videos) Like, Share 💕💕💕

Let me know in the comments what you are unlearning today?

29,When i make someone i care about upset especially if they were going through something very emotional I feel so horribly guilty and I get extreemly depressed. It gets do bad that I feel like distancing my self from them. I cant tell why I do this but upsetting someone scares me a lot.,From past experiences I've shut them out or distanced my self from them. I don't know why I feel this way does anyone have a clue?  I feel like it kinda became a sort of trauma that hold me back from making anymore friends cuz I feel like I'll only hurt people so the best thing I could do is keep them away from my self. But I'm very lonely and really need ppl who I could express my self to and who would love me but I feel like id never be able to return the love they'd give me more so I'd never forgive my self for hurting or upsetting them so I just let my self suffer and not hurt anyone else. These are very twisted and complicated feelings and I'm not sure how to approach them without feeling overwhelmed.
30,Fourth of July Celebration,"I have no trauma of loud situations, besides maybe yelling/fights. However, on the fourth and tonight when shooting off fireworks I’ve had panic attacks. Fireworks, and loud/sudden noises are huge triggers for me and I don’t know why. It makes no sense, I know I’m safe, and I feel so stupid. I can’t even hold a sprinkler or shoot those little parachute solders with my little cousins and grandparents. Not even the loud ones anymore, even the ones that just spark. I’m missing out on what little quality time I have with them because we live many states apart, but I can’t bring myself to even go outside. I lasted maybe five minutes. I’m so embarrassed and confused about what about this is so awful to my subconscious. Any advice?"
31,I need to vent/COVID life stress,[removed]
32,What's the purpose of doing anything or achieving anything if it's all going to end and disappear anyways. Is life even worth trying?,"Nothing feels worth it. Even the simple thought of wanting to get a bird is just drowned out by thoughts saying that it's going to give me more sorrow than joy because it's going to die before I do.

I feel an absolute loss of hope and motivation for everything. But I cant just do nothing and wait for it to end unless if I were to actually end my life but I dont have the nerve for that and to die sooner is the last thing I want. If I dont want to die yet everything feels pointless, I cant figure out what there is to do and how I can get over this feeling. I just want this suffering to end.

I'm tired of medication and therapists being so incredibly expensive. Theres no way I can get any help anytime soon because of it.

Throughout high school, I'd think to myself that I can get over my mental problems myself, but ever since then, it's gotten incredibly worse and theres no way for me to overcome this by myself."
33,"I have become extremely careless with my job since daycares have allowed me to have a place to bring my children. I used to constantly worry about doing enough and staying productive, but now I just dont care. The people I work with are ok, but I really just do not like not being home anymore.","I used to think homelife was stressful and work was my escape from it. Now, I realize how much less control I have over my environment when on display for the public. The only control I have over my surroundings is in my home, and that's putting lipstick on a pig when I'm at my lowest. I feel like I'm about to do something stupid and just up and quit my job, hope for the best,  then regret it. I'm not the bread winner either, but we do depend on my income. People live with way less though and are perfectly fine so I dont understand what the deal is here."
34,Anxiety Overrides Medication,"Which  makes me even more anxious. I've been a mess today. It doesn't happen  every night, but when it does, my entire next day is ruined by all day  anxiety over not sleeping. My medication is Klonopin, by the way.

I  started taking it at the end of March, just one .5mg pill per night for  sleep after a very rough few months of increasing sleeplessness and  anxiety. I don't *think* it's  tolerance at this point, being that when I'm in the right frame of mind  and not stressing I fall asleep just fine. It's when I start the night  with anxious thoughts that my night is already destined to be terrible..

Sound  familiar to anyone else? I'm so scared when this happens. I just don't  want to feel like I'm the only one fighting this, I know there must be  others out there that know what this is like :("
35,Im so stupid i cant even type down how i feel.,[deleted]
36,Symptoms of severe depression,"So recently I have gone through very long moments of severe depression. And my room is disgusting to be blunt. It has been that way for years because of my depression and Im so used to it that when I go somewhere that's clean or stay somewhere that's neat it's weird to me. So I'm adopted and my mom is driving me fucking crazy. she always is pressuring me to cut my hair and dress differently and if I don't comply, she gets very upset. She's tried to keep me from seeing my birth mom multiple times, by saying that if I don't do well enough in school or I don't do something specific I won't get to see her. I personally think it's very fucked up to do that but I've been told it's not a big deal. She has a bad way of handling certain things and sometimes tries to have uncomfortable talks with me that make me uncomfortable. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life that could get me in trouble and I regret everything I did. I have been in a toxic relationship for years and it's been devestating on my mental health. I've made plans to kill myself before and she found pills in my room and she tried locking up all the razors and knifes so I wouldn't harm myself but it didn't work because I did it again not too long ago. I really just don't know, it's hard to keep myself safe sometimes because suicide seems like the only option to all of this."
37,I never cry at funerals.,"Maybe I don't sympathize with death, because I often wish it for myself..."
38,How do you know if you need help or not?,"I've been thinking about this for months or maybe a little over a year. I feel abnormal at times, like something is seriously wrong and I can't put a finger on it. For instance, there are those days where my mind goes blank. I can't think of anything, can't feel anything and I simply don't want to do anything normal like eat or sleep. Then every few hours I'd suddenly start crying nonstop over all the bad things in my life and I can't stop doing that. Its like it just happens to me and I just watch it. I've also always pushed people away from me for absolutely no reason then I'd start regretting it every single time i do it and even after it happens and this regret would last forever. I've manged to avoid that I might need help all my life but now that i'm considering it, what makes me sure that I actually need it or that i'm not just going into a phase that can end one day you know?"
39,Was I raped?,"I struggle a lot with this and my rapist. 

I guess sometimes I don’t know if he knew what he was doing was wrong, if he meant to even hurt me. 

He approached me on the street after I had been drinking. He was 30 and I was 19 and separated me from my friend. Once we got back to his place, he started violently kissing me. He forced me to undress, bit my breast, suffocated me with his body, pinned my leg down with his knee, and told me to perform sexual acts on him before vaginally penetrating me until I started bleeding. He didn’t stop when I was bleeding and kept going. I dissociated the entire time.

He made a lot of degrading comments and forced me to tell him what I wanted him to do to me. He tried to take pictures of me, yelled at me when I tried to leave, and forced me to sing for him knowing that I was studying voice in school at the time. 
He smirked at me and looked smug the whole time. 
I managed to escape after he’d fallen asleep and then dropped out of college.

I don’t know if he meant to hurt me or if he’s even really a rapist."
40,girlfriend has insomnia,
41,I’m confused by my mental health,"Hello! So I’m a 17 year old girl and I have diagnosed GAD, emetophobia, OCD, and a panic disorder. I began taking antidepressants in late January and they have worked great, I went from having 10 panic attacks a day to 1. My anxiety HAS increased recently but that’s most likely due to the general chaos of the world right now, as well as the fact that I’m in a transitional period since I graduated high school last month. I do have a question regarding my mental health though.

Recently, I have been feeling very bored. Not just bored like “there’s nothing to do” bored — I just don’t see much excitement or opportunity in life. It’s strange because I’m attending college in the fall and I have a lot of things going for me, but I just don’t feel excited or like life is very special anymore. I’m not sure if it’s because of the quarantine or something but I’ve been feeling this way for a while. I also have had a strong lack of motivation that might also be due to quarantine as well, but I’m not sure.

I know this can be a symptom of depression, and normally I’d discuss it with my therapist as I know anxiety and depression often go hand-in-hand, but 1) depression doesn’t really run in my family and 2) otherwise i’m a generally happy person. I smile and laugh a lot, I sing along to music, and I love playing with my dog. I exercise every day.

I’m not asking for a group of strangers to diagnose me, but I’m just wondering what your take is and whether I should bring this up to my therapist. I’m really scared that I do have depression, but it might just be me overthinking as I do that a lot haha.

Thanks so much!"
42,What to do,"Will try not to go into too much detail.
My childhood was a nightmare the likes of a gut wrenchingly tearful movie.
I have no faith, I do not have a connection with anything, not even spiritual. I feel numb.
Nothing ever matters.
Sometimes I find a muse in helping others, but it quickly passes when I find everyone just uses me.
Without helping others I'm never around anyone, aside from work that is.
Also relating with others has never been possible, I'm fundamentally different from the lifetime's worth of people I've met along the way.

Work helps me pass the days, months, years, etc..
Basically I have no logical reason to exist.
I have exhausted all options presented to me in life. Nothing brings me to a place where I feel a connection to life.
Going back to the whole faith and spiritual part, I nearly obsess with the idea of killing myself.
I'm not going to do it soon, I just know I'm headed towards it, just a matter of time.
I will not burden anyone with my checkout at that time, don't worry.
I am not looking to be talked out of the idea, but rather looking for some insight I've never seen,  maybe I'm missing something?

Is there some magical explanation to people living out a fulfilled life, is it all a big lie everyone tells themselves and eventually come to believe in the end?

I know I'm not okay, mentally speaking, but I'm an expert problem solver, can usually overcome anything, with the exception of this lifetime ailment."
43,Americans compared to rest of the world (in terms of mental health awareness),Heyho so this just came to my mind but I feel like Americans care so much more about mental health than the rest of the world I don't know why but where I'm from it's like you either get a job and be a functioning part of society or u don't and are basically useless. I feel like in America people are way more understanding to someone who is taking a break from work because of mental health etc. Dunno I recently took a half year brake from college (basically 1 year now because of the covid situation) and only got shit for it. Also if I mention that I'm seeing a therapist from time to time people look at you like u belong in a mental asylum or smthn. Americans seem to be more open about the topic of mental health is basically what I'm trying to say. Any of u guys got some thoughts on this?
44,I don't think I can take it anymore.,"America's been dead for years, we're all living in its corpse. We live in a country of idiots who will bring us down with them because of their idiocy and it's all made me really start to consider ending it all not out of depression but out of pure spite. 

What's the fucking point anymore? What's the point to being a good person? Yeah, I change one person's day by making **them** happy while I go home, a fat slob who can't pick up his room right, gets mad at video games, takes out his anger on his friends and regrets it afterwards, and can't get a better job beyond fucking pizza delivery. What's the point? What do I have to look forwards to, with the way the country is going and the way the world is going and how little impact I have on it all? Getting a VR headset? What, so I can escape reality more? Get a girlfriend? Fat fucking luck with the covid going on and how weird I am. Get a better job? With what money? I can't get a degree, flunked that and ruined my life because it was ""too hard"" and I ""just didn't get it"".  


It's too much. I don't know if I can take it anymore, and the urge to just run away or end it is immense."
45,I don’t like my therapist,"My therapist is this waspy lady with like a transatlantic accent (???it doesn’t make sense). She’s very upper class and as someone Mexican growing up below the poverty line it just feels like she can’t help me. I know that’s not how therapy works but sometimes she just feels so out of the loop. 

Like I was talking about the schools in my district re opening and how I was anxious abt corona and she was like “well they’re probably doing daily testing” and that just seemed so I don’t know how to explain. 

I’ve been asking my parents for a therapist for 3 years I started last year at a therapist in my low income neighborhood but they would make wait sometimes 2 hours before telling me my appointment was cancelled, then I waited 6 months to start this one. 

I don’t know how many therapists in my city do children and take our health insurance and it’s taken this long to find one but it just doesn’t feel like it’s working"
46,Two face,"My whole life I never really tried to hang with my brothers who are younger than me ( I’m 21, my brothers are 14 and 10) I always was selfish and just wanted to hang with my friends in HS and college( smoke weed, drink, party) I have been driving myself insane mentally how shitty and selfish of a brother I was. I also have other regret, smoking all of college away never studying just cheating my way to a degree with starting. Hung out with the wrong crowds who just weren’t motivating. I started a new job and it made me depressed knowing all this In the past and my Parents sacrificed so much for me to go to college and made sure I came out debt free. I had been severely depressed for 2-3 weeks not leaving my room after work just sleeping, crying, feeling miserable. After the weeks I again had this fuck it mentally selfish, what is there To lose. I always knew how to contact a prostitute but was too scared to follow thru with it. But after getting over the depression I went and had sex with a prostitute. I got chlamydia from it. Mentally I feel so fucked up. Covid got me woke but has me feeling like the worst person This planets seen."
47,I think I’m not okay,"This came suddenly. Or at least it suddenly became obvious. 
I am pretty sure I did this to myself, by refusing to face my traumas and simply distracting myself. 
Maybe? 

I had my first panic attack a year ago. 
I feel like I’ve had mini panic attacks almost every day since then. 
I know my triggers. 
I know it’s him. 
I know it’s when he gets sent to that certain area to work where he knows exactly how to find his heroin. 
And then I know I’m going to spiral. 
I’m going to yell at my kids because he’s not answering. I’ll call him repeatedly until he blocks me. Then I spend all night unable to breathe just praying to God that he’s alive. 
When he’s done, he will call me and tell me I’m crazy and we will fight until I can’t fight anymore and I just forgive him because it’s easier to pretend it didn’t happen. 
But I’m spiraling now. 
It’s just getting worse. 
But I see clearer now, I can see how our kids are suffering. 
I can see why i have so much anger for him. 
I know it’s because I have no control over my life and what happens to it and i can’t help my kids if something happens to him. 
So am I getting better? Or am I getting worse? 
Was I as bad as he told me I was and I just didn’t know it?

But these thoughts. These thoughts are getting darker. And they don’t stop. They just loop and loop and loop and I obsess over them until I finally pass out. 
These thoughts are new. They aren’t about him. 

I’m suddenly terrified of the tree in my yard. 
My kids aren’t allowed to be in the back part of the house. 
It’s going to come down on the house I know it. 
And the driveway. It’s sinking. And I check it everyday and it’s just getting worse. And I’m consumed. I’m consumed of thoughts of a sinkhole swallowing ya so deep into the earth that no one can reach us. 
But we don’t die. 
No my brain wants to make me suffer by giving me visions of us buried in rubble and all I can hear are my kids screaming in pain and fear for days on end until we all die. For hours and hours these thoughts consume me. 

I couldn’t even do the dishes tonight because I know if I went near the sink I would turn the garbage disposal on and what if o just stuck my hand in there?
And at night I don’t sleep because I’m checking to make sure it’s unplugged every twenty minutes because what if my four year old climbs in the sink while everyone is asleep. 

These thoughts consume me. Paralyze next. There’s no room for anything else. The kids want to play but everything is so dark and these thoughts just won’t give me a break. 
But then they do. 

And then I spend the rest of the night thinking about how I’m failing my kids and I need to be better and I need to get up and call my doctor. But I won’t. Because I can’t. Because my brain fucking hates me and I just can’t get out of bed. 
I can’t talk to people today it’s too much work."

53,Lost Uncle,"I want to find my uncle, Alvaro Nava. He is about 60 years old; last known address in Pasadena, CA. Alvaro lives in a board and care. He is mentally unfit. He made it through high school, but never held a job. He lived with his parents in Pomona, CA until about 23 years ago when his parents turned him over to the state. The legal guardian of Alvaro is his younger brother and my father, Reynaldo Nava. The younger brother will not disclose where Alvaro is. Reynaldo Nava works as a surgeon at Baldwin Park Kaiser and he hides information of Alvaro like a dirty secret. How can I find my uncle, Alvaro Nava?"
54,I don’t know what to title but this is my first (not really) post but I’m drowning,"So I did my makeup today, however shortly after I remove it. Not only how I hate the makeup that I do but whenever I look into the mirror I hate every portion of my face and body! It’s as if that I want to edit every part of my body just to look beautiful. 

I’ve always dealt with low self esteem and low confidence since elementary days and it got worse during my junior year in high school not to mention also in college. 

I’ve always considered cosmetic surgery. However, my family would disowned me despite that I’m doing this in order for me to at least feel beautiful and regain my self confidence as I also have a strong negative perception about my body (in other words worse body image if that makes sense) 

I’ve always been so envious of these glow up videos that I see on Instagram and YouTube. Like how do you even transform from a potato to an actual goddess? 

Anyways I’m sorry if this is senseless that’s all."

56,I've come to a realisation that I often pass the buck,"I can't help it. I seem to have a default setting of covering myself and it's crept into my work. I'm an operator and when logging an incident today, my boss (it can't be good that he's said something) made a comment about my report saying that I did well to cover myself and include all documents to show why something wasnt done right.

As soon as I realised this, I'm thinking back on all other times I've done this without knowing it at the time - no matter how small the incident and both work and personal related. I automatically overexplain myself and cover all bases, I think in a way to avoid responsibility. I don't even know if I'm explaining this right. If my boss has made a comment, it's definitely been said before without me realising what was meant by the comment.

How do I break this habit??

57,Some dark thoughts,"CW: death

I'll probably delete this later so I'm sorry about that.

For the past 4 to 8 months I've been in a a really bad rut but today is the first day I thought about dying. I was driving and I thought ""wouldn't it be great if another car just crashed into me"". 

I haven't thought like this before. Should I be concerned? I'm not sure if I should tell anyone. What does it mean?"

59,Landed an interview at job I wanted!,"I’ve been feeling like shit lately. I’m a manager at my current job barely getting paid above minimum wage and my boss won’t budge with my hourly pay. 

I applied to a few serving jobs a few weeks ago. I didn’t think I’d have any luck given the shutdown with restaurants. Well today I got a call and was offered an interview at one of the places I applied to!

I really hope I get the job. The interview is tomorrow. Even if I don’t get it this has helped boost my confidence and my hope for a better work situation. Wish me luck :)"
60,I just need some advice or support,"recently, Ive been very unhappy and overall just really sad. I have more bad days than good it seems. I have been really good at evaluating a situation and assessing how it will affect me emotionally. it felt like I have really grown to look at my anxiety and mental health from a better perspective, rather than having my anxiety define me which is never has but I'm sure y'all know how it is. These days it seems like I can't watch a youtube video and enjoy it, my mind is elsewhere just constantly in a bad mood. It seems as now I am back at square one and I don't want to be because I have made alot of progress and I am not about to have it go to waste. I worry that my anxiety overloads affect the people around me, especially my boyfriend who is really wonderful. He says I can talk to him about anything, and is there if I need to talk. But I really dont know if its healthy to dump all my problems onto him. Is that too much? I worry. Im really trying to better myself for me so I can stop feeling this way because I really dont want to sit here an accept how sad I am when I know I can take steps to be happier bc I have done it before. Overall, I just think I need some support and advice as im really struggling here, im constantly worrying if people even want to talk to me. If im boring or too sad to want to talk to."
61,How much my school talked about mental health in puberty,"Okay, so this post was originally meant for the teenagers sub, but I decided to post it here.

Before I start I want to say that Im 15 and I have some issues with mental health. Im very emotional a lot of the time and kinda unstable. Im not mentaly unstable to the point where I would snap and do something crazy but my mind is just a crazy mess now. I dont think I have any mental disorders even tho there is possibility for that. I wont explain the whole thing because Im not doing this post for that. I heard that your head can be a mess in puberty and it probably is because of that but I never imagined it could be such a mess and here is one reason why:

I finished elementary school this year. Idk how school system works where you are from but here there is kindergarden to age ~6 then middle/elementary/primary school from ages ~6 to ~15, then 4 years of high school and then college. You can also go to high school for 5 years but then you cant go to college. The last four years we had these presentations about puberty and other things like that. About 1-3 per year. They were presented by people who work in places where they work with that kinda things like teens and stuff I dont really know but they are specialized in that kinda things. It was fun having these presentations. They talked aboult all kinda things that can happen in puberty or in everyday life like on the internet for example. But they almost never mentioned mental health. All they mentioned is that we might get more emotional and that we might fight with our parents a lot or that we might feel ""more rebellious"" and that we will need friends if that counts as something because I think it has to do with mental health. They did a good job with other stuff but all Im saying is that schoold dont talk enough about mental health issues or mental health in general. Idk we'll see how will my high school be about that next year.

 Im still learning about mental health so if anyone know anything about mental health in puberty or think that it could be something else or just anything feel free to share. 

Im sorry for all the grammar mistakes.

Stay safe everyone and have a great week. Bye :)

Edit: If Im making this post here I would also like to say thank you to everybody here for helping not just me but also others. Thank you."

63,My schedule got pushed to 12am-8am. What can I do to ease my anxiety about this?,"I'm terrified. Terrified that my skills will suffer. Terrified that this will affect my body and mental health. I'm worried that I won't be getting real sleep. That I'll be stuck in a constant loop of depression. My mental health deteriorates without proper sleep or a normal schedule. My brain is telling me that I'm some weirdo because I now have to go to bed at 5am and wake up at around 2...like a bum. My ex would give me endless streams of shit when I'd sleep past 9am. Even if I was working late that night. I fear that has caused a lot of anxiety with me about my sleep schedule.   


Sorry. I'm anxious. These words might not connect to anyone. If anyone out there has advice, or has worked night shifts....talk to me. Please?"

66,Actors in psych ward?,"Has anyone ever been to a ward where they bring in actors acting as patients during the evaluation and watch for your triggers and try to mess with you or make you uncomfortable?? Had an experience where they filled the room up with people who here little parts of me all mixed up. Every piece of my personality there was a different actor. When i would ball my fist up one of the voices would go MAN FUCK THIS SHIT FIGHT ME BITCH.... and similar actions for different things i was doing.. at least 20 actors were used. They have tricky mirrors all around the place and illusions throughout the evaluation room too to see if your bugging out. Cameras inside the clocks, plants, chairs, everything...."

68,I’m completely empty,"I am empty

I don’t feel anything from doing anything anymore. Nothing inspires me or makes want to keep going on in life, there’s no reason for me to keep on living it feels like everyone is done with me by this point. I really don’t care but isolating so much for the past couple of years has made me think so much about everything and now I just feel empty and dead inside. I wanna say I’m happy about hanging out with friends or happy that my puppy is healthy but it doesn’t feel like any of those things will ever happen because I don’t think I’m in the position to care about anything anymore. The only thing I do in life is waste time. I am completely drained by everything and it feels like there will never be a reason for me to keep on living. I don’t wanna kill myself just yet because I’m afraid of it getting better and don’t wanna lose an opportunity for my life to be fixed but that glimpse of hope is slowly fading away and having that as the only thing keeping me alive isn’t gonna do much when things get much worse. I am really in no position to complain, my life was looking good but I don’t know what happened, everything just disappeared, my friends, family, and overall human connection which has just put me into a complete state of denial. I don’t think life is worth anything because even if I find happiness and build a life for myself it will inevitably end and disappear as I take my last breathe. I’m just warped in an entire feeling of nothingness that is not going away anytime soon and I don’t think anyone will ever be able to fix that and make me function with purpose again.
Thanks if you read this I guess but I just need a place to let out my thoughts or something."

I love both cooking and showering when I feel okay but sometimes I have a hard time making myself do anything. What do you guys do?"
71,I honestly just want to blow my brains out. No one cares anyway.,I’m so alone. I’ve never had anyone on my side let alone real friends. I’ve been betrayed and taken advantage of my whole life. I already attempted suicide when I was 17. (I’m now 20) and my life isn’t any better. I know for a fact that some of you who will read this will think “pfft 20 years old? This guy is a pussy grow a pair” well it’s not that easy. I’ve tried everything from therapy to medication. Nothing helps. I guess I’ll never find happiness. If any of you even care anyway.
72,"feeling overwhelmed, hopeless, and insecure.","today i went to the lake with a close friend. we ordered sushi, drank red bull, sunbathed, and bought some tea at target. it was fun and all, but all of a sudden i got this overwhelming feeling in my head and chest. a heavy pressure. a bunch of thoughts flooded in at once. 

my relationship with my dad is unhealthy and i don’t think it’s fixable anymore.his comments about my body, he’s manipulative, his mental state even makes me feel more depressed, and still hasn’t recovered from his divorce in 10 years ago and still makes me feel horrible about it.

my future. it seems so far and difficult. i graduate in 5 months and i have no clue what i’ll be doing afterwards. i don’t know what to do with my life. i don’t feel i’ll be successful.

my boyfriend. sometimes i feel like i’m not getting what i need, but i want to work everything out with him. i’m feeling sad now, he went to sleep, and i wish he would stay up with me a little longer or at least try to help me feel better. but he wakes early for work so i feel bad keeping him up. it’s hard to vent to him. he’s never had problems with depression or anxiety. he’s a very determined and hardworking guy, and i respect him for that.

i wish i had my own source of income to buy those paintbrushes or new fabric for my embroidery, or that body scrub that smells like vanilla cupcakes. you know, to treat yourself a little bit. i want a job to keep busy, but with the recent corona spikes it’s very difficult to find a job— especially in a small town.

i might be having to get rid of my two month kitten because the smell is too overwhelming. he’s my pride and joy and my parents think one cat is enough. i’m trying to find solutions like baking soda and other deodorizers but i haven’t found anything yet.

i have frequent utis. every other week. i wish i was kidding. i finally got a referral to go to a urologist but continuously having these infections make my heart sink to my stomach. the pain and uncomfortable is simply too much.

i wish i could live a normal life. happy most of the time, not getting sick every other week, being well-rounded... but it seems too much to ask."

75,How do you know when you found a therapist/counselor that's right for you?,"I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, low self esteem, etc.. for years and in the last 3-4 yrs i have probably seen over 10 different counselors/therapists (forget what is what at this point they all feel like the same really) but i have never really left a session once thinking that this person is actually guiding me towards a better me as my life keeps spiraling down and out of control.. it sometimes just seems like they all have that sales pitch you see in scammy ads where they egg on about eventually showing you the ways to get better then when the fund dry up or my free sessions are soon to end they just tell me we can't get to where we need to go unless i keep seeing them. But all i feel is like i'm paying 120$ to be told see you next week.

At this point i'm willing to even drop 300$ per session if i see a therapist that actually asks and engages with my situation and can help me bounce from this eternal dread.

I'm just tired of investing so much money and time into the wrong therapist who says pretty little things until i catch that we aren't going anywhere.

To anyone that has found success with a therapist/counselor, how did you know it was a good fit? any advice to someone who hasn't found a good fit?

I think personally, i always expected that if you're paying for the service it's because you're essentially going in saying ""look somethings fucking wrong with me but i don't know what/how/why it is, please help me fix it"" but i'm never found with a supportive counselor like that. I thought the very least they're meant to do is probe right? too many times i'm left at awkward pauses because i don't know what to talk about and they don't ask me a damn thing. I was raised in an emotionally abusive household where i was raised to hide and not acknowledge any of my problems but yet you expect me to know how to convey these problems for the first time to total stranger randomly? that's why i'm here in the first place!

Sorry for the rant.. i'm just sick of being told there's a problem but never actually be shown a solution"
76,My life just keeps getting worse and worse,"It’s not even like I’m not hopeful. If I wasn’t I would’ve killed myself by now. But it’s just so fucking frustrating to constantly be hoping and wishing and assuming that my life will get better and it progressively gets worse and worse. Parents are always fighting at home. Can’t get worse? Parents get divorce and still fight all the time. Can’t get worse? Mom gets new boyfriend who is an ass. Can’t get worse? He’s actually completely insane even though we become very close and I love him. After a traumatizing 5 years he goes to jail after trying to kill my mom. Can’t get worse? I become bulimic and develop a bunch of health problems. Can’t get worse? I leave my school where i feel so comfortable and happy to go to a shit school with kids I hate but at least i have my brother and people to do drugs with. Can’t get worse? I become a drug addict, I get an exchange student who is a fucking asshole that I hate who makes me so uncomfortable, brother leaves for college and dad randomly moves to Switzerland for a girl then she dumps him as he gets there! So great! Can’t get worse? I can never go to my sleepaway camp again and it’s literally been my entire life for 8 years and the only place I’ve ever really been happy and carefree and corona is apparently the cherry on top! But what do I have not to be grateful for. I’m just a spoiled bitch who should be happy and I need a reality check but I’m just so fucking sad and it’s times like this where I ask myself...is there really any hope? I’m holding on by a thread but I’m holding on so tight and it’s like everyone and everyone are trying to snip away at it every chance they get. I’m lost"
77,Feeling a lack of emotion and could use some advice,"I’ll make this as short as I can because this post could be a novel if I don’t stop myself, lol. Thanks to whoever takes the time to read it :)

Im 17F and have usually been a very emotional person.  All through high school I would be the first person to cry during a movie, and I’d always empathize with others. Then, 2020 hit. My mental health began to crumble and I was diagnosed with Pure O OCD. My OCD obsession is that I believe that I might be a sociopath. I‘ve had good weeks and bad weeks since January, but this obsession has stemmed from my recent lack of emotion. For some reason, I feel like my emotions have turned themselves off. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel empathy for others. Hell, I don’t even feel fear anymore. 

My therapist attributes this feeling to depression, which I disagree with. I have been depressed before, and this is not how I experienced it in the past. I dont experience the typical symptoms of depression like loss of appetite (although food has lost its taste now) and trouble sleeping. I feel myself pulling away from friends, though. 

I guess my question is how do I bring up lost emotions again? Could I have turned into a sociopath? Everyone Ive asked for reassurance from says no, but I don’t know what caused this complete shut off of emotion. Thanks for any and all advice, and Im happy to answer more questions."

79,Struggling with self esteem and confidence,"Hi, (27/M/gay) and I am really struggling with my self confidence, appearance, and overall feeling about myself. I have a good job (not a great location). And I am in a relationship that is going well. But I keep feeling inadequate and not good enough for him, my career, and so on. I haven’t gotten a lot of sleep in the past few weeks (or I’m oversleeping) because my mind keeps racing. And I recognize them as thought traps (have a graduate degree in counseling/psychology) and they’re centering around “you’re not good enough for him” or “he’s going to leave you for someone sexier (or handsomer, etc)” or “your career isn’t going anywhere”. Any advice on how to break out of those? Tried CBT-type thought exercises but nothing is working and I keep feeling lower and lower."

81,Questions about psych ward,"Depending on how some things go, I may consider voluntarily checking myself into a psych ward. I currently have no income and no insurance. If it was absolutely necessary, I would do it even if I had to pay for the whole thing, having to declare to bankruptcy is probably better than being dead from a rational point of view. For people who have had a similar experience, did you find being in a psych ward helpful, and was paying for it difficult?"
82,The weather is perfect and I feel miserable,"I’m missing out on my own life. I’ve been depressed since I was like 9 y/o and refused to admit it in fear of being seen as just another kid trying to be edgy. I missed the most important phase of my life to learn how to socialize and became extremely socially awkward. I just can’t function as a normal social being. I can’t even say hi back to people and whenever I try to make conversation I can just see the disappointment or confusion in their eyes and I die inside a little. I see wonderful people around me just pass by my life because I don’t know how to establish relationships. 

But no one points it out or thinks I need help because I go to a renowned uni and do well in grades. People just think I’m weird or “quirky” when in reality I’m just broken and malfunctioning. Right now it’s fine because I’m just a student but I’m not sure I could be accepted in the society when I graduate. My parents think I can do things on my own, that I figured out most things I need when in reality it’s completely opposite. I have no direction in my life. I don’t know what I want or what I can do and wasting my youth. I make many plans out of anxiety and fail to do anything afterwords.

And I have no one to talk to about it. I have very few friends and they are all suffering from mental health issue, probably way more severe than mine and they simply don’t have space in their heart to listen to or care about my problems. I can’t tell my parents either. When mom found out I was seeing psychiatrist and taking medication she was heartbroken and acted extra careful around me which made me feel even worse. And my dad just doesn’t understand and he always ends up preaching about things that honestly isn’t meaningful or helpful to me. And my s.o — they’re struggling so much, usually I’m the one who’s trying to fix things for them and when I open up about my deepest feelings I just make them more depressed and it turns out to be all about them again, which feel like shit. 

I just want my life back. This isn’t supposed to be who I am or how I am now. I need advice, I need mentor, someone to lean on, someone to help me direct my life. And I have nothing."
83,"I know I'm the problem, but I don't know how to fix it.","Alot of my life I've gone around thinking everyone is shitty, but I've come to the realization that I'm definitely the problem. I put on this fake confident persona because I don't have any real confidence and I lash out and am really defensive when I feel I've been slighted. I know all this, I know I'm a bad person, I know I have issues, but I can't fix it. I don't even know where to start. It's like looking at a landfill and deciding to clear the area for a garden all while trucks are still dumping trash. Even if I make a change, that doesn't make up for how awful I've been in the past.   
Would therapy even help at this point? I've tried it but I never get very far. I'm on medication for my anxiety, but I've begun to feel like it doesn't do anything. Am I just a lost cause? Has anyone been where I am? What do I do?"

90,Tired of life,"I’m so done with my life,
My life will end after all.
Everything comes to a stop soon,
So what is the point of staying alive?

Staying alive when we are destined for death,
Is there something I’m not seeing from my window,
or is it something else that’s blocking my vision?

I’m just a little girl that no one likes,
and is too quiet to even ask for something simple.
My mask hides my broken self,
which is coming close to a breaking point.

No one suspects the little girl of age 13 to be so god damn weak inside."
91,I literally have no friends...,"When I see something funny I have no one to send it to, when it’s the weekend, I have no one to go out with, I feel so alone and useless and pointless like I’m just bored and sick and tired of this I feel as if nobody cares about me and I don’t know what to do anymore I’m only 15 still in high school like Its idk how to explain it but as in as soon as I leave school nobody talks to me/asks me to go out with them, like I don’t even know what to do anymore I feel very sad and alone and I just can’t take it anymore also I always try to keep occupied so I don’t have to think about the fact that I have no friends, I’m always trying to keep busy, I just don’t know what to do anymore i can’t take it anymore I feel as if nobody cares about me also I feel ugly and useless
Edit: I’m feeling better I calmed down, spoke to one of my friends who I got in a fight with months ago and we made up and we agreed that after this lockdown is over we’ll go out. I’m also going to be more outgoing, when I go back to school I’ll try to be more open and ask people if they want to go out. I also will try to think less about things and let things go and not worry so much and know that things will get better soon, I’m going to try to be more calm and happy, and relaxed."
92,I envy those who have died unexpectedly,"Or just passed away in general, especially for those who were making a difference. Why did they have to die when there’s me? Me who is unproductive, not smart, not making a difference. Me who is just coasting through life. I’m not looking for pity. I’m just over it. I’m really not contributing anything to society. I’m taking up space, I’m depleting resources. 

I’m also tired of seeing destruction &amp; unrest. The older I get, the more I realize there are bad people in the world. The older I get, the more I notice injustices in the world. I’m tired of fighting &amp; the constant defending. 

I wouldn’t define myself as suicidal. Yes I want to die but I don’t want to kill myself. It’s funny because I’m able to tell someone they are worth living for X amount of reasons. I just can’t tell myself that because I’m tired. It’s just one worry after the next. In my teens I worried if I’ll graduate high school. Then it was will I get into college? Then it was will I graduate from college? Then it was will I find a job after college? Then it was will I keep this job? Now my job will become obsolete October 1, so now my new worry is will I find another job? Another worry is will I be able to make as much as I did before? &amp; it’s not even just jobs that worry me. When I wakeup I think “what is a new problem the world is going through now?” Oh mass elephant deaths in Botswana. Oh the Arctic is melting due to global warming. Oh someone killed a baby bear in my neighborhood. Oh a whale was found died choking on plastic. It doesn’t stop. I want it to stop.

I just want to close my eyes &amp; not wake up. 

I want to add, I really won’t harm myself. I’m safe in my room with my thoughts."

94,You ever feel like everyone hates you?,"Just having one of those days where I feel like no matter what I do everyone is just hating me. Sometimes I say shit I shouldn't say but it's never my intention to be rude.

95,Don't know what to do anymore,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old student currently doing a final internship to graduate my Human Resource Management bachelor. My bachelors usually takes 4 years but I'm now in my 6th year, also due to a gap year. After that gap year I felt great and finished with good grades. But ever since I started my final internship in February I've been extremely unsure about myself. 

I have been struggling with my mental health since high school, I was bullied for 2 years which severly damaged my self esteem. Right now I don't feel confident whatsoever that I'm going to graduate in October. I'm having light panic attacks whenever I go to the office, not being able to be productive and constantly thinking about the worst case scenarios. 

Worst of all is that currently my therapist and my coach (every student at my college is assigned one) are both on vacation so I can't speak to them untill mid August. I want to speak to the person at my internship who manages/mentors me about the whole situation (she knows a little and we already decided to cut worktime from 5 days a week to 3) but I'm worried that she is fed up with my issues and that I come off as unprofessional and lose my internship. On the one hand I would'nt even mind starting all over again at a different company but on the other hand that would mean that I failed again, have to spend more money paying for my degree, etc.  I'm so close to my diploma but totally does'nt feel like it. I feel that I'm on my own, my fantastic GF tries very hard to console me but it's like she doesnt really understand (which I get, it's so complicated, for me too).

Right now I'm in the office, not knowing whether to stay or just go home and give up. I feel nauseous just thinking about doing the work that I have to do. I can't trust myself that tomorrow is going to be a better day and I don't know what to do. 

I hope you understand my situation, I feel like there's so much more to say but I don't really know what, my memory is very clouded and can't really think straight."
96,I really just cant with my brain anymore,"
I really just can’t with my brain anymore.  I just can’t.  It’s not even me anymore.  It’s a machine that runs—it’s not even productive, I can’t even remember or synthethize my thoughts—it just runs just to mock me.  It feels like my brain is a slot machine and any productive or healthy or correct, sensible, intelligent thought, is really just a statistically inevitable jackpot resulting from me pulling the lever as fast as I can as many times as I can.  Like I wanna be lobotomized so I can finally have some peace

98,I feel as if I don’t know myself because I never got to grow up normally,I don’t really know myself and I don’t know where to start to understand myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m just all of my mental illnesses and symptoms all added up into one. I never got to have a normal childhood or normal teenage-years. I just went through trauma and never got to do the same things others got to do the same age as me. Now I still feel like I’m still a teenager and don’t know who I am at all. Does anyone else feel like this?
99,Why do thoughts of dying comfort me?,"It's quite embarrassing to be making this post. But I'm almost worried? I really just don't want to live anymore, I feel like my life is one big suffering ferris wheel, no matter what i do, try or whatever, the outcome always leads to suffering. Even when things do 'get better' and I feel good I find myself worse off than before. 

Doesn't that mean my life will eventually lead to a horrible death anyway? I hate to sound like a victim honestly, I'm pretty strong but my attitude recently has been whats the point in all of this? I feel really empty, disillusioned and hopeless. Maybe it's just depression. 

I don't know if I'm asking for help or advice or whether someone has had a similar experience. But what is this actual feeling?"
100,Here’s My Mental Health Story In Dewsbury Priestley Unit Hospital UK England,Here’s a link https://youtu.be/a2-SKY8h55o
101,Is it even worth trying to find a therapist?,"I’ve been in a near-crisis state for awhile now and I feel like part of me logically knows that I need to find some sort of professional help, but I’ve had such bad experiences trying to seek mental health care that I’m honestly a little bit cynical about it and also just scared. 


My first experiences with “therapy” were when I was in middle school and made the mistake of posting dance videos on YouTube, which lead to me being in contact with a lot of predators and my laptop being confiscated by the police when they found out. I had a couple mandatory meetings with a psychiatrist and they were just... weird. I had a lot of issues with my mom and whenever this came up he would always steer the topic towards intrusive questions about my moms sex life, to which I had no answer, but he would press. He went as far as to ask me if she was a prostitute, which he had no reason to believe, except for maybe wishful thinking (my mom was fairly young and very conventionally attractive). I would also refer to some of the men who talked to me as pedophiles, which would make him get annoyed and correct me about the distinction between pedophile/hebephile/ephebephile which I guess was valid, but I was calling them pedophiles as a way to express my disgust, obviously not as a diagnosis (I was 12/13) and as a kid with an interest in psychology, he kinda made me feel really stupid with the way he went about it. Anyway I was just not comfortable speaking with him for a variety of reasons and I was pretty happy when my sessions with him were up and I moved on to a family therapist instead. So I had my first session with the therapist, and when going over the basics of recounting what had brought me there, she was just incredibly rude to me over seemingly everything. She outright accused me of lying a few times over stupid things, one of which was my follower count on YouTube (which was like 1000 or something not even something unreasonable). Thankfully my mom was there for that session and knew I was telling the truth and didn’t want me to see her again. So I bounced around a couple of different therapists, but was always too nervous to talk about anything with them in fear of being insulted or disbelieved. 


Fast forward to high school, I develop a pretty bad problem with self harm. I was brought to the hospital a few times because of it and it was generally the same deal. Get cleaned up, referred to a psychiatrist a week later, they’d tell me to get more sleep or eat better or something and refer me to a therapist, never see therapist, rinse, repeat. Until I had a particularly bad night where I drank an obscene amount of alcohol, slashed up my wrists and throat really bad, and tried to jump out of a window. My wounds weren’t as serious as they looked so they gave me some first aid supplies and instructed me to wash and bandage my own wounds, then told me I’d have to wait in the family room (small waiting room with just a couch and a table with some tissues, no bed/washroom) until the psychiatrist arrived at 11am (it was maybe 1am). I got really frantic and begged them to just let me go home. They said no and I tried to run out of the hospital, so they locked me in the family room for the night, without water or anything. I just felt so trapped and helpless that I ended up having probably one of the worst mental breakdowns of my life over the next few hours, tearing out my hair and clawing up my face and feeling more suicidal than I had felt before. By the time the psychiatrist arrived I had calmed down a bit though, and I told her that I was just drunk and I didn’t feel suicidal anymore, and that was that. She made a follow up appointment that I didn’t go to and I refused at all costs to be taken to a hospital from that point on. 


But after a few tough years, things eventually did look up for me. I kind of developed my own coping mechanisms and although I definitely still had issues, I got by fine enough. Until one night I decided to have ONE beer with a “friend” of mine that I had been avoiding due to exam season. He drugged me, held me against my will for hours, and repeatedly assaulted me. I ended up having to go to my academic advisor to defer an exam, because 24 hours after being drugged I was still feeling confused and groggy. I told her the truth because I didn’t know what else to do and she honestly handled it very well, setting me up immediately with a counselor. This was definitely my best therapy experience so far, but it just wasn’t a good fit. She would often recommend essential oils, which just aren’t something I find particularly useful to be quite honest. But she was nice enough and meant well so I kept seeing her for awhile even though it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere, i thought maybe once we got to know each other better I’d open up more and she’d be more able to help me. Anyway it got to a point where I was having very intense, debilitating flashbacks to the night and the next session, she came prepared with something she had “typed up” to help me. She decided to read it aloud to me and it was basically saying like “it’s normal to experience these symptoms after trauma” and it went into a list... which turned into bed-wetting, and asking to sleep with your parents... and then she realized that she had accidentally printed an article about childhood PTSD. And I know she meant well, but I just didn’t see the point in going to a therapist for advice I’d be better at googling myself. 


Anyway my symptoms ended up getting better for awhile, but I don’t know if it’s isolation, or the upcoming court case that keeps getting pushed back, or graduation anxiety, or what, but my mental health is NOT good. I’ve slipped back into self harm on a few occasions now and I’ve been having extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It’s getting to the point where I don’t know what to do, and I KNOW I need help, but I don’t know where to get it. I don’t know if I could afford it. And honestly I just don’t know if it’s worth it."
102,Feared for my life a few hours ago. Be carefull.,"Quick lesson for yall. 
Learn from my experience. 
Got stopped by a crip a couple hours ago at midnight and he kept trynna get me in his car and wouldnt take no for an answer. Blue busted up car, blue bandanna over his chin and he was eying my sony headphones with his hand over his chin as if he was considering doing some shit. I said have a good day and hinted at me living real close, that my friend was behind me and once i got away i immediately called someone to pick me up. Watched to see he didnt follow me and walked hella fast. Stressfull and scary as shit. I know it wasnt natural because he damn near drove across the whole parking lot to almost stop in front of me. Thank you for listening to things like this. I appreciate it. Make sure you dont make my mistake and walk half a block down to albertsons for razors at midnight. Not even that far smh. Im only fucking 17 and i gotta worry for my life and worry about walking to the store. Im lucky, he couldve done whatever because i wasnt strapped with anything. Thank god for witnesses and my ability to keep cool and not panick. Sorry, just had to vent. Life sucks. Maybe he wanted to roll up on me because im white. God knows that people are using these protests as an excuse to hate. I have love for anybody that took the time to read this. Be carefull, especially nowadays. He was dumb. If he wanted to rob, murder, or do some shit, all he had to do was roll up quietly and wait till i got to a dark area and jump out and club me in the back, shoot me, chokehold, or whatever. I understand that hatred and anger at life and the desire to do things like that but i always let my morals control that desire. I used to walk out in the middle of the night armed with a pocket knife hoping someone would attack me and that I would have an excuse to unleash that pent up anger, rage, and hatred. Ive since learned a lil self love and learned to value myself again. That why i got scared. If this were a year ago, i dont even know what i would have done or wanted to do, due to my lack of self care and anger i have towards society. It wouldve probably got me killed. Whoever took the time to read this, i have an immense love for your compassion and desire to listen to others (if that was the intention). This world is soo fucked up and it often makes me want to stop caring again. All love, stay safe. As a man, i have this inner desire to protect. I want to remind people to be careful."
103,Out of touch with reality?,"I am 15 years old and noticed recently that I’ve been imagining/thinking about things obviously not real. For example i was watching a superhero movie and pointed my finger at something legitimately thinking i would be able to shoot a laser out of my finger. I have been noticing these types of things more and more over the past few months and was wondering if this was some kind of mental disorder. I do have a sleeping problems where no matter how early/late i sleep, i always wake up at a similar time 6-7am. This happened every day, weekend or weekday and maybe lack of sleep could be causing this?"

106,6 Fears and How to Overcome Them," 

BEFORE approaching the fundamental principles upon which this lesson is founded it will be of benefit to you to keep in mind the fact that it is practical – that it brings you the discoveries of more than twenty-five years of research that it has the approval of the leading scientific men and women of the world who have tested every principle involved.

Skepticism is the deadly enemy of progress and self-development. You might as well lay this book aside and stop right here as to approach this lesson with the feeling that it was written by some long-haired theorist who had never tested the principles upon which the lesson is based.

Surely this is no age for the skeptic because it is an age in which we have seen more of Nature’s laws uncovered and harnessed than had been discovered in all past history of the human race. Within three decades we have witnessed the mastery of the air; we have explored the ocean; we have all but annihilated distances on the earth; we have harnessed the lightning and made it turn the wheels of industry; we have made seven blades of grass grow where but one grew before; we have instantaneous communication between the nations of the world. 

Truly, this is an age of illumination and unfoldment, but we have as yet barely scratched the surface of knowledge. However, when we shall have unlocked the gate that leads to the secret power which is stored up within us it will bring us knowledge that will make all past discoveries pale into oblivion by comparison.

107,what is this,"when i feel anxious or stressed I zone out and my vision goes fuzzy (not to the point I cant see just like medium fuzzy fucks me how to word it)  i feel like my depth perception is different in some way and like my consciousness is more inside my skull than seeing through my eyes.

sorry if this isnt the place or if anything else is wrong about this post I just need answer"
108,I have no coherent thoughts,"Lately I have been really restless. I’ve been spending pretty much every day straight working out, followed by studying because I have nothing else to do. I feel like I am doing things but I’m not really present for them. When I try to use my brain for anything, it just falls flat. Even when I’m talking, I just let the words come out of my mouth rather than thinking about what I want to say first, which is usually the complete opposite of me, as someone who tends to over-think everything. I feel like my brain is super full and it’s just kinda flatlined or moving so fast that it feels like it’s not moving at all. I can focus on things, like studying, for hours at a time but I’m not really ‘thinking’, per se, I’m just ‘doing’. Anything I can do to help this? It’s never really happened before, I’m used to thinking about everything really hard before I do anything, maybe a little too much, I just feel like I need a balance between the two."
109,"Dor all of you out there, I have something you can try to self-help","This app(MyLife Mediation by Stop. Breathe. Think) helps me a lot: it is based around grounding yourself and processing your feelings, thoughts, grudges ect., through mindful meditation. 
These sessions are really short, the longest I've found is 15 minutes but they are generally around 2 to 3 minutes long. You chose the narrator too, based on what you want to do.
The sessions can also be simple, like drawing your attention to sensations or actions. One is even having a cup of tea and being aware of how it makes you feel, the taste ect. 
You also get recommendations on how you are feeling, mentally and physically. 
So guys, give this a go.

I have also looked through the terms of use: they don't sell or distribute you data, unlike other apps like Headspace- who track most of you social media accounts - so it's completely anonymous.

How can I stop feeling like a loser?,"I was a summer intern for three weeks at a startup and yesterday I was told that I was bad at my job and I would be fired. I believed my boss was not being transparent about his reasons and I told him as such. Things got tense and he yelled and cursed at me.

I didn't care much, as it was an unpaid internship. It did however, have the opportunity for a full time job at the end. That night, I was informed that I got rejected from a master's programme. This is the fifth one I've applied to, and all have rejected me.

115,How I ended up in behavioral health hospital,[deleted]
116,"Feel like I’m living in Groundhogs day, struggling what feels like a never ending cycle in my life.",[removed]
117,"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out","To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&amp;#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&amp;#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact"

I also desperately need a job, so I am putting so much pressure on myself too. I almost feel like giving up completely, but I can't afford to.

125,conflicting emotions-DAE?,Like sometimes I really want to cocoon myself from this world and not have to deal with this adult bullshit. I want to become a baby again and just curl up in a ball in my bed. Like then there is a part of me yearning for human connection. And I also seek exciting and novel experiences and I want to be stimulated and have fun. Like I want to indulge in all my hedonistic pleasures and engage all my reward receptors and increase my dopamine levels.
126,Why couldn’t I have been born a fly,To not have a complex enough brain to experience pain and suffering. To act by animal drive without conscious thought. It’s a beautiful thought.
127,Should I apologize to someone who is also a jerk?,"Let’s say I’ve done bad things to people and they also have done bad things to me. Is it worth apologizing to them if they aren’t also going to apologize for their mistakes? Isn’t it unfair if I’m the only one apologizing?

Context: My friends and I. I seem like the only one who is apologizing always, and I never heard any apologies from them, and I feel like I’m a piece of shit because of it. I don’t feel heard at all."
128,Feeling like im useless,"Everybody is always telling me I’m a great person and that i am not useless, but somedays i feel completely useless. 

I am not smart when it comes to school and I’m in my 3rd year of college barely passing. I make so many stupid impulsive mistakes that it feels like i just don’t have a brain. I feel like no matter how nice i am to people, people walk all over me. 

Sometimes i feel so useless that i consider being dead the best option. I feel like nobody needs me anymore (no matter how much my family, friends or Boyfriend say) 

If anyone has advice, feel free to comment"
129,Anyone else have their own imaginary/fantasy happy space?,"I know this is going to sound weird, but does anyone else have any sort of ""imaginary/fantasy happy space""?

As in a place you have in your head where you can just be to separate yourself from reality. ""Imaginary friends"" and a fantasy like life that you know is fake, but you bring it out randomly when you're by yourself to help cope with a situation or just clear your head, entertain yourself, or whatever it may be?

For me, it helps. My ""fantasy life"" I'm rich and famous and can live my life however I want, and people on the outside looking in love me and appreciate my quirkiness. Having a small circle of ""imaginary friends"" I pretend I play against when playing video games. Or ones I just pretend are present when I'm talking to inside my head when I need to vent or hype myself up. Weirdly enough, the ""people"" who ""know"" me best, like me the most, let me be who I am, are ones I create inside my head.

At times things connect between real life and imaginary life, almost like imaginary life is a TV show version of my real life."
130,"For All I've Lost On The Road, and Found.","The Road is long and paved with many hazard signs and bright red flags to direct your way, to make you aware of the jagged edges where the footpath ends, to keep you from getting lost. It's a Road that contains many distractions as well, for it is a well used thoroughfare and the feet upon it are many. 

Cracked and broken in places, smooth and treacherous in others; its a difficult road to walk upon, so much so that many choose not to walk at all. At the Road's entrance, piles upon piles of what appear to be rags lay everywhere. Torn and dirty, almost colourless with age... until they begin to move, or groan. They sit huddled together staring down the road, with a mixture of fear and wanting in their eyes. These barely human souls, sitting with their demons to keep them company, are forever lost - frozen in their indecision to move forward.

It is, of course, their choice to see the journey ahead as one containing nothing but fear and pain. It's certainly a valid observation to make from a surface level, but once the terrible/beautiful knowledge that is Recovery is fully known, it cannot be unknown. It is this knowledge, and fear of the Road itself that scares these lost souls more than anything else ever has, paralysing them there in place at the entrance to the Road and all that awaits those who reach Recovery.

There's a tide of traffic to walk against, quite thick at the start and a few dodgy corners along the way. It can almost seem to bottleneck at times. This tide is also barely human, but it's still a great deal more alive than the rag piles at the start. A horde of walking dead, going back the way they came, zombies with very little interest in brains. They walk with conviction mostly, no matter how broken their bodies may appear to be. Briskly, matter of fact-like, eyes fixed firmly on the horizon where their old demons await to greet them as long lost friends. There are a few amongst the tide who walk hesitantly, looking over their shoulders. They are wondering if they should turn around and walk back towards the goal, feet shuffling as they argue with themselves. They try to shake the fear from their hearts at the thought of returning, and wonder if the host of new demons that had come to dance with the old were really as awful as they seemed.

No one stops on the Road. 
They run, walk, stagger in every which direction, some even drifting past the hazard signs and red flags at the edges... but they don't stop. The edges of the Road are even more treacherous than the road itself. The soft shoulder is deceptively spacious and wide, dotted haphazardly with the warning signs and red flags. Some choose to weave through these obstacles instead of walking the road itself. The way is easier at first glance. Far less foot traffic, soft earth to walk upon, just some ducking and weaving. These people walk with a variety of speeds and in all directions also... but those who duck and weave past the signs move fastest of all. They dodge words like ""DANGER"" and ""NO HUMANS BEYOND THIS POINT"". Flags flap in their faces as they impatiently push past, the red fabric unnoticed as they move on. Hurry, hurry, Recovery is just ahead, or was it back there? It all depends on the direction they're choosing to take. Only two are recommended.

You may have gathered this already, but the Road is a rough place to be. A place for the damned perhaps, or those who refuse to see life in all of its beautiful yet terrible glory. It is a place for the ghosts of Pain and Addiction, a place where they wail and scream for the attention of the walkers, showing each soul whatever horrible vision they believe will lead them off the road for good. Whether its back to the start, or straight off the edge, it makes no difference. The ghosts wait, and watch, and seize travelers at every given opportunity. 
Casting them back with the images of old fears and new insecurities, calling seductively, and at times fighting for the attention of the tide openly. 
They don't want them to reach Recovery, you see, and neither will some of their audience when they do.  

What could possibly make Recovery both so horrible and wonderful all at once, you may wonder? Lets talk about the end of the Road, and perhaps it may become more clear. As the crowd thins and the ground less difficult to walk upon, scores of new demons begin to appear in the distance. Some stride forward with ease, greeting travelers warmly, shaking hands and taking individuals aside, speaking with confidence as they lead them away. Still others shuffle and wail, and shriek of the dangers ahead. 

Some of the demons have names that all can recognise easily - Depression and Anxiety are quite the show stoppers - still others call themselves Past and Present. A host of other demons await, many just vaguely recognisable with blurred nametags that only some travelers recognise. They greet the travelers' existing demons as old friends, and call words of welcome to the ghosts of Addiction and Pain on the sidelines. Such is the welcoming party that awaits our weary travelers. Many will choose to simply turn around at this point, fear and recognition now showing in their dull eyes, their pace quickening as their demons whoop and celebrate. 

Still others take in what appears to be the final stretch of their journey, and try to dive off the side of the road entirely. The signs and flags catch some but not all. Young or old, beautiful or weathered, proud or broken, confused or aware... these people are all different but share one thing in common - the look of puzzled fear on their faces before falling to their doom. You may remember that no one stops on the road, but that only two directions were recommended. The edge of the Road is Death, and it awaits all who choose not to travel. 

The destination isn't much better for some at first. Reality awaits on the other side of the intersection that turns off on the corner of Recovery, and that particular highway is what often drives many back down the Road to the start. The knowledge that the next Road is far more confronting than the first sends many running back at first glance, crashing hard into the arms of the Devil(s) they already know. 

The terrible truth that must be realised for many as they each arrive at what they believe is the end of the Road to Recovery, is to discover that there is a road they must always walk upon, finding the strength within themselves to keep going, taking step after step towards the future. After recovery, they must choose to join the greater tide of people in Reality, regardless.

The Road may be long, the race is certainly hard, but in the end, it really is only with yourself. It may not be an easy journey, but its the only one we have once we've led ourselves astray. Whatever your demons, whatever your ghosts, I pray that you all choose to keep walking. If you keep an eye out, you may even see me strolling beside you one day... but only if you're walking forward."

132,I don't know what to do. I failed my degree.,I won't tell anyone. I am a massive disappointment and failure to my family so they can't know. My dad always told me that I wouldn't achieve anything and it's true.  don't know what to do. I'm a loser. I'm in the UK.  I feel so depressed. I can't be bothered with anything anymore. I'm beginning to not care.
133,Am i a horrible person? Can i forgive myself for this?,"Am i a horrible person? Can i forgive myself for this?
So im ruminating in different life events, stuff that i did in the past and im stuck in one memory that i never seem to be able to forgive my self for. Im feeling extremly ashamed for this and im ruminating if this makes me and horrible person because i read its a serious crime. So im 22 years old and a couple of years ago i watched alot of porn and i stumbled across some child porn videos and actually watched them because i got curious and i can even remember that i got aroused aswell, one girl seemed to be like 12. I even saved a link ( not the video itself) of one girl in a porn video who im pretty sure was underage, (she showed her breast in her webcam nothing else). I was not addicted to this type of porn and i have never done it since then, and i would NEVER do it again. Will this mistake that i comitted in the past make me an horrible person or criminal? I dont know what to do. Sometimes i even want to kill myself because of this. Im not attracted to childs but sometimes i get POCD wich makes me thinks im a pedophile . My sucidial thoughts are killing me.

TL;DR; will this mistake make me a horrible person? I did it a couple of years ago."
134,I’m tired,"I’ve been trying to go out with friends, I reach out, nobody even reacts, not even a reason why they can’t meet up. My parents are hounding me to find new interests because they don’t like how I messed up this school year. I’m 15 and I struggled through my first year of high school. I can’t keep up anymore, I honestly feel like I should just dissapear. I just want to do what I want and just try and keep myself together."
135,It has been four months since my mother died,[deleted]
136,What is wrong with me? Why do I feel this immense guilt?,"I don’t know where to start with this one. I don’t even know how to type this :( 

Years ago, I had some really terrifying instructive thoughts. They were things that I found abhorrent and things that sickened me and that I would never have done in a million years. Whilst changing my nephews nappy, I would think of paedophiles and the terrible things they’d do to young children. I’d try to stop thinking of it because the thought made me feel sick. The more I pushed the thought out, the more it would come back.

This was years ago. I now have my own children and thankfully these thoughts disappeared years ago. 

The problem is, now when I hear stories of paedophiles being caught, arrested and sent to jail, I somehow feel sick to my stomach with guilt. Like I’m just like these people. I know I’ve never done anything like that, never ever would and find the whole thing completely disgusting but for some reason, I still feel this guilt. I feel fear of being caught! Which makes no sense at all because I haven’t done anything.

What is wrong with me? I can’t bear feeling this way any longer. Please help!!"
137,Why DONT i just end it all...,"I tell myself i want to die, but then i also know that people who like me would be sad, but then i tell myself they hate me and they wouldnt care, cant i just decide!!!! I know im a horrbile person and i know i deserve to die, so why dont i just go and kms!!"
138,Did I always have bipolar disorder?,"I was diagnosed at 19, I am now 21 but looking back at my life I've often wondered if I had bipolar disorder all this time only that it was so mild that I never really thought of it? And that it just got severe when I was older and then considered a diagnosis?

Because I've had depressive episodes since I was 11 years old and they came and went through the years.

Mania/hypomania is the tricky part because I remember clearly starting to struggle with that when I was 17 and then it got worse.  
But I have read my entire psych journal and looking back there are things I find out. Like my 7th grade teacher saying I usually kept to myself and didn't talk much but sometimes I would come up to her at random and talk a lot and very fast. And I remember many times when I was 13 I would have these moments or days where I was overwhelmed with confidence, walking down the hall of the school playing these upbeat rock songs thinking I was the shit and thinking I was amazing. Getting into a lot of fights etc. Which was in big contrast to my usually depressed self but I always saw that as that I just ""decided"" to stop caring about the things that made me depressed. I remember staying up all night writing music and writing short stories but I don't remember it as the feeling of mania just as being very pumped.

Also searching bipolar in my search history I find results from when I was 11-13 but I can't say I really knew what it was so I'm never sure why I was considering it.

And you could say maybe I was bipolar then and was just diagnosed late but it came to a halt when I was 14 and I can't say I struggled as much at that age. Same with 15. 

Then I turned 16 and I thought I had borderline personality disorder because I was just unstable (as in mood swings every day and being fragile and anxious in general). Which I was diagnosed with at 18. But when I was 17 I recognize the feeling of not mania but hypomania, that specific itch inside. Especially when I started taking citalopram. 

Then something traumatic happened ig and I got full blown bipolar 6 months after being diagnosed with bpd. But the bpd diagnosis was probably bipolar in the making all along because I recognize a lot of those symptoms with me being depressed.

It just really makes me wonder because I blame myself and I try to look at things I could have done differently to prevent myself from being how I am today but I'm also not sure if this was always meant to happen? Because I've been asked about bipolar disorder by doctors since I was 13 and I always said no but if I were to go into 13 year olds me body now knowing what I do I would say I don't know because I can't tell if shit started with that traumatic event or with my first depressive episode at 11 and if I would have gotten it no matter was because it was already ""developing""?

Sorry this is really long but thank you if anyone actually took the time to read because I just want to know if I'm looking into it too much or if it's actually possible I just always had it but it never got severe until I was older."

143,I need an outside opinion,"Hello!

I need an outside opinion.

So short past time story: I was given into a foster care when i was 14. My parents never gave me rules or boundaries (i know sounds like the perfect life, bc i was doing everything i wanted, but that was the problem) I was struggeling with really bad depression. I went to therapy for like 6 years.

Now I'm 23. I kinda feel like i have the depression under control. But there is something that really annoys me. I don't think i'm capable of feeling love. There was a major event in the past, i had some bad ptsd, but i thought i solved it. But i really can't get close to people. I have a okay realtionships with my parents now, but i don't love them, its sounds rude to say, but for me they are  acquaintances .

I tried to get into realtionships, but i don't feel anything. When a person gets to close it bugs me. I don't like being touched. So i dumb the person, because its unfair to them.

So my question is, can i fix myself? Can i feel love? And how does love feel like?, bc i seriously dont know.

And sorry for the grammar and spelling issues!"

145,How do you deal with emotions?,"Recently I lost a friend(not dead) which has made me obviously sad, angry and lonely but even before this happened for about 2 to maybe 4 years I’ve felt like there’s a pressure of emotions building and now after this happened I feel like a shaken soda Bottle about to explode after being shaken but every time I try to release the pressure I can’t because the cap is welded shut and sometimes when I think or remind myself of the pressure I feel immobilized which consequently causes me to be completely and utterly useless for a day if not days at a time. but me going through these dehabilitating periods dose absolutely nothing to the pressure in bottle, if anything only making it worse."
146,How do I tell my parents (again) that I am depressed?,"I already told my parents twice that I don't really have a wish to continue my life and that I am sick and tired of it. At one of these times I even had a mental breakdown right after I told them. My parents still think I just have a few problems with vitamin or something. I was actually at the doc already and he also talked about me being in perfect physical condition and that it's a mental issue most likely. My mom still wont believe it and now wants me to go to another doc. 

I don't even know why but I don't have the courage to talk to my mom and tell her directly that I have depression. I don't understand how she hasn't even figured it out yet. I mean my doc literally recommended that I should go to therapy and I also told her that I am done with life and that there is not reason for me to continue this misery."
147,"I need advice, please.","Is anyone else feeling like they've been depressed and anxious for so long that it stripped them of their personality and consciousness, the ability to think and learn new things, memorize information and be creative? If you've experienced something like this, is there a proper way to cope with it and get back on track? I'm so lost. I've never felt this helpless. I feel like I've lost ability to express myself. I feel like I will never be able to accomplish anything in life, and it makes me want to end it all. Every time my mental health starts getting better, this feeling hits and I'm back into the spiral of endless panic attacks."

Looking for help and advice on how to cope with a situation that has rapidly escalated over a week, despite slowly trending this way for months (hindsight is wonderful as wasn’t obvious to us at time, especially with lockdown).

Based in UK, individual suffering is my mother-in-law, who is not a native English speaker but has been a UK resident for nearly 20-years. 

Over past week, condition has radically worsened and communication and conversations indicate lots of thoughts and fears about death and what next. Has had one professional meeting that diagnosed severe psychosis, just 2-days ago. Currently, individual is staying with family, but behaviours and things being said around young children make this very difficult and rather untenable, especially with work responsibilities although all individuals do have holiday time. Does have a small studio flat, but we fear to leave alone. Very hesitant to try any medication.... Finally, sadly, financial resources are limited...

Completely unsure of how to proceed both short and long term. 

Any and all advice hugely appreciated."

They made me try a session and I’ve noticed I’ve been acting differently lately but I hate it.

156,I have always ran away,"**For 21 years I never really knew how to express myself genuinely, to the point that even I myself don't know if I'm being genuine in most situations.** 

I envy a child's freedom to express. The can be angry, sad, overly happy, cry their lungs out, walk out when they don't like being in the room, and tell people whatever silly thing comes to their mind. People tell me that I've always been a happy child. But somewhere along the line, I wasn't allowed to be myself. Maybe it started with my dad noticing that I was too effeminate for a boy. He even sent me away to some relatives to ""man"" up for a summer. And like his worst nightmares, I am indeed gay. It wasn't just him, it was the world - the relatives, the uncles, the uncle - friend of my parents, the schoolteacher who tells who to not cry because that's not what boys do. *As a child, I got that signals from my family and the world. It was loud and clear:* ***Hide yourself.***

And I guess it just built up on top of one another. I had to hide something about being queer, which I definitely didn't understand what it was back then, and **it trained me to have a knee - jerk reaction to just hide from everything in general.** I had to hide my thoughts in even the smallest of things. I had to hide what I liked. What I know and what I didn't know. What I did and what I didn't. And the BEST part of learning how to hide at an early age was learning how to hide *effectively* \- that is, they won't discover what you're hiding if you're telling a completely different thing. If you're feeling sad, you show you're happy. So that they don't know what's bothering you, you have to act excited. Deal with them as quick as you can so that you can hide immediately in your room, where no one can see you. You're an actor without pay. 

While at college, I was finally able to express myself to some extent. But because of the years of hiding I had to do, I was developmentally stunned - it's like you're going through a crash course for something that you should've always been doing all your life, which is having confidence to be able to really express yourself. I made improvements, but I can't say that it was enough. Having to know yourself after years of trying to repress yourself leaves you confused a lot of times. It makes you miserable because you are aware that you didn't have the life that you know could've made you more happier and more productive. 

And since you don't know how to live yourself out to the world, you always second guess yourself. **Is this really what I feel, or is this what I trained myself to feel?** Have I ever really been happy if I'm not even sure if I know what makes me happy. I've been living on autopilot for so long, and now I'm going to crash. Is living a life worth it if you're not sure of yourself, how you feel, and what should you be doing? 

I've been hiding and hiding all my life. And now that I realize how much freedom I lost all my life and how little freedom I have now, I just want to disappear. Even if I have the chance to be really free to express myself, I don't have the capacity to express myself because I have always ran away. I have been in a depressive pit the past months because being stuck with my family this quarantine just made me realize how miserable and fake I have been my whole life. 

I just want to disappear so I don't have to hide and deal with myself. I'm tired of running."

not only that, college exams is coming and i feel like i don't have any place in this world. everytime i see myself go thru huge failures all i can think of is to d!e. i feel like i can't do anything and that i lie to myself everyday that i'm okay even though i am not. i feel so dumb and that i can't pass huge universities and might fail all those people who believe in me. i don't believe in me.

It’s like that surreal, dreamlike feeling hasn’t faded but became my norm. I’m sitting back, trying to recall what her laugh sounded like, the twinkle in her eye, the comfort of her embrace and to be honest it’s kind of difficult. Writing that line makes me a bit sad but I guess it’s quite natural for these things to happen, right?  
.  
Even though the gleam of Jessica’s smile may have faded in my memory, I’ve gained something new from her, as if our relationship has evolved into something else… not better or worse, just different. I’ve come to rely on her guidance, her assurance, her direction and her protection. She’s not only the metaphorical guardian angel but the needle of my life compass or maybe a secondary gut instinct. I consider myself to be pretty damn lucky having someone looking down on me and providing all this support.  
.  
Like a man taking a mental inventory of some comfortable yet fascinating room, I evaluate my life and see that I’m fortunate in other ways too. I’ve grown so very much in the last 6 years, and I’m certain the catalyst was her passing - but the encouragement to strive for more, to heal, and find meaning in this life was provided in part by Jess’s unwavering love. There is no doubt in my mind that she proved as supportive after her passing as she was for me while still here. Humbly speaking, I’ve learned quite a few lessons over these past 6 years with her constant support but there is one in particular which I will forever cherish and mind; tell the ones that mean the most to you that you love them.  
.  
So in honor of Jessica Marie Hehn, I’m asking all of you to do exactly this. Tell at least three people in your life that you appreciate and love them. It doesn’t have to be anything dramatic or long winded, something like this usually does the trick for me,  
.  
“hey stupid… I want you to know that I love you very much and appreciate you for who you are… even though you’re stupid and you smell bad.”  
.  
It works for me each and every time, I promise. Thank you for doing this for me and to honor Jess. I know it would make her laugh and smile - and imagining her smile and laugh helps me remember it a bit better.  
.  
Love u all

170,Break from social media,I want to take a break from social media just to refresh my mind and not see what everyone is up to because I find that I get so focused on it and it really affects my mental health. I deleted a bunch of apps but I’m already finding it difficult. Any suggestions of what to do?
171,"I just don’t know what to do, or who to talk to","Hello, I don’t know if this is the right place to say this, and I’ll be posting this in other places i think it could go.

March 15th around 11:30, my 14 year old brother had a seizure that stopped his heart, and I did all medical things I knew, like CPR, he was taken to the hospital and was shocked either 3-5 times, and his heart was beating again, and then he passed on the 16th around 6:15 pm, before then my great grandfather passed away in the next room. After I was taking care of him for 4-5 months because of bone cancer. And before all this I’m basically verbally abused by my uncle and grandmother, both calling me useless and disgusting, telling me I can’t do anything right.

Then the virus stuff has stopped me from seeing any friends or other family, and I’ll most likely be moving school cause of our lack of money, and I currently don’t have a house as my mom and I are fixing a place to live in.

Now my mother has gotten sick 3 times in 2-3 months, and she can barely do anything, she’s just lying down puking and having…accidents…and I’m afraid she has Covid now. There’s so much stuff going on for me and it’s just hurting. I don’t know if I’m okay mentally or not, I had a breakdown a couple weeks ago from everything, and I am just not sure what to do.

If someone can just talk to me or something. Or help me mentally, I’d love it…please"

173,Uncontrollable crying,I’m at work and while delivering I started crying and couldn’t stop. I had no reason to cry and it keeps happening. This started about an hour ago and I cried for 30 minutes the first time but now it only lasts for 10 seconds then I’m able to stop the tears. I also have a hard time talking and breathing normally. I’m trying to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist or Councelor but any help before then would be greatly appreciated. (19M)
174,It shouldn’t be this hard right?,"A quick recap of my mental health. I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember. I’m 20 years old and moved out of my narcissistic moms house at 17. I’ve tried multiple antidepressants and am in therapy twice a week for close to a year now. I was diagnosed with PTSD along with clinical depression and GAD. I’m doing a ketamine treatment for all of those problems. I’m on my second treatment a feel a little better, more clear, less of a cloud over my head. The issue is I still have a problem with my thought process. My psychiatrist recommended a 6 week IOP I would need to be on disability for this. All the money I have is money I’ve worked for and saved up, I just had to spend 3,000 on the treatment because insurance won’t cover anything. I work at a place that has less than 50 employees so I could be fired for needing disability. Sometimes I just feel like so many things have been set up against me, I don’t have it in me to continue fighting this stupid flaw. I’ve been having the thought that I’m just destined to feel this way forever. Mental illness is really severe in my family and I’m the only one who has recognized it and tried to get help. I just feel everything is stacked up against me. My boyfriend is the only person in the world who I have right now because the only family I’m on good terms With is moving to Michigan. Everything in me tells me I’m not lovable, everyone will leave me and I’ll be poor, mentally ill, and hopeless for the rest of my life."

My sister over the past few months has been laying in bed all day because she can't see her friends, has been making very dark suicidal jokes, and has told me that she's been very depressed. 

The jokes keep getting worse and more detailed, and when I told her that kind of humor only make things worse, she told me she literally only sticker around because I would be sad.

As the condition does not hinder my vision, I cannot have the operation.

I have began saving up for the operation to be done privately and this will take around 2 years. Every day I wish I could put myself out of this misery but I know I would never act on these thoughts as: 1) I will eventually be receiving a relatively trivial operation which has a high  rate of success. 2) for all I know there is no afterlife, it's just black which isn't really better

186,Feeding off each other?,"I apologize in advance for wall of text. 
I and my SO are both in a tough place mentally and I just don't see any way to change it. 
I have IBS, which for me is most often triggered by stress and anxiety. This  makes things difficult since talking about problems is the only way to find their shape and look for solutions. Heavy stressful topics will offend send me to the washroom and shut off my apatite for a day or so. I have been eating under 1200 calories a day for 2 months now. When my partner is upset I get upset, which makes it hard to be supportive. I get physically sick because he is hurting and I am worried about him. 
Our main issue, which we seem to circle back to frequently, is moving. We are 100% ready to move and can find another place easily, but we can't till we sell. Our place has been for sale since last year, excluding the winter, and it just wont sell. We feel trapped, and he cant do about 80% of the hobbies and activities he wants until we do. I am irritated by the not selling thing, but not as bothered because I at least like our current one a little. Neither of us can controll the housing market so this is a weight we cant effect.
Covid is an inconvenience, but not that much of a worry beyond following guidelines and wearing masks for me. It is a much bigger weight for him as it affects every level of his job.
Both of us are working from home, and while we keep schedules and get dressed for work to keep the mindset it is still being stuck home all the time.
My ongoing illness and inability to eat is dragging him down too. Plus our libidos are not lining up because I am sick. Cue feedback loop.

Both of us have several signs of depression, but getting professional help or a diagnosis in this province was a 4-6 month wait BEFORE covid.
I just don't even know what direction to look for help.
I just want us to stop hurting inside, figuratively and mentally. How do we break the cycle and start looking at the future with hope instead of defeat?"
187,Genuinely scared that I’m going crazy,"Hello, I’ve never posted on here but after a conversation with my mom I thought it was worth a shot. For background I’m 19f living in America, family history of mental health isn’t good at ALL on either side. 

So getting into it, starting maybe a year ago I started hallucinating auditorily, just little things like someone saying my name but they’re just too far to be sure you really heard it or I would constantly hear what sounded like my parents arguing downstairs even when they were asleep. In my opinion it wasn’t that big of a deal, it didn’t impact my day-to-day life whatsoever so I never really addressed it, but now it’s becoming a bigger problem.

Lately I’ve been having a lot of trouble falling asleep, because about every five-ish minutes my door knob turns or at least I hear my door knob turn, I have no clue if it’s really happening or not, it happens a lot when I’m awake during the day too. It kind of came to a head the other night when I was almost asleep, it sounded like someone almost knocked my door down trying to get in, it scared the crap out of me and I sat straight up in bed and it stopped, nothing had happened in real life, it was all in my head. 

I also have this paralyzing fear of someone or some thing crawling around my floor where I can’t see it (and inevitably crawling up in the bed with me), I SWEAR I hear things shuffling down where I can’t see almost like someone’s crawling around and I know it’s probably just in my head and I’m making things worse by dwelling but I can’t shake it. 

I’m staying up until 3-4 in the morning because I DREAD trying to fall asleep, I have three fans, a white noise machine, and music but it’s coming from inside my head so it doesn’t help at all I don’t know what to do. :("

Those people I'm checking temps on aren't wearing masks when they pull up. They complain about this and ask me why I'm doing it.

It's either this or live off unemployment for the foreseeable future. Even told one guy who just wanted to drive by that safety checked the cameras and if you weren't scanned you could be fired. He called bullshit. Came in the next day and stopped. Didn't make me feel any better.

192,Am I disconnected to everyone my whole life or just plain dramatic and it's the hormones?,"Even when I was young, my mother had told me that my father is seeing someone else. I had been contemplating since last year that I never felt pain even when I heard it from my mother as a young child. Was I confused that time? No. I have a clear definition of ""affair"" even if I was a kid. Was I supposed to feel that pain that time? I think I should've been crying after knowing that but I didn't. 

Fast forward, I had a nice, fun time with my friends, we were very happy. Suddenly it fell out just because they couldn't agree on this travel plan. I wanted us to get back. I was stuck in the middle with two opposing sides in which I just want them to get along again. Afterwards, I finally have no friends! Great. Honestly, it was my fault for not finding anyone to confide in. My mother by that time had been comparing me to her friend's son for God knows what.

When I find a hobby to distract myself from my internal drama, my mother suddenly appears and she tells me that my hobby won't benefit me financially. Would I earn money from doing that? No. Of course not. I was just doing it to make me happy, not to earn money. But she's a mother, and she knows better in this world. So I stopped. 

I still have so many things to say but I just can't jot them all down here. Sometimes my throat just hurts but I'm not supposed to cry when she is here. I've been called a robot by many other people, guess I am.

I don't know if anyone else would read this but I hope everyone could feel emotions when necessary. Sometimes I just feel disconnected with other people but of course, it is my fault for building my own walls even to my own family. There was even a point I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I guess I could say I was not abused nor violated when I was a kid up until now, I can even say I was given a lavish life and pampered.

I won't be fishing for any reassurance. I can definitely tell you that I am an ungrateful, selfish brat that takes unnecessary things personally and supposed to take painful words not as a challenge but only to down myself and excuse my current state.

Sometimes I have high self-awareness and sometimes, I don't know myself. I want to get back to my old hobbies but I can't do it anymore. I want the old happy me. I want to get back soon as possible before I turn into an adult and regret things because I let my so-called emotions drown me.

I don't wanna dwell but I subtly notice patterns to my present and rely on my past and there and then I suddenly hold back. I'm supposed to talk about anyone about this! I'm having a turmoil and it's my fault. Or is it? Back in my head I know my family has an influence in this part but I can't blame them! I should be liable for my own actions.

I just wrote everything without holding back this time. I don't know. I need help or maybe I don't? Maybe I'm just acting upon my hormones and this soon will fade.

But the title is still a question I want to ask you Redditors, as my answer is just one in a million. What are your thoughts or questions? Please tell me as I am willing to listen and answer, if there are any, thank you for your time, if there aren't any, it's okay, I will forget this again soon and it's much better that I am not a bother of someone else's time.

I don't know if using an authentic account is a good idea to vent out. What if someone else sees this and use this against me? I will just decide and see what happens."

It started with a manic episode then he stopped the meds, and got another manic episode and had to go to a psychiatric center.

I don't know from where to start but he's so stubborn and he's always complaining about the meds and the doctors (although as I understand that the meds he take are the only thing that could make him better and it's the basic treatment for his case), he still takes meds but refuses to see his doctors because he thinks they'll just tell him to keep taking the meds. He's now in the depressive phase and it's looking really bad. He's really depressed, doesn't wanna do anything, doesn't want to go out and he also lives alone and refuses to stay with us. He doesn't work so he has nothing obligatory to do during the day and any normal activity he's too depressed to do.

I am very worried and I always try to help but it doesn't work because he's really stubborn and he throws everything on the meds and I'm scared he'll stop them and gets another episode which are really hard on him and on us as well.    
I don't know what to do anymore, everything keeps getting worse and he's so impatient.

My father was my abuser so a lot of repressed feelings have reemerged. Long story short, I had a breakdown and on my doctor's recommendation have taken time off work and gone on short term disability.

196,How do you deal / live in a world in which no one cares about you?,"I've been thinking a lot since I have nothing else to do and this whole Covid-19 isolation is like hell on earth.  The reason I say this is because it has forced me to deal and live with my actual life and the reality of the world.  Suffice it to say the reality sucks.

I made all of my friends late in life (in my 30's) so I am no-ones best friend or most important person in their lives.  I know a lot of people but I would say they are more acquaintances than what would traditionally be called friends.

Having friends when you are 40 and the people you know are even older than you is just weird.  As I said everyone I know has someone who is a higher priority than me.  As a result no one calls me, texts me, emails me, etc.  I've tried to put some effort into it but I just got sick of not hearing back from anyone and people not caring.  

I've had a lot of stuff happen in my life and really I have no idea how to interact with people.  The weird part is I do not even know what to do when I do spend time with people I know.

I just think it would be nice to live in a spontaneous world.  In a world where things are a two way street.  

I don't know.  I am an introvert and in the beginning this whole isolation thing was heaven on earth but I am getting tired of it.  I have nothing to look forward to.  No escape from my life.

Thanks for listening to me."
197,Why does this happen to me when I’m with people? And how can I stop it?? Help,"A little backstory, I’m 17 and I’ve had mental problems ever since I started smoking weed about 2 years ago. At first I only smoked every once and awhile but it eventually turned into an every day thing. I was smoking every day alone for about a year and especially a lot during the last few months of quarantine. Smoking every day slowly brought on so much stress and anxiety and I was just constantly talking to myself in my head, if you don’t get what I mean by this, you know the constant narrator in your head that that turns on whenever you need to think about something? Well it was constantly turned on for me, basically every minute of the day. This brought on a lot of negative thoughts after a while which I still get (but not as often) to this day. I was brought to some really dark places in my head and I knew I had to change because I just wanted to live normally again with general peace in my mind. So I quit smoking about 1 month ago for the most part and decided only to smoke if I was with my friends which is about 1-2 times a month. I took up meditating which actually really helped with my anxiety and to just generally calm me down when I’m in my own head. Anyways I’m starting to live normally again but my anxiety or whatever it is, is preventing me from being happy. I hung out with 2 friends last night who I’ll call Dave and John and this one girl who I’ll call Lena who was a friend of Dave’s and knew John. Anyway the night started out ok my anxiety was definitely present but I could bare it and maintain normal conversation. We went out for a walk in the park to smoke a couple joints I rolled up which was our original plan. As soon as I took a hit of the joint my anxiety almost immediately went away and I felt confident. Before smoking I was constantly thinking about things like am I being awkward and I would just not willingly want to start a conversation with Lena I would respond in short answers if she said something and I wasn’t really talking much at all. After smoking however I felt great all my problems seemed to just go away and I started to join in on the conversation. I just felt present and normal and I wasn’t worrying about being awkward in fact I was actually being funny and confident. This went on for a while and I was getting to know Lena which was nice but once we got back to Dave’s house everything changed. Suddenly the thinking turned on in my head and it felt like my head was telling me “your having too good of a time, let me ruin that for you”. Slowly I became more and more like I was being before I smoked. It was insane.. I couldn’t even make eye contact with Lena or hold a conversation because I was so anxious... this continued until she eventually left and it was just me Dave and John left alone. We watched a couple movies and my anxiety calmed down a little bit but I was still on edge. 

Anyways I really want to know what’s wrong with me and how I can fix this because it’s ruining my confidence and I’m afraid it’s ruining my  years of experiencing what it’s like to be a teenager. If anyone can offer and advice I would appreciate it... thanks


Tl;dr: I have extreme anxiety and I went to hang out with a couple friends and a girl I’ve never met, my anxiety was bad and I felt I was being awkward when I was with them but then we smoked weed and my anxiety went away and I was confident.. after a while of this the thinking voice in my head basically said “your having too good of a time, let me ruin that for you” and I had major anxiety kick in which ruined my night and I went back to being like I was before I smoked. Please help any advice is appreciated"
198,Anniversary is soon and I don’t know what to do,"Hello Redditors, I am in need of your assistance. 

I struggle with depression, anxiety, adhd. 

It’s soon going to be our one year annie and I honestly have no fkn clue how to go about it, it feels like I don’t want to do anything, I just want it to be another day to pass by where I sleep all day. It’s not present in my mind like it should be because I don’t even know what day it is to begin with. 

I’ve been in a depressed slump for the past while (I’ve only just recently admitted to myself about this after being in denial) and am now feeling cornered into action. 

So my question is this: how did you and your partner celebrate special occasions when one (or both) of you was feeling too depressed to do anything? 


I have an “I love you” book I started to make but I never finished it so I’m trying to motivate myself for that at least. But I dread having to act happy and gushy, when really I have no energy. I do appreciate my partner but I worry that it’ll come off as “oh I don’t care,” when really I do. So please help me."

200,Having such a hard time with life..,"Life just seems so tough. I don't even know what to do half the time. I feel like I am privileged as to the situation I am in, and that a lot of people have it much worse off than me. Yet I can't seem to find happiness or motivation anywhere. I have really bad depression and have let myself fall into a pretty deep hole. It's hard to even care for myself these days. I also have pretty bad anxiety, which makes me dwell, assume, have irrational fears, and be paranoid among other things such as essentially living a life of agoraphobia. I feel like every day is a constant struggle and source of stress. I feel like a failure because I haven't been able to do anything with my life. And constantly feel like I'm not good enough for anything or anyone. I was drinking and vaping as an unhealthy ""coping skill"". But I recently quit both. I've felt nearly consumed lately by my depression and anxiety. I have crying spells multiple times a day. I can't even focus on things, because my anxiety pulls my focus away to dwell on random shit every 5 or 10 minutes. My emotions are so sensitive, like anything can set me off into a spiral. I know that after having been using drinking to forget, I'll have a flood of dealing with everything I've been avoiding. But I've always been like this.. it's just too much to handle a lot of times. There's one person who I can really count on, and who understands my struggles, cares about me, motivates me, and tends to put a smile on my face. But things have been tricky lately. I am somewhat having to go back to dealing with all of this alone. Aside from that person, and a few other ok friends, close family. I really have nearly no one in my life. And definitely no one that fully understands. I also struggle most likely from some level of asd. I tend to have a really hard time reading people, and taking hints. Everything has to be blunt, or else I get lost in assumptions and guesses. I have a really hard time with conversations and meeting new people. Never knowing what to talk about or what to say.. I overwhelm a lot of people because I focus on the nitty gritty details of everything. I also tend to never really fit in and am kinda different.. Between all of the things I've said, I'm just having such a hard time. Not just now. For the past 15 years when it comes to anxiety and depression and for nearly 30 years with the asd. I really don't know what to do. I have suicidal thoughts pretty frequently. And I honestly just don't have the energy to care. The social stuff drains me really bad. And a lot of times I don't feel like i can be myself around people. Eventually, I tend to end up isolating. Which just makes the depression and anxiety worse. I'm just so tired of caring... I'm so tired of trying... I'm so tired of thinking... I'm so tired of hurting... A lot of times it's hard to find reasons not to quit. There's only a couple left that I have. And sometimes the nagging thoughts try to climb over that wall.. More often than I'd like to admit... All I wanna do is sleep. I don't even wanna be awake. I just wanna hide from all of it because I just don't have the energy to handle it most days anymore. I tend to wonder what life is like without depression. Waking up, and looking forward to your day? It's hard to accept that this is my life. This is my fate. How do I even begin to find a reason to live? I want to be happy one day.. I want to try at life.. but why? What's the point... I feel empty inside. I can't even find the energy or motivation to pursue the things I enjoy. most days I end up just sitting there, not knowing what to do because nothing sounds appealing. I have hardly even been eating lately, I'm just not even hungry. I really don't know what to do. I'm on medication. But it doesn't help a ton. I've tried nearly all medications, and none of them solved much. Not to mention that they tend to just stop working after a while. I'm in therapy. once a week. It helps, sometimes. It also makes things worse, sometimes. And I've been in therapy since I was like 3. I'm honestly on the fence about commiting myself. I just don't think that's the answer, and I've had bad experiences with that in the past. I'd probably have to turn to long term inpatient, residential. I'm really scared of the future.. I'm afraid of facing all of this alone, for the rest of my life. I'm afraid of the day where those couple reasons I have left, may not be there anymore. I'm afraid that one day, I just won't have the energy. I'm afraid that one day, I'll not care just enough. Idk.. I really dont know...."
201,Sometimes I just stare into space and don't do anything. Any reasons why?,"So sometimes I just sit or stand some where and stare out either into the sky or at a white wall, not thinking about anything in particular. I don't really feel anything when I do, not happy, not sad. I just feel sort of empty both in thoughts and emotionally. Even when I say to myself I'm going to do something, I find myself doing this instead at times, even when the activity is fun. For example, yesterday I planned on watching a Netflix show and I was prepared: I completed my work, I did the dishes, etc. Everything was ready- I didn't have to do anything else for the day but simply enjoy what I wanted. Except I couldn't. Instead of watching the show, I just sat in front of my television and stared at nothing. I know it sounds extremely silly, but this is just a habit I have and I've begun to question whether its related to a mental issue."
202,How to find the right therapist/counselor/whatever the hell title,"Well, I found out that, in spite of my hopes otherwise, I'm probably not gonna be able to kill my emotions without killing the rest of me. At least, not alone.

As such, I figure that since I can't do that, I might as well try to find help, to which end (destroying my emotions or becoming human) I don't know, and frankly, don't really care.

I have had experience with several therapists in the area (eastern Washington State, USA) in which I live, and to say it has been less than effective at either goal is to put it gently

So, how do I find a better therapist?"

From the time I met her I have been trying to be supportive and talk to her whenever I can.

209,Healthy Foods That Can Lift Your Spirits,"Hello everyone!

I have done some research on different types of health food that’ll be able to lift your spirits up, whenever your feel down. Not only will they lift your spirits, but they are healthy! This will drastically help you both physically and mentally. So, without any further to do.... here are some healthy foods that helps to lift your spirits:

Starting off with a tasty one... **Dark Chocolate**. 

Before I start... YUM! Chocolate, dark or white, is rich in many mood boosting compounds. The sugar that’s inside of the chocolate is able to improve and lift your mood since it’s quick source of fuel for the brain. Dark chocolate is high in health-promoting flavonoids, this has been known to increase the blood flow to your brain. Because of this, it reduces inflammation and boosts the health of the brain. To finalise, dark chocolate, inside has a high rating of hedonic, this means that it’s pleasurable taste, texture and smell can promote good mood. That’s your dessert sorted for tonight!

Secondly... a fruit.... **Bananas!**

Banana’s is able to turn that frown on your face.... upside down. Bananas, many like them, many don’t. But, they are very high in vitamin B6. This helps synthesise feel-good neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin. Also, a single banana provides 16 grams of sugar and 3.5 grams of fibre. Wow! 

When sugar and fibre combine together, the sugar is slowly released into the bloodstream, this allows for stable sugar levels and a better control of your mood. 

Thirdly... here’s a boring one... **Oats**. 

BUT, Oats are whole grain. Oats are able to keep you in good spirits and a terrific mood all morning. Another positive thing about Oats.... you are able to enjoy them in different ways and forms, such as... oatmeal, muesli, overnight oats and granola. 

Oats are an excellent source of fibre. They provide 8 grams in a single raw cup. Fact! Fibre, in general can help slow your digestion of carbs. Instead of eating biscuits and crisps, grab yourself a cup of oats. Also, fibre allows for a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream, this helps the energy levels to stay stable. 

Another one.... **Berries**.

Yup, you guessed it, another fruit. Delicious! Eating fruits and vegetable is linked to lower rates of depression. Berries carried a BIG range of antioxidants and phenolic compounds, this plays a key role in combatting oxidative stress. 

If you’re not able to find yourself fresh berries, try frozen ones. By getting yourself frozen ones, the berries are at the peak ripeness, which helps to retain the maximum amount of antioxidants. 

Lastly... to finish this off... many love it and many hate it - **COFFEE!** 

Whether you love it or hate it, coffee is the most well known drink in the whole world. Thankfully, coffee makes the world a much happier place, believe it or not! Coffee contains caffeine. The caffeine itself prevents a naturally occurring compound called adenosine from attaching to brain receptors that is able to promote tiredness, therefore it increases attention and alertness. 

Also, coffee increases the release of mood-boosting neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and norepinephrine. 

So.... there you go! Here are just a few example of foods (and a drink) that is able to help boost improve your mood. Instead of snacking to junk food over the week, try some of these! If you do, let me know what you think in the PM’s. I’d love to find out what you think. 

As always, my PRIVATE MESSAGES are open for all. If you fancy a chat or some sort of support, let me know and I’ll be more than happy to help. Have a great night everyone!"
210,Explaining my mental health history to someone I'm dating,"**Tl;dr: Co-morbid anxiety and depression under control with SNRIs, episode-free for about 6ish years. Met someone special, not sure how to reassure her about myself and potential future. Looking for people's previous experiences sharing with partner.**

Hi everyone,

This post is a little different from a typical post, so please bear with me here. I was first diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder around 2009. I spent the night at a hospital a couple of times due to panic attacks, and eventually through CBT, medication (low SNRI dose), and my own work, my last panic attack was in 2013 and I haven't had any paralyzing depressive episodes since 2012.

Now, after many years, saving the subreddit all the history because it's not relevant, I've met someone I feel like I connect with in every way. The only concern she has right now boils down to her need to protect and do something about the people she cares about. To be more specific, she has no prior experience with any friends/family, let alone significant others, with mental health issues. 

I've tried to explain to her that:  
1. The dose I'm on is very low  
2. I haven't had any episodes in quite a long time

However, the issues she's concerned about are largely:  
1. How will this potentially affect our family in the future (the old nature versus nurture argument)  
2. As a slight control freak and worrywort, whether she can bear with the thought of not being able to do much/anything if I (or our future children) have these issues

Now, for a little more context, both of us were partially educated in the US, but she grew up in a fairly conservative part of Asia, meaning understanding and open dialogue about these issues is sort of taboo, which kind of led to these discussions we've been having. I'm here because we've been only dating a short time, and she's asked for some time to clear her head, do some research, and consider whether we should be together or not. 

*(insert long impassioned speech by me about how I'm super sure about this person, might be ""the one"", yadda yadda no one cares about this, but rest assured I'm here on Reddit because I really want this to work)*

Basically, I've been on Google pointing out research articles and stuff about nature versus nurture, but I'm looking for people who have come out to their significant others about their mental health issues, and how they came up with a bilateral system of support within that relationship. 

Bonus points if your partner:  
1. Did not have prior knowledge or experience with mental health issues before you  
2. Grew up in Asia

Bonus, bonus points if you are the significant other that learned/received all this information

Thanks very much for your time and for reading."

212,I quit my meds," 

And now I feel pure. I'm going to church tomorrow to embrace god into my heart and ask for forgiveness for my sins.

I've been down and I haven't cared to be alive. In fact I've done a lot of things in hopes of dying including trying to drink myself to death every day. All my meds have made me depressed, they have not protected me from myself. This is a new start and I will let god in and hope he forgives me and that he can allow me to feel the love that I feel today.

I have woken up from a dream, a medicated dream and I feel alive. I will get a grip and take charge of my own life I'm looking into getting a loan so I can buy an apartment and I will be free. I won't make myself depressed with medication and I won't be manipulated into being okay with it. It would have gotten me killed."

215,Im having a quarter life crysis and dont know how to help myself out of this,"Not sure if anyone will read this, i just really need to rant because i have nobody else to speak too. However if u do read this and have any advice, pls help.. I apologise in advance for bad english im portuguese. 

Im a girl and i turned 24yo in May, way before my birthday i was freaking out but lately its been so bad i cant even sleep. I feel useless and pointless and i just dont know what to do with myself. I grew up listening to my dad say that a womans worth will vanish with age, and that we peak in our 20s blah blah (yes he is a bit of a twat). So i have always been terrified of growing old. I feel like 30 is the end. Like there is no point in living past that because i Will be a washed up trash bag. And i know deep down its not right, but i cant help but believe it. I feel old.. I look in the mirror and hate what i look like now, so all i can think is ""shit it just gets even worse from now on"". 

I lost my job because of covid and being home certainly doesnt help. Ive looked for jobs but right now its really hard. I see my friends very rarely, most of them are busy with boyfriends, jobs or kids. I feel like they all have it figured out and it really stresses me out. Whenever i do see them they brag about whatever it is they do and i have nothing to add. I do nothing, im just nothing. I try so hard to get out of this funk, i tried hobbies and sports and just taking walks but i find it all pointless. Whats the point? If im miserable outside im better off being miserable at home. Ive forced myself to do all these things and i just cant. 

Im not good at anything, i also dont really enjoy anything so ive come to terms with the fact that im never going to achieve anything extraordinary, im never gonna be ""that girl who is really talented at doing...."". I will never have an actual career and enjoy work, i am and will always just be the girl who serves tables. I missed my chance to be someone, i never did anything with myself because ive always been to miserable to just live. To just enjoy the little things.. Why cant i just enjoy looking at the stars? And taking walks at night? Why do i ruin everything for myself. 

And its not that im looking to have Kids and marry and all of that, im fine being alone, i just want a purpose, something to make me want to wake up in the morning and not just lay there wishing i was dead. Ive considered therapy because lately its been scary. But im broke, i have no way of paying for sessions. The only way to get free is if im under 21yo lmao.

I probably sound like a little winy bitch, but i feel very close to just giving up and needed to vent. I wouldnt wish anyone feel like this, but if u ever have or still do, leave me some feedback please."
216,Can't afford help,I have negative 50 dollars to my name 300 in bills coming out later today. I can't afford therapy but I think I badly need it. I feel alone even when I'm with my friends I can't do anything without overthinking everything and forcing myself into a breakdown or mental crash or something. I only talk to like 4 people regularly and even then I don't really talk. I can't remember how to have a conversation I'm just kind of there. Nothing interests me and I can only pass in social situations when I'm drunk and that's terrible unhealthy. Any ambitions or goals I have I quickly give up on and I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about this. I can never form the words when I try and if I try again I feel like I'm just rambling on and all I ever talk about is how fucked I am. I have no support system except for myself and thinking about everything to try and find answers but that's making it worse. I don't know what to do and I need help. But I don't know how to ask for it

I feel like it started on my first-ish relationship there i my ex compared to his ex girlfriend and how amazing she was in every aspect. I am too embarrassed to talk about it with my therapist so how should i talk about this unhealthy behavior?
221,Hi friends,[removed]
222,How do I talk to my parents about my anxiety and depression,"I belong to an Asian family. And it’s kinda getting harder everyday to keep my mental health in the backseat and take in wtv happens around me at home. i don’t know how to put it into words but I see that it’s so unhealthy and not right, the way my parents deal with me and my sibling’s emotions and I know that they’re actually doing it unknowingly and have little to no idea that it’s harming my mental health and I fear even my sibling’s. My sibling and I are close and I don’t want him to end up where I am, mental health wise. I don’t know if that’s good or not but I really want to him to be in great health always. I try to communicate to my parents to change certain aspects about their communication with us, so that it appears less ignorant to our feelings but well I don’t think they completely get it. It’s like a never ending cycle. I don’t want to term it as abuse because I kinda know why they are the way they are and they’ve never had a self sufficient childhood like my sibling and I are blessed with, but yk...things hurt. Sorry, I’m rambling. Well, any advice?"
223,Schizophrenic friend threatened to kill me and my family.,"So I have a dear childhood friend -25 years old-, whose parents are divorced.

Last couple of  years we noticed he's depressed -his group of close friends- , we tried to help him. his parents made it hard for us as neither of them cooperating.

They both worsened it. And they both are responsible for his misery. They continued their war even after their divorce to include him.

He was in a different country, I noticed he's depressed from his voice, but since it's a very personal matter I didn't bring it up, and he didn't seek my advice, and I didn't want to pressure him. he only asked for financial aid, I supported him every time he asked, after that he disappeared.

I heard from my friends who are in the same region as him that he's blocked them all and is avoiding them. we know he's clear from drugs, alcohol or weed, he doesn't even smoke, but they noticed his very negative attitude.

Last year he came back to the country, I didn't know that, out of the blue he called me at 4am in the morning to ask for a number of an old friend, in an angry tone as if he's holding a grudge against that friend, so I told him: ""Tell me why you want his number? what's the problem? and where have you been all this time? and is this how you speak to a friend whom you haven't heard his voice for more than a year? what's wrong?"" he responded ""give me his number or I will come to your house and crash your car"", I realized he's NOT depressed, he is something else, then I to played along to stale him: ""OK... alright... I don't have his number but give me a few hours to find it for ya"". After two hours he called again and told me to forget everything.

Then I texted his father to tell him the situation, at the time I trusted that his father cares for him, so acted as if he's broken for him and he doesn't know what to do with him, and he's trying to put him in Mental Institute but can't do anything about it since he's living with his mom, so he asked us -his friends- to set a trap for his son so that the mental  institute can capture him outside of his house -because apparently he is living  with his mom and his father cannot (by law) be near her house- so anyway I REFUSED and I told him *""no way I would trap a friend of mine, I will  talk sense to him I'm gonna try to help him...there is no shame in mental illness""* of which his father responded will if it works it works, but if not, send me your location to capture him.

So we took him outside to his favorite burger joint, he was in miserable shape. he had fun with us. then we headed back to our car. 

&amp;#x200B;

As good friends  I told him ""look I don't like what are  you doing to yourself, and we're here for you, and we will always be, we are brothers,  and no matter where you go, we will go with you, and stick with you.. so please listen to us."" before I even continue my sentence he told me to shut my mouth, ""Shut your mouth, shut it, shut it I don't want you to continue, fuck you, fuck you"" then as I was driving in the highway he attacked me while driving, punching kicking, almost causing an accident to kill us all, my other friend held him tightly. he started spitting and screaming. ""Stop the car I will teach you all, stop the car I will fuck you all you sons of bitches""

Then I told him ""why? why did you attack me? what did I do to you? so your father was right? it was true what your father said about you and I didn't even want to believe him"" he was SHOCKED. he panicked and started apologizing. then told me ""stop the car and let me go, I will not chase you.""

but I couldn't do that, I couldn't let him go back to his mother's house and become even worse, so I called his father and told him what happened, his father told us ""Great the ambulance is on the way"", it was not his first time in the mental institute, he was there before, which is why he disappeared, so until they came, he threatened to kill me and my family, he swore on it. I at the time thought this was the best for him.

since that incident I stayed out of the picture. I visited him once in the mental institute and he hugged me.

The mental institute were heavy with him on the meds, they diagnosed him with schizophrenia, he stayed there for three months, then he back out, his father rented an apartment for him, and started causing more problems, not taking his pills. sometimes he takes them, then skips them for months, his mother traveled out of the country, and his father doesn't want to deal with the mess directly.

He asked one of our friends for a gun, and our friend told him why? he said to kill me.

now should I take this seriously or what? 

and I honestly don't know what to do? should I be worried? and should I respond to his calls? he sometimes calls me, sometimes texts me, and I've been ignoring him, last couple of days he's been calling from different numbers and mt friends told me he is in bad shape and not taking his pills again, he even told them he is AFRAID from me....

&amp;#x200B;

can someone kindly give me an advice?"

225,I don't have anymore hope left in me,"Hey guys and girls


I'm M24 and live in Germany 
I lost my job back in May because of Corona. 
I get unemployment payments so that's only a little issue because I'm still living with my grandma (She is the only person in my family who's still alive or I have contact with)
My grandparents raised me.
Never knew my father and never had a father figure in my life ..(my grandpa kind of acted like one but he couldn't replace that..)
My grandpa lived until two days after Christmas in 2016 where I found him dead. That is still a great great trauma for me ...I will never forget this picture in my head...


My car broke down and while my grandma paid for the repairs (1.500€), the car is still broken. I cost her so much money ...i can't repay her in my life 
I wish she had a better retirement instead of the need in raising me and investing every Euro in the failure that I am 
I feel so bad because of this she deserves better than me...
If something might happen to her now I will off myself 
I can't support myself 


I have depression and it gets worse by the day 
It's brewing inside me since my grandpa died 
Even the anti depressants doesn't seem to work anymore 
I feel like I'm a failure and useless 
Never had a girlfriend I'm lonely as fuck
It's a pain to wake up and get out of bed, I ask myself every day ""Why? For what? It doesn't get any better anyway..""


There are many more reasons I feel like shit


While the lifes of my friends go forward my life is going backwards ..i would do so many things different if I could go back in time and start over


I lost every bit of hope and will to live..
I feel like I wrote myself to a mental breakdown I hate my life I hate that I was born"
226,Some of My scars are fading and Idk how I feel about it.,[removed]
227,I want to kill myself,"[TW: obvious mention of suicide, ftm]

I cant do it anymore. I'm a transgender male, unaccepted by my parents and family, regularly accused of deceiving people by my parents.
My dysphoria has gotten so bad that I can hardly leave my room. My family blames me for this.
My mother constantly tells me ""oh, I just wish it was easier for you"" while at the same time barely giving a shit about how she makes me feel. She'll get pissed off at me because her calling me ""beautiful"" makes me extremely uncomfortable. She will say she's on my side one moment and then the next she's saying how much she misses her daughter and how she wishes I would just stop.

I've been out for about 5 years now.
My plan is that once I turn 18, move to an apartment i can pay for and start transition. But I'll be all alone. My parents will cringe everytime they see me or hear my voice. My family will disown me because of their tight religion. I'll never have a girlfriend because I'm short and awkward. And guys will never see me as one of them.
I just want to end it. I'm so tired and done.

Today I went to the doctor for some xrays and she wouldnt stop calling me ""sweetheart"" or ""baby girl"". I was forced to sign a paper stating that I am not pregnant, which was near heartbreaking for me because I wish I never had to touch such a paper. I feel so disgusted with myself. Today I was feel alright, pretty confident... but now it's all ruined.

My mother tells me that I should let that ruin my whole day, but if you dont have dysphoria then you'd have no idea how scummy that made me feel.

I just want to die. I'm tired a living a life where people think I'm deceiving them. I'm tired of living a life where I have to be continually reminded that I am not right in my body. I just want to fucking die.
I cant do it anymore. I dont want to be the ""trans friend"". I dont want a girl to date me because she thinks I'm ""man lite"". It all makes me sick to me stomach.
I wish someone understood but I'm so alone. I dont know what to do now. I feel so lost.

Surgery is a fortune and I come from a poor family. I feel like there is no escape. If I keep living how my parents want, it'll kill me. If my family turn their backs on me because I'm transgender, it'll kill me. 

There's no one I can talk to about my struggles. Struggles of someday wanting to be a husband and dad. Wanting to go to college and be one of the guys. Wanting to be able to have a normal sex life. I cant talk to it with anyone because they just say ""well if you stay a girl you wont have any problem"". My mom cant understand why I want to be a parent, more specifically a dad, and dont want to give birth, but want my child to have my DNA. I wish I was just born male. Fuck. I'm done, I dont know where else to go from here."

Please. I am so desperate and in an extremely bad mental state. I know this thread isn't professionals. I don't care about that. But I am so close to relapsing to my old self because I can't do this anymore. I'm constantly alone and I seriously do not have any friends that I can just go and talk to about any of this because they dont want to hear it anymore."
230,I fled from quarantine and I've never felt so homesick,"So I've (21F) spent the last 4 months in my home country in quarantine with my family and boyfriend. I'm going to university in another country, 1000kms away from my home.
Quarantine has felt like limbo. I have no friends in my home country, and it has felt as if I was robbed of half a year of precious uni-life - something I've idealized my whole life. Although I love my boyfriend and family, we've had conflicts through the last 4 months. By the end I felt like they were driving me crazy. I felt like I wasn't really living and I didn't belong there. I had to do something.
So I've went and came back. Got a new place in my uni-town. And only when I arrived did I realized how stupid that was.
It's my exam phase-so my friends and I have to study pretty much all day. I've never been so alone and homesick in my life. It's been a week but there are still times I can physically feel the homesickness, like a burning sensation in my face. I was already struggling with depression when I was back home but it's gotten worse (of course). I have no appetite or energy and even simple things like taking a shower or trying to stuff some food in myself are challenging, let alone studying all day.
I mean I don't know what I expected. I feel so unbelievably stupid. I feel if I had sat down and realistically thought about what it would be like to be here, I could have easily figured it out. But I went ahead and made a rash decision.
I also find myself pathetic. I'm just a priviliged little girl that thought ""oh I'm so sad I wanna go back to that place cause that will SOLVE IT"" and my parents go ""of course darling, we'll pay your rent"" so I get money shoved in my face and once I get here I go ""oh no no i want to go back i didn't want this after all"". I'm crying over this when there are hundreds of thousands of people living on the street who have no home to run back to, no family, none of these things that are just handed to me. I cannot imagine what they must go through every day mentally. 
If you've read it until this point you honestly deserve a cookie... I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Doesn't have to be all helpful and positive. 
Cheers."

My anxiety got worsened when i heard abot HPV which can cause genetial wrats and may cause cancer to females, there is no test for HPV for males, this is killing me and making my anxiety worse. (I don’t have any HPV symptoms but the problem that i cant know if I’m infected or not which make me in a depression cycle)

How to stop thinking about infections and how to get rid of anxiety?"
235,I'm done with life at 14,I dont wanna sound like an edgy 14 year old but I wanna die I'm sick of life I've never been truly happy for a long time since I was 5 I was bullied through primary school I'm in an autistic secondary school that i hate and I keep getting into relationships so I dont feel suicidal all the time I'm not smart or good looking and all I wanna do Is play music but I'm a shit musician I'm constantly anxious or depressed. I just wanna die I've tried carrying on but after 3 years of wanting to die I just feel if it hasn't got better after 3 years when will it I cant cope anymore anti depressants arn't even working. I've even tried therapy
236,Sometimes I just want to hang up on life.,"I don't want to kill myself, but I just want my brain to shut up.

I want to stop thinking.

I just don't want to be me.

I hate my thoughts.

I hate the way I think.

I just want to pause my life, I just want to hang up, I don't want to die, but my brain won't shut up..."
237,Is it possible to be introverted and extroverted?,I’m not sure whether or not this is the subreddit for this question but it’s the only one i could think of to ask.
238,How to deal with anxiety and trust issues?,"Hey all. I hope this is an appropriate sub to post this question. I won't go into crazy detail, but I could use some advice.

I'm in a pretty new relationship with a sweet, amazing girl. I truly feel very blessed, but I can't help but have trust issues even though she's never given me a single reason to doubt her. When she goes a while without texting me back, I get very, very anxious. I freak out in my head and play every possible worst-case scenario there could be (even at times I know she's busy). Sometimes she'll use Snapchat and such without replying to mine, and I'm positive the only reason behind that is that she wants to be able to give me a proper response but I can't help but have this crippling anxiety.

I've always had anxiety, and have PTSD from some things I endured as a child, so I'm terrified of abandonment and betrayal. She's given me no reason to doubt her at all, literally not one reason, and I know I *can* trust her, but for some reason I can't convince my brain to. Any tips on dealing with this? I know this isn't a relationship sub, and I'm not asking for relationship advice. I'm asking for mental health advice so I don't ruin my relationship and end up damaging my own mental state further."
239,I am trying to only have beer every second day.,"Yes, this is my pathetic goal. While other my age (23) plan their lifes, their futures, their careers, I just try to stay sober for at least every second day. And only one or two beer at once.  


I have been drinking too much for around two years now I think. I ""learned"" it from my ex boyfriend. I don't know why I copied his drinking behaviour even though I saw what it did to him. But I did and now I drink whenever I feel sad or angry or frustrated or even just bored.  


Let's see for how long I will keep it up."
240,I feel like crawling out of my skin,"I can’t explan this except i can’t stand still and i feel like crawling out of my skin. I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD years ago, but i don’t feel anxiety behind this, just agitation and the need to move. What could this be?"
241,My best friend has dissociation and visions how can I help?,"One of my close friends suffers from dissociation and has visions of some fucked up stuff. He often dissociates and zones out in front of me, and he refuses to go to a doctor and when he has he hasn’t spoken. 
Kind of 3 questions here:
Are there any coping mechanism that he can use that id be able to pass on to him as he hasn’t been given any?
Is there anything His girlfriend or I can do to help him when’s he’s out of it and needs bringing back?
How can I convince him to go see a doctor and to stop smoking weed?
Thank you in advance I appreciate all help &lt;3"
242,Im scared my drug use is out of control,[removed]
243,I need help :(,"I’ve been trying to search for jobs but is been very difficult. I have SAD known as (social anxiety disorder) and it’s been keeping me from getting a job, i try to apply for jobs with the least amount of social interaction like popular restaurants and shops but those are the ones that are popular in my area. I don’t know what to do and i’m freaking out because I want to make some money. If anyone has any advice of what I should do please let me know in the comments.:)"
244,Intrusive thoughts about my internet privacy,"So i was on a messaging site since i was 11 years old, and did some very embarassing stuff. i've met a lot of awful people, and some even threatened to doxx me (they were 20-30 year olds) and one of them proclaimed that they have found my parents. I left the site for 3 years, and now i was back with my new account, only revealing myself to some of my internet friends. Over these past 3 years i developed a trauma, i have nightmares where everyone looks at me in the street and laughs at me, that those people who threatened me actually found me in real life, that i became a lolcow. I spent these 2 years in anxiety and a mental trauma. So anyway, i was contacting with those old friends, who didn't know my identity. everything was fine, i was keeping it cool and mature, I recovered from that trauma, but then i told my real friend about it and how vulnerable i am to such things, and instead of supporting me, he gives my internet friends hints of my real identity. don't know if they believe it or not, i even have thoughts that they know everything about me.  The problem is, my friend triggered my trauma and anxiety again. Now i can't sleep and i have intrusive thoughts about everything, sometimes i even wonder, if there is a picture of me somewhere, being mocked, harrased, laughed at. or are my internet friends actually my enemies, who are just playing the role of a friend while laughing at me behind my back, what if they actually know my identity?... I want these thoughts to stop, they are eating me from the inside, i can't sleep properly at night, I want these nightmares to stop. Ever since these thoughts started i don't recall having a good dream. I wish my friend could understand me, what am i going through, when he started giving hints, i wasn't that worried about it, but now he was sending them pictures of our mutual friends, and i am very worried that this could help them identify me."
245,hello! it's my first post,"i suppose this is a good place as any to introduce myself! my name is kal and i'm new to reddit. maybe you've seen me elsewhere on the internet, maybe not! (i don't use this username anywhere else though) but i'm recently trying to make a name for myself or something.

my mental health is okay lately... i recently got a job and am going back to school after two years of being in debt. it's been such a wild ride lately...

i hope everyone is well &lt;3 feel free to talk about whatever's on your mind !"
246,I just had a talk with my mum,"I finally told her how shit I'm feeling and I'm getting a counselor and she's telling my dad for me. It was so hard to tell her but now I feel a bit better knowing that that weight (at least) is off my shoulders. I know you probably won't care but I actually feel proud of myself for something for the first time in a while (even if that is just talking to my mum). Anyway, bye."
247,Resentment over being pushed around,"How to get over a former roommate and friend that heavily disrespected and bullied me towards the last few days I lived with him? I bought this fucker meals and gave him rides to and from work when he was low on savings and in need of help. Then he repays me the last few days I lived there with horsing around with me, calling me stupid and generally getting up in my personal space and acting all smug all to just throw his weight around and stroke his own ego. I was already ina bad place because I had moved there for a stressful job and I was getting ready to quit around the time I left. I didnt really react either, because I'm just not very confrontational and because of the fear of police being called or legal trouble.
Still, the feelings of belittlement, being a doormat and just being mogged or shat on still persist a year after it happened and I moved back home. It's just seething anger that comes and goes now. How to deal?
'hurr durr the more you let it bother you the more he wins'
This kind of mentality just leaves me feeling weak and vulnerable for someone else to treat me the same way. I need to know I'm not alone in having experienced this."
248,Sometimes when I'm hopeless I go buy one powerball and one megamillion ticket.," It gives me something to fantasize about and a modicum of hope for a day or two. Idk why I felt like sharing that, but there you go lol"
249,Finally found a drug that works... hopefully,"Hi All,
Brand new to this sub so please take it easy on me!
I’m 22M and have been diagnosed manic depressive and GAD since I was 14, and have struggled for a long time. I’ve been on basically every SSRI, SNRI and trycyclic antidepressant that you could name, been to 30+ psychologists and never had any success. Last year I spiralled into benzo addiction, ended up in hospital after seizures from withdrawals several times, but have finally kicked them. 
I found a new psychiatrist and have started on moclobemide - I’m about day 24 and this seriously seems like a miracle drug. I still have pretty hard down times, but when I feel good I feel on top of the world. I haven’t experienced happiness like I have in the last few weeks in literally years. Life feels like its worth living again. Anyway, just wanted to share! Love to you all. Together we can do anything!"
250,"To anyone who feels at an increased risk of suicide, you are not alone.",Share your experience
251,My father and sister make me feel horrible,"I can't do anything without my sister and even sometimes my father calling me crazy. I have depression, anxiety, ptsd, bdd, and disordered eating habits(I've never been diagnosed with an actual eating disorder), so I guess I just don't act normal enough. Whenever I try to explain myself they literally just walk away. My sister always blocks my number when I try to talk to her, and she keeps saying things she know triggers me, denies she said anything and then calls me crazy or says I have issues or something. She NEVER acts like this to her friends with any sort of mental health issues, so I don't understand why she does with me. She's seen me getting into an ambulance when I tried to kill myself and she saw the blood on the floor, but she still says I'm making it up. My dad literally walks out of the house, slamming everything he can on his way out, and just leaves me. I try to explain myself and he either talks over me and says I'm selfish and ungrateful or ignores me and walks away. My mother is the only person that doesn't immediately make me feel like she thinks I'm crazy and she actually makes an attempt to understand what I'm saying, but she just tells me that ""things will get better eventually"" and things like that. I don't think my father and sister mean to make me feel so bad, but they never listen to me when I tell them it does and they keep doing it, so that's what really pisses me off."
252,What do I do?,"So one of my friends has PTSD and mental regression. He copes by mentally regressing to a toddler. I'm one of the few people he has told, and he asked me to help by babysitting (basically someone to look after him and make sure he doesn't hurt himself). But the problem is, thinking about doing that makes me stressed, he wears nappies and said I might have to change them! I do not feel comfortable with that but don't know how to tell him because he trusted me with the information and seems to really need me,and I struggle saying no to people anyway. He also told another mutual friend, who said 'no' several times until he kinda pressured her into doing it. He also told her that 1% of the time it is a fetish/sexual thing, and I'm his ex and do not need that right now. I don't know what to do because I don't want to crush him, but I am going through my own things right now (possibly depression). What do I tell him? How do I tell him? Also, am I being totally stupid or naive about any of this, or insensitive? I honestly have no idea and it's stressing me out!"
253,I just want to attack and torture something innocent and I don’t know why,I [17m] have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to get something innocent and just torture it and hurt it for no good reason. I want to scream at it and tell it how much I hate it. I don’t know why I feel like this it makes me feel horrendous because I could never hurt someone I loved or something like a kitten or baby animal. But for some reason I have this horrible feeling of wanting to just unload and torture something small and innocent like a toddler or a baby cartoon character. I’ve gotten a rubber duck and stamped on it and ripped it apart but I still feel this feeling. Please don’t think I’m trying to be edgy or I’m doing this for attention this is a genuine concern and I’m trying my best.
254,"I feel quite alone tonight, I just need a hug...",Just a warm hug from someone who really cares about me. I suffer of physical and psychological abuse from my own parents. My brain tells me to to cut my arm but I don't want to break my 2 months clean. I want to stop feeling empty at night. :(&lt;3
255,Going back to therapy but I'm actually going to be honest this time,[removed]
256,How do I convince a psychiatrist that I need help?,I’ve been struggling with depression for quite a while and I finally went to see my school psychiatrist and she thinks I’m faking it
257,i dont know whats happening to me,"i don’t even know if this is the right flair, but there is something really fucked up about me. in november 2018 i started to really think that my school friends were talking to me only to talk to other people about me, like to monitor me. i was convinced for so long, until literally this moment i’m thinking maybe they actually were just talking to me. i swear i heard them talking and whispering about me, and i’d see them walking together talking about me. they’d be sitting on the beach whispering, and i walked back to school to get away from the stress of thinking about it, but they were in their rooms, studying as if they never left. i don’t know if what’s been happening to me for the past 2 years was real or not."
258,"I overcame social anxiety disorder years ago, now I'm helping others overcome as well! Ask me anything (AMA)","A little background about me: I struggled with severe Social Anxiety for the majority of my life. I was always the shy and introverted guy, even up until my 30s.

A long story short, I missed out on many career opportunities because of my inability to speak in front of people. Whenever I tried to, I would stutter and my mink would go blank, leaving those around me extremely uncomfortable and to deeply shaming myself as a result. This eventually lead to having panic attacks whenever I found myself in situations in which I may be put on the spot to speak.

And I also missed out on having deep meaningful relationships because I did not have the ability to be present let alone listen carefully to what other people were sharing with me. It prevented me from being vulnerable with my wife who I absolutely adore and in my opinion, it is the worst human condition to have simply because it’s prevents connection with others.

Seeing years of my life and my goals, hopes, and dreams pass me by, sent me on an 8-year search for answers starting with CT brain scans and doctors. Who all told me I was fine, and put me on medication (which did not help).

I tried everything. Talk-therapy, Self-love/Affirmations, CBT, Exposure therapy, Hypnosis, and many more tools which didn’t get to the root of the issue. But eventually through much trial and error I was able to heal. It wasn't easy, and it took a lot of action on my part, but at the end of the day I am fully free and it was a matter of finding the right information.

No more physical symptoms and regaining the ability to connect with people whether in groups or one-on-one. A life fueled by freedom and accomplishing my goals. Now, I coach people step by step to overcome social anxiety because through coaching people are able to shift their mindsets while also having someone to hold them personally accountable (the two keys to personal mastery).

So ask me anything 😊

What questions do you have for me?

DISCLAIMER: When I mean ""overcome"" social anxiety, what I mean is that I no longer have intense physical symptoms. There is a fine line between nervousness and utter panic/terror. So now it doesn’t matter what the situation is, speaking to a stranger or speaking in front of hundreds of people, I just feel a bit of healthy nervousness (it’s what makes us human right?). No more out of body experiences and losing complete control."
259,Unwanted thoughts?,"So, yesterday, I had an odd feeling. I can't describe it as anything else other than negative thoughts being injected into my brain and fears of doing harm. I know I'm not the type of person to want to hurt people, but it still scares me. I'm not sure if it was some form of panic attack, since I'm prone to getting those, especially shortly before/after my period, and I've been getting extremely stressed lately (mostly due to a lack of interactions with friends, difficulties with my parents, possible childhood trauma, etc.). My question is how can I keep this from affecting me in the future and if I should try to get a proper diagnosis after this pandemic is under control?"
260,Insecurity and never being good enough,"First post here, but I’ve been sitting with some of these thoughts for a while and I had to rant a bit while I’m feeling brave.

For a little context - I’m an artist and a part time streamer. My work CONSTANTLY relies on a very simple rule : “ you must be the first to do it, and you must do it well to be successful “ which is easier said than done. I have constant struggles with depression and anxiety but this year has been a pretty progressive year for my mental health. (Last year posting anything like this would have sent me into panic) I’ve really pushed forward to heal. 

Recently I’ve noticed, while I work on my self confidence, I’m having a bad time with personal insecurity. Feeling as if i’ve never created anything good enough or unique enough and that I’ll never make it to the goals I’m aiming for (self employment, full time streaming, successful freelancing etc.) While I grow my community connections I realize this comes out as jealousy very easily and it is NOT my intention to look spiteful and cranky at other’s success. 

The old saying that goes “there’s always someone who will do it better” makes these feelings worse. People say it to make you feel better but it just alienates my negative feelings. It feels like even if I do something that I’m so proud of, something I think is new, what’s the point if someone does it better? It’s irrelevant that I’ve made it. As a creator this can be pretty detrimental to my work. 

I know admitting it’s a problem is a good way to start but I wonder if I’ll ever see the end of these insecure feelings and if I can one day view things without being afraid it’ll harm my chances at success.

Anyway... I guess I thought I had more to say but that’s pretty much it... feels good to finally type it out so to those who read through, thanks!"
261,How do I care for my friends whilst also dealing with my own mental problems?,"I have many friends who are all going through something mentally, big or small and I try to help them through it as best as I can manage. People seem to trust me fairly easily, and I’m glad of it. But I feel like it’s putting a pressure on me to be OK, because when you’re feeling down or sad, you don’t want to talk to another down/sad person to help. You want someone outside of your current emotions. I’m scared to tell them I really don’t like the why I look and I’m currently dieting at a fairly young age and it’s been really stressing me out. I especially don’t want to mention it around a friend whom I love more than I can express who struggles with an ED. How can I help my friends while also taking care of my mental health?"

263,"is this a mental health thing, or was i too young? or are both possible?","my mom recently told me that when i was in 2nd grade, my parents almost got a divorce. i had absolutely no idea, and her saying that triggered some memories that i feel are related to that but i still don't recall that at all. i do remember several important events from 2nd grade and i feel like i would have remembered an almost-divorce. was i just too young to expect me to remember that now, or does this mean something?"
264,The nobody of suicide,[removed]
265,Was I raped?,"I was in a very abusive relationship, but have been out of it for around 10 months. I have my struggles with it still, but generally I’m happy that I’ve been set free from that abuse. 

There was an instance in the beginning of said relationship where my ex inserted himself in me after I told him not to, and that I would only have unprotected sex after he had been tested. He didn’t seem to care very much and still inserted himself unprotected. I was very upset and annoyed at the moment, but don’t know if I ever considered it rape. But now I’m starting to think maybe this was rape. 

What do you think?"
266,Random bursts of frustration / irritation. How do you cope?,"Hey!

As the the title says I have recently been having random bursts of frustration and irritation. The tiniest sounds (a message notification, someone yawning, even someone taking) is making me increasingly irritated. I actually have to cover my ears, and my body genuinely tenses and I want to scream at whatever is making the noise. 

I do have GAD, so it makes sense for me to be anxious all the time, but I've never been this frustrated and annoyed by every little thing. Does anyone ever feel this way? How do you cope with it? Quarantining with 4 other people makes avoiding sounds impossible. 

I appreciate any feedback!"
267,Scared to call a Crisis Line,"I’ve been in a crisis for a while and I feel like I’m really close to acting on my thoughts. I want to call the crisis line but I’m scared of talking on the phone. Also, will they send the police to my house?"
268,How to take control of depression during the pandemic?,"Hey guys!
So recently since this whole lock down and quarantine has happened I’ve been having probably the worst case of depression I’ve had in a very long time. My college is all online so I spend a majority of the day sitting at home on the computer. I also have to work at the hospital on the weekends but lately I’ve been working once or twice a month because I’m so scared of getting sick.
So I’m spending A LOT of time at home, As I’m sure just like a lot of other people. Now I just feel so sad lately and I have a hard time getting up and doing things. I don’t know how to put my plans into actions anymore.

I also don’t have much friends at the moment because I just moved to the town I’m in.

How can I manage this? I’m trying to get in to see a therapist but seems like a lot of the local ones that take my insurance are booked up. Any virtual suggestions?"
269,"I’m worried about an acquaintance, but I don’t know what to do to help.","TW: Substance Abuse

My brother in law has a very good friend that has been struggling with mental illness and substance abuse for a while. He’s recently quit all drugs and has since gone to rehab, but this just seemed to make the problem worse. Since quitting, he’s been saying very bizarre things and has vocalized thoughts that I can only compare to extreme paranoia. There are stray cats in my brother in law’s backyard that he believes are spying on him. It really troubles me, but I really don’t know what to do. He’s aware that he can’t control these things and has openly spoken about the issues, but he has no family, no money and no other real support besides my brother in law. I don’t know what he’s going through, I don’t know him well enough, but I know he needs some time of help that we can’t provide. Are there any state programs or services that can help someone going through this? I’ve tried to look online, but all I find are hotline calls and general information about seeking counseling. He doesn’t have insurance or enough money to entertain the thought of seeking help again so I don’t want to present an idea of therapy, because I don’t know what something like that would end up costing.

He’s so isolated these days that it really worries me. I really don’t know what to do in this situation and I know he won’t get help on his own. Please, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you."

271,Can people with ASPD fall and stay in love?,"So there is a new popular korean romance drama titled “It’s Okay Not to be Okay” which features a girl with ASPD who shows interest with the male lead. I’ve googled a bit about ASPD back then but haven’t come across any studies that indicate for sure if relationships with people with ASPD work out well for a long time. I just wanna make sure that the drama is portraying realistic themes before recommending it to others to prevent misinformation. I’ve read somewhere where people with ASPD end up being abusive to their partners in the long run. So far, the drama has done a good job portraying someone in the autism spectrum."

273,"How to get through the rest of summer break, lonely?","I have no friends. Literally nobody I know IRL that can be considered one.

Before quarantine started for me (5 months ago) I was talking with my therapist about my life. I talked about having no friends and she encouraged me to get involved in out of school activities which really helped. She also encouraged me to try to become more social.

Of course just as I was improving my life quarantine came to ruin it all. I’ve managed to occupy myself thus far with the internet and video games, but it’s starting to get unbearable and I find myself sleeping and browsing social media an unhealthy amount and it is having a massive toll on my mental health.

I can’t wait to get back to school, even if it’s only part time. 

But, I don’t get back until September 8th which is still about a month and a half away.

Can someone give me suggestions on how I can make this time a little bit easier for me to get through?"

I don’t know what to do"
275,I don’t know what calm is.,"I don’t crave benzos or my Kpins 

When you have a mind like mine that’s used to constant disappointment, I can’t help but think negatively about any situation and myself, get really down when people talk down about me and how I deal with my life , and the littlest things that many people can rationally deal with on their own I freak out about and think it’s the end of the world you don’t crave drugs. You crave that feeling of calmness over constant anxeity, worrying, and extreme stress, that feeling of just for a moment everything feels fine and everything bad melts away. Just for a moment or two when your mind is a complete fucking hurricane and there’s something that’s able to calm the storm, what the fuck wouldn’t you crave normality? Who wouldn’t take a moment of feeling okay when daily life is nothing is more than constant worry? Constant terrible moments of your life playing over and over on repeat and the worst of it comes out when you do try to relax or fall asleep. The mind races, which makes the heart react the same, and you have this NEVER ENDING ALWYAS THERE fear and worry nothing will ever work out because in the past it just hasn’t. How do you cope with childhood PTSD and being afraid of the slightest raise in voice or even tone can take you back to terrible memories that are triggered by someone who possibly hasn’t even done anything to make them fear you. The fear of rejection and the fear of being judged about ANYTHING especially when you’re just trying to cope, ESPECIALLY by the one who’s supposed to love you the most cuts deeper than I can with a razor blade through my skin. And the fact that NOT. ONE. SINGLE. PERSON. on this earth understands me or understands my particular mental or psychological issues just makes me feel even worse about myself than i already do. I know I’m a fucking loser. I know I’m not smart. I know I’m not good at ANYTHING. I know I’m worthless. And every time I try I get shot down or my husband thinks something shady while I am at work. Who would want to work if it caused problems with the one person that’s the reason you’re still living? Nobody. He’s embarrassed me and almost cheated on me when I had jobs. At least if I’m home he can’t say I’m cheating which means he shouldn’t hit up Olivia or that ugly bitch Bradley’s sister OR THE HOOKER. if I don’t work he won’t have thoughts and he won’t cheat. Maybe he will I don’t know. I may have my issues but I know I’m way too good of a woman to fuck over or use I’m the one that stays for life. That’s the only thing about myself I am confident about. I will never be understood by anyone and nobody cares enough to try to. I’m sorry my fucking brain doesn’t work like everyone else’s. I’m sorry I’m not normal. I’m sorry I’m damaged goods. But there’s nothing I can do about it. If I would’ve died last year my biggest regret would be not allowing myself to make the most out of this shitty probably short life I’ve been given. And making the most is self medicating to me. Because that’s what makes ME FEEL BETTER I’m so worried about pleasing everyone else and that’s why I suffer the way I do. I don’t crave drugs, I crave the feelings it takes away and the peace in my soul. Even if just only temporary."

P. S. I hope this post doesn't get removed and be deemed irrelevant to this sacred subreddit hehe. It would just really mean a lot if more people can view and hopefully be inspired by my narrative. It's not that big of a story but i'm just hoping it would or could help some of you guys here who are dealing with the same things and issues."
277,How to deal with the feeling of constant failure?,"First of all, gonna say that this might be a long post, i like to write a lot.

A bit pissed right now since half of what i wrote got erased, thanks to my browser.

Want to give some context, so my thought process will show.

With all this quarantine stuff going on, i am spending a lot of time at home, so are my \_friends\_ .

Didn't really bother me so much since i'm used to stay at home, read, play video games or watch tv; all good. Since most of my \_friends\_ also got to stay home, we could finally team up for some online games.  

I always had this attitude of trying to be good, be my best. So i started practicing and watching/reading guides, but not those 5 minutes quick tips, i really went deep and i searched long videos and guides. I also had invested a lot of time on to this game and i was about to invest a bit more to actually perform well to have a good time and win with everyone.

Most, if not everyone, that i know/play with are ranked above me, nothing wrong with that, i have always been a fairly average player, but this time i was doing my homework with all this long tutorials, guides and so on. Some weekends there were amateur tournaments, and with everyone stuck at home we could just go in and see how far we go.

You can't win everything, and that's ok, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

Being that said, after weeks investing time to improve i didn't really do much to push wins and sometimes i was the weak one that made the team lose. But everything was fairly ok... Until a few days back where things started to blow up.

As i said before, i invested a lot of time trying to improve, and i noticed how people i know and \_Friends\_ i play with contradict a lot, i mean a lot of what i was learning for various sources, commom mistakes and some quite deep that could make you lose the game fast and still, everyone is ranked above me...

A few weeks ago i was listening to a interview to a ""Pro"" team in my area, they were talking about how they got to the highest rank possible in the game and how it's to play in such high level. I asked a question, the host read it and it was silence, quite weird since it was a fairly simple question but that involved ""high level"" play to answer. The host switched to another silly question to keep the interview going and get out of the akward silence but then, he asked another question and the answer of one of the ""pro"" players showed a complete lack of understanding of the game, and the worst part is that no one in his team corrected or commented anything. I closed the interview.

This got me thinking... How all these people are ranked so above me without knowing simple stuff? I mean, they must know something to be any higher from the average, but after hearing that interview of ""actual pro"" players... Got my high doubts.

Then, this weekend i was able to play with a few friends and the brother of one of them that has more than one account in high ranks, everything ok, but now in game he was playing in a very cocky way and, basically, showed so many mistakes that anyone in his rank shouldn't commit. We played for a long while and lost everything.

I got stuck thinking... My investment and effort, why i am not actually improving or winning more? What is wrong with me? It's like you know tricks to cook really good, you follow steps but at the end someone with no real knowledgement ends up having better results than you.

Finally, yesterday i was really positive, i finished my work, after that i watched a couple of new guides i found making my knowledgement emphasize in what to do and what not to do. I went to play a few games and i lost everything, again. 

Yes, every time i go i see improvements but not actual results, and still, everyone that surrounds me show commom mistakes and things they should avoid doing... Keep winning, keep being above me.

So it... It started rolling off me. ""What's wrong with me?""

I just closed the game feeling like a failure. Once in bed, thoughts really rolled inside me and some memories as well.

This is something that happends to me quite often, to other hobbies and things i like to do, i do my ""homework"", i invest time trying to be better and when the time comes, i fall short.

Also reminded me of this one time in School where i wanted to get into Physics olympics, i studied for days preparing for the preliminary test, a few \_friends\_ noticed that, and wanted to ""give it a try"" as well, but ""it's easy, i'll just go and see how do i do"". The day came, i was confident until i sat down i couldn't resolve not even half of the test. After i finished, every \_friend\_ that also went was like ""that was a breeze... easy, right? how did you do?"" While i did terrible and they were like ""Who would study for this? It was so easy"". When the grades came, i was the lowest of anyone in my class that went to give it a shot.

As a side note... A few months back, before quarantine, i started going to the therapist, long story what happened, but in short... I ""survived"". A few sessions in, my therapist told me that she sees a lot of potential in me, that i have so many good things in me and i just have to explode them, i took note, but i always thought that ""Potential"" is a empty word, since anything that is ""potential"" it's something that could be, but it really isn't. Still, she kept telling me that i have to invest and improve to explode my potential, you know, exactly what i did to become better in this one freaking game.

(Sadly, with all the Covid19 thing, i couldn't keep my sessions and we are on hold with my therapist)

And still... Things kept getting worse making me go to dark places, again, places that i really didn't touched in months. ""Why am i such a failure, why can't i do anything good, so this is why i don't really have friends, why everyone ghost me"" and so on... To add ""If this happends to me when i am trying to become better in a silly stupid video game, what can i expect of my profession? With all this... I will be just a failure at my work as well apparently...""

Now anyone can add ""Hard work beats natural talent"", yeah... I know it won't be instant, that's why i am ranting and feeling quite bad after months of investing myself, not just a few days.

To close everything up, my girlfriend, that noted me down told me ""I think that you shouldn't feel like this over something that silly, it worries me"". Oh, yeah, sure, i like feeling bad for being such a failure after investing so many hours in guides and tutorials in a game i've played for almost a decade, but she is right and  anyone in his right mind will first think that being that affected over a game it's beyond dumb.

SO, with all, ALL this context before hand... 

How can i overcome or deal with this creepling feeling of being a failure, that no matter how much i invest myself into stuff i am never that good, i never really improve or at least i am happy with my performance even if its a hobby, a passion of mine or even my work?

...  


Thanks for reading."
278,"Ive been sad for no reason so and its getting worse, also kind of a long post, sorry","For the past few weeks ive been sad for no reason, ive cried alot at night and talked to my friend whos dog was just put down so shes kinda sad too, anyway ive just been sad and this day it was just worse than ever i was sad like the whole day, i had my friend talk to me and i also talked to her when her dog was put down because i know the feeling, ive had about 5 dogs out down so that might be part of the reason why im sad, also a few days ago my friend told me that she had cut herself about a year ago, and well i did too, sadly. I just wanted to see if there were any people on reddit who could help me because i feel kinda depressed, i feel just empty, anxious, just sad, also i love riding my minibike but now its just really boring and i dont really enjoy it even tho i should and i cant sleep, if there are people who could/want to help please reach out to me, i have also started shaking badly when i get sad at night and im scared to tell my parents because i dont want to make them sad and them to tell everyone, i also dont want to go to a therapist or anything because i feel like it would make it worse, like bringing up all of my bad past and i dont feel comfortable with talking to random people, especially about my past pets, thanks and bye.."
279,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I just want to tell SOMEONE","I recently was able to get a real therapist.  She addressed my medication (unchanged for over 15 years).  Two days after changing meds I mopped the kitchen floor for the first time in memory and initiated sex with my husband.  Mental health issues NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT MORE.

I hope you have a win in your book today too.  
~Love from an internet stranger!!"
280,Why keep up the fight?,"I have had several severe depressions throughout my life, and I am currently undergoing another one at the moment, every time I learn some coping mechanisms and exercises to circumvent it, it just feels like a never ending struggle.

What’s the point of keeping up the fight to get out of a depression, just to feel okay for a brief moment, and then only to await for the next depression about to happen?

I know it’s a pessimistic point of view, but by personal experience this is all I know and all that life has given me so far."
281,How to deal with feeling devalued from harassment?,"I know it wasn’t my fault, but I always feel unworthy and like an outsider my family. I feel like a fraud or a let down because they don’t know I was weak enough to be taken advantage of (neither am I planning to ever tell them because I know they would blame me). overall, I just feel ashamed and undeserving of love."
282,Is my therapist asking me to ignore how I feel about the Pandemic?,"I recently had an online appointment with my therapist and I let her know how anxiety riddled I’ve been and how strange it is to try and find a job when I don’t want to risk my health. I also stated how absurd it was that there are some people who refuse to quarantine or wear masks.

Her reaction to this was strange, she almost glossed over the pandemic, calling it the new normal and that we are all having some difficulties adjusting to this but that I can’t be scared of it and that it just exists. She also said there were good arguments on both sides for wearing masks, which I did not ask more about since I basically spiraled into a panic attack from her lack of acknowledgement. She is a great therapist and maybe she was having an off day, but has anyone else come across this type of “new normal” therapist speak of and then proceed to talk about something else?"
283,Im 90% sure im fucked up,Pretty sure im a low level sociopath
284,COVID has me Freaked Out,"My Mom though it would be a lovely idea to watch 2011s *Contagion* tonight and it was way overwhelming. After watching person after person die of disease, I ended up leaving and hiding away in my room where I burst out in tears. I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen if I somehow contracted and had a bad reaction to COVID 19, and kept envisioning myself dying alone in a sterile hospital room while my family was forced to sit at home knowing they would never see me alive again. 

I've been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with Generalized Anxiety Disorder with depressive recovery and Agoraphobia. I was making really good progress before the quarantine started; using a combination of medication and therapy, I was going out and socializing more than I ever had and hadn't had a bad episode in months. I finished high-school and was excited for college. Now I feel like all that progress has been stripped away. I'm practically a hermit these days; I interact with my immediate family, but don't really hear from my friends other than the occasional text. My anxiety is getting out of hand again; it's getting hard to control my thoughts and little things overwhelm me. I'm not excited for college anymore. I just feel a lot of anger, disappointment, and fear that I can't rationalize. Any advice or support would be much appreciated. I know I kind of sound like a whiny brat, but I just needed to get this all out somewhere."
285,Do i have some sort of anxiety?,I recently been nauseous and have these moments where i can feel my heart pulse i checked my heart rate its normal but i feel it i also got a fever maybe its that but its not a high fever its its 37c° I also feel like throwing up but also not??? I don't know what's going on i mainly feel very nauseous and worried it started as of monday when my cousins left after a long stay.  I sometimes feel normal and then bam i feel weird its not crippling just i feel unable to do things like eat or think clearly please someone help idk what's going on and I'm scared. Please comment or private message me i just need to understand what's happening before going to a doctor since my parents are scared of going out because of covid 19
286,I’m actually excited to wake up tomorrow,"I’ve had an eating disorder (Anorexia) since January. Getting sent from from college in March really made matters worse. I practically starved myself every day from March through last week week. But I think I’ve finally turned the corner. I’m starting to eat more (and actually enjoy food without guilt). Plus I’m not forcing myself to do extreme amounts of exercise 7 days a week.

For the first time in a long time, I’m actually excited to wake up tomorrow and enjoy my day without obsessing over my calorie and step count for the day. I forgot what it was like to be excited for tomorrow."
287,Why don't I feel guilty for being horrible to myself even though I would feel guilt for treating others that way?,"I've been thinking about it for weeks and it frustrates me so much that I want to tear my hair out.

I've always had VERY low self esteem and I've suffered from a slew of mental health issues for the last decade or so. My inner monologue is just a never-ending cycle of tearing myself down, I've had self harm problems, been suicidal, etc. And obviously I don't like being this way, but I don't feel GUILT about being mean to myself. I don't think of it as morally wrong. I kind of feel like the victim of emotional abuse or something, but I don't feel like the abuser. Even though I guess I'm both, since I'm the one treating myself poorly.

Is it just not possible to feel guilt over treating yourself poorly? Is it possible to like... not have empathy for yourself? I hope this makes sense. Not sure if it belongs here or in a different subreddit, I'm just interested in what people have to say."
288,My body doesn’t feel like my home anymore,"I used to have an eating disorder and even if it was through unhealthy means I ended up starting to like my body like a year or more ago and then I gained 20 lbs and started drinking alcohol.
I’ve been ignoring my health issues assuming they were from alcohol and eating issues.
But now I’m trying to eat healthy or at least as healthy as I can. I feel like I’m not losing weight as easily. It’s an accomplishment just to lose 2 lbs and before I could easily lose 5. If I mess up I gain the 2 lbs back immediately.

I’m going to get tested for PCOS because I didn’t realize a lot of things were possible symptoms of that and I just kept ignoring most of it until recently. My fatigue, not being able to lose weight, irregular painful periods, bad hair, acne etc I just tried to ignore and assumed they were genetic, but neither of my siblings have those problems. 

But I was thin for the most part until recently.
my body bloating and round stomach is something that I’m so uncomfortable with, I was used to having a flat stomach and now I don’t have that anymore. I know it probably sounds stupid to a lot of people and my family thinks it’s stupid since they’re all overweight or obese. But I don’t really get to enjoy wearing cute clothes anymore, and I think 2 of my big baggy sweaters I use to hide my body were either lost or stolen.
It might be a health issue but I’m not going to know for sure if it is until next month or something."
289,I'm afraid my life will never be normal again.,"I want to apologize if I go into detail about my life, I'm currently feeling scared and anxious and writing this out is making me feel somewhat better. I also want to apologize if everything is messy.

I'm a overweight 24 year old male with low self esteem. I like to think of myself as a happy kid and teenager. Comparing to myself as of now at least. I used to be able to look at everything and enjoy every aspect and think of how beautiful the life I'm living is. I was a dancer looking to work in the fields of film and video production. My childhood wasn't too bad, I don't dwell on it everyday. I had abusive old brothers, the eldest of which would have no problem hurting us. He'd apologize every so often, the second oldest was physically and mentally abusive. He definitely hurt my self image growing up. 

Despite everything I looked at them and realized I wanted to be better. Unfortunately I couldn't follow through. I took up alcohol at age 19 and started to abuse it. I lost my dad, gained weight, and I lost my girlfriend of 3 years because of my change in behavior. I was an abusive boyfriend, I wanted to end that relationship before I started to become abusive but she threatened to kill herself if I left. She even attempted. That was the first time I felt trapped, I acted out because of it. When we broke up, I was hurt. I loved her but I was toxic for her. Even then, I wanted to move on with my life. Then one day the cops showed up and arrested me. I'm doing 2 years of a conditional sentence, I have to attend domestic violence meetings with my probation officer (I haven't attended for 4 months so that might be another reason why I'm feeling bad).

This is where my anxiety started spiraling out of control. After my break up I was sober for 4 months. Mainly because I didn't want to be sad AND drunk but eventually I took up drinking again because I wanted to be with my friends. I was doing 4 day binges of hard liquor with my friends and brothers. The only time I had fun was when I was drunk but of course there's always gonna be bad days when we drink. I got into a fight with my older brother. I went blank and defended my other brother Grey. I punched my older brother in the jaw giving him a massive cut on his lip, he was taken in by the cops and ambulance to receive stitches. The next day was the first time I've ever experienced a panic attack. I was hungover and full of regret. I thought I was having a stroke. i feared for my life as my older brother drove me to meet the ambulance half way. I promised to stop drinking and change my diet and lifestyle from there but I didn't. I started drinking again, kept eating poorly, and just stayed home always and because of that I started developing symptoms of depression. I have no motivation, I can't focus without my mind going to a bad place for no reason, I don't wanna see people because I'm afraid of what they might say behind my back, I wasn't excited when I bought my first car and when I was accepted to return to University, and I'm constantly scared that my mental well being will worsen. So I quit alcohol and smoking hopefully for the final time. The only time i feel normal is when I'm attending certain events where no one knows the things I've done or when I'm with my mom. I want to be happy again but I'm afraid I'm too late. That by the time I start losing weight and leave for University I'll already be too far gone. I just want to be me again."
290,"When I get depressed, I work out more?",[removed]
291,Does anyone else ever feel so overwhelmed with emotions they feel like they could explode?,Or is that just me?
292,HYPERSEXUAL POST SEX ABUSE,"I wanted to tell this to the world for so long but I always  felt embarrassed by it but With this reddit I want to just let it out let it out to the world Because I need help with this but I believe I have hyper sexual it started when I was  5 years old when my big sister told me to massage her back and butt and as boy a lot of emotions was going through my head I’m thinking this wat I’m suppose to do I’m a boy and she is a girl so I’m thinking this is acceptable and she made it seemed like it was acceptable so I thought it is okay we keep doing it up till I got older because we moved to a different house and i didn’t really see her so often and so she moved upstairs in my two house house when I got in the 5th grade and she use constantly tease me like bend over in front of me tell me to come lay down with her bump me with her butt it was a lot she even gave me 2 dollars to fold her underwear and so like me in middle school I was lonely I had nothing to look forward to in middle school I had no girls  so I liked it I’m think this the best it get for me so why not 
And so high school rolls around and she move and everything is forgotten I had a girlfriend and I was straight on a narrow path until I was 19 and went broke and went into depression so one day I see my sister again and I start to those weird feelings again and we start hugging and she puts my hand on her chest and I removed it because it felt weird to do it In front of everybody but nobody saw and then I seen her again and she puts her hand on my chest so at this point I’m aroused and I grabbed her butt but she moves away and said that’s not how you show love to ur sister then my brother came in the kitchen then she sits her butt on my leg then I walked  out why do I feel so bad and depressed about this I keep blaming me for liking and going with lt I don’t know I just want help I’m so sad I hope this helps a lot of you out there"
293,I want to stop existing.,I don’t want to kill myself but I just want everything to stop I just want to fall asleep one night and never wake up. I feel like a spectator in my own life. I don’t feel like I’m even a real person. I feel like my entire body is on auto pilot and I’m just here for the ride. I just want to feel normal.
294,What are your favorite movies to watch when having a depressive episode to cheer you up,"In a funk right now and feeling down. This will probably last a while, so in order to distract myself and keep everything as positive as can be, what happy movies should I watch? I love childhood movies (I grew up in the late 90s and 2000s so anything from that time period is my fav) but Id love to hear what everyone else watches"
295,I can’t stand my mother’s (probably)depression-caused forgetfulness,"I love my mother. I really do. I’m grateful for all that she does for me.

But if I had a quarter for every conversation my mother starts where I feel like jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge in order to end the back-and-forth, I’d have enough money to afford moving out.

I’m 18 and I spent my high school years in a boarding school, Monday through Friday. My first year of college, I spent at my apartment until COVID-19 ruined everything and forced me to go back home. In between graduation from high school and now, my parents separated, and though this didn’t cause her depression(she’s had it for fucking decades now), it certainly worsened it. My brother and sister are older than me by a fair bit and they don’t even bother listening to my mom, so I’m the one who has to pick up the slack and deal with her. For example:

-I’m the one who had to listen to her problems with Dad.
-I’m the one who listens to her complain about my siblings “not caring enough” about her
-I’m the one who listens to her bitch about back pain and her nerves
-etc etc etc

Now she’s forgetting shit. She’s acting like she has Alzheimer’s, forgetting anything we tell her at night, essentially, calling us over and over for the same shit, leaving her phone everywhere, meaning we can’t fucking call her, and forcing us to explain ourselves whenever she finds out that something’s gonna happen.

I can’t fucking deal with this, I’m the only one who lives here consistently with her and she drags down all of my mornings and nights after I come home from babysitting two stressful children. Now college is starting up online and I probably won’t be able to keep my apartment, so I’ll have to spend another trimester dealing with her constantly ask about my fucking grades, nagging me about studying, interrupting the few non-irritating conversations we have with “are you  taking your medicine regularly?” or “you have to do x”. 

Then when you try to tell her that “mom, we’ve already had this conversation, I don’t really wanna have it again, I’ll explain it later” she gets all puffy and says shit like “fine, I’ll leave you alone” in an I-feel-like-I’m-the-victim-here sort of tone, or other phrases like “I’m always the problem” and “nobody cares about me” in the same tone.

I’ve graduated from not really wanting to talk to her all that much for fear of having to repeat myself or justify myself again, to dreading having to speak to my own mother.

How do I fucking deal with this?"
296,medication,"Uh so I feel uncomfortable typing this out even though I know there shouldn’t be any stigma around mental health and stuff but yeah. I didn’t want to post this in the depression or Suicide Watch subreddit because I didn’t want to take help away from people who need it immediately so here will have to do. 

I finally laid out the major points of all the shittyness with my therapist and mentioned how I’ve been suicidal since I was a child (on and off) and she said she didn’t want to push antidepressants because she felt that it should always be the patients decision which I appreciate but she filled me in briefly and addressed some of my concerns. I made it clear that I most likely was not going to ask for a prescription for a month or two after CBT to see if I improve. (I don’t like medicating because if I’m not actually depressed and this is my baseline what happens if I randomly take it and I don’t actually need to ‘fix’ my brain?)

When I got home, I thought it was a good idea to at least pretend I was open to it and did some research. And I have narrowed it to three types of antidepressants (the three I would be willing to look further into): SSRI’s, NDRI’s, and NDRA’s. What I’m worried about is they all seem to have serious side effects to teenagers, and are NOT recommended by the NHS to children under 18. I am 15. 

Serious side effects as in a risk for an increase in suicidal thoughts and actions... which to me defeat their purpose. Also, I am suicidal right now. Not the worst I’ve ever been, but if I have the meds and I get in deeper, I’m worried about using them inappropriately. 

Wow this is long. Question: Is the risk worth it if I’m still not sure I’m actually depressed; and is it worth it if I might use the meds for what they are supposed to prevent? How common are the less serious affects like weight gain and insomnia? 

TLDR- To use antidepressants or not"
297,It's me again,"I posted here last week for some real help. It did work to calm me down but when I confronted my mother about this,she just said it's the mobile phone.

Now our results came and our whole batch was pretty much bad. She is really mad for no reason and is just saying blatant words like before, making me think I am the wrong doer.

I JUST WANT TO FUCKING KILL HER.

I WILL NOT STOP IF SHE SAYS SOMETHING USELESS AND UNREQUITED THING NEXT TIME.!!!!

Please help I want some online help.😭"
298,An entry from my mental madness journal (was not originally going to post so somethings might not make sense),"Whenever I think about my future I genuinely think of suicide as an option after realizing the harsh reality that I’d have to get a job, write college essays, learn to drive, learn to pay bills, buy an apartment, etc. All of that seems so mundane and stupid. Only necessary in the society we’ve created or some shit. I get so anxious thinking about it like I’ll never be able to do it and that it’s just too hard. Which I know is a false belief considering a crap ton of people can do it but I just REALLY don’t want to. I fully dread doing it. So much so that I’d rather commit. Damn I need a fucking therapist like why the hell does the thought of doing normal adult shit terrify me to such a degree? I love some parts of living as an individual human consciousness such as being able to appreciate nature and its energy, the little things like the smell of a musty elevator, and certain interactions with cool people but the thought of my future is a huge weight that just sits in the back of my mind until it comes shoving itself to the forefront at every chance it gets. I don’t have a fully negative perception of my future though. It would be cool to ride a motorcycle (however actually going through the process to learn it does not excite me), be a mentor to and a bit of sunshine in other people's lives who are also struggling mentally, and continue to run (goddamn I absolutely love running). I would like to have clothes to wear that really make me happy (but don’t actually want to spend the time to obtain them) and Astro traveling sounds pretty cool not gonna lie (yet again I don’t want to go through the process to learn). I might have a major fear of failure or fear that what I do won’t be absolutely perfect which is the reason for why I’m so scared to start something. God I just really don’t know. Mom refuses to get me a therapist and just tells me to do law of attraction shit (which is legit but sometimes does not need to be the only step towards good mental health). Some things are better off digested a little. Ugh. I don’t even know if I believe myself when I say that. What do I need? Maybe I do still have a major fear of imperfection considering I’m editing my personal journal as I go along just so it sounds better. Jesus Christ. I still have some things to live for yet too many times a day I wish I didn’t. What if I did just hit up the drug isle of cvs and pop like 90 pills? Not now but when I’m like 18 so I don’t have to do adult shit. Although I would miss out on the possibility of falling in love with an incredible girl and them falling just as in love with me. But do I really care? Is it really that big of a deal? Is anything that I think would be cool to do really a big deal? No. If I overdosed would I regret it? Fuck."
299,Not seeing the comet Neowise has pretty much crushed my mental health.,"Not sure if this is the place for this, and I understand that I'm just going to sound whiney. 

I've dealt with depression for a long time and was pretty heavily medicated for a lot of it, but for some reason, Neowise sparked my interest more than anything in an incredibly long time. I've always loved space, and I guess the idea of a comet visible with my own eye was something to get out of bed for.

Being a night owl because I sleep 14 hours a day made it easy to be up around the optimal time (4:30am-ish). Despite this and attempts for more than a week, going to various places, high and low, I couldn't find the comet. If I'd go somewhere that might make it visible, it'd be too bright. If I went to a dark place, there'd be no high hills to get my vision above the trees. 

Probably the most whinging I've done in a long time because I usually don't care to vent, but I'm finding it almost impossible to describe how disappointed I am. As if the entire universe was actively against me seeing this comet, and every day and night got more and more disappointing."
300,I feel so worthless and alone,"Yea another rant vent post. I'm 19m and growing up I was always shy and introverted partly due to bullying and lackluster parents.

I never dated and barely had any friends growing up, I would come home from school and play video games/browse the internet since that's all my life was.

I was in a suicidal depression from 14 to 19 February this year. I knew if I didnt change my life I would kill myself soon.

So I changed my diet and started an intense workouts gym routine. I also found some hobbies that looked fun to pursue as well as being social for friends and possibly dating. Rock climbing at my gym, and volunteering at an animal shelter. 

2 FUCKING WEEKS into going to the gym, lockdown happened and i cant pursue any of my hobbies. No college in person classes so no chance of meeting a partner or friends.

These past 3 months I didnt give up. I did home workouts 6 days a week and tried to stay positive. Then about 4 weeks ago here in california shit starting opening up again. I went to the gym first day and every day since, and now we are back on lockdown after like 4 weeks of reopening. 

I cant do home workouts since weights are sold out everywhere and people are re selling for hundreds of dollars.

I cant take this anymore...... I'm done being alone and living my boring pathetic worthless life. I cried and had a mental breakdown for the first time in 6 months as I'm typing this. I HATE THIS, I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!! 

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ALONE AND AM SICK OF MY BORING LIFE! I CANT PURSUE ANY OF MY HOBBIES OR MEET PEOPLE.

This isnt even just dating, this is regarding my overall life. For the first time in years I try to be happy and life shits on me. Everyone keeps saying. ""tHiNk Of EvErYoNe ElsE, wE aRe iN tHiS tOgEtHeR"" no at least I'm not....... millions of people have relationships and friends to get through this with..... I'm completely fucking alone with no one....... the highlight of my life right now is going to work and talking with my coworkers..... 

I want friends..... I want to date.... I want to have hobbies and interests.... I want to live an actual fucking life for the first time in 19 years...... BUT NO! NOW WE ARE BACK ON LOCKDOWN BECAUSE FUCKING IDIOTS CANT PUT ON A MASK!

this will go on for months or years and I dont have that time...... I dont want to wait any more..... I will kill myself soon if this keeps up, after making such good progress finally being happy, people like me dont deserve it I guess...."
301,Why do I hate my body so much? How do I stop?,"Divided into parts to make it easier to read

Thank you if you read all of this!! I’m sorry for it being long, I tried to divide it for that reason.

You can skip part 10, that’s where I start talking about my current problems. The previous parts were just good for anyone who wanted more background


Part 1: my weight

I’ve been overweight my whole life, along with depression and having narcissistic and anger issue parents. When I was little I’d complain about my body and my parents would always tell me I’d grow out then up. Which I believe children can be chubby, but I looked morbidly obese for a child. At around 6th grade I just gave up and accepted that I’d be fat and there was nothing I could do about it.

In 7th grade I did track and became extremely slim, I hadn’t actually looked at my body for a year then when I did I was really skinny and gained self confidence which lasted through 8th grade.

Part 2: weight loss

In 9th grade I still had confidence, then in 10th grade I realized I’d gained abunch of weight without noticing, I was 125 in 8th grade, and was then 160. I decided to make attempts to loose weight and when I weighed myself a month later I was 175. I kept trying to eat normally (I wasn’t over eating but I wasn’t working out). A month later I was 185. I started working out everyday and cut out strictly unhealthy things like ice cream, burgers, soda, even juices. I made my way to 175, then 170, which I stayed at for a long time. I was starting to get confident because I felt skinny, but I think I was mostly confidence because I knew by summer I’d have my ideal body.

Part 3: more on weight loss

It was the start of 11th grade
I made it to 170 then 168. Once I got to 165 I wanted to loose the last few pounds faster as 150 was my goal. I joined the weight loss Reddit and calorie counted, mostly using lifesum. But I noticed if I went 10 calories over it would give me a frownie face. So I just ate under that amount as oppose to over. I found that 1200 calories was easy to go under so I stayed at 1000. At this time I was working out everyday for an hour, plus 2 hours after school. I had a cardio class one day, then a weights class other days, with track being cardio and whatever training it’s called I forgot the name of. So a good mix of cardio, and muscle building, plus healthy eating (I was eating way healthier than I was the year prior while starting my weight loss plus calorie counting). But I found that I stayed at 165.

Part 4: skipping meals

I figured since I was working out and eating right, the only thing was that I was eating too much, so I’d only eat a protein box my school had for lunch (which was like an egg, a pita bread wedge, and a vegetable) or a yogurt parfait which was yogurt, fruit and granola. I felt pretty good about myself, but still mainly because I saw myself at my goal in the future, but I was still stuck at 165 even with all these efforts.

Part 5: quarantine.

The only reason I could eat normally without feeling guilty was because I was working out so much I figured I was burning off enough to eat as much as normal people do, then quarantine started and I panicked as everything was canceled and I could no longer work out. I knew I could jog and do at home workouts, which I did, but I knew they wouldn’t be as affective. Half jogged half walked a mile every weekday, plus some normal floor workouts in between. I was so terrified of flying back to 185 just because my body gains weight for seemingly no reason. So I went back to calorie counting and restricting to 900, then seeing how low I could go. My average calorie intake each day was about 700, and I’d criticize myself if I got over that.

Part 6: anorexia
I got down to 500 calories a day. I ate about one small meal a day at around 7 pm.  I made it down to about 200, the lowest I got was about 150 before I woke up early one morning morbidly nauseous. I got out of bed but collapsed, and crawled to the bathroom. I started heaving over the toilet but nothing would come out. So I decided I’d stick to 150 everyday and eat about 500 one day a week to prevent getting sick. This went on for while and I only stopped because the weight loss reddit said that starving yourself makes you gain weight. I didn’t think I was anorexic because I could choose to stop anytime, and I wasn’t skinny. I asked my anorexic friend if I was anorexic and she said no.

Part 7: recovery

I deleted life sum. I forgot to mention that even when I tried to eat I’d end up getting sick at the thought of food, or as soon as it touched my mouth, I had to force myself to eat the small amount of food I was eating each day. I downloaded eat this much which auto generated meals at a certain tdee after I put all my information in. This helped me a lot because I put it at a setting for recovering from my eating disorder. So it was mostly smaller meals that were high in calories, so that I didn’t have to make myself eat much. And at the beginning most of my meals were liquid. I worked my way up to 800 calories then 1000 and finally 1200. This also helped me get down to 150 pounds, my goal weight healthily. At a rate of 1-2 pounds a week.

Part 8: weight loss background.

I’d never been able to loose weight normally. Most people say cico is fool proof, but it doesn’t work for me except at an unreasonably low calorie intake. After a while I stopped loosing weight even when sticking to my eat this much diet. It took me 3 months to go from 176 to 173. And a year to loose just 10 pounds. I calculated my TDEE, which was around 15-1700 calories to maintain weight loss, the total calories I burn on average a day was around 2000. Which is normal for a young active and healthy person like me, except I was eating under 2000 for my whole weight loss journey and hardly lost anything. I thought I’d also add that I have chronic constipation and poop about once a week, this started around December when I used to have normal bowel movement.

Part 9: self esteem

I got to 145 pounds which means I lost 40 pounds. My (overweight)parents were never supportive of my weight loss. When I was 185 pounds my mom tried to convince me I was underweight when I said I was going to start loosing weight. Everytime I practiced healthy habits like eating healthy, exercising, and not eating when I’m not hungry my mom would yell at me for being anorexic, but when I was actually staying in my room all day and never coming out and starving myself she didn’t anything. I remember convincing myself to eat a bowl of ramen and when I was making it my parents told me to stop eating everything since this was at the beginning of quarantine and people wanted to stock up on food. He was on his 3rd bowl of loaded baked potato soup as he said this, then made himself a bowl of ramen after.


———Skip to this part————-


Part 10: I hate my body

I’ve lost 40 pounds but it feels like it much has changed. I look skinny at a glance, not even skinny, I look 160 pounds. I had a butt, but I lost all my fat there. I have the most unflattering bone structure and body type ever. My body cannot loose weight in a logical way. I have hip dips which make me look like I have a muffin top, and makes my butt a weird shape and caves in on the sides. 

My rib cage is huge from the front and the side. It’s wide and not slim like most girls, and from the side it makes it so I’ll never look skinny because it looks like my stomach when it’s just my ribs, and it keeps the skin out so it will never be a flat stomach. I’ve looked at other girls with my insecurities to make myself feel better and it doesn’t work. No one has both, and these things together make it so even if I weighed 100 pounds I wouldn’t look any different. I look at girls with hip dips and they still have a thin rib cage. Girls with a big rib cage still have slim sides of their rib cage and don’t have hip dips. I do hip dip workouts everyday, 

I do butt workouts everyday, I do ab workouts everyday, the only thing I’ve gained are abs which aren’t as visible and my stomach isn’t flat because of my ribs. I can’t find a single girl who looks like me and even then I don’t think I’d feel better. I try to find flattering outfits but nothing is, even even the ones that look best on me dont look good on me. And even if I find something that caters to my hip dips, my ribs still make it look like stomach fat is sticking out. 

In pictures my hip dips make my body look such an awkward and unnatural shape. It’s like my hips start to go out and look like there will be curves at a sharp line, then suddenly sharply goes straight down as if my butt got sliced off. I’d be fine with not having a butt if I was skinny, but I’m not. I look in the mirror and I just break down. 

My mom takes pictures of me with my geese and I’m excited to look at them, then I see my body completely ruin the picture and I just want to cry. I hate looking at myself. I feel like the only way I can feel slightly confident in myself is to just never look at myself, but I have to to make sure my outfits don’t make my body look even more unnatural. And I feel like having confidence by just avoiding seeing yourself because it makes you sad isn’t real confidence. I was confident in 8th grade I don’t know what happened. 

It doesn’t help that the smallest things make me want to go back to starving myself again. And just because I’m calorie counting my parents scream at me for being “anorexic” and “taking it too far” just for counting my calories, which I also do to make sure I don’t under eat. My parents aren’t a good environment for mental health either. 

I know I don’t have body dysphoria, I see my body as others do, my friends all have normal bodies for teenagers and tell me I look great, but I know they wouldn’t trade with me if given the option. I avoid pictures, I feel ugly constantly, I want to cry constantly, I just hate my body so much and loosing weight isn’t going to change it. My mom gets mad at me when I say I don’t like myself. I do the mental health workshops I do everything I can to feel pretty and in the end my insecurities are what stand out the most about my body."
302,I feel so worthless and alone,"Yea another rant vent post. I'm 19m and growing up I was always shy and introverted partly due to bullying and lackluster parents.

I never dated and barely had any friends growing up, I would come home from school and play video games/browse the internet since that's all my life was.

I was in a suicidal depression from 14 to 19 February this year. I knew if I didnt change my life I would kill myself soon.

So I changed my diet and started an intense workouts gym routine. I also found some hobbies that looked fun to pursue as well as being social for friends and possibly dating. Rock climbing at my gym, and volunteering at an animal shelter. 

2 FUCKING WEEKS into going to the gym, lockdown happened and i cant pursue any of my hobbies. No college in person classes so no chance of meeting a partner or friends.

These past 3 months I didnt give up. I did home workouts 6 days a week and tried to stay positive. Then about 4 weeks ago here in california shit starting opening up again. I went to the gym first day and every day since, and now we are back on lockdown after like 4 weeks of reopening.

I cant take this anymore...... I'm done being alone and living my boring pathetic worthless life. I cried and had a mental breakdown for the first time in 6 months as I'm typing this. I HATE THIS, I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!! 

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ALONE AND AM SICK OF MY BORING LIFE! I CANT PURSUE ANY OF MY HOBBIES OR MEET PEOPLE.

This isnt even just dating, this is regarding my overall life. For the first time in years I try to be happy and life shits on me. Everyone keeps saying. ""tHiNk Of EvErYoNe ElsE, wE aRe iN tHiS tOgEtHeR"" no at least I'm not....... millions of people have relationships and friends to get through this with..... I'm completely fucking alone with no one....... the highlight of my life right now is going to work and talking with my coworkers..... 

I want friends..... I want to date.... I want to have hobbies and interests.... I want to live an actual fucking life for the first time in 19 years...... BUT NO! NOW WE ARE BACK ON LOCKDOWN BECAUSE FUCKING IDIOTS CANT PUT ON A MASK!

303,Ive wasted my life,"I've spent so many thousands of hours just playing games and not finishing half done projects when I was younger I was able to breeze through school doing my homework on the bus to school. But for the past few years I've barely scrapped by. There's just so much time I've wasted on pointless things I can't handle it. I've only lived in one of place long enough to have a friend I trusted and I've since moved away from them and we don't talk anymore they were the only person I could talk to. It hurts me to write this because I've seen and known the people who threaten suicide and fake depression for attention. I know I'm depressed but I can't do anything about it. I wouldn't kill myself but if I were in a situation where I had the choice I would rather just fade away. I've tried talking to a counselor but just couldn't. I don't know what to do. I know tomorrow I'll wake up feeling okay and continue on with pointless shit, until I've bottled up enough to have another breakdown. I don't know what to do."

306,First time poster here,"So I'm not exactly sure how to explain what happened but here goes.  So I'm re-watching a show and afterwards I decide to browse Reddit before I go to bed.  And as I decide to do so my thoughts in my head as I read to myself begin to grow louder and louder and louder.  To the point where its like I'm screaming at myself or something in my head?   But it's what I'm reading.  If that makes sense. 

This has happened before, a long time ago when my brother and I used to split weekends with my mom and dad when we were younger.  I'd stare at the ceiling, and at some point my thoughts would just get so loud they'd yell.   But die down after a short time.  Like I could control it.   

This last time was different. After a minute or two I got up and got some water and it felt like I was about to pass out.  I laid down, heart was racing.  It was weird.  Like a panic attack maybe?  Not sure.  After typing this out I'm feeling back to normal.  Was looking for your thoughts."

I cant take this anymore...... I'm done being alone and living my boring pathetic worthless life. I cried and had a mental breakdown for the first time in 6 months as I'm typing this. I HATE THIS, I CANT LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!!

This isnt even just dating, this is regarding my overall life. For the first time in years I try to be happy and life shits on me. Everyone keeps saying.

I'm completely fucking alone with no one....... the highlight of my life right now is going to work and talking with my coworkers..... 

I want friends..... I want to date.... I want to have hobbies and interests.... I want to live an actual fucking life for the first time in 19 years...... BUT NO! NOW WE ARE BACK ON LOCKDOWN BECAUSE FUCKING IDIOTS CANT PUT ON A MASK!

this will go on for months or years and I dont have that time...... I dont want to wait any more..... I will kill myself soon if this keeps up, after making such good progress finally being happy, people like me dont deserve it I guess...."

314,I [30M] am having trouble understanding my fiancee's [26F] anger issues," 

Soon after I met my fiancee, she moved to another city for work. Most of our dating days were on Facetime. While I saw some anger issues in her during the time, I let it slide thinking they were resulting due to long distance relationship.

Fast forward to February 2020, she finds a job in my city and moves in with me. Things started to haywire from that point with little arguments every now and then. The arguments would be for some really trivial hairline triggers for instance, say I didn't turn on the heater before I the started the car. If I didn't walk fast enough from the car to the store she we would say ""You will make me go tan"". These arguments will result in a ""no talking"" period for about a couple of hours. Every time something went wrong, it could be a dish, it could be assembling an Ikea table, its always ""your fault, you can't do anything right"".

A month later during one such argument, she slaps me. I couldn't stand it and I hold her hands to pin her down going ""How dare you slap me"" . She starts to cry and tells me how me holding her hand hurts her.""You are a man, I am a woman . Don't you know that I am weaker? now look who is crying! I am"". Within the next one minute, me holding her hand becomes the topic of argument and the whole blame turns towards me. I feel guilty and apologize.

Each time such an episode happens, I try to tell her the next day ""Do you understand what you did yesterday? Do you know how toxic this is? Imagine raising kids in such an environment"" . She realizes that she took it a little too far, apologizes and says it will never happen again. I feel relieved that she finally realized what happened and is genuinely going to try and not repeat it.

10-15 days pass and they would be the most beautiful days.

Again something really trivial would trigger her and this time she would resort to throwing things at me, her phone, flower vase, sometimes pick up the knife, put it on her throat and go ""You'll be happy if I die , right? Isn't that what you want?"". One of the days she got angry she would say ""I am going to call 911"". It was mentally so exhausting. Her angry episodes would last for 4-5 hours and there will be a lot of name-calling like ""son of a bitch, motherfucker etc"". She would belittle me saying ""I am going to leave you just like that (snaps fingers)."" and ""You should be happy that you got someone as pretty as me"" . At the end of it all I would be told that I am the reason for her anger and that I do not know how to handle her anger.

There was one instance where she spat on my face while I held hands to prevent her from throwing stuff. Some other time she would bang her head against the wall when I held her hands.

She hasn't had any issues at work or at college due to such behavior. Is this abuse? How do I handle this?"

319,How do I tell my parents I'm not okay?,"Hey, I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this, I hope it is. I'm 15 and I haven't been doing well (idk if that's grammatically correct). I've lost interest in almost anything. I just go through the day doing the things I'm supposed to, then just doing nothing while listening to music adn at night I scroll through social media. I hate being like this. I don't practice the guitar anymore as I don't want to learn anything, I've lost the interest I was developing in computers, I can't develop any new hobbies or anything like that. I don't want to eat anymore, I'm never hungry. I keep procrastinating everyday and hating myself for doing that. I feel like I can't even pickup my own body.

I don't want to live like this anymore and I want to go to a psychologist. It took my some time to admit to myself that I needed help. But as I'm 15 I cant go to de psychologist by myself so I have to ask my parents (there is no counselor or psychologist in my school). 

This is a big step for me, having to admit to my parents (who I don't trust that much, only my dad) that I'm not okay and that I need help. 

Any advice on how to do it? Has anyone gone through anything similar?

Thanks in advance"

321,Food issues,So I’m a 16 year old Male and I’ve been working out for about 4 months by now and I have some issues. Well yes it’s great I just have a little food issues. Every time I eat something bad like pizza or burgers (even it’s a healthier version like frozen yogurt or coal fried pizza) I feel bad. I have been eating less than usually and counting my calories after I eat everything on a calculator. My parents say it’s not normal to do this and I know it isn’t but I do it anyways. I tend to try to avoid bad foods and ice cream. Like I said I workout and I run every 4 days and lift so I should be eating a lot right? I only have about 2000 cals a day and should be having more. I know what I’m doing is wrong but can’t stop! Can someone help me with this.
322,Weird feeling after mdma,"Hi there,

I took 1 pill of xtc on 18 june 2020 and until now it has passed almost a month. 
First of fews day. The emotion bring up to me very hard . My brain is like melting and push me to do or think a lot of stuff that my brain can't rest or concentrate clearly, vibrate foot. I just try to think that effect of xtc and practice the mediation every morning.

Day by day. I can control my emotion and it rarely come up but it still make me can not feel normal with some weird feeling as mild faint, scare about using illegal drugs, anxiety, nausea and especially, my right temporal nerve is so tense that make me think a lot about my physical health.

I would like to know why it cause me like that? Can I get back to normal? And how can I deal with it once my emotion trigger them on. Please help and guide me. Thanks"
323,Does anyone ever deal with feelings of guilt for no discernible reason?,"I (24 F) have been dealing with depression and anxiety ever since my early teens. I have my ups and downs, but for the most part, it is well managed with medication and counseling.

 For the past few weeks, I have been plagued with these random “spells” of guilt. I will have moments where I feel so guilty, I am in tears and cannot sleep at night. The problem is, there is nothing specific that I am feeling guilty about! It is so frustrating. I live a simple life and have a clean conscience, so I don’t believe it is anything subconscious. But these feelings are getting worse. I am now spending entire days feeling guilty, and it is making me anxious. Does anyone else experience this? Does it eventually go away? :("
324,Help me understand this crazy thought,"I realized that every time I’m not seeing someone or I’m not dating someone, I get anxious.Is it just natural desire to pass on the genes to the next generation? Or there are some underlying abandonment issues, stemming from childhood?"
325,"Why am I always obsessed with, idealizing my teachers?","I’ve done this with three or four teachers. Always my English teachers (I love English). Only two of them have been really intense and long lasting but the latest has gone on four years and has been totally all consuming. I’m 23 by the way, female. The targets of my “obsession” are male and female. They are genuinely incredible people. And it helps that I love the subject that they teach. But I my intensity is creepy and pathetic. I an 23 years old, have of experience in the real world (diff jobs, friends, boyfriends, travels, drugs, etc.), so why do I act love a luck struck, star-struck, teenager around my English teachers and professors? It’s not explicitly romantic or sexual in nature, except for vaguely in the most recent case, but it leave me breathless. It’s downright creepy.  I have gone to extreme lengths to know more about these people, be around them, endear myself to them.  I fantasize about being their friend, or child, or spouse. I never want their class to end. And I think about them fondly for years after the class is over. Usually I do become somewhat close to them, and receive a lot of encouragement, which I cherish and replay in my head, and probably make out to be a bigger deal than it is. Still I always want more. I cry over them. A more personal connection even while I realize it’s wrong and weird and impossible. I try my best to tow the line between enthusiasm and obsession, at least when I’m around them. I think they can sense my desperation though. Usually they are quite protective and sympathetic which only fuels my longing. 

I don’t want to be so hopelessly enamored and creepy. I don’t understand why no one else seems to be vulnerable to these immature feelings. I get starry eyed even now when I think about my English teachers. Logically I know they are no better than anyone else, but they are so special to me. It’s almost painful. I’ve never been in love, really, but it feels like I’m falling in love. 

Please help me. I thought it would go away with age and experience but it hasn’t. I always thought a real boyfriend or best friend would cure me but it’s hasn’t really. I’ve had a boyfriend, I’ve had many casual partners, hookups and an amazing best friend and group of friends. Still, I obsess to the point of wanting to stalk..."
326,It’s hard for me to want to get better,"I feel that I have lived with my own internal battle for so long, part of me doesn’t really want that to go away. I find comfort when I feel at a low point sometimes, while other times I do want to feel better. I feel this is why I have issues opening up to anyone about how I truly feel, even my therapist. I go through ups and downs, but have found there are times where I don’t want to get out of a low point. If I am experiencing a good day or even a few days, I know in my mind that I will experience a low point again soon, which is oddly comforting."
327,The Insanity Of An Aimless Mind,"I don't really see any point in anything anymore. There's so much coldness in the world that it almost makes the coldness within myself seem tolerable. I suppose that's the difficulty of the situation, the warmth I seek can really only come from changing myself, and my habits that make my mindest. 

Abraham Lincoln once said, "" Most folks are about as happy as they make their minds up to be.”  I suppose that sums up my feeling about life currently. I know I have the potential for greatness, I have a lot of passion for a variety of things. Movies, theater, history, science, poetry, if you name it I probably like it. I seldom hate anything arbitrarily. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's more of an overall summation of my feelings. Full of potential, but I lack ambition and a general understanding of how to operate in society. Part of this is because of my upbringing, I was brought up in a less than ideal environment (divorce, alcoholism, etc) which I believe has morphed my worldview into a negative one.  I don't do anything in order to actually fix them, merely contemplate hypothetical ways that something could be better. Not like an average person where we have an intellectual discussion and move on. I obsess over finding the exact logical position that I believe, particularly around politics. 

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself a libertarian (I'm from the United States for reference). Another way of saying libertarian would be (Classical Liberal) although the two do have subtle distinctions. The overall point being I'm in a political minority, we're never allowed to participate in political discussion on a fair and balanced scale. I suppose it's a good thing, I feel like my obsession over libertarianism has become dull. I have my opinions, but it doesn't really matter. It took me years of closely examining each political position I hold to formulate concise positions on almost every political issue. I suppose that part of my life was useful, in that I can discuss a range of political topics in a variety of ways. The problem is nothing gets produced this way. It's just aimless mental jousting in a system that relies on the ill-informed and pliable masses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue I've always had is nihilism. Nihilism started creeping into my mind at around 16-17. It began to linger around a little longer around age 18-19. But since 20 | I'm slightly older than 20| nihilism has consumed my thoughts. I can't escape its pull. I feel like anything I build in my life is meaningless in the end, because nothing in the universe ultimately matters. Every value we hold is subjective, primarily based on malleable societal beliefs. 

If there's no reason the universe exists = humans are without cosmic purpose (meaning our relationship in relation to the universe is inconsequential) = anything we do in our life is temporary, and any values we build on are subjective. I don't think you can build or impart objective meaning on a randomly caused subjective system. 

The reason nihilism has become a problem in my life is that I can't escape the logical conclusion of everything I do. For example, if there's no meaning to the universe (meaning our lives are meaningless other than the temporary existence we currently endure, and I use the word endure deliberately, a lot of existence is suffering), why get married? I know the relationship between these two seems illogical to most, but to me, it's a perfect equation. 

Marriage won't last. Statistically \~50% end in divorce anyway. Of the 50% that remain how many are actually happy? Then you've got the cosmic side of things again, you'll be dead. The marriage was just a temporary fluctuation of chemicals in your brain. Sure the experience of feeling ""love"" is ""real"" insofar as a chemical reaction in the brain constitutes reality. It's our perceived reality, but it's not very fulfilling (at least not to me). It seems pretty depressing that we're really just meat machines taking in inputs and filling in the gaps with a biological sludge of pre-determined desires. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mental and physical health has also slipped. I can't get good sleep, can't maintain a schedule, or sleep at all. My dedication towards things swings between many things at once, nothing gets done or build to a reasonable level. I'm a mess. I think I can fix it, I just need help. I know I have goodness in my heart, I want to express my love towards the world. I just need a consistent way to get out of this...hell."
328,Schizophrenia Help,"Hey all,

I'm almost ready to give up. My sis is 31 and has shown progressive signs of schizophrenia since age 18. It's gotten worse and worse. Shes been in and out of hospitals and facilities since those late teen years.

My mother has recently gotten divorced and has had to move into my 1 bedroom apartment temporarily. 

My sister has been kicked out of 5 homes my mother has placed her in since the middle of 2019. She has just asked my mom to stay the night at my place. I accepted.

Shes here now. I feel so terrible for her, shes talking to herself but at the same time I can't feel much sympathy because she has trashed over 10 thousand dollars of my livelihood in the past 3 years. 

Shes gotten to the point of being violent with a knife 3 times but the hospital keeps letting her out after 72 hrs. Shes a master manipulator in there it seems like. She can ""play the sane-game"" for just long enough for a social worker to believe her.

I just want to make sure shes happy but not endangering anyone. 

Where do I go from here?"

Obligatory apology for mobile formatting bleh bleh bleh

I've been cutting for quite a bit of time now and I've been able to keep my scars hidden, especially the ones on my wrist. Even now, when they're super faded, I can just wear a bracelet or some foundation and I'll be fine. But the scars on my thigh are super recent and red and I don't think it's ever hit me that I'm gonna have to work overtime to hide them, especially in the summer.

I love my friends to fucking death. I really do. I've never felt so at home with a group of people before. I've struggled with social anxiety and autism and I never thought I would be able to foster a genuine friendship like I do now. Honestly, I'm glad they were the first to see them. I get overwhelmed thinking about how much I love them.

We were going swimming together. I was stressed out because I had cut the day before. My friend knows this place by a park with a waterfall and I was super excited to go. The only swimsuit I own exposed my thighs and I was wondering if I should wear shorts, but then decided that I probably wouldn't need them as we would all be in the water anyways and my scars wouldn't be visible.

That wasn't the case at all. Stupid me. As soon as we arrived I realized most of my time there would be spent above water. I really started panicking. There were even other people there. I really considered backtracking and keeping my clothes on.

But I didn't!! I took off my shorts and it took me a while but I eventually forgot about hiding my legs!!!

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place but I'm so overwhelmed. I was so scared it would end up awkward but they never even mentioned them. I'm trying so hard not to cry but I feel so happy and NORMAL!!! I don't know what I did to be blessed with meeting these people but I'm just so grateful."
332,Coping with fear.,"So I will put this in short. If you have any questions please ask I will explain.
Couple of months back something devistating happened that led to the course of my family splitting up.
My sister away, parents together but with arguments, and I mean ARGUMENTS.
I personally know that I am a emotionally strong and a solid person and I am also a extremely loyal person if I see fit to be one and am shown kindness to be one. I have fears like the fear of heights but I cope with it and try to fix it.
With this latest issue, I always feel tense and frightened whenever I am in a room with my parents, when I go to bed at night and I hear either of them speak it could even be laughing, having fun and being nice yet I still wake up with a hard worry in my stomach and I usually jolt up still half asleep and try to see what they are talking about and even though I see that they are okay and even though I am still very sleepy I feel the need to stay awake for their own sake.
Other than that it is not affecting me but I fear that if I keep going on like this and keeping my emotions bottled up that what if one day I let loose and do/say something that I will forever regret?

Thoughts?"
333,Trying to cope while dad is in hospital,"Yesterday my dad had a stroke
Considering how late they caught it, he is in relatively good shape. He can still talk, he is regaining a little bit of movement in his arm and legs. He should make a decent recovery. 
Even so, I feel stressed to the max and it’s making my depression bad. 
I told my boss I wouldn’t be in to work until next Monday. I just don’t want to go in right now. I work a summer position, and she told me to just come in whenever I am available since I am just a ‘bonus’ to their office, but I still feel like a jerk for calling off. Especially since there isn’t anything I can do by staying at home and my last week is in two weeks anyways.  I can’t go to the hospital to be with him, I took care of everything at the house for him and my mom. My sister is old enough to take care of herself so I just have to occasionally check in on her. I’d essentially just be sitting at home waiting for any news and it’s unnecessary, but I wanted the days off just to try and process. It still doesn’t feel real. 
I feel so on edge. I’m sad, I’m anxious, and every little thing makes me angry. I cried for like half an hour tonight for no reason. 
It’s so hard to see my dad like this. He is only 50. He always seemed like this indestructible guy. He always found a way to fix things or help others or make something better. He called me on the phone yesterday while he was alone at work having the stroke. Hearing him crying and asking me for help before he hung up keeps playing over and over in my head and it’s haunting me. It was so scary and i feel like it’s traumatized me. I wish there was more I could’ve done, I wish I could’ve helped him or gotten to him faster than I did. 
I feel like I haven’t been able to process this. As soon as he was admitted and flown out to a different hospital I was orchestrating everyone else, feeding my mom and sister and relaying all the news to family and in-laws. Now, he’s in the hospital for an indefinite amount of time and I feel helpless. There’s nothing I can do to help anyone and it’s tearing me apart. 
My husband is emotionally dense and unhelpful and the rest of my family is emotionally closed off, so I feel so alone. 
Everyone else in my family (especially my mom) seems to be taking it considerably well. I try and seem like I’m okay, but on the inside I’m emotionally a wreck and I don’t know why. 

I just want my dad to feel better so I can feel better."

335,Hi all!,"So, I’ve never posted here before but ... emetophobia is such a struggle. Today was a really bad day. I’ve been brushing my teeth and lips off and on and basically not eating today and I’m afraid I’m going to make myself throw up from that! I accidentally brushed my teeth wrong and then drank water (I brushed my lips before I brushed my teeth which is so stupid cause it’s NOT supposed to be in that order, and I had to wash my hands so many times) and I just can’t think straight or rationally right now. And I’m afraid there’s still toothpaste on my lips and I then put it in my body by using a water bottle and swallowing the water. Is there anyone who can talk?"

I must’ve looked sad because he eventually begrudgingly said I could take a sick day if I really needed it, but now I feel dumb for asking. Maybe 10 years is too long to still be incompetent on sad anniversaries?"

340,I [30M] am having trouble understanding my fiancee's [26F] anger issues," 

Soon after I met my fiancee, she moved to another city for work. Most of our dating days were on Facetime. While I saw some anger issues in her during the time, I let it slide thinking they were resulting due to long distance relationship.

Fast forward to February 2020, she finds a job in my city and moves in with me. Things started to haywire from that point with little arguments every now and then. The arguments would be for some really trivial hairline triggers for instance, say I didn't turn on the heater before I the started the car. If I didn't walk fast enough from the car to the store she we would say ""You will make me go tan"". These arguments will result in a ""no talking"" period for about a couple of hours. Every time something went wrong, it could be a dish, it could be assembling an Ikea table, its always ""your fault, you can't do anything right"".

A month later during one such argument, she slaps me. I couldn't stand it and I hold her hands to pin her down going ""How dare you slap me"" . She starts to cry and tells me how me holding her hand hurts her.""You are a man, I am a woman . Don't you know that I am weaker? now look who is crying! I am"". Within the next one minute, me holding her hand becomes the topic of argument and the whole blame turns towards me. I feel guilty and apologize.

Each time such an episode happens, I try to tell her the next day ""Do you understand what you did yesterday? Do you know how toxic this is? Imagine raising kids in such an environment"" . She realizes that she took it a little too far, apologizes and says it will never happen again. I feel relieved that she finally realized what happened and is genuinely going to try and not repeat it.

10-15 days pass and they would be the most beautiful days.

Again something really trivial would trigger her and this time she would resort to throwing things at me, her phone, flower vase, sometimes pick up the knife, put it on her throat and go ""You'll be happy if I die , right? Isn't that what you want?"". One of the days she got angry she would say ""I am going to call 911"". It was mentally so exhausting. Her angry episodes would last for 4-5 hours and there will be a lot of name-calling like ""son of a bitch, motherfucker etc"". She would belittle me saying ""I am going to leave you just like that (snaps fingers)."" and ""You should be happy that you got someone as pretty as me"" . At the end of it all I would be told that I am the reason for her anger and that I do not know how to handle her anger.

There was one instance where she spat on my face while I held hands to prevent her from throwing stuff. Some other time she would bang her head against the wall when I held her hands.

She hasn't had any issues at work or at college due to such behavior. Is this abuse? How do I handle this?"

343,My parents will not let me sleep,"Note: I originally posted this as a mini rant on r/teenagers but I feel it'd be better posting here

Its 1 am and im tired as fuck but my parents keep waking me up

Its been 3 hours and they managed to wake me up 4 times in that period, each time right before I manage to fall asleep

This happens every night and I'm sick of it

I managed to get like 6 hours of sleep total these past 3 days and Im seriously tired but I cant fall back asleep and whenever I get close they keep waking me up

I dont need the usual 8 hours (I'm usually perfectly rested even at four hours) but I get approximately 2 hours or less a day and its starting to bacome a fucking problem

About 3 weeks ago my parents took my room away cuz we were supposed to be moving soon (but now Im hearing itll be at the end of the summer) and Im stuck in the basement with 4 other people, 2 cats, and a dog with 0 privacy

The first time was my brother, I went to bed around 10 (pretty early but i was really tired) and my brother decided it would be funny to sit on me while i was asleep

The second time my parents turned on the tv really loud (I cant sleep if theres a tv or a screen on) and woke me up

Then they kept asking me if ""are you awake"" and to ""go to bed"" even though I've been trying to for 3 hours now

Then the 4th time they literally turned the light on looking for the remote to turn on the tv again

Im fucking sick of this shit

Edit: Now they're telling me to go to bed even though IVE BEEN TRYING TO FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS AND SOMEHOW ITS MY FAULT

Edit 2: Just got beat for being awake even though they were the ones keeping me up in the first place. They wont even let me turn off the tv

Edit 3: Thanks for all the comments trying to help but unfortunately the two most frequent pieces of advice wont work

1. Sleep in the bathroom

I really want to do that but every time I use the bathroom (even at day time) if I spend more than 5 mins in there my parents come in and harass me to get out

2. Try and reason with him to lower the volume/turn off the tv

I tried to do that but my dad is really stubborn and refuses to admit when he is in the wrong. I got into an argument and said that I was freaking out because I was off my medication, not because he kept me awake for pratically 3 days"
344,coping mechanisms for severe anxiety?,"Lately I’ve been under a lot of stress. There has been a great deal of conflict in my personal life that’s been causing me pain and it’s starting to weigh on me. I haven’t seen my therapist since February (due to Covid and monetary issues) and I’ve been unable to refill my prescriptions. I typically took a mood stabilizer and an anti-anxiety medication. 

While struggling to find balance during such a tumultuous time in my life, my anxiety has become unbearable. It has gotten so out of hand that I can’t even sleep. I usually get 5 hours of rest and vomit as soon as I get out of bed. It has been maybe 4 years since I’ve felt like I couldn’t control my own anxiety. 

This anxiety has manifested into anger and erratic behavior. It’s beginning to affect those around me. I feel like nobody, not even me, can predict what mood I will be in and it has left me with a sense of extreme guilt. I want to get this under control so I can be a better friend and partner but I’m not sure how to recollect myself. If anyone has any positive coping mechanism for slowing down this cycle of anxiety I would really appreciate any suggestions. I haven’t felt this hopeless in a long time."
345,Treatment Resistant Depression and PTSD...what now?,"I'm turning 27 in a month, and Ive been suffering with depression for at least 21 years. Ive been going to psychologists and psychiatrists for 13 years. And I've been in one outpatient program, and two hospitalizations. 

I grew up with two verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive step fathers, and an emotionally, verbally abusive mother, and at the age of 21 moved in with an extremely abusive (verbally, physically, sexually, emotionally) boyfriend for 2.5 years who tried to kill me and my cat. 

Since then, I've been going to kaiser (only insurance I could get) but the therapists there make me feel like im not being heard, or that my problems aren't real. 

My anxiety, depression and PTSD only gets worse by the day...especially now that my restraining order against my abuser ends next month. 

Its getting so bad that i allowed my job to fire me...i don't take care of myself...i hide in my house...and i don't talk to anyone...

I want to ask for a new doctor but I don't know how...

I've tried literally almost every medication, and the doctors keep reminding me that I'm running out of options so I stopped going to my psychiatrist. 

The only things that ever helped my depression was microdosing lsd which made me feel calm and at ease but since that's illegal it's hard to come by...the other being animals. But I cant bring my cat everywhere I go, she has anxiety too...

Would it be wrong of me to attempt to find a psychiatric service dog?...i know im vegan which means animals are not property but im getting to the point of being suicidal because its hard to live like this. Afraid of everything, and so sad it physically hurts. 

..i don't know what im looking for here...but i don't know who else to talk to..."
346,I can't deal with death,"I recently had a good friend pass away. It waa about a week ago and once I found out I just shut myself up in my room. I hardly ate or drank anything and just cried. My family had to be the ones to pull me out of my room to force me to eat something. 

 I've been trying to force myself to act as normal as I can but I find myself feeling so empty. I cry out of nowhere and when I do it's almost full on sobbing. It's hard to feel anything besides sadness. I'm scared to get close to anyone. I don't want to feel this again. She was an amazing person and really young and now she's gone. So suddenly. I hope everyone else is having a decent day/night. Make sure you hold anyone you love a little closer because one day you might not get to. Enjoy the moment you have."

348,Am I a sociopath?,"I’ve wondered for a while now if I’m a sociopath. People will tell me how I ruined their life and all the bad things I’ve done to them (eg cheating, lying, etc) and I still don’t care. I’ll say whatever they want to hear in the moment but inside I could care less. I made my ex depressed and suicidal and still didn’t care. I pretended to but deep down I felt nothing. Even when I saw her crying and the cuts on her wrist I still felt nothing. I also feel this way towards my current partner and my friends/family. I cut people out of my life like it’s nothing to the point where I have no real friends. The few friends I do have left are either fake or just want to use me. I really do want to genuinely care about others and feel empathy, as I hope to become a doctor one day. When I see old people or patients in pain I feel nothing. In fact, I want to laugh inside sometimes but know I shouldn’t. I even have weird thoughts about animals from time to time. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how easy it is for me to cut people out of my life and manipulate others for my own personal gain so I’ve started to wonder if I’m a sociopath. Sorry for the long rant but based on what I wrote do you think I’m a sociopath and how can I make myself care about others?

355,Irrational belief about sexuality,"Hello. I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I just need to get my thoughts out there and maybe someone might be able to offer some insight.

Just a heads up: the following topic involves masturbation.

For quite a while, possibly over a year, I have had this belief that my sexuality is determined by the last thing I masturbated to. So for example, I know that I am straight because the last thing I jerked off to was a woman, whether she was a woman of my imagination or a photo/video of a woman. If I happened to jerk off to a man, then that means I am gay/bi and will be gay until I jerk off to or have sex with a woman. 

It's really fucked with my head, because I basically do these rituals where I jerk off to women in order to be absolutely sure that I am straight and will be straight for the rest of my life. And I end up masturbating primarily in order to know what my sexuality is, because maybe I might have had a fleeting image of a man during masturbation, and therefore I am gay.

I have no ill will or prejudice against anyone's sexual preference. Hell, if I am gay, it wouldn't matter to me. The problem is that I have this ""need"" to know for sure what my sexuality is.

I have this gut feeling that this belief is irrational, however I don't know how to get rid of it. It keeps following me around and it feels like my mind wants me to believe that this belief is completely logical.

I think I have OCD as well but I haven't had an official diagnosis, however I have talked to an experienced OCD professional (not really a therapist in the strictest sense of the word) about my experiences and they agreed that I have it.

Anyway, to make a long story short, I don't know what my next steps should be. Is this really an irrational fear? I feel confused and it's like I have two voices in my head. One voice is saying that this belief is irrational and the other voice is saying that I should keep double checking."

357,having panic attacks almost every night,"Since I’ve been home from college, I seem to spiral into panic every night when i get into bed. I know its deep, but I always find myself thinking about how one day, all the people I love will be gone. I lie in my room and think about my life that my parents have worked so hard to make for me and thinking about them not being there one day...even just the thought of it sends me into panic. I start hyperventilating and just...sobbing and shaking. Obviously my fears are inevitable but I dont know how to stop thinking about it every single night. I’m 21 years old so im sure this isnt exactly “normal.” Idk what to do its really taking a toll on my mental health. I really just cant even imagine existing without my parents."
358,Irrational fear and discomfort when a kid at the time of sleeping,"I'm on a quest now to discover more about this feeling I had quite a lot of times when I was a kid. It was like an extreme discomfort or fear to the point of derealization when I was laying in bed to sleep and I would look at things and compare them. Like, I would be laying and I would see a chair and a book and the size difference between them caused something extremely uncomfy in me (and this is not an exaggeration). Even when I closed my eyes there would be shapes, forms or I would imagine objects like that and it was quite terrible. It was not a one time or a few times things.

360,First Time Here,
361,I am really confused,"I have no clue what is happening to me.

I am a male teenager in the united states, and I have been all over the place.

For a while I have experienced symptoms of anxiety and depression but never actually acted on these and tried to be strong. But now I have no clue whats happening.

Over the last two months my mental health began to progressively get worse and worse, and I have begun to show symptoms of more and more mental problems. 

I keep trying to find things online to give me answers, and right when I finally think I found them it turns out that there are some things that make me lose faith in finally thinking I know what is wrong.

I have begun to have major depressive episodes, panic attacks, paranoia, etc. 

I am pretty sure I am experiencing depersonalization, but based on the things I have read online they have only confused me more as to whether I am experiencing it or not and have freaked me out more.

I have never felt so troubled with myself until now, and I am very confused.

Besides seek help, is there anything I can do to help me determine what is happening to me right now?"

364,Self-improvement/motivacional stories only make me more unhappy,"(WARNING: VERY DRAMATIC VENTING AHEAD)

All these stories regarding a guy who had it really rough but overcome his personal hell don´t help me in any way; in fact I tend to end up asking myself why can´t I be that guy.
Most people will tell you that YOU can be THAT GUY, but the only thing that comes to mind with those stories are thoughts like ""I don´t even experience a 10% of what that person went through, ¿how can I be weaker?"" 
I have this tendency of comparing my struggles with others, and while I realise it might not be the healthiest thing to do, I can´t stop doing it, especially when everyone around you seems to be having it way worse than you. When I hear that Mr. Whoever kept getting up besides his three types of cancer, poverty traumas, mourning of a loss and having a third nipple or some shit like that I go: ""Wow, and here I am quitting college just six months in because I feel is too much for me"". It doesn´t inspire me at all.
I don´t know how common this train of thought is, but as for me, yeah, shoving in my face that a hundred thousand people just in my city alone had to go through some form of hell I´ll never live or understand only makes me feel like my suffering is not-worthy of mentioning or taking serious. Even my dad went through some messed up stuff growing up, which while hardening him in some ways, also gave him more courage and willpower. For me, I feel my easy, comfortable life where, even though I don´t tend to ask for stuff, I get it, made me spoiled is some ways and eventually made me realize I´ve never had to go through genuine pain like my dad´s or some other stories from close ones.
Funny thing is I used to self harm and do drugs, even ended up on a psych ward once, but that was 4 years ago, and in retrospective mostly because of my teen angst.

369,How do I cope with a fictional character’s death,"SPOILERS!!!! For The Last of Us Part 2

Hey reddit um i’m a little bit concerned so heres a bit of background.(also possible TW since im gonna talk about murder. I’d also like to avoid any discussion about the game itself since it’s pretty controversial and just want help with what i’m talking about)

The Last of Us has been my favorite game since 2014. It left me with such wonderful and complex emotions and ever since I finished it, it had become my favorite game(and still is). The announcement of the second game was actually one of the reasons i kept myself alive. Anyways, one of the characters in this game is named Joel, who is also the main protagonist that you play as and follow in the story. 
Joel had quickly become my favorite fictional character, ever. I felt genuine love and happiness for his character. I felt connected to him, I guess. As if he was real. 

Now in the second game, he had died. He was murdered, to be precise. He was actually murdered quite brutally. I was playing the second game when I witnessed this and actually had a panic attack. I cried for the longest time lol, and haven’t even finished my own playthrough of the game since I want to mentally prepare myself before I play again. 

Anyways, ever since his death, i’ve been having the weirdest thoughts. I’ve often been forgetting that he’s not real, and that I actually want to die so that I can be with him. I cry just remembering his mere existence(I think i’ve actually cried once a day because of him ever since the game came out). Things like “I want to be with him” and “I care about him more than anyone I know” have crossed my mind multiple times. I want to stop crying and having such weird thoughts, but I don’t know how. I genuinely do love his character but I feel like i’m taking it too far with my own thoughts. Is there a way I could appropriately cope with this, or start having more normal thoughts? Is this some form of mourning? I don’t know whats going on anymore"
370,I didn't realize I had tics until someone pointed it out,"I might not have Tourettes since I haven’t been diagnosed but I’m writing here because I feel like this is the closest place that people may relate to me with this.

So I started having a tic when I was 8. It’s just a thing I do with my nose. It was a bit more extreme back then.

My parents thought it was a habit so they always bugged me about it. They weren’t trying to be mean or anything but they just thought I did it cause I was a kid and developing an unusual habit and I understand that. But I couldn’t stop it, it really bugged me and bothered me. It became less noticeable within the years. 

Until a few months ago when someone point out about ‘that thing I do with my nose a lot’ and I was really confused cause I never knew I did it. So I asked a couple of people that I’m surrounded by and asked if they notice it cause I was curious and they all said yes. Now that I’m conscious of it, I obviously think about it every now and then and just thought I might have Tourette’s syndrome. 

I know you guys are no doctors. But can having such a small tic mean you have Tourettes or are there more symptoms that I have to meet?"
371,I feel cheated out of a decent life: Growing up with a narcissistic mother.,"I am 32 years old today.

For the first 27 years of my life, I felt worthless and lost. I was a liar, cheat and a thief. I was in search of something and I had no idea what that something was. 

Bouncing from abusive/toxic relationships until I got lucky enough to find my husband. He taught me how to feel things. How to process emotions in a healthy way. He talked to me and gave me .... empathy, love and compassion. Those things ... they are what I was in search for. 

My mother has always been moody. Sleeping all day and awake all night. Chain smoking on the back porch while she argued with whoever tried to speak with her.  If any of the five children she had tried to come to her for help- immediately it is their fault and she’s had similar happen to her but MUCH WORSE, feel bad for mom. 

When I got my period for the first time, I was 12. I had no idea what was going on and asking mom was not an option. So, I told an older friend of mine who lived down the street. She gave me tampons and explained how to use them. I hadn’t known at the time that virgins shouldn’t use tampons. I ended up getting a yeast infection. Though, I had no idea it was a yeast infection. I was convinced I was dying. So, I told mom. She accused me of having sex and being a whore. I just needed to be educated. I ended up telling a different friends mother who told me I needed a cream from the store. I walked there... and stole it. Again, I was 12.

I guess I am just searching for others who believe they grew up with a narcissistic mother and how it affected them. How it continues to affect them.

I am not a clinician of any kind and my mother has never been evaluated. 

If you need a good source of information, I suggest Dr.Grande on YouTube."
372,Welcome to hell,So for the past few days I’ve been sleeping. This is all a dream or a simulation of some sort. Nothing physically feels real and it’s to the point where I’ve been tempted to cut again to try to get out. Visually if I stop and look at things they glitch slightly like they shoot to the side and then return to their spot for a second or two then repeat. Colors aren’t quite right and noises aren’t right either. I’m just waiting for the terrible ending of the dream to wake up. Usually either my dog or I dies and I get to wake up. Fingers crossed!
373,Somebody is trigging something,[removed]
374,i dont know if this is where i should post this kind of thing but i dont know where else to go,"recently, i’ve found myself getting very upset whenever i see someone attractive. it used to be like that all the time with attractive women, especially around my age, i would get upset because i wanted to look like them but this is a different kind of upset. i cant even look at a man i find attractive for too long without crying or putting my phone down for hours, or taking a nap, i’m only 16 and i didn’t notice it until now. idk what to do or why i feel that way but i don’t like it. does anything think they know why i’m feeling this way?"
375,Lack of sympathy but high empathy? - Advice,"I guess I just wanted some advice about my sympathy/empathy. (new here, sorry if this comes off as rude because I don't mean to at all)  


I have always been an empathetic person, I think so anyways. When people are sad or upset, I feel really bad for them and it usually affects my mood a lot. When people tell me something bad, like even of someone I don't know that well, it repeats on my mind for a long time and it's like a large, dark cloud hanging over me. I feel like I have a really good radar for people that are upset, as I feel like I can just always 'tell.' My mood is just really damaged easily by other people's problems.   


For a while - I guess I've just shut people's problems out completely. I've destroyed all of my sympathy. Of course, I still feel sympathy for people, but I don't have a lot anymore and quite often I resent people who are struggling. I distance myself from them and I try to mostly stick around people who are always happy, (which is completely unrealistic standards) and I actively avoid people who are upset. I get angry when people cry and I almost just don't care. It's awful, because I come off as cold and I am a very loving person but I just don't want to be around people who are sad and just block them out.  If somebody came to me for help personally, of course I'd help them but I would eventually distance myself from them until they didn't come to me anymore. I feel like my intent is because being around sad people just hurts, but I don't really know.   


Is this relatable to anybody? Am I hyperempathetic or just an asshole?"
376,I’m scared that I’m on the verge of a nervous breakdown,"Hey, sorry to blurt this all out but I feel overwhelmed and like I need to just get everything out/hear from someone who can relate... I’ve contacted a therapist but I’m currently waiting to hear back.

My mental health has taken a complete nose dive in the past 1-2 weeks and I’m a little confused as to how it’s happened.

I won’t go into too much detail as it’s long, but I have a lot of issues around my self-esteem, self-worth and feeling rejected/unwanted. I also have severe procrastination issues and impulsive tendencies... I’ll start something new and then get bored of it and decide that I want to suddenly move to America or quit my job or something equally spontaneous. I don’t actually end up doing anything too drastic (just lots of small impulsive habits), but I guess that I’m never happy where I am. I always believe happiness is somewhere else.

I’m what you’d call ‘high-functioning’... my mental health is never great, but I somehow manage to coast along a lot of the time and convince people that I’m doing well. During lockdown, I’ve launched a side business that’s doing pretty well and created the illusion that I’m also getting loads of work done for my main job too (I don’t know how as I’d get fired if people knew how much I was doing). It’s not that I’m lazy or not ambitious - I want to do well and have a productive life. It’s more that, recently, I find being productive painful (it hasn’t always been this way).

When my business was all ‘new’ and ‘shiny’, I put my heart and soul into it. I worked all day and spent most of my spare time working on my business. Then I started to notice that I was becoming lethargic and moody trying to do these tasks and then I gradually started to decline in productivity. I WANTED to do these things, but it was like my brain had a mental block and wasn’t allowing me to.

I tried to pinpoint these feelings, but I can’t really figure out exactly WHY I always end up like this. I thought maybe it’s because of my low self-worth, but who knows. Anyway, something really insignificant happened with a work friend (they went to a work social with others without mentioning they were going to me) and it absolutely sent me spiralling. It sounds pathetic and insignificant, but I can’t explain how much things like this affect me. Rejection is the ultimate worst thing in life for me... whether it’s actual rejection or perceived rejection on my end. And I guess I must’ve already been in a pretty bad place without me realising, as I’ve just completely lost it.

I can’t focus on anything. If I try to do my work for my actual job or side business, I cry. If I make the smallest mistake when I actually do something mildly productive, then I slap myself round the face repeatedly because it makes me feel good. I think I’m worthless and useless and I deserve this discipline/punishment for making stupid mistakes that hold me back. Yesterday, it took me until 4pm to get the energy to shower and the effort of doing it felt painful to me and it made me cry. Everything just feels exhausting and like it’s hurting me emotionally even if it’s something as simple as making dinner. I opened up my work laptop today and for a minute or so I felt like everything looked weird (almost ‘warped’ when I looked at the keyboard) and I panicked because I’m scared what the hell is happening to me. Like I feel like my brain is so overwhelmed with stress and anxiety that I’m malfunctioning and it’s freaking me out.

I’ve never had a nervous breakdown before like this... is this what one is? I keep trying to take deep breaths and ground myself by listening to nice music and calming myself down but it doesn’t help much (only slightly). How do I pull myself out of this so I don’t completely screw up my job and my side business?

Thanks"

I cant remember who quoted this "" if you can predict the future your seeing there plan"" I feel like I need to get political but if I do you will become on of the pigs in animal farm. I feel like theres no winning."
379,What should I do if someone I know is having a panic attack?,"Is this the right place to ask this? 

Some of my friends experience panic attacks. I never know what to do. What should I do when one my friend has a panic attack?

What I've done the two times it has happened is: I tried to get them to a quieter room and call/get someone who knows what to do. But what should I do if I'm alone with them and I can't get someone else to help?"
380,How can I love my life again?,"Okay let's start here. I had been studying at college and graduated from it recently with red diploma and everything seemed to be nice now because it had been a very difficult and tough time because I studied so hard there three years. I thought I would only read books, write stories, study my target language (English) and do some spots but I feel like I don't wanna anything anymore like there's something like a light in me that was turned off. I have no motivation and no power to do anything and I'm feeling so depressed about my life. I wanna keep studying hardly but all I am able to do is think about my depression and wait for the day to end. I have no friends and I've never been in relationship with anyone so there's no one who distracts me from my dark thoughts and I'm feeling like I have no love for my life or interest. What the hell happened to me and why can't I just love the things I loved before? Is that depression? If that's depression can I get rid of it? Will the condition of my mental health change? Because I'm feeling like I'm having to willing to do anything and that scares me. I had such a great plans for my summer (studying history, geography and my target language and some study stuff) If i just have a rest for a couple of weeks will i get better? Or should I start forcing myself to work now? Please help me with you advice"
381,How do I cope with being isolated,"It's been months and being alone is taking a toll on my mental health. The cycle keeps repeating. I wake up, barely eat, bathe, sleep again. The cycle keeps repeating every single day and every day that passes feels like the room I'm in is getting smaller and smaller. I try to do other things such as read, draw, play games but I can't seem to find enjoyment or anything in doing so. It's hard. 

To anyone reading this, I hope you're doing well."
382,Is this job anxiety?,"(M20) I went to culinary high school and my first job was at this restaurant I worked like 10h to 12h shifts.
I hated it but I dealed with it and worked for 6 months, the last 2 months were horrible. I had panic attacks when going to work and I spent my time home overthinking my life and cried often.
After that job I tried at another restaurant, after a month of working there, it all came back and I quit again. Gave up cooking and worked in a store after. It was a bit better but as soon as some sort of rush happened, as in a lot of customers and when I had to hurry I would just lose my organization skills and get all lost. And the ""anxiety"" came back so I quit again after 2 months.
It's been almost a year since I had a job. I just can't deal with the anxiety again and I don't know what to do. I live with my parents and I have food and stuff. But I don't want to be broke. I want to work but I just can't deal with it mentally. I'm so stuck in life currently. 
Has anyone experienced it? What did you do?
What do you think I should do?"
383,Why do I have a fear of looking weak/vulnerable in front of people who actually care about me?,"I’ll avoid any situation where any of my immediate family or boyfriend might see me vulnerable or embarrassed or nervous, I’m fine with people I don’t know very well yet and friends.

I don’t know why I feel this way, I just don’t want them to see any of this and feel bad or embarrassed for me. I don’t want to ever look weak/vulnerable/scared/sad/embarrassed in front of them. 

I got invited to a party with people I don’t know very well and I’m considering not going, my boyfriend might be coming and I’m scared he will see me nervous or weak, or that I might stutter in a conversation and embarrass myself, or look anxious and not fit in, or he’ll see me pretend to be someone I’m not. If he doesn’t go I’ll be fine because then at least no one will be interested in what I’m doing, no one will be observing me, they won’t know I’m being someone else to fit in. 

Not sure where this stems from."

385,Anti Depressants are demonized,"I first went on ADs 3 years ago (I'm in mirtazapine because I struggled with insomnia). I started to slowly realise there's this stigma that even i had.

I'd feel ashamed when I'd go somewhere and theyd ask ""are you on any medication?"" And I'd respond yes. Why??? I almost felt disappointed in myself for being on them.

I've had friends constantly tell me how they wouldnt go on ADs because it changes them. If an AD alters your personality then it isnt the one for you. But also, the point of ADs is that they balance out your brain chemicals so...I mean there's going to be some change so surely it's for the better?

ADs are always recommended to go along with therapy, depending how deep your issues are. For some people they may feel better after a few months and be able to go off the ADs. But for others with long-term mental health problems, they will have to be on the ADs longer. Therapists actually recommend staying on ADs at least for a few years if you have deeper issues.

The side effects are blown out of proportion. You should only have severe side effects if the AD isnt the one for you or you were put on too high a dose. I'm on mirtazapine, that has a tired side effect. But as I was struggling with insomnia, it's not as if I hadnt already had that side effect beforehand. But there will be people in the same boat as me that make out the mirtazapine is awful, why? Because they've been installed with the idea that ADs are bad and so look for any reason to dislike them. Most side effects clear up after a few months. If you're constantly looking for side effects, you will find them.

The only bad think I believe comes from ADs is people can become dependant. And there needs to be some sort of program people can go through that can help them wean off. 

Some people do judge you for going on ADs. They wont be open about it though. Theyve been told and taught that ADs alter who a person is and is a ""last resort"". No. ADs are made to help people struggling to get by whilst they fix themselves. Anyone who treats you lesser because they have this twisted view on ADs can f*ck off."
386,today: im deadn't tomorow: im dead,so sad
387,A weird couple of minutes,"I was at work a few days ago. I was walking back from my break when I got this very intense feeling that everything happening around me just wasn't real. Like I was walking in place on a treadmill and fhe world was on autopilot around me. I passed a lady pushing a cart and all I could think was that she didn't actually exist.

This lasted for a few minutes and then everything was fine. I've been dealing with a lot of depression issues lately (and by ""dealing"" I simply mean nothing's killed me yet bc my coping skills are garbage) I don't know, it was just so strange."
388,Period of extreme confusion. What could cause it?,"I don't know if this is a medical problem or a mental health problem but I'm posting here in case it's a mental health thing and someone might know what it is. 

On Sunday I was at home with my birth mom and some of her family members I really suddenly started to feel confused. It's hard to explain exactly what I felt, but pretty much I just felt like I didn't understand what was going on and couldn't really form many coherent thoughts. I knew that I knew where I was and who the people around me were, but it was as if I kind of forgot exactly where and exactly who. I remember wondering if I was having a stroke and thinking I should ask someone to call an ambulance, and I tried to say ""call 911"" and focused really hard on saying the words but it was like I completely forgot how to form words. I wasn't feeling any pain, headaches, nausea, trouble breathing, or anything, but I did feel a little cold even though it was a warm day. 

People tried to talk to me and I just couldn't understand what they were saying. It was like they were speaking simlish. Apparently the whole time it just looked like I was really out of it so everyone assumed I felt nauseous or headachy or was having cramps or something and my birth mom led me to bed so I could sleep it off. I remember being led to bed but I didn't know why, but I also didn't really question it. She put a glass of water and some painkillers next to my bed but I didn't notice her do that.

I have no idea how long this went on for but eventually I must have fallen asleep and when I woke up hours later I just felt a bit off, like as if I was waking up from a nap I hadn't expected to take, which I guess is exactly what happened. This is the only time this has ever happened to me. Any idea what this might be? Should I go to a doctor about this?"

390,How to get out of this state of mind?,"Hello people of reddit :)  


I'm 26M, I have recently got my own apartment near my family so I have my own space, I currently work remotely as Software Engineer with great pay for my country that I got mid-COVID lockdown and I have first GF ever (since 4m ago, absolutely amazing person) so on paper I should be happy, but i'm not.   


I see my mental health deteriorating. I make a mess of apartment, my hygiene went to hell, I don't really contact my friends or my family if they don't initiate it. I feel so sad and alone inside even tho I have absolutely fantastic people around me who deeply care about me. 

This is not an issue that just happened when I moved out, this is happening last 4 or 5 years but with different intensity - Really strong like now or almost no issue like last summer. 

I'm overweight and I'm working on it, and when I get into this mental stage I see that my efforts get lower as well - Btw. I lost over 15KG since start of year with CICO and a bit of exercise!

I have not finished college yet and that is my only ""sore"" point of my life, I think it is reason I went to this stage as I once even thought about suicide for split second after failed exam but my logical brain just said **FU#K NO** to it and I really have that opinion about suicides I never thought about doing it again.

As I already said, I feel sad and alone, I sometimes feel huge need to cry when I think about it for a second or even some other sad things, things that I would definitely not cry about earlier in my life. I have noticed that this issue appears when I'm alone, when I'm not socializing, when I'm not getting out as much or it could be just the effect of it.

As younger I practice waterpolo and basketball as well but due to some (curable/cured) illness I have stopped but I have found joy in stair climbing and walking with my weight loss efforts as pools are not an option right now.

I hope this made sense to some of  you. I'm not really sure what will my next step be but probably someone who could help me professionally altho my country has poor mental health system so that will be a bit of a challenge."
391,Traumatized from past relationship.,"Hello! I'm glad you're reading this.

6 months ago, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. In bad terms, but I still stayed.

Our relationship was toxic. Whenever it came to a disagreement or miscommunication; She blocked me and gave me the silent treatment. At least, twice a week. I thereupon blamed myself multiple times, I took the blame on me to have her release the feelings.

I contained a lot of feelings and I was always the one trying to contact her whenever I was on her blocked list. It didn't take long until I felt numb. Wanting to please her needs, gifting her even tho I wasn't stable financially. It was sometime received with denial. 

After the breakup, she had crush. Unaware of what to feel, I kept supporting her and giving her advice. I still was in love with her, and stupidly enough, trying to get back with her, trying to satisfy. She revealed to me that she shared nudes with him and THIS is engraved in my mind. I have a colleague at work who for some reason reminds me of it ( I don't know why I'd compare him to this, really), whereupon anxiety returns, and sadness isn't that rare as well. 

She isn't to blame about anything. She has depression. It was my mistake not comprehending in what situation I put myself. It's good that the breakup eventually happened. As for now, I'm blocked. After thanking her for the experiences she gave me and the support, plus telling her that I like someone else now, I got blocked without explanation. It wasn't uncommon to me. 


Whenever my current partner goes silent or behaves I little different, it gets triggered again. I get anxious, overthink, try finding a way out. Whenever I'm alone, my ex comes back up, giving me the same feeling. It really just needs small things. 

My partner is really supportive and completely understands. I just wish to get rid of this, it's for a half year already daily."
392,Overthinking and catastrophizing,"So I dont know if this is the right Subreddit so sorry in advance (sorry for my english)
Since last year due to a lot of stress in university and a lack of social contact apart from family I (M 22) really started to realize the effect of poor mental health. I'm constantly overthinking things like not being good/smart enough for uni even though i passed, developed something like health anxiety where I fear the worst when sick or feeling pain like ""a slight pain in my arm - shit I am having a heart attack"" even when I have no reason to since I've always been healthy 
Started to close myself more and more and starting to distance myself from friends and being afraid to annoy new people due to a really low self esteem(?) I guess
I m always thinking things like ""you're not good enough, you look strange, people will get annoyed if you talk to them, you're a burden to the people around you"" 

I have been in this hole for a year now but my family supported me all the time for which i'm very grateful 
Now I've taken a big step in going abroad to a new university and living on my own for the first time in my life and yet while I should be happy for a new chapter in my life all I m thinking is that I might not be good enough and fail completely or that I will be alone for the next years and be an outcast. I know that without effort nothing will hapoen but everytime I decide to do something, take action I get overwelmed with this strange feeling and thoughts of being less and dont know how to escape from this hole im in."
393,Ranting,"
I have many friends who are all going through something mentally, big or small and I try to help them through it as best as I can manage. People seem to trust me fairly easily, and I’m glad of it. But I feel like it’s putting a pressure on me to be OK, because when you’re feeling down or sad, you don’t want to talk to another down/sad person to help. You want someone outside of your current emotions. I’m scared to tell them I really don’t like the why I look and I’m currently dieting at a fairly young age and it’s been really stressing me out. I especially don’t want to mention it around a friend whom I love more than I can express who struggles with an ED. How can I help my friends while also taking care of my mental health?"
394,Getting diagnosed,"TW Self-harm, depression and psychosis

&amp;#x200B;

Hi. I'm 16F and (I don't want to self-diagnose but) I think I have psychotic depression. I won't go into my symptoms unless I really need to but I've come to the conclusion that this is what it most likely is. I live in the UK and to get a diagnosis you have to be referred to a professional from your GP. However, I live with my parents and they don't really believe in mental health, it took them a year to consider me getting an autism diagnosis when I was 13 because they were in denial. I try to talk to them about self-harm and other stuff and they just sigh and tell me I'm fine. I now hide my self-harm and don't talk about any of that stuff with them because they just push it away. 

Nights are awful, I hardly sleep because I'm terrified something is going to kill me, there's a faint notion in the back of my mind that I know it's not real but it feels so real at the time. I have to sleep with lights and music on. There's other psychosis stuff but I'm not ready to share that with everyone yet.

What the main point of this post is though is that I don't know how to bring up the conversation about going to see a GP for mental health issues with parents who don't believe mental health is a thing and I should just ""grow up"". My aunt is a doctor and she's coming over soon so I might talk to her, she's coming over for a birthday though so it might not be the right time."
395,What is psychosis?,"Just a bit confused as I’ve tried reading up about psychosis because I’ve been worried about my train of thinking/behaviour lately, but there’s so many symptoms that it could almost apply to anyone with a mental illness (at least from what I’ve read so far). Is psychosis a very specific thing that occurs? Can it range from mild to severe? Is it sudden or can it occur over the long term?"
396,Real life Peter Pan,"I feel like a real life Peter Pan. All I wanna do is play video games, watch tv shows and fool around, go for drinks and shit food, basically pure instant gratification. I don't wanna grow up and get a job because I have no clue what I would REALLY want to do in my life. I have a serious fear of commitment in relationships and even jobs, like I am losing some freedom when I would end up being tied to a person or a company, so in the end I just end up overanalyzing things and doing nothing. Sometimes also the inevitability of death makes me wonder what's it all for, if we're actually just a speck of some shit universe dust, and in the end I just end up mortified about life and death.

my question would be what kind of professional should I seek to help me with the above mentioned things? I actually want to do something with my life but in the end I just brush it off and another day, week, month, year goes by. would really appreciate any help"
397,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"Feel like I should start this off with saying I’m a 17 year old male. For the past two years I’ve struggled with my mental health (I’ve not been diagnosed with anything and honestly I’ve not sought for much help because the few times I have it felt like my issues were just brushed off). But recently I’ve gotten a lot worse, I have short periods (around 5 days) where I feel numb to any positive emotion and I just shut myself off from my friends and family but then suddenly I’ll feel fine for a couple of days but then that wave of sadness will hit me again. I sometimes cry about how much I wish I could be younger again and that I wish I could just reincarnate as my younger self again (if that makes sense?) and honestly I despise my birthday, I turned 17 a couple of weeks ago and it made me feel physically sick, I can’t stand the thought of getting older it really distresses me. I also have these constant and intrusive thoughts that my friends aren’t really my friends and that they’re just trying to collect evidence and information on me so they can try and ruin my life in any way they can. It feels like my stomach flips on itself and I start shaking when I start getting these thoughts. I also struggle with how I view myself academically, no matter the grade I get, like even if I got 100% on a test it would still feel like I did garbage and that I’m inadequate, it’s not the I even have pressure from my parents, they just tell me to try my best and they’ll be happy but I honestly just feel like such a disappointment no matter what I do. 

I think one of the worst things is that I know everything I think and feel isn’t normal, but that doesn’t make me feel any less awful"
398,Is my therapist overstepping a boundary?,
399,"When you rise, you fall. When you fall, you rise.","The one thing they never tell you in life is that no matter how low you are, there’s always lower. And lower. And lower. Lower. 

Your body, your mind and heart. All broken. Dunked into your floor, your bed. So much so that just being in your room encompasses with darkness.

And it hurts. You want to cry, shout scream but you can’t. There’s nothing stopping you, and no matter how hard you try you can’t cry. And then you feel defeated. Worthless, humiliated. Maybe even forsaken? I don’t know. 

And then you take a moment to breathe. SIKE my health online, you got a bill statement. $1000. Mostly likely some shit I’ll being paying off till I’m dead all the way back from when I was 17 and they were shoving tubes up my veins, checking my blood every week, giving infusion that never felt like they were working. 
Pulling out the bone marrow, two blood infusion. Three suicide attempts. 

One mental ward visit where the only thing you learn is that you’re built well or you got to live ripped up on pills that you got to sort out by days like abuela does, and never takes because she can’t remember what day it is. 

And then you turn your life around.

You finally get your license at 23. And no matter how hulimating is, your dad gives you a car and you humble accept it because what do you know you also finally got a job that pays you well enough to start paying off that hospital bill. 

And then after you first week, you’re about to get onto the freeway and it hits you. 

Every muscle, every joint and vein release all that tension and screams, “We made it another day! Thank the heavens! Thank the cosmos! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” and then you cry while going 65 and doing your damn best to make sure you don’t swerve until traffic at 5:30 am after pulling a 12 hour shift.

And you cry. Thankful to seen such a beautiful sun set, but so heartbroken because there will never be another one like it."

402,What's going on,"This is going to be a long post, I feel myself slipping. This has happened before but I still don’t know what’s going on. 

The past two or three nights my insomnia has kicked it up a notch and I’ve barley been getting any sleep, yet I’ve had an overwhelming amount of energy which makes sleeping even harder. A part of my sleeping problem is seeing a showdown figure in my room, it goes away the second I look at it but it’s very distinct and I can almost feels it’s presence, not like it’s looking at me but like it wants to hurt me. I’ve started to get paranoid and overly cautious about everything. I’ve started worrying about reality and how real everything is, I’ve started to believe I’m not real or that I’m the only one. I feel like I’m being pushed out of my own head, that’s about the only way I can explain it. My head feels crowded with things I can’t understand or “de-code”. Familiar things like my room and kitchen and living room have felt so foreign for some reason. This has happened before but I normally start feeling this way and within the next 1-2 days I’m fully into that episode but it’s been like 3-5 and I can feel myself slowly getting closer and closer to the breaking point. I’ve got therapy tomorrow so I am planning on telling her all this but telling someone this much about me makes me anxious. I trust her fully but it makes me uncomfortable when people know the deep dark things in my mind. 

Does anyone have the slightest clue what’s going on?"
403,Mental Health Tips toward Productivity,"📷

Some days are harder to get through than others, especially during a global pandemic. Sheltering in place for some may mean being trapped in a slew of unhappy thoughts. For those struggling with anxiety and depression, the lack of productivity may make matters worse. Here are some simple things to allow yourself to say “[**Yes. I did do something today.**](https://www.newyorkminutemag.com/finding-hope-with-mental-illness/)”"
404,I think my partner (25M) and I (21F) have PTSD from our baby's birth,"Our beautiful baby boy was born on Monday morning, but it was a really traumatic time for both my partner and I. We're going to formally complain about it.

I knew I was in early labour but the docs didn't believe me, I kept begging them to give me another physical examination but they said I'd already had one the night before and didn't need another. Eventually they gave in and found I was 3cm dilated and the contractions were getting stronger and stronger, and extremely painful. I was screaming that the baby was coming but again, they didn't believe me. Before I knew it I was fully dilated and ready to push. They told us they had left it too late to go through with my c-section! Which was really scary because my partner and I had decided due to my type 1 diabetes that giving birth naturally was too dangerous for me. We were absolutely terrified that something would go wrong. They didn't check my blood sugars once the entire time, it was completely left up to my partner. There were a lot of staff in the room and yet only a couple of them actually did anything, it seemed the others were just there to stare at my privates! 

After A LOT of unnecessary distress and pain (and no comfort given by the staff whatsoever, who just kept telling me to calm down) baby was still taking a while to come despite all the pushing so they finally decided to give me an emergency c-section after all (thank god, I was screaming that I needed one the entire time, I was in so much pain that I broke the gas and air machine with my teeth). Our beautiful boy was born and I got to meet him about 30 mins after waking up in recovery. He's doing amazingly, he's on the special care baby unit as he's so early, but he's a big chunky healthy boy!

It's been a few days now and we still can't stop talking about how awfully it was handled. Nobody listened to a word we said and my partner was terrified something bad would happen if he left my side."
405,I hate myself so much,[removed]
406,Helpless and I have no insurance,[removed]
407,I've been referred to a specialist for eating disorders,"Ive been telling my doctors for over ten years now how much I struggle with overeating, how much it controls my life and how I feel helpless when bingeing. I've always been told to check out Overeaters Anonymous, exercise and make a diet or food plan. Nobody considered the mental aspect of this. 

I have FINALLY spoken to a therapist who urged me to call my doctor again and tell them to refer me to someone. And they have!!
In all these years, nobody told me it was possible to get help for my binge eating. All I knew is that people with anorexia got help, but I was told to just exercise and stick to a diet plan. 

I don't know what will happen next, when I'll be seen and what kind of help I will even get but I am both relieved and frustrated that after so many attempts, someone only had to request a referral and it was done in minutes."
408,"My estranged, drug-addicted, mother has terminal liver cancer.","Apologies in advance if this is the wrong subreddit.

My biological mother was sexually abused by her father (who I have never met), and had a number of pre-exisiting personality problems, namely compulsive lying and manipulation. She became pregnant after dating my father for three months and both families wanted them to marry and keep me. The marriage was not happy and she effectively abused my father.

When I was 7, she was diagnosed with Wilson's Disease; a genetic intolerance to copper which damages the liver and then spreads to the rest of the body, including the brain, causing further neurological disorders. She was Sectioned and placed temporarily in a secure mental hospital. My parent's marriage deteriorated and I became her carer for some of this time, helping clothe and feed her. Eventually new medication stabilised her physical health, though there has clearly been permanent neurological damage.

My parents divorced when I was about 10, and initially she had legal custody of me. She had a series of progressively more unstable boyfriends and began to abuse hard drugs. My father remarried and won custody of me following a lengthy legal battle. My mother's situation further deteriorated during my mid-teens and she was often robbed, beaten up and raped twice (allegedly). I still saw her during this time and was witness to the periphery of some of these events, however as my mother is a compulsive liar it is very difficult to know what is actually true. At some point she began using heroin.

My mental health deteriorated and I became very withdrawn at school, and was sometimes bullied, however the environment my father and step-mother built for me was a loving and supportive one.

Just before my 15th birthday, two men arrived at my mother's house whilst I was upstairs. I heard an argument and saw them out of the window, but as this was a regular occurrence thought little of it. My mother came upstairs and told me not to come downstairs under any circumstances. I decided this was her usual histrionics and went back to playing video games. She told me later that they dragged her into the garage, injected her with heroin and repeatedly raped her. I do not know if this is true, as again she is a pathological liar.

Following this, I had a rapid mental breakdown and began to feel actively suicidal. I self-diagnosed myself with depression and went to see a doctor, who prescribed me antidepressants and began my journey with counselling. I was very much at ""the edge"" and vividly remember my ""point of no return"" moment. Therapy helped me recognise the abuse for what it was, and I broke ties with my mother. I have not seen her since.

I am now nearly 26. I have been in and out of therapy for the last decade, which has been invaluable in me working through my own feelings and understanding my history, and the complex relationship with my mother. During that time my mental health went from critical to generally very strong, and I've been able to completely turn my life around. I have a loving family, a supportive circle of friends, and am financially successful with my own home and a good career, which included a two year stint in law enforcement. 

I credit the circumstances of my upbringing for giving me a sound independence of mind, emotional intelligence and considerable drive to achieve my objectives. I am extremely driven in helping people and have volunteered often, including a three month stay in West Africa when I was 18, which I feel was the moment I became an adult. 18 months ago I decided to take a night school intro class to counselling, and am now enrolled on night school degree program to become a fully qualified therapist. Despite my still relatively young age, my experiences allow me to empathise readily with clients and appreciate complex clinical psychology.

I have had a strained, distant relationship with my biological mother's family, and only speak to my grandmother regularly. We have grown closer in the last year as my anger towards my mother has become more manageable, and Covid-19 has in particular meant we have been speaking more. My grandmother is not a bad person, but is the only family member who has not disowned my mother.

In the last 10 years, my mother became homeless, is regularly in trouble with the Police and criminals, and everything else one might imagine the life of an addict might entail. I have little sympathy. Most jarring is that she continues an abusive relationship with my grandmother, using pathological lying and emotional blackmail to have effectively bankrupted her to fund her habit. She has claimed she has had cancer at least half a dozen times now, always false. She has tried to add me on Facebook a couple of times but I have automatically blocked her each time.

I have had a recurring dream where I imagine that I either confront my mother for everything she has done to my family and myself, and another one where she has died and only I and my grandmother attend her funeral. In the dream, I ask the funeral director if I can push the button that ignites the crematorium, so that I know our suffering is finally over.

Just over a week ago my grandmother told me that my mother had collapsed on her way to pick up a methadone (synthetic heroin) prescription from a homeless clinic. She has been in hospital since then and initial tests were difficult due to struggling to fit a cannula. My grandmother called a few hours ago, saying she was invited in to the hospital and spoke directly to the doctors. My biological mother has terminal liver cancer, prognosis two to three months to live. She will be moved to a palliative care ward, and they are waiting on a second opinion though this appears to be inoperable, compounded by her long history of substance abuse.

I have activated my support network and know how to ground and take care of myself. I have an incredibly supportive network of friends, family and an excellent employer. But I feel, I think understandably, somewhat in shock, and full of conflicting emotions.

Thank you for reading and allowing me to vent in anonymity."

410,I hate being a lesbian,"This will always be the number one reason why i hate myself with a burning passion. I hate my sexuality. I wish i was just asexual or straight. I hate being the odd one out i hate being the disadvantaged one. Everyone knows me as the single girl. Its a literal personality trait at this point. 

I hate being attracted to the same sex. Its fucking embarrassing and pathetic. I'll never get a girlfriend. I'll always be a single virgin. I'll never be able to have my own family either. I don't ever want to adopt and don't want to be knocked up by some dude, to raise a child that isn't even ours. 

Everything is so pointless. I hate myself. I don't think I'll ever accept myself."

In the last year I had to quit weightlifting because of how bad my health has been (keep getting one health issue after another). In a few days I’ll be at a cardiologist’s office because my heart rate doesn’t go below 100 anymore. My life sucks right now and I honestly can’t do this anymore. I can’t live afraid to go out with a girl because of how anxious I am. I can’t live afraid to reply to assholes because of how self conscious I am. I just can’t and honestly I wanna die, but due to health complications seems like I will soon anyways. My one question is why? What did I do to deserve this."
413,Is this ocd?,"Hi, sorry, I just had this tought and would like to ask someone's opinion.

I constantly doubt everything, my looks to the point that I considered i just had bodydismorphia, because I have to take pictures once in a while just to make sure I haven't gotten worse during the day... buf I noticed I do that with other things too, like work.

I am just not convinced anything I do is ever good enough. And I have intrusive toughts bad enough that I have to go back and check even concluded things again and again to make sure I didn't screw up and I was just too distracted tired or simply too stupid to notice the errors...

And i kind of realized that the way I circle around the same kind of toughts is quite similar and I just wondered if this what ocd is like? Or maybe it's something else, I have no clue."

I get extremely panicked about talking to people etc, and so help me god if I have to hug them. Sometimes I can stand it for a bit, but other times it feels like they’re burning my skin. I break down when people touch me and have to scratch at the spot they touched until I believe I’ve removed their touch. I’m okay with hugging some people, although that’s only people I’m really close to. I always get in trouble and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Do I have some sort of mental issue that keeps me from touching people?"

I’ve gotten so tired of trying to tell anyone that I’m not okay. It just feels like a worn out excuse, and no one wants to hear it anymore. And that’s fine, it’s no one’s responsibility to deal with my bad days too but I don’t know how to deal without disappearing. I dig myself a hole and crawl into it because it’s the only place I know how to feel safe again. Sometimes things get bad and I can’t say anything at all.

I am tired."
418,Understanding And Dealing With Fear,"  

Fear and Anxiety are incredibly complex and at times they can push you to take action to improve your life and or they can cripple you. I have had anxiety my whole life and understand how detrimental it can be to live with, so I made a small video on this topic where I try to explore some of the psychology behind fear/anxiety as well as provide ways in how to deal with it, hope it provides value in a small way.

419,How to approach someone who has extreme anxiety and depression?,"I am very close to this person with extreme anxiety and depression. They’re 16 years old, a female. I don’t really even know where to start, but we’ve tried to get this person to take therapy, to take medication, to get help numerous times, and it just isn’t helping. This person has also not been able to go to school for an entire year ever since they refused to go on the first day of last year. It’s gotten to a point where they don’t leave their room. They don’t do anything really. And it’s super super sad seeing someone deteriorate mentally, physically, and just being consumed by their problems. I try to help but she’s so far down a hole that even talking about getting out of that hole is just a process that’s too scary for her. Idk if there are any suggestions but the parents of this person have tried everything and nothing is working. I’ve got nothing but questions, but how do I start to help this person. Anxiety caused this person to withdrawal from society and because of the shame they are now depressed. Plz help"
420,considering cutting ties with parent,"I have been considering this for a while. It is a phasic feeling, much like his disorder is phasic, but always returns.

My father is not a physically abusive person, or even a bad person fundamentally. However, his extreme denial of his psychological condition makes his behaviour very difficult to deal with. He has undiagnosed bipolar 2, which he believes to be mild depression. I am a psychologist; I know it is not. He has intense verbal outbursts when he is in a low mood. Sometimes, I have been able to get through to him to the point where he talks about considering seeing a professional. But he never has, and I have been engaging in this horrible dialogue for in excess of ten years. Before that, I was too young to know what was going on. So, that's my primary reason.

Some background on my relationship with him. I was sexually abused by a relative at 10 years old. I told my parents at the time; my father did not believe me for about 5 years. I think it is because he couldn't deal with it, but the upshot of it was that I was told to ""grow up"" and ""get over it"" when I refused to see the relative. He has significant self-esteem issues regarding his personal levels of academic attainment having been affected by his mental health. I would sympathise with him, were it not for his behaviour. To put it bluntly, I am academically successful. I have worked my butt off to be so. My father has undermined my intelligence to the point that I didn't know I had this in me until I left home. My own education was affected by anorexia. I am not unaware of what he went through. My objection is to the gaslighting, undermining and emotional vitriol that comes my way when he feels inadequate. He is not willing to change, and I am done trying at this point.

I am not defenceless; I have stood up for myself during this time. I have a good relationship with my mother, who is very stoic and has her own way of dealing with him. I have been lucky enough to form other healthy relationships with my partner and friends, and have had influences from other parental figures and therapists that have allowed me to separate my self esteem from my father's diatribes. However, despite rare moments where we get along, the rest of the time old patterns ensue. I have become better at dealing with them, but inevitably they still get under my skin. I am struggling to see why I would want to spend time with someone who affects me so negatively, or why I would want any future child of mine, especially if they were a girl (I believe gender to be a massive factor due to his complicated relationship with his mother), to be subject to anything like this.

I would be grateful for those of you who have encountered similar issues to share your thoughts with me. I do not consider this lightly, but at a time when other areas in my life are so positive, I am struggling to see why I should expend time and energy on something so negative, that ultimately makes me feel like an ill little girl again."
421,"People taking medication for their depression, how are you finding it?","Hi guys, I have depression and have previously done a CBT course as well as some counselling to tackle some issues and learn some positive coping mechanisms.

However, I'm still struggling - I was thinking of asking my doctor if medication is the next logical step. For those of you taking medication, has it helped? How do you feel, did you encounter any weird side effects etc?"

423,Is getting tested for epilepsy worth it?,"I think I have epilepsy. Ever since I was a kid the voices in my head were just too loud so I just slammed my head into the wall or bagged over my head until I passed out. 

I permanently twitch and sometimes have black out moments, but my dad told me I would be locked up permanently if the police found out. Of course I would lose my cpa license forever if I had a major seizure but I don’t really get grand mals I lose maybe 10-15 minutes.

Due to being in my 40s I’m sole support for my parents and other elders. But I’ve lost jobs before because I scratched my face and was bleeding. Nobody cares at my current job. I lost a lot of weight and got down into the 70’s before.

How much does the cure for epilepsy cost. I don’t have a lot of money cuz most of it goes to my parents and siblings as well as remittances. Is it worth it if I don’t have a car atm or should I just ignore it."
424,Can eating disorders be hereditary?,"I’ve read articles that talk about eating disorders being more likely to occur in people who have a family history of EDs. I’ve recently started recovery from Anorexia but I’m not sure if I should tell my therapist if I have a family history or not.

My grandmother, who died when I was very young, might have had an eating disorder. From what my mom has described, my grandmother would binge eat privately in their home, resulting in obesity and other health issues. However, this was long before mental health began to be normalized so she never went to a doctor or got a real diagnosis. 

I’m basing this only off the description my mom has given me, which obviously is only so accurate as it’s based off her childhood memories from almost 50 years ago. 

Since I never really knew my grandma, she never had a real influence on my life. Is it possible that her history with a potential ED might have put me at higher risk for developing one even though I never knew her?"
425,Skipping Work because of Depression,"So basically I had a really bad depressive episode Tuesday night. I don’t work Wednesdays and had plans to go see friends so we went and I spent the whole day just kind of shoving my feelings to the side.

I woke up this morning and I just couldn’t. I was not going to go to work and groom dogs while I was feeling terrible (they usually sense it and freak out). AND have the regional manager over my shoulder because she’s watching our location today. 

So, I called in sick and said I had food poisoning. I’m not comfortable talking about my mental health, and tbh, I said my oven broke without me realizing it and I ate very undercooked food which gave me food poisoning. But my oven really did just break and I really did eat very undercooked food, it just didn’t make me sick.

I feel terrible about lying and about not going in to work (to be fair most days my appointments don’t show up and I spend the whole day sitting around anyway). I wouldn’t normally feel so bad about this but 2 weeks ago I was out for a week for a COVID scare because I was showing symptoms and couldn’t go back to work till I had two negative test results. 

To be fair, I told them to reschedule all of my appointments to the end of my work days tomorrow, Saturday, and Monday, so that I can make it up to the customer (1 customer 3 dogs). So it’s not like his dogs won’t get groomed. But I still can’t help myself from feeling badly about myself. Am I a terrible person?"
426,Someone please help me,"English is not my first language so I apologize in advance. 
I don't even know if this is the right place to talk about this, or how to explain it. The thing is, I believe my mom is experiencing some psychotic episodes all of them religious related. Instead of going to a doctor she asked for help to people of the church and they came to the conclusion that she is possessed. Since then, I believed she became extremely manipulated by the whole environment. They are trying to exorcise her, this people aren't doctors and if something happens to her that requires medical attention on these sessions they are not going to know what to do, and I'm scared. Also, exposing a person to that level of stress is not healthy at all, I don't know if that could cause some sort of long term damage. Were should I asked for help? Is there a Reddit to this kind of situations?
 How can I convince her to see a psychiatric? She's absolutely brainwashed :( Sorry if this is not appropriate to put it here, I honestly don't know what to do."
427,What is wrong with me?,"Someone told me to post this here instead



Hi I’m 19F and a college student. Over the past few months I’m losing motivation for everything and everything feels like a fucking chore.

I started my first semester of CC in August last year and loved it! I loved doing my homework and getting shit done even my second semester that was in January I was positive.


Since March I just have not given a shit about anything. Literally do my homework hours before it’s due. All I do is lay in bed for hours and listen to music or be on reddit or YouTube. Until the time gets too close for my homework to be due. 

I’m in my third summer semester now. I literally don’t give a shit about my homework I half ass everything. I feel like I’m not good enough for my major anymore. I’m a honor student but idk how the fuck I got into that.

I even hate how food taste now. It just feels like I’m eating. I don’t feel like how I used to feel when I eat I feel worthless every time I put something in my mouth. Yet I still continue to eat .


I have no friends except the people I talk to when I go to work. I have a bf we met online so it’s ldr. I don’t want to tell him about it bc I don’t want him not to like me.


So when I get a spark of motivation to do something then it goes away. I should be happy because nothing bad is going on in my life but I have no joy for anything. I just got accepted into a University I wanted to go to and I’m not even that happy about it.

I got a shiton of homework due Sunday I just don’t want to do it

The past few days have been my worst in a while, while I don't want to hurt or kill myself I feel just like giving up. I've called out of work and made up excuses for multiple days. I can't sleep at night and wake up feeling exhausted with no energy and I barely have energy throughout the day. I haven't gone grocery shopping in over a week and have been eating out randomly or snacking, spoiled food is just sitting in my fridge. I have no energy to shower, to go out. The only thing I have managed to do is keep my living room where I ""sleep"" clean and my dishes washed mostly but even those aren't done now and I can't muster the strength. I feel like I'm racing downhill fast. I'm supposed to be moving in like 2 weeks and really needed the money from this week and next weeks work and now that I've called out so much I won't have enough and don't know how to get enough and I'm scared but at the same time, it's like I don't care. I feel so tired, I can't explain it. I'm now more overweight then I already was, I'm not taking care of myself. Should I take a leave, check into a mental hospital? Im scared of those too.
Depression and anxiety are such a hard combo, possible ADHD on top of that, every day is a struggle. I don't know what to do.
My boyfriend broke up with me weeks ago, my great-grandma is in hospice and dying soon, i haven't seen my siblings in months and they are living in a motel. I have only one friend i actually talk to.

For the past month, i was good, i went to work on time and only called out once every couple weeks which is good for me. I actually like this job i don't understand why im sabotaging it, lying about not feeling well to call out when it's just my brain telling me i cant do it. I don't want to be homeless or jobless but i just can't. I don't understand what made me suddenly give up and why. I need to get out of it.

Im not on any meds and never have been. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder when i was 16, my parents were the cause as i grew up in an abusive home. I self-harmed then but not for years now. I've been so stressed, bouncing from home to home not making enough to be on my own, people kicking me out, trying to keep a job, for a while i was finally doing good but then i got kicked out randomly for no reason, was homeless for 3 days sleeping on a couch.

432,people with delusions make me angry sometimes,"so sometimes i have run ins with people whit delusions online when im servers or subreddits about dreams or spirituality i am a very logical person but i am interested in spiritual things but i like to keep a leveled head and not jump to conclusions stuff like this makes me angry "" the dream was real you are \[insert magical being\]"" stuff like that and then i go to their profile and they are obviously very unstable and in a rabbit hole of delusion do i get angry because i dont understand? and im scared?maybe i really really wish these people had help but i get so mad my mind goes in cruel mode i know im an asshole i wish i understood better but my mind is very grounded when it comes to proof of paranormal and spiritual stuff how my mind works i need 100% proof and when i am presented with just babble i get mad, idk i think countries need to do better on getting people treatment. sorry i know i sound like an asshole but my mind reacts they way it does and if anyone has advice on how to handle people in psychosis and delusions please feel free to add"
433,Finally got a real therapist!,"I've been experiencing symptoms of depression since I was 10, and I didn't tell my parents about it till I was 14. I'm turning 16 soon and since then I was seeing a counselor, so I wasn't able to get officially diagnosed. I got to a really low point around the start of this year, and my mum finally decided it was time I saw a therapist (well, a child clinical psychologist) and I had my consultation last Thursday! We talked, and she'll be able to officially diagnose me. I struggled with talking about my feelings because I didn't want to be one of those self-diagnosers who just say they have depression for shits and giggles, so I'm happy I can finally have a name for my feelings. Just wanted to share, since it's something I haven't been able to talk to me friends about, didn't want to be a burden."
434,i dunno anymore,"I don't have anywhere else i can post this atm. I'm getting so paranoid i wanna cry, it feels like there's dozens of people watching and judging me all day long. I can't do this. People seem to think i'm not serious or they think they can poke fun when i'm feeling like trash. I don't understand why they wanna do this to me, i've been feeling like this for way too long already"
435,What causes that I cannot form thoughts?," I have felt like a zombie for years now. I can only speak about myself and the sentences are like maxinum of 10 words. My mind is TOTALLY blank and I can never think anything to say. AT ALL. My doctor could not help me, he said its depression and gave me SSRI medication that does not help. But I have had this from childhood. Is this some rare condition, can I do something to boost my brain activity or something? I need help very bad, I cannot live life like this anymore."

437,I'm stuck in a rut and I need help,For background information I have finished school and I am about to go into university. I have  been suffering from depression for over a year now  and I should be studying to get read for uni but I don't want to. There's been times before where I could make myself sit down and do it but that was when I was still in school and wanted to succeed. Tbh I think I might be burnt out because I was doing 4+ hours a day 5 times a week of self study. Thank you for reading this I hope you have a good day.
438,"Hi okay, I’m very confused","So recently I’ve been having tics, I guess. It usually happens when I’m depressed or anxious. Usually my head just twitches, but I’m worried that my brain is just making this up. I feel like I’m faking it but I don’t know anymore. If anyone could help clear this up that would be great! :)"
439,How do I experience joy?,I don’t find enjoyment in anything I skate but it doesn’t bring me joy or any type of pleasure same for gaming it feels like I’m forcing myself to do stuff I don’t like but I don’t like anything nothing is fun or joyful (I’m diagnosed with depression) I just hate this so much I can’t live in this world like this I wanna die I’m so close to ending my life I don’t wanna live with this what do I do idk what I enjoy anyone or even who I am what am I how do I escape this there’s no joy in anything I hate life
440,I'm no longer angry about my past,"I used to get really badly bullied. I've been in hospital twice and had several rounds of therapy.

I've grafted so fucking hard to get to where I am today. Healthy, happy and successful.

And I just realised that I'm no longer angry at those people that made me suffer. I forgive them. I realise that while what they did to me was wrong, a lot of them were suffering too.

I used to channel that anger into productivity. It worked but I don't need to be angry anymore, now that I have everything I want.

I'm sharing this not because I'm gloating or anything, but because I want others to know that you can beat it. That feeling of hopelessness can diminish. 

I suppose the message here is be kind. Not only to others, but to yourself. It's really important.

How did you get over your past? If I had to nail it down, it would be;
1. Cups of tea. They're like hugs in a cup.
2. Therapy to teach me how to live with my emotions, make sense of them and not to identify with them as much
3. Hard work and patience. Take each day as it comes, try your best and don't be harsh on yourself.

Ps. Apologies if I get the flair/post wrong, this is my first post!"
441,Does anyone else struggle with feeling genuine empathy for others?,"Today I hurt a good friend of mine’s feelings on accident. Inadvertently, through my careless choice of words, I made her feel like her thoughts were not important to our conversation. 

I understand that she was upset because of my actions; I understand that it was my fault. I told her that I was sorry that I hurt her and that I would be more careful in the future.

But, if I’m being honest, I genuinely don’t care. I don’t. I don’t care that she was upset because of me. I apologized because I wanted us to be able to move forward, not because I truly felt bad. A part of me thinks maybe I shouldn’t have because I didn’t mean it.

Although I can recognize the issues other people face, I have no empathy for them— not even for matters that I, too, have dealt with. If anything, it bothers me when emotions throw a wrench into things.

Reading this back to myself, I realize I sound like a major dick. I don’t really want to be a rotten person. I try to be pleasant but sometimes i’m overly blunt/rude and hurt people. I know how to be civil but it irks me that it isn’t genuine. 

I really don’t understand why this is an issue for me. Does anyone else struggle with this? Does anyone have any advice on how to learn empathy (is that possible)?"

443,I finally did it. Thank god. I took the first step. I finally found the courage to tell my Doctor about whats been going on and i asked for help.,It was easier than i thought it was gonna be. I thought i’d be super anxious but it was very easy to talk to him. Instead of being anxious my body sort of decided to just shut down and tune out and i was able to tell him everything without trouble. I told him whats been going on with my family and i asked him to get me in contact with a professional who i can talk to and give me professional advice on what the next step in my life will be. I feel so much more secure now that help is on the way. I took the first step and things are being arranged. We decided i should be talking to my psychiatrist more often. It was really good. I took the first step and now no matter what happens i can sit back and relax knowing that i took the first step and help is on the way. He’s scheduled to call me again next week. Im excited.
444,I dont understand myself and my brain,"I've suffered from depression all my life but only started taking anti depressants a few months ago
they seemed to work at first and my life improved alot
but recently I've just felt empty with nowhere to go and constantly unsatisfied with myself a progress on my personal projects only slowing me down and making me feel like absolute trash.

I tried talking to family but almost everyone i spoke to told me to toughen up and it through me further down that spiral of feeling like im worthless and that there is no point continuing.

The feeling of worthlessness has lead me to consider ending it all to stop the pain as the self destructive solutions I've used no longer work so im being hit with the full force of my brains unfiltered emotion which I just can't handle any more.

I don't understand myself anymore and it hurts to simply exist while keeping a happy face to those around me saying nothing is wrong and that im fine but inside im beginning to let go of hope."
445,7 common misconceptions about depression,[removed]
446,"Mistrustful to my father, LSD + PD = psychosis?","I have been having the thought lately I have some sort of personality disorder. I had very few friends at childhood, and always thought myself sort of different from others. I had different interests and my behaviour was not like other normal people. The previous fact didn't really affected me through college, in fact I graduated with honors from mech. engineering at a top school in my country.  I'm now 28, and through this 5 years of experiencing frustrations at my work and life, I started experimenting with LSD with the hope It would help me. At first it was nice, I felt more connected to people in general, with my mother, my sister, normal people on the streets, etc. I felt being able to wrasp things on a deeper level as well. 

With my father, though, it was different. I started sensing he was hijacking me, he was lying to me constantly, he was gaslighting me, he was hiding information from me, he was pushing me to do incorrect things (for example, he is pushing me to buy a new expensive appartment one of his friends developed, with a 25 y loan, at a 15% discount of the list price. I didn't like at all the appartment, i consider it full of errors and strange design decisions, and interpreted, and still interpret this, as him wanting to help his friend and socialize this bad investment to me with my debt). I also think property prices will drop significantly as well, because they are not anchored to construction costs but to speculative location prices.

 I can't remember having similar ideas when I was young. I always trusted him back then. 

I also have noticed myself I'm amplifying my dislike with financier people and with the financial sector. In the last years I have been constantly blaming financiers and finance for the world problems, and my problems by extension (wrong or right, idk), since I sort of view the world as interconnected. My father is not pro-finance, in fact I remember him disliking them openly when I was young, favouring productive endeavors. But in the last years I have been sensing he defends them, defends usury, defends the system, etc. In the last months I have started having this paranoid idea he is some sort of intermediary that gets money from finance (my father's business has grown at a huge rate). By extension, I now think his financiers control my father, and push him to do degenerate and unnatural things in general (one of them making me suffer). 

Anyway,  I don't really have strong reasons to think this, other than my intuition. So I'm not able to convince even myself at sometimes that this concerns are true. I'm worried this might be some sort of permanent psychosis induced by LSD and by some unknown PD. Anyway, I'm currently exploring escaping from all of this to cure myself away from him, with anthroposophic medicine. I have this idea any psychiatric treatment will last years and I don't think I can bear this that long. Are my concerns real? what do you think?"

This time I tried to tell her the truth about something that's been bugging me, but she cut me off and told me it was ""just anxiety."" I was especially off put because the call started with her making a joke about how I used to self harm(not in a mean way, but I didn't appreciate the joke).

I won't go into detail on it, but when I spoke to her she didn't really let me detail what I wanted to say either. I started to say one thing, and she interrupted me saying it wasn't a big deal and started talking mostly about herself for the whole rest of the call. It made me realize that most of our sessions(which have been a handful at best over the past 4 years) have almost entirely been her talking about herself...

Do I trust her that there's actually nothing wrong and that it's just anxiety? Idk if it'll make much of a difference in how I feel rn, but... it's just been bugging me, and has been one of the thoughts feeding into me doubting that there's anything wrong and that I'm just faking/exaggerating all of...this."

460,Every time I go out.,"Hi.

I have a problem. If I don’t leave the house, I can somewhat control myself. If I leave the house for any reason, I HAVE to eat something. That something usually tends to be a LOT and it ends up being unhealthy... obviously.

I have lost 50 pounds so far. I’m half way to my goal. This all happened during the lockdown so it was kind of difficult to get unhealthy food in my household.

Now that things are somewhat more accessible, (although it probably will go back to lockdown soon) I’ve been having to go out to run errands and such. This has become the catalyst to eventual regain of weight.

I have been finding excuses to get out of the house and even if I actually have to go out, I always eat.

Food somehow is so important to me that my productiveness can be completely halted to scheme on how to get out of my house to binge.

If any of you have experienced something like this or have any general tips / tricks... please help.

Thank you so much."

462,an interesting article about hoe even mentally ill people stigmatize other mentally ill people,"So i read this article:
https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress

And it kind of gets what I have experienced in mental hospitals.
Even people that are there tell themselves, that they are not mentally ill, but just have something, that need biological fixing and will still unwittingly see ""the crazy people"" as different from themselves.

This is a great problem, that does not help prevent stigmatizing mental illness, but rather increase it, albeit the fact mental illness is talked about more. What do you think about this?

Do you think your ""chemical imbalance"" in you brain is different from other people, that you would see as ""crazy""?"
463,Bouncing around the stages of grief,"I can't get an appointment with the therapist as they don't have the resources to meet demand.

I'm thinking if I can process my situation the way I processed my brother's death, I'll end up in a much better and stable place. But I think intellectually, since I know this circumstance is not death, and doesn't have the same finality it's harder to move past it.

I really wish I could talk this stuff out with someone."

465,My Mental Health Journey~ PLEASE READ! THANKYOU!,"I started seeing a therapist for over a year now, and we had been working on some issues.
I used to not be able to LEAVE the house without someone with me, or just to even throw the trash out by myself, even though it was just at the end of the driveway. But we worked on some things, discovered that I have severe PTSD from my childhood, my anxiety is OFF THE CHARTS and apparently I have depression as well. I did talk to a psychiatrist who got me on some medication to balance out my brain.
Fast Forward a year and now I am able to go buy lunch by myself, and even go to my appointments alone! Although Covid has thrown a wrench into all my plans, I did make a new year's resolution to Vlog since that is something I always wanted to do. I have made 6 Vlogs so far and am working on my 7th one this month! 
But if you wouldn’t mind, would you watch my videos and give me some more emotional support to keep going? I want to eventually advocate for better Mental Health and everything to help people around me too, but right now I want to focus on becoming more comfortable with myself and hopefully Vlogging will show me that i'm not as weird as I think I am, and it'll help me overcome any irrational fear/social anxiety I may have. 
I'm usually extremely insecure, but i'm throwing caution to the wind right now, so please let me know if you have any questions about me, about my issues, and any other things I can try to help with! Thank you!!!

I especially don’t want to mention it around a friend whom I love more than I can express who struggles with an ED. How can I help my friends while also taking care of my mental health?"
467,Input? Im feeling very scared rn,"Hi all, Im 29 (mtf) and this is my story.
I've been a straight edge all my life, up until recently in 2018 , I started experimenting with weed and psychedelics. I never mixed the two, and I only did like edibles once, psychedelics once, and smoked weed during 2018.

I found my current partner in 2019 and we both did edibles and smoked a few times. We found someone who had shrooms and decided to try it out, why not? 

My partner had more experience with them, and I obviously haven't ever tried shrooms, but i heard of the great experiences and mind opening opportunities it could open. I decided to try it, why not? 

It was April 2020. The trip was nice at first, the first hour was a pleasant experience, that is, until my partner had to take a phone call, and I was left alone in the room.
Right after that , I was afraid of losing control, I was afraid I would never return and that I would stay this way forever, that I would come out a person I don't wanna be. I had constant panic attacks and really did my best to calm myself down. I was left with anxiety and towards the end, it felt fine, I felt happy . 

I was left a little shocked from the whole thing, and for a while after, I felt empty. My partner reassured me that my brain just used a lot of feel good chemicals and it's why I feel that way. 

Well a month later, I watched Bandersnatch on Netflix. And it freaked me the hell out. I started having a panic attack and it left me messed up.

Days after the attack I had ups and downs, felt anxiety and depression, soon, some intrusive thoughts. I was able to control the thoughts for a while through meditation. And my life seems to have gotten better 2 weeks after.

A week ago, I started having intrusive thoughts again and couldn't really control them. Im constantly dealing with anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts. Its been a month and a half since I've been like this. 

Does it get better? Is this just temporary? I'm going to be trying CBT and Zoloft because it's hard to deal with it RN. 

Has another else been through this? If so, how did it go?"
468,Am I wrong to hate my ex? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?,"TW: SEXUAL ASSAULT, CSA, OCD

So I am 25 F, this was when I was 22 and my ex that time was 27 M. I am pansexual and all of my partners before him had a vagina, never had been with a person who had a penis until him, let's call him B. So I dated him 3 years ago it lasted 8 months. I should've seen the red flags but honestly did not. 

I live in a not-so-developed country being gay is not illegal but most ppl too religious and before marriage sex is very frowned upon. So I was horny he was with me and I was attracted and we were really good friends so we had sex. My friends told me much later when I told them about the details and they said it was wrong. But basically he knew I never had sex with a person who had a penis, he tried to mouthfuck me without permission and I never gave a BJ before hell I had had sex with 2 ppl before and they were my partners at the time. I didnt think much of it. And we started dating that day. And he started changing, he said he cant come and he has blue balls bc he was attracted to a specific race only(not gonna say which). And he started watching porn beside me without asking. I was extremely uncomfy. Bc I am a survivor of CSA but did not tell him. 

I have severe OCD, he had depression. My OCD stems from paranoia that I will be alone forever( and also nasty nasty intrusive thoughts). I thought he would understand. Whenever he didnt get sex he would get angry, so I started to just fake it and try to satisfy him. I was terrified of him getting angry.(abusive parents) So I did whatever he wanted and did not said a thing. Then someday he wanted to break up. I was happy and I flirted away. Bc he said he no longer had feelings for me. Few days later he cried on my shoulder telling me he is suicidal since I 'left'. And I said I am still his friend but he said that I should go have fun and he would be okay but he said that while crying and I was convinced he would commit suicide. He begged me to get back together and I was like ok. I was terrified he would die. Then our sex life was dead. Once he opened porn on his phone while we having sex (doggy) and he put the video on my back. Never asked me.

One day I told my close friend that B and I are both poly and might try opening the relationship, I was happy bc not much poly ppl around. I told B that I told my friend. He got so angry and started yelling that I broke his trust. 

I went and lay on the couch, it was 3 am. He then came next to me and hold our his hand I thought he would hug me. But he turned me around undressed my bottoms and I just froze. I remember thinking if this is the price to pay for him to forgive me it is okay. I remember looking down at ppl from the window and thinking how far away they are and how they cant help me. Then he stopped. And started to talk, he said ""You broke my trust so I raped you."" I remember too clearly that sth inside me broke. Bc until that time I thought he didn't know I didn't wanted. I broke down but he didnt let me get my jeans. And I couldn't call my friends bc he didnt let me get my phone. I couldn't go to police bc they dont take it serious when a non-virgin woman gets r*ped. I don't know how but he convinced me I misunderstood him. I told my highschool friends they were terrified I broke up with B saying I cant get over it and he said ""I thought we fixed that""  Then after a while went on a date with a girl. B asked me to come to his house to hang out. I said no. He called next day yelled at me and said I was a slut and other stuff. I broke down again. He made me convinced that he was the only person who could ever love me. 

We went back together. He knew everything about me even my intrusive thoughts. For anyone who doesn't know they are fucking awful. Imagine trying to not notice you are blinking, like you notice everytime you blink and you actively try not to notice. Which is impossible. Some of my intrusive thoughts were violent some sexual and some about my childhood sexual trauma I told everything to him. My therapist sucked ass that time. He said what B done to me was my fault bc I didnt fight back. I told my friends in college they said same. I told my dad he said same. I told mom she said these things happen to everyone get over it. Basically at last we broke up 2018 end of may. I was still confused about what happened I was blaming myself. 

I talked about this anonymously on the internet and he saw (he apparently remembered my username which I showed him one time for a meme) and he told me to basically fuck off. I cut all ties from everyone made a new group of friends who think I am not at fault. Then found out B was talking behind me to everyone who know me and telling me all sorts of stuff including that I am a p*dophile. (we go to the same department). I didn't say anything about him to anyone except my 2 best friends. He literally told my entire department. In the end ppl laugh it off. But I was scared so much I didnt think ppl would get intrusive thoughts, and that they made me hate myself and I wasnt attracted to children for God's sake. I remembered parts of my trauma relived them. I was part of a internet group for intrusive thoughts and yeah there were some p*dos there. But they were getting help and my thought was if you disnt hurt anyone and get help I dont care. And there I learned actions and thoughts differ. And voila my intrusive thoughts began to fade away. Bc I wasnt obsessed with not to think of them anymore? If that make sense? And now they are 80% gone. And the others doesn't make me hate myself bc I know my brain is just stupid. And then I thought about ppl on the net and get real therapy and yeah left that group 2 months after joining bc didn't fucking trusted p*dos. But please understand that I had no one and that was the only place I thought would accept me. I know I was stupid and naive. I trusted ppl's word. 

Well you guys now know everything. I always thought him as a trash person but tbh I don't know if he knew what he was doing. I dont condone what he has done. But he has problems too, he had an abusive family too. Maybe I am wrong? Bc all I hear from ppl beside me now that he is a waste of space. And I feel like it is only one sided. I don't wanna become someone who hates their exes for no fucking reason. 

TL;DR: My ex abused me and tried to destroy my life but he had a really hard childhood and adulthood, am I wrong for thinking he is the worst? Bc I dont wanna be someone who hates others without a reason. 

And ppl always say that if a person says their ex is crazy/bad or sth is bc they are in the wrong. I dont know. Please ask me any questions you might have."

470,I need help.. 23M,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So since the coronavirus pandemic I've been feeling a bit down but this ''down''ness started peaking some days ago when I realized that I won't be able to enter Uni this year due to me not being able to get my diploma in time (I'm in a specialized secondary school, community college).

I've been jobless for almost 2 years, and I live with my parents. My father can be quite annoying and authoritarian towards me, he likes to give me commands and if I don't obey him he'll call me names but it's not severe, we are working in the yard building stuff and I am working on my courses and basically have to overstress getting a diploma together studying 4 courses, within 3-4 weeks. It's practically a big problem now, and I'm in a lot of trouble. My parents expect me to study in Uni this year and if I can't pull it off, they'll probably kick me out of the house.

That being said, I don't have a driver's license or any of that. My friends have graduated from Uni already, but I don't know if it makes sense to call them friends today since we cut ties many years ago since I felt inferior in their midst having no degree. So I've been not meeting friends for \~2 years. I rarely meet my cousins. All I have is my family, and they're not happy with me. I don't feel loved or appreciated in the house, my father is a perfectionist, it has taken a toll on my mental health. When it comes to cleaning in the house or whatever, it always have to be literally perfect, or he'll complain. The fact he complains renders the whole chore futile and useless. I think I shouldn't have worked around the house, and every time I work, I can't think of anything else than my studies and how I won't be able to pull Uni off.

As you may have guessed, my mind is overactive. I don't know how to cope. 

**Additional thing** I want to mention is that I stopped craving for nicotine ever since the peak hit of feeling down from overstressing. It's very odd. One would think that the craving for nicotine would be there? Even if I use nicotine I can still feel sleepy, it is as if it doesn't have an effect, I really feel asleep while having dry moist tobacco placed inside the lip during nighttime (I have this habit of taking it \~12 hr everyday after waking up) because it supplements the usual 1-2 cups of coffees that I drink. 

Even when I went for a walk today, I couldn't feel anything than being on a low mood. I didn't enjoy my walk. Everything just felt rushed. The sun was still shining, but it felt very different. I had dark thoughts. I didn't derive any pleasure from my walk. 

I don't think there can be a possible recovery from this because even when I'm well-rested after 8 hours of sleep when waking up, I can feel down and think that life is meaningless and that I should just die. It's very dark and I have never thought this way for the past years, which makes me think this could've been caused by COVID-19 and stress, mostly stress though. I also have to get my adrenal glands checked for cortisol, right?

Appreciate any help."
471,Drinking alcohol on seroquel ?,Recently got prescribed seroquel it says no drinking but I want to have a little drink with ny neighbour later. Will I be able to have a couple. I have lots of questions about the medication but not sure where to post.
472,What was your experience going to a psychiatrist for the first time?,I've been psychologists/therapy before but I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist in the next month and want to know what other people's experiences were like.
473,Need help with intrusive thoughts,I've been trying to get help on this everywhere but I don't know where to go. What's going on with me? I'm having trouble with telling the difference on whether it's intrusive thoughts or i genuinely consciously think bad things. These don't come out of nowhere like intrusive thoughts but the thoughts still bother and disgust me. It's like the intrusive thought topics just got stuck in my head and whenever I think something relating to the thoughts they come up. Idk of this is the right place to post this but I'm stressed and worried about it.
474,Exam anxiety,"I'm studying for my boards coming up in around 2 months and I'm overwhelmed. I'm a slow learner and so in my experience I feel like I'm behind my supposed pace to study everything. Whenever I can't answer some questions, I panic and get a shortness of breath and so I take a breather and go back or skip, but then again when I can't answer some more questions, I start to panic again and the cycle repeats until it becomes a frustration and I break down. This cycle makes my progress slower and makes my thoughts worser. How am I supposed to set my mind for this? I keep on laying out schedules to guide me so I don't go blind on my progress but my anxiety is still getting the best of me."
475,SONDERMIND,"DO NOT use Sondermind. I like to research my therapists, choose who I go to, DECIDE MY OWN APPT DATE AND TIME....they just randomly assign it all to you and there is no way to cancel without calling! Ridiculous! They dont have a good selection of therapists, they are all new with little experience or therapists with low ratings when you search their name. I am in Columbus, OH BTW."
476,i hope it’s fine that i post this here since i can’t see a therapist and the person i live with will never ever understand,"hi everyone- i’ve been journaling word vomit, but it doesn’t seem to have the same effect as interacting with actual people, so here goes!

How do you cope with depression/body dysmorphia when it hits you wave after wave every single day? i’ve opened up to my bf about my mental illness and what i deal with throughout the day

He has been great with support and continuously asks how he can help, but i’m not sure he can. i can feel his frustration from not being able to help- while i know his frustration isn’t targeted at ME, i can’t help feeling like an absolute burden despite his constant reassurance that i’m not

I break down and cry in the middle of the day bc it just gets THAT hard. i feel like there’s so much tension between my bf and i, that i don’t even know how to approach him

any feedback would be really helpful, and i’m grateful that you even took the time to read all the way through, i hope you have a wonderful day"
477,"Am I legitimately becoming crazy, or mentally sick?"," I know during the pandemic and being locked up, many people feel uncomfortable. But I feel like I'm actually going crazy. I have a history of OCD for a little over a decade, and am now in my 20s. Even taking meds for it. But I feel I'm becoming strangely impulsive, can't control my feelings and keep my thoughts to myself and just blurt it out to people, which is hurting my relationships with others. Also, the obsessive, intrusive thoughts are branching out and becoming weirder and weirder. There's a general feeling of unwellness, lots of irritation, boredom, frustration, some anger, no motivation, feeling trapped even though I'm not, paranoia about losing friends and irritating family to the extent they'll wanna ignore me, etc. Are these signs of becoming crazy? Thanks."
478,The days all seem to blend together,[removed]
479,i uncontrollably start biting myself when i am in intense anger,i am a 17F. it isn’t just anger. it also happens when i experience extreme sadness or any kind of intense emotional pressure. i just cant control myself. last night i started biting myself because i was extremely angry. my entire arm is bruised from the bites now. i dont understand why i do this but it makes me feel so much better. i can see myself getting addicted to biting myself. but i am afraid it could be a form of self harm
480,"My mind is tormenting me, and I can't take it anymore.","I hope this is the right place for this. I'm sorry if it's not. I have to get this out of my chest, because it hurts. It kinda gets personal, so I hope it won't freak you out. It's also a long read, sorry for that, but I hope you will get to the end. 

I'm 31, male. I suffer from anxiety since the age of 6, had my first panic attack at 10. From 13 to 25, life was pretty good. After that, I had a spike in anxiety and depression. The last five years of my life have been extremely bad, and I feel like this is the culmination of this period. 

I never felt so bad before. I feel like I could lose it from one moment to another. I don't know what to do anymore. It's like my mind is working against me. Here's what's making me feel so bad.

I still live with my parents, because where I'm from if you don't have a partner (double income) there's no way you're going to pay rent and bills. I have a few friends, who both now live far away because, as opposed to me, they actually did something concrete with their lives instead of jumping from one low-paying job to another. So I'm constantly alone, except for rare cases. There's no friends to be made out here, I live in a rural area.

I've been single for 12 years. I haven't had sex in 8 years, because my last ""relationship"" with a girl completely destroyed me. It makes me feel so ashamed. I had chances to have sex over the last few years, but always refused because I didn't like the girls, and because I thought they were always trying to trick me. I can't trust girls anymore, even though I obviously know they're not all the same and that there are amazing women out there. Unless I really like the girl, in my mind they're all trying either to marry you for their own satisfaction, or they're trying to have babies and then forget about you. Or even worse, just wipe your account. I know this isn't true, but this is the mechanism that's triggered in my head (almost) anytime a girl shows interest in me. Which is... extremely rare. Cause everyone can see I am pretty much heartless, a block of ice. And as I said, I live in the countryside, there's just not many girls my age (they're all married). And there's no such thing as Tinder out here.

I don't have a career. I dropped out of high school cause I was bad at it, even though I was extremely good in some subjects, no one ever noticed. I've always worked, but now I'm unemployed, and I'm just helping the family business cause my parents need me. But I have no future plan or career in my mind. Zero. I have passions, but guess what, they won't make you money.

And now... the toughest one. The thing that makes me feel absolutely terrible. I didn't even know if I wanted to write this, cause this truly makes me ashamed. But I have to. To put it simply: there's a lot of girls on Instagram, and some of them look and act like they're way older than they are. I feel attracted to these Asian models (that's what they are, I'm not talking about random girls, it's literally their job) who are like 15-16-17 and look like they're 25. Now, I have NEVER and would NEVER in my life even think about trying to even talk to a girl that age. I'd rather cut my fingers off. But still, I feel attracted to them when I'm alone in my room and looking at my phone, and I feel extremely guilty about it. I feel like a piece of shit. The worst of the worst. I feel like no one would ever forgive me for something like this. 

About three weeks ago, all these thoughts started to torment me on a daily basis. Between the lockdown (I'm from one of the most affected countries in the world), my grandma who suddenly got sick and is now risking to die, all the stress from my situation, and other family problems that happened during the lockdown, I started to feel worse than ever. It's like my mind is plotting to drive me insane. I have terrible thoughts, like I'm a failure because I'm 31 and still at my parent's place, because I have no plan for the future, because no matter how hard I try to create something that makes me happy, it always fails. I can't remember the last time I was happy. And the worst one, the thought that I'm a filthy pervert, because when I'm alone I look at those girls, and look at their damn ""gravure"" movies that you find on YouTube and famous websites everyone knows (like the orange one) and were even on sale on Amazon up until last year. I even downloaded a few a long time ago, and then deleted them cause I felt ashamed, even though they're models and just showing off swimsuits. I feel like I'm unforgivable for this. That the police will raid me and ruin my life for this, even though it's not illegal (but morally not right). I imagine killing myself over this. That the few people around me would abandon me for this. It's the only thing no one ever forgives. Even a drug addict is better than that.

It even got worse two weeks ago, when I called my therapist, seeking for help. I went there, and for whatever reason, before I even started explaining my issues, she started bashing me. Saying that I haven't learned anything in years. That I escape from my problems. She pretty much didn't want me there anymore, I don't know why. It took me off guard. I was furious. That's when it got worse. I lost the only person I could say these things to. I deleted her number, and stopped taking benzodiazepine she gave me so easily (I took it for 7 weeks, a very low dose, about 3mg/s a day (10 drops) and then stopped. I've been on and off for brief periods of time in the last 3 years). I'm paranoid that the fact I stopped taking that med abruptly may have played a role, but the dose was so low and the med so light, that I just stopped cause I didn't want to take this medicine anymore and felt like I didn't need it. Even though, admittedly, now that medicine might help me.

I don't feel like going to another therapist and talk all over again about my life. I'm not sure if a therapist even works for me. I wanted to go somewhere, go on a vacation to relax and reset my mind so to say, but with the whole virus thing going on in the world, it's just not ideal if not impossible. Plus I'd still be alone... so what's the difference.

I'm constantly tormented by my situation and my thoughts. When I'm not helping my family business, I just lay on my bed with ambient music and my headphones on, in darkness. I play videogames at best. I tried to reach out to some friends last weekend, I really wanted to hang out with them, but they were all busy. Of course they are. We are over 30. I wish I was that busy, I wish I could share my life with someone. But I'm just here alone. Outside is busy now, cause there's a lot of tourists, so it's pretty much impossible to go somewhere even alone. And with all these thoughts tormenting me, I stay here. But now it's starting to feel like torture. And I don't have the force to help myself anymore.

I hope one day I will be able to move out of here. Somewhere overseas. Start anew, get rid of this thoughts and of my situation. But making it to the end of the day is so hard right now. I feel like I'm surviving, instead of living. I had to help myself for not crying today at work.

And hat's it. Any suggestion is more than welcome. And if you made it this far, thank you very much for reading. I think I need some help, but don't know who to turn to. And if you think I'm a horrible human being, well... I can't blame you."
481,Rant on nothing,"You know when you can feel a proper breakdown coming? Like physically feel it, cawling under your skin. But you can't afford to let it happen. So you just fight it. 

I feel like sometimes the only way to process information you can't, is to just let it tear you down until there's nothing else it can do. Because I think ignoring it will just make it grow. 

But then at the same time, there's never a good moment. How are you suppose to know when to let something hurt you, before it just does?"

483,What are people's experiences with antidepressants?,I've got an appointment Monday to start the process of diagnosis/medication because I've had all the classic depression symptoms for a long while now. I'm curious as to other's experiences with antidepressants so I can get an idea of what to expect.
484,How do I know if I have real OCD?,"Every time before I go to bed I align all the things on my table perfectly, I touch certain parts of my bed with my leg, usually 8 times, I also drink water in such a way, that I have to swallow it in 8 gulps, I often switch the lights on and off until I'm happy with the way I switched them off, I do the same with closing doors or saying ""good night"" to our guinea pig. Sometimes I think about how easy it is to hurt someone, especially with the power of social media, I could just post one picture of someone, write an ugly message and make their life worse. I also erase a sentence if I make a mistake in it, usually all the way to the last comma or preposition. I could be just playing around with the idea of having OCD, but I wonder if it's going to get any worse."
485,Im losing my mind,"I've always been a pretty tough guy but I've got so much bullshit going on in my head and around me. When i fucked up my relationship with my girlfriend because I'm an idiot, things got been bad. I'm doing my best to repair the damage I've done because we do love each other a ton but when we have fights about our problems, i feel like I'm going mad. I've always had a temper and anger management problems. I've smashed my phone, a chair, a keyboard, the list goes on. To add, my mom was diagnosed with bipolar, anxiety and depression and there's every chance I've got it too since my grandfather and a few aunts and uncles have the same mental illnesses too. I feel like I'm losing my mind and i don't know what to do. I'm so full of anger and frustration and i don't know what to do anymore."

487,Bracelets that help with Inner Space,"I've always been super fascinated by Outer Space. I love how we can collectively come together as a planet to explore, discover and learn more about the Cosmos. In college, I blended my love of art and science into my own jewelry business with handmade solar system bracelets and all space-themed products to help teach people about the Universe. After 3 years of running my business, I learned a lot about entrepreneurship and even more about myself. The stresses and drive to succeed definitely paid a toll on my mental health. A good friend of mine recommended I work on my mindfulness practices, meditate more, and do yoga whenever I can. I read  ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart Tolle to help with my burnout. Chapter 8 really hit me. It was all about Inner Space + Outer Space. Humans are just as complex as the Universe and we are all made of star-stuff. I loved this wave of thought and it inspired me to launch my [Inner Space](https://astronobeads.com/) collection of bracelets. The collection includes: Breathe, Energize, Change, Manifest, and Unplug bracelets. All great reminders to have on your wrist with whatever you are going through. Your Inner Space matters just as much as Outer Space :)  I am excited to continue my spiritual journey and continue creating jewelry that inspires me. For any creatives, business owners, or anyone with similar experiences - what books, podcasts, or activities have helped you?"
488,Why now?,"All was good for months even with a shitty relationship. 
Why does it all go down *now*
The last few days I felt like shit, I even drank some alcohol even though I mostly avoid if I don't want/have to.
This whole lockdown and shit all was good but know it seems like it all catches up, everything I try to ""avoid"" more or less to not always be depressed now comes back to haunt me.
I don't want this to go on, I don't want this confusion and pain
At least not this kind of pain.
I didn't have suicidal thoughts in a long time but I feel them crawling back in my head.

I could have treatment, I could potentially have this all go away with treatment but why do I don't take this chance? Why can I think rationally but act like a moron?

This is nothing more than a cry for help but it won't change anything because maybe 80% of you can't reach me outside of the internet or even know me remotely.

Just ignore this because I'm just one of many with problems and surely don't have problems that can be described as a priority or something 
I don't even know what I want to say with that."
489,Scared for the future. I'm stuck.,"Hi, I am in search for a job and it is rather difficult to find a job. I'm searching for almost a year now. Part of me is really frustrated that I can't find a job that ""suits"" me, but part of me is actually happy about it too. I'm really scared to actually start a job not knowing how it will shape my life. If i'm honest with myself I actually don't want to work at all, but I know that that isn't an option. I know I should take my responsibility, but on the other hand I think this whole system of society is outdated since there aren't actually enough jobs for everyone. Anyway, I don't want this to be a discussion about society or politics. I'm just scared for the uncertainty of the future, how I'm going to have a live that I like living. How am I going to be able to combine everything in my life: work, social life, hobbies, learning things... The fact I can't find a job is probably partly caused by the fact that I bear all these uncertainties in me."
490,Antidepressants make me suicidal,"Backstory: I have bipolar 1, depression, constant anxiety, CPTSD and have horrible nightmares about my trauma and just random terrifying things 

I have tried: lexapro, zoloft, Prozac, celexa, Wellbutrin, Effexor and Trintellix (for a few weeks because I could only use samples, my insurance wouldn’t cover it) and I’m sure others, but I can’t remember at this time. Basically all or most of the SSRIs. No matter what I tried, I felt overwhelmingly depressed and suicidal. I constantly felt a looming sadness and lack of motivation to do anything. Even to take one step or go to the bathroom, I just couldn’t. My body felt heavy with sadness. I became hopeless and stopped the antidepressants but continued my Buspar and Adderall for anxiety and ADD. I stayed very anxious (the antidepressants did help my anxiety immensely though) while buspar did some but not much at all and eventually felt like it did nothing. 

Fast forward: I haven’t been on antidepressants since last summer and am currently on Hydroxazine, seroquel, accutane, and buspar. I have recently been up and down, mad and sad, happy and excited, very irritable and annoyed, and all over the place throughout the day for a few months now. My (new) doctor decided to give me trintellix again (samples) and switch me to Vraylar. 

I started the new medicines last night like she said and within an hour I had suicidal ideation and heightened anxiety. I ended up having a panic attack and throwing up for hours and couldn’t sleep until early morning. I still feel the immense sadness and lack of motivation to live today as I did last night. But logically, I realize there’s no way the medicine could have affected me that soon? It takes weeks so I don’t know if it’s me being afraid and anxious about feeling that way again or me actually feeling that way again. 

Do SSRIs do this to anyone else at all? Am I crazy?"
491,is this normal??,"from an early age, i would give myself hickeys on my arms. not to give myself hickeys, it just made me feel better. i havent done it in a really long time, but i did it the other day and i feel ashamed to tell people that i was sucking on my arm. does anyone else do this? and if you do, why do you do it? it almost feels like a mix of comfort and an alternative to self h*rm."
492,"False Hope leaves me literally forgotten by psychiatrists for 5 months. Its what we all fear, but it actually happened this time. I fucking can't. [TW - blanked]",
493,I am having intrusive thoughts and obsessing over them...,"I had mental health struggles when I was in my sophomore year of high school. I woke up one morning and felt very off. Pretty soon I felt like getting sick when I would go out with friends or try to eat. The first night I tried getting sleep, there were thousands of little voices in my head telling me that I shouldn’t be alive and that offing myself would be appropriate. I didn’t listen to them and struggled with stomach aches and overthinking until my junior year of high school. 
Flash forward to just a few weeks ago. I had become overwhelmed with the loneliness of COVID and different relationship problems I was having. Pretty soon I started to have random intrusive thoughts. They were taboo and violent subjects. It terrifies me because I would never harm myself or others but these thoughts just pop up randomly and I seem to obsess over them. I have no idea what to do. I’m talking to a counselor next Monday but I don’t want her to think I am crazy... any recommendations? (P.S. I have been reading many of your stories and just wanted to say that the world is truly better with all of you in it, much love)."
494,i feel like i have no control in how i act... i don’t know what’s going on,"i’ve[19f] been feeling this way for awhile now. i know i need to seek help, but my parents believe in pulling yourself up from your bootstraps, and i don’t have enough money for therapy myself. i come from a long line of mental illness ranging from OCD, anxiety, depression, BD, and schizophrenia. 

i’m not sure if i’m just making myself think my more negative personality traits are from some mental illness, or if they are actually caused by an underlying issue. 

i often find myself acting out very aggressively when i don’t want to. either physically or verbally. it’s so bad that it’s to the point where i’m afraid to have kids or a spouse when i’m older because i’m worried i will severely hurt them in a fit of rage (or possibly kill them). i often have urges to hit and hurt people, and it’s scary because i refuse to even kill bugs. 

i often just feel like people hate me. like maybe they took double the time they usually would to respond to me. my brain immediately goes to they found out your a bad person and don’t want to be your friend anymore. i constantly feel bad for speaking out, making jokes, etc, and again i usually act out angrily at people for not reacting how i predicted they would even though i’m really just embarrassed that i was so off base on how they would take everything. 

when i was younger i never cried, and recently i cry at every little inconvenience to me. whether it be a critique of my person, appearance, or change of plans. this kind of roots back to my last point of thinking that people really don’t like me. in my head i know it’s not bad and that ppl have lives but i can’t help but break down and cry every time.

i do often have a hard time sleeping because of these thoughts as well... idk what to do, because i think i might need help, but i don’t know where to go. i might also just be completely wrong, and i just have some personality stuff to work on."
495,Anybody else stress clean?,"Wow my anxiety is peaking today. Something made me feel overwhelmed and stressed, and now I feel as though its triggered me into my hyper-focused cleaning mode.  I dont feel like eating, I need to clean everything and reorganize, I can't think of anything else, its so intrusive. I can't relax until it is done.  

Its like my environment has suddenly become unacceptable, cluttered, claustrophobic...   despite the fact that I tidy every day."
496,I(15) can't stand people touching me,"So for the past few years I’ve been getting more and more sensitive to people touching or even getting close to me. It doesn’t matter who the person is. If the person doesn’t tell me or explicitly show me they’re about to touch me and doesn’t ask for consent, I’ll literally flinch away. Some people don’t need to ask permission but I still need them to express they’re about to touch me. For the most part people understand this and they’ll be like “I’m hugging you” or “can I hug you” 

If I don’t flinch away or aggressively push them off me, I’ll freeze up and I can’t move. My old band director used to make jokes about how we knew each other for nearly three years before I would hug her back when she hugged me

My mom and sister (39 and 5-6) don’t respect my boundaries. I’ve been at my aunt’s house since Sunday evening watching my cousin while she works and my mom came to pick me up. She had my sister. My sister ran in and jumped on me, and I threw her off and told her to not touch me. My mom told me to not be so mean to my sister, even though I’ve brought up that I need them to respect my boundaries and I don’t like being touched. She always tells me to get over it.

Then we got in the car. Normally I sit in the front seat but we decided to go to my other aunt’s house so we crowded in my mom’s car with my aunt in the front seat and me in the middle between my cousin and sister. My sister started touching and grabbing me and I swatted her and told her to not touch me. My aunt snapped at me and told me “don’t be a little brat. She’s your sister and she can touch you if she wants. Get over it.”

I nearly started crying. I was trapped between to people and our bodies were pressed against each other and I thought I was going to have a panic attack. Luckily for me though, it was a really short car ride

Anyway, I suck at writing conclusions so ima end this here and talk to my mom about it again when we leave"
497,Found out why i am so different and need help,"I found out why i act so different(possibly), i am 17(M) and i have been struggling for a while trying to think straight as everyone else, i act anxious all the time , it feels horrible, think slow, i am smart but think too slow, can't decide quickly, i get mentally fatigued easily, afraid of Halloween decorations, hard to concentrate, i can get depressed easily, dark triad(all the time), want to do things for attention, dont realize what i am doing, hard to be aware.
      All of this stuff, might be more symptoms, but reason is that i might of inherited something from my dads side, my grandpa from that side had a as they would call it ""special brother "" who died, then he had my dad but my dad was different as well, so i theorize that my grandfather was carrying some sort of inherited genetic disease, from my great grandfather, i seriously could need some help for this, i hate thinking the way i think, the way i act slow, i don't want to be like my dad, i don't want to be known as this "" special"" person,  and i don't mean it in a mean way but this has slowed down progression of my life in to doing my dreams, and i just want some advice or some help to change it as much as possible, it feels horrible not accomplishing things you want to accomplish without these struggles"

499,What to do about my brother with Major Depressive Disorder and/or Bipolar II?,"Hey guys,

First time posting on this subreddit. I'm at a loss as to how to properly help my brother out. He's in his early 20s and has been going through some mental health issues ever since college started.

He started college 3 years ago and had to move far away from home. He's always been this quiet guy, but he had friends in high school despite that. He seemed fine to us. When he started college... that's when things just went horribly. After his first year, he went to the ED and said that he had suicidal ideation. He was placed on a psych hold, after which he was transferred to a psych facility. I think that honestly made him worse. To this day, he doesn't want to talk about his time there. That summer was probably the worst time of my life. We had no idea which facility he was located in, my dad trekked up to where he was living at the time for college (about 8 hours away), and couldn't get any answers because of HIPAA (understandably so). We eventually found out where he was, but he wouldn't talk to us on the phone. At that time, he was diagnosed with Bipolar II. 

After that, my brother was almost mute. He wouldn't talk to us unless absolutely necessary. He gained a lot of weight because he ate a lot. My parents didn't say anything to him because they were afraid they would aggravate him. He has had a lot of anger bursts at them, me, and my other sibling, for no reason. He is ultra-sensitive; the slightest things made and still make him upset. He's dropped a semester, gone back to college, dropped another semester, and has made switches from major to major multiple times. Very indecisive about his future and what he wants to do. He alternates from wanting to go to PA school, to wanting to go to law school, to just giving up and not wanting to do anything at all. He has high hopes and dreams sometimes, but then winds up saying he doesn't care and wants to stay at home. Being diagnosed with Bipolar II, I am assuming that his high hopes and dreams for himself constitute as his manic episodes? Not sure. He doesn't seem to have any other displays of mania. It seems as if he has more depressive symptoms.  

I don't know when this all started. I think college, but it's possible that he was depressed earlier on. My brother has severe eczema. I think that really contributes to his mental health. It's always been a little disfiguring to him. I can't imagine how he feels. Eczema being a chronic disease is harder and tougher to get through than it looks. He is always itching and scratching himself. He was put on Dupixent, which worked well for a little while, but it stopped working and he just stopped taking it cold. At first, we thought his depressive symptoms could be due to the medication's side effects. He doesn't want to take care of himself either, which just puts himself in a cycle of pain. He doesn't want to shower much, doesn't care to moisturize himself like people diagnosed with eczema should, doesn't care to brush his car or shave.

Medication wise, he's been on a few SSRIs. From what I understand though, and what I am confused about, is I thought that mood stabilizers like lithium and valproate were most often used for Bipolar II? I didn't think SSRIs were used, and from what I understand, they can make his manic episodes worse. Each SSRI that he's been on didn't work. We've tried to get him to talk to the physician, and his physician made things worse by saying that he's been on multiple meds already and that there was nothing left for him. My brother stopped trusting doctors. We're trying to get him to see another doctor, but I don't think he wants to or is ready. He thinks they're all the same and will screw him over. I just don't get why he keeps being given SSRIs... is there some disagreement about his diagnosis? Is he depressed, or does he have bipolar disorder?

To make all of this worse, I'm currently not at home with my parents. I go to med school in a different state (started around the time his issues started) and I come to visit when I can. Coming home is nice, but when you have a sibling that's going through these issues, it can be really hard. We all feel like we're walking on eggshells with him. We don't know what'll set him off and get him angry. I feel like I don't know him. We don't know what he likes, what his life is like, what friends he has. He doesn't want to share any of that with us. It's weird though because he has moments where he is happier than normal and talks to us and is lively. He goes from getting upset and really angry to acting as if everything is normal. This often happens throughout the course of a day. 

My poor parents. We're South Asian, so there's a huge mental health disparity there. My parents don't know what to make of this, didn't know really what mental health was until their own son was going through problems. They have a better understanding now, but it's tough to see them just so sad and at a loss. Currently, he's a little better. His anger outbursts are now 2x weekly. He comes out to talk to us more often. But he refuses to talk about finishing school or going to the physician or anything else. The thing is, we don't want him to finish school at all if it's too taxing on him. My parents have told him multiple times that they just want him to get better. We would all love to see some initiative on his part to get better, to go see a therapist, etc. We have been searching far and wide for therapists and psychiatrists, but he refuses to see anyone.

I don't really know what the purpose was behind this post. I guess I was mostly looking for reassurance and some advice. Is there anyone who has been through something similar with a sibling? Any advice on what to do? Any words of hope and encouragement? We're all know how much potential my brother has if he just tried to give himself a fighting chance."
500,What things can my experiences be?,"So, I experience dissociation, memory loss, voices from inside not outside (like thoughts but they are from people who aren't me, not in the same tone, not speaking in the same way I do, etc) and I have no idea what it is. My therapist says she'll look into it more after quarantine but I dunno if she will.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is having dreams which are so realistic and stuff that I am left genuinely believing them the next day. Like, last night I was dreaming about a new Marvel film and I thought it was actually gonna come out soon but I know deep down that it isn't but I also think there will be one? I know the entire plot and stuff as well but it's too long to put on here. 

Cheers if you can help I guess."
501,Can’t recognize myself (15),"I experienced something very odd last night and I’ll do anything to get an outside opinion on it. 

I was picking up my little brothers room when I looked over to a full body mirror hanging up an the wall and realized that I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me.

I didn’t have an opinion on my reflection. I didn’t find it ugly or beautiful or exciting. It felt like I just made eye contact with a stranger at the store. But I couldn’t look away. I didn’t know who I was looking at, I couldn’t make sense of it. I stared at the mirror for a good 20 minutes thinking about how “That isn’t me, who is that?”.

On top of that, I came to the realization that I don’t even know who I am. I don’t know what my personality is or how people view me as a person. I don’t feel my own emotions when I’m alone or in a small group, I just feel what everyone else around me is feeling.

It’s like I’m a vessel, I’m just going through the motions. There’s no intention behind what I do, I just do it. I’m not depressed, or anxious about anything. I just don’t feel anything at all. 

I don’t know who I am and I need advice.

I asked my family for therapy but refuse to give it to me. When I talk about it to my “friends”, they disregard it. I’m so tired of existing like this.
I want to feel human again."
502,I dont know how to help,"TW: suicide

My brother is 17, about to turn 18 in October. 

He told me once “My 18th birthday is when I’m going to do it.” 

My parents aren’t the kind to understand mental health issues and think being sad can be fixed by anything. They say “oh but we give him whatever he wants and he goes out and hangs out with his friends all day and he plays video games all day”

My parents have a tendency to say things that can be offensive, hurtful and rude without knowing it. Or maybe they do. Idfk.

Anyway, my parents aren’t taking this seriously and I’m so frustrated because I don’t know who to talk to or what to do to help him because I’m currently active duty, stationed in California and my brother lives in Wisconsin. So it’s not like I can take him out for a drive and just listen to him. My brother refuses to respond to me when he posts all over Snapchat how he’s not happy. 

It’s honestly getting to the point where I feel the need to call the police on my brother just to make sure he is safe. 

I don’t want to lose my brother but I don’t know what I can do from so far away."

Such as “my anxiety is terrible and getting worse” but they seem fine and act fine i try my best to comfort them but i feel like im loosing time to comfort myself. Some other things they say is about them cutting, I talked to them for hours about how thats harmful and people love them but the next day they said the same thing about cutting. I keep asking myself to leave the friendship but i don’t want them to harm themselves and i hate the thought of friends leaving me if i were to vent."
505,Questions before first psychologist appointment,"Hello! I’m about to have an intake appointment, finally getting a hold of my mental health :) Just one question though!

I’m nervous about being flagged for drug abuse and not being able to get meds that’d help me. I smoke weed daily (I know this sounds fake, but I really can stop when I want. I take regular breaks just to make sure those “I can quit” muscles still work) and I drink heavily ~1 month with friends on weekends (or I did, before covid). Should I tell them this? My friend was all “dude if you tell them this and you break your leg ten years from now, you’ll be on a list and they will give you Tylenol instead of a painkiller”.

I just want to know the correct way to navigate this. Thank you!"
506,Everything feels claustrophobic,"Or at least that’s how I can describe it best.

Everything feels like it’s taunting me and following me. Even this subreddit. The bot that replies to every post makes me not want to read or post anything because I know I’ll see it. 

Mirrors. Mirrors follow me I can’t go anywhere without them being there. I don’t even recognize myself but the girl in the mirror watches me as I walk by. I check my surroundings to make sure no one is behind me even though the mirror shows no other reflection. I can’t stand between two mirrors because I know they can close in on me too. 

Food. I can’t eat it I can’t be near it because what happens when the things holding me hostage are inside me and not outside. My love of baking makes this the worst part. I can’t eat or bake or cook anything. 

My dogs are always in the same room with me. Their hair is on the ground in shedding season and I can’t seem to get away from it even when I wear shoes in the shoes. I wash my feet and sweep the floors and try to stay away but it’s always there. 

What is this? Everything seems to be closing in on me. I can’t recognize myself and I don’t have my own personality. I’m not even a person. Every day I sit home alone all I do is cook and watch tv and bake and look at my phone and eat and watch tv. I don’t know what’s happening with me. I don’t know what this means."

508,Are my abandonment issues caused by my father?,"I've dealt with mental health issues my whole life but have never consistently been in therapy due to it not feeling like it was helping me and also my parents not fully supporting/understanding it.

I've always had a complex relationship with my dad. He's great and funny sometimes but he's never been there for me. He never offers to do things with me. He rarely has meaningful conversations with me. He often prefers to watch TV than spend time with me. He's not a mean person. Me and my mum have always tried to talk to him about how I feel he's not there for me and his excuse is that we don't have anything in common. But I want to make the effort, and I do. But he often never reciprocates so I'm left in the same cycle. 

He often lashes out at me when I talk about my MH as well because he doesn't understand it. When I dropped out of college due to my anxiety and depression he would always get angry and seemed like he wanted me to just get over with it. I always thought it was because he cared about me but I'm starting to think it was because it was putting more stress on his life and he didn't want that. 

My mother has been loving and supporting most of the way. The complete opposite.

To get to the point, I've been looking into abandonment issues because I always find that I have lots of issues with friendships and relationships. And from everything it seems like I fit the box. I don't want to self diagnose but it gives me relief to put a name to it and not have it as this mysterious feeling i've been battling for the past 5 or so years of my life. 

So the question is, is it possible that my issues are caused by my dads emotional unavailability? I like getting to the bottom of things and having a reason for why things happen so any answers would greatly help my conscience."

510,Single and lost,"Hello. I’ve been out of a long term relationship for about a month now and I find myself lacking completely in motivation. I’ve recently moved to a new area for a job and I don’t have any friends here. My ex and I would take the 1 hour commute to visit each other weekly. Since we’ve broken up, I’ve spent most of my days laying in bed playing video games and watching tv; all while crying and being sad about my situation. 

What do I do?

I ask myself this everyday and my answer to everything is “I don’t know.” I’ve been miserable and depressed and gaining weight like a mofo. I hate doing things alone. It’s just not the same. 

I can’t meet friends through work because it’s all online and I am unable to meet people at bars and breweries like I used to, all due to COVID."

512,Anxiety makes me unworthy of love,"

For the past year I’ve been on an upward spiral in my confidence, overcoming many self-esteem and social anxiety issues to the point where I could just be myself and even recently started talking to women through dating apps. Lately though, I’ve been getting a lot of moments of anxiety that make me feel so weak and ashamed of myself. For example,
I started a job this week after being unemployed for a year and today when my boss called to ask what I’ve done my mind literally went blank even though I’d done some much today. Also, the other day one of the girls I’m talking to on a dating app asked if she could call me and I got so anxious because I’ve never gotten to this point with any girl in my life. It’s not so much the initial nerves that I’m worried about because I’ve faced many fears in the past (I consider myself a great public speaker), it’s the shame I feel for having the moments of intense anxiety that just make me feel so incompetent and unattractive. I’ve been hitting it off with a girl online but sometimes I take so long to reply due to how unattractive and unworthy I feel for feeling this way. When I’m in a calm state of self-acceptance, which I have been for the most part of the past few months, everything just goes so smoothly in every area of my life. I don’t think it’s an issue of thinking low of myself in general because when I’m
not in this state I’m as confident as can get but when I do get these moments of anxiety I just feel so low, unattractive, undesirable, incompetent, you name it. To be honest, just the fact that I’m posting this on here makes me feel bad.

TL/DR; I overcame major self-esteem and anxiety issues. Finally got a job and decided to try dating, suddenly anxiety is back and I feel so ashamed and unworthy because of it."
513,To go to old therapist or not?,"Hi guys! I went to therapy on a weekly basis last year and my therapist was amazing. She truly changed my life for the better and I was really happy I went out of my way to work to have the funds to take myself to therapy. However, I had to move to college which meant I couldn’t see her. Coming back due to the pandemic, I find myself spiraling out again due to .. well external news and the fact that i’m at home in a non stable  routine along with the fact that physics as a summer class is needless to say REALLY taking its toll on me. I thought I could handle it, and I did for the first few months of the pandemic but I caught myself falling into an episode a few days ago and it just fucking sucks. I need to remember that progress isn’t linear BUT I reached out to the therapy place again and they said she got her masters so the price increased (i originally paid 55 but now each session is 85). this definitely discouraged me but i mentioned how i was struggling to work and a college student and they reached out to my therapist and she told them to charge me the original price again. (‘: However, 55 per session is still a lot for me considering I can’t work. I get free counseling sessions from my school, but the last time I went the therapist was just not my vibe and I never went back. I’m having a dilemma because I can’t help but feel like a financial burden to my parents (i’m moving out back to school and it’s pricey) but at the same time I always preach to others mental health is important and even if there is a price tag it’s worth it in the long run. I don’t know if I should go to my schools therapy for free and start the process all over, (probably with another therapist) or just pay the $55 for my former one? Thoughts? Sorry i digressed so much. So many thoughts :("
514,Is it normal to have “tics” when anxious,"Usually before I have a panic attack or just when Im really stressed out in general I have “tics” that kind of help me calm down. Im not 100% sure Im right in calling them tics but it feels like how people describe them. Like an intense urge or trying to hold in a cough, doesn’t feel like Im the one controlling it. I usually snap and then do this flingy wrist thing, i also click my teeth together a bunch in a row really fast. When i was younger I had one where I would point my fingers into like a cone and hit my sternum(so glad that ones gone, ouchy) I have generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and depression(ofc). Ive been on medication for four years. I never brought the tics up to my doctor and I dont know if its important to? Anyone else experience this? I dont EVER tic unless im very anxious"
515,Depression isn’t an aesthetic,"
I can get so frustrated by (some of the) “recovery” accounts on instagram. Sure l, I wanna help break the stigma, but it shouldn’t be romanticized. Depression isn’t cute sadness. Or crying pretty tears. Or the cool black aesthetic (which is a gigantic stereotype btw). My depression is the ugliest, most horrific thing I’ve ever faced. And, like many other mental illnesses, it can be very competitive. So if you put photos of your hospital intake on Instagram, I’ll feel like my depression is faked because I never had to be hospitalized. When you post about your recent suicide attempt, I’ll feel like my depression isn’t bad enough cause I never really tried that. 

Please stop making it a battle between  different people with different depressions. Cause fighting depression is enough of a battle already."

517,In love with the same girl since I was 15: am I crazy?,"That's the thought that makes the most sense to me right now.

I knew her in high school fifteen years ago, maybe I wasn't in love with her but I always liked her more than any other girl. And I haven't really talked to her until the summer between the fourth and fifth year. 

In those months I fell in love with her, confessed and got rejected. Two months later she gets together with my best friend and we stop talking. 

High school ends and I don't see her until 2012, some months after me and my best friend reconcile. 
I see her but rarely and only with my best friend and our other friends. 

In summer of 2013 I start to get the feeling that I like her again, but I don't say anything to anyone. Later that year she breaks up with my friend but I continue to hang out with her and the others.

After a few months something clicks and we start to spend a lot of time alone in my car, literally hours, just talking. I ask her out in March (2014), we go out but when a few days later I ask her out again, she blabs some blatant excuses and refuses. We continue to spend our ""car"" time together, but I see her way more interested in her ex and I give up, and fade out of her life from August '14 until March '15, when she invites me to her university graduation. 

I accept, realize that I have no more feelings for her and from that point on we have a great close friendship, I get interested in some other girls but never happens anything with them.

Ten days ago, a friend asks her out, and from that point on my life plunged into darkness. Everytime she mentions anything about dating him my heart aches, and I'm jealous of the chance he has, that she never gave me.

Rationally I know I have zero chances with her, that by now I'm only a friend for her, that life can still be great without me getting her etc etc, but I am still in love with her.

I am in a dark place right now, I'm living my worst nightmare (me being again in love with her, which is something I never wanted to feel again), but my thought is that I must be crazy to still have this feelings over a decade after confessing to her.
Everyone else would have moved on and found plenty of other girls, instead I still would do anything to get her.

Something must be wrong with me."
518,What the fuck is wrong with me?,"I’ve realized recently I’ve got trauma for sure but can’t start trauma therapy cuz of COVID. I take cbt but can’t do shit there, or won’t, I don’t fucking know.

I’ve got mild depression mild anxiety and adhd symptoms

For like my entire life now, there’s things where I just don’t do work, things like daily chores, or school work, or well anything. Even cbt tasks. Everything I want to do and am supposed to do in it, I can’t even pick up to start working and when I do, I just can’t, I can’t focus, I stress, I dread, I subconsciously pull myself away to do random things that just randomly popped into my mind. I procrastinate. And then I slip past it and forget. I have every intention to do it, but won’t or can’t. It’s ridiculously hard to start, and keeps getting harder to continue as I work, to work.

Here’s the problem,I found out I had adhd symptoms and started taking meds hoping to see if this could fix it, if it could help me get past that wall and infinite runway I have when starting and doing work. Well I just got taken off meds because it didn’t work. 

Doctor says it’s probably behavioural issues with anxiety. But well I’ve been trying to work on this at cbt but can’t or won’t. I don’t even know. My Therapist keeps giving me stuff to do. I know I want to do it, she says she needs me to do it myself, which I want to try, I absolutely want to, but fucking how? It’s stupid. Everyone and myself is just saying I’m lazy, which yeah i am, but my gut is saying this is something bigger, but I don’t know if that’s just me trying to justify this shitty procrastinating habit of mine or a genuine issue.

Honestly at this point I hope it’s an undiagnosed issue because if I manage to diagnose it then I finally have a step forward, then I’ll finally have hope. But nope, had it, but wasn’t it.

Back at square fucking one. I’m never gonna fix this now huh? I’m gonna fail getting into the uni program I want and I’m never going to be able to be a functioning adult because I’ll refuse to work even if I actually manage to get a job I like. I’m never gonna be able to do what I want or what I dream of. I swear I’m not suicidal again but at this rate, if I don’t fix it this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if I relapsed again next year.

I just wanna be able to work. I want to be able to work until I faint from overworking. To be able to give it my all. Like a normal human being, but no, here my starving ass is trying to sleep at 5pm because he wants to run from his stupid ass problems that will be fixed if he just sits up, and starts learning shit online like he wants to."

I don't really understand why, and I feel like I'm supposed to be sad all the time to go to therapy. Like I'm not allowed to be excited to talk about things that happened during the week. I feel like an idiot when I tell someone I'm looking forward to just sitting and having a conversation with someone that I've only ever met via video chat and phone calls."
524,Emotional distress,"I sometimes feel like crying, and I want to, but I just cant. I have been in therapy ever since I was 12, I am 20 now, my parents are divorced and have been for 7 years. Between then and now I have developed an Anxiety disorder, which I was in Treatment for in a Clinic for 6 months. I now have that under control. When they divorced I was 13, we moved to Europe and my father stayed in the US. I yearn for the past, because the future is too imminent. I also have Narcassistic Traits, which cloud my judgment sometimes. I feel like my emotions are at a Constant state of distance from my own self and being. I havent had a solid relationship, because of the disruption of my emotional development. I dont lack social skills, I have plenty of friends and get invited enough, sometimes more than I want or need. I feel like I am scared to commit. My relationship with my mom is not good, we fight often, and I lack empathy towards her. I want to feel guilt and empathic when she starts crying, but I feel like I cant. She says I lack empathy in General. I dont know, I can cry during some movies, but over a person feels difficult. And I know that if she does get sick, that it will be partially my fault, she has said this to me, but even before I knew it is true. I am angry that I cant cause her less stress, and seem to push and oust all that to the side. For some reason I sometimes look forward to sadness, and to that moment where people point fingers towards me when she gets sick. I dont want her to get sick and I do love her alot though, and its important to me how she feels and how she is doing. But our relationship hasnt been based on feelings, since I do not feel comfortable sharing mine with her. One could describe it as cold, from my perspective. My father and I arent that close either, I would describe the Relationship as the same, except that we dont fight often, 1. because he lives far away 2. because I feel more respect towards him. I dont have suicidal thoughts, but when things get bad, it calms me to think that in death there is no bother. I am not suicidal. That was actually one of my anxieties growing up, thinking that I am. I Think that it crosses my mind as such because of need of attention, I never say it out loud though. As I am typing this I am scared that you will title me as such. Usually I am happy, and I think I do have a Good life, but I dont have any aspirations. I just finished school, and it is sad to see everyone leave. A good relationship, is what Im missing and I hope that is what can balance my emotions. Its not the problem of look skills as I have had turned down a few in the past, but a problem of commitment I think, any tips? UPDATE: I seem to have more bad luck in love than i thought. Recently I came into closer contact with a friend of mine. We stayed up multiple nights writing eachother, and sending voice messages, laughing so hard we couldnt breathe. She was even angry when i said that her best friend distracted me because she had also texted me at the same time. This plus many other indicators where I even asked my boys if this is finally the time for me to gain at least some stability. Each of them said that it was a 8/10 chance. All that just to find out that she has a boyfriend. The person before her was a Sociopath, who also manipulted me, and screwed me. And now her? Im slowly starting to give up. With no aspirations in life, and the law cutting down on my hobby (graffiti) this would have been the highlight and the reason to keep my head up. But once again, no. Im starting to give up, please help-I dont know what to do. I feel empty. Im literally the meme ""funny guy at school and depressed at home."" I feel like thats all Im good for, to be laughed at, and other than that a no good. Im not suicidal, but sometimes I thiink about how many people would actually care, besides my family."
525,For the good of my health I need to get over my ex but i have no clue how.,"Together for 4 yeards. We broke up 6 months ago, I think about her almost constantly and have fallen into a deep dark depression over it, I miss her very much and still have feelings for her and she's entirely moved on. The feeling of sadness and frustration and a certain feeling of 'betrayal' is too much to bear and I have not been able to move past it. I lay in bed all day, I can't go to sleep at night causing me to fall asleep at like 5AM out of exaustion, then i sleep in til 12-2PM and feel like shit all day. I am truly truly miserable and i cannot bear to feel like this anymore. I NEED to move past this but im stuck, any advice would be appreciated"

529,My two Me's and their war against each other.,"Hello people of Reddit! My name is JJ
And ive been living with depressions and social anxiety as well as a ""anxiety of dissapointing people""
My question is:
I work a normal 9 to 5 job at a electronics company we are allowed to listen to music wich i do most of the time wich leaves me to me and my thoughts
 I am an extreme overthinker but heres my problem everytime i start to think about something for example: should i call her (a love intrest /friend) and talk to her to just hang out and chill? One side then goes ""yeah great idea this will strenghten our bond and itll be so mutch fun and healthy!"" Directly after the other side goes ""no dont call her she hates you shes angry she doesnt like you give it up youre creepy""  this goes with everything simple things like shouldni ask coworker x/y where i find this my brain goes ""yeah well never find it alone!"" And the other half: ""no he ll scream at you because you asked a dumb question!!!"" Ive been like this for awhile and yess its actualy like 2 mes are talking to eachother fighting i feel like the mean /depressed side shows more but the happy side shows stronger 

Anyways if anybody knows what this... hmm i guess disorder is or whats wrong with me let me know!

Also sorry for my bad english im no native speaker!

Im gonna go sleep know so thanks for your awnsers in advance!"
530,I am stressed out as hell about this.,"So let me give you a bit of backstory. I live in South Africa and am currently in my final year of school. So about 2 weeks ago, my friend tested positive for Covid-19 and I had to go into quarantine. I absolutely hated it. I reverted back to watching porn, was not enjoying online lessons at all and really struggling with being alone in my room the majority of the time. When it came time for me to go to school, I was ecstatic. As hard as it is to believe, I really enjoy going to school, being in a new environment and being around my friends. I was starting to feel happy again.

But now, I was barely in contact with another person who has contracted the virus and I fear that I will be told to stay at home for another 2 weeks, which I don't think I will be able to handle. I barely made it through the first time in quarantine and I am extremely fearing the worst. With my history of anxiety and depression, I fear that this potentially devastating news will be the end of me. If anyone could offer any advice on how to calm myself down, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading."
531,Chest hurts even when I'm not having an anxiety attack?,"Is it normal for your chest to continue feeling tight even the days after a mental breakdown? I can barely breathe and it hurts to even try and talk. It just feels like so much was taken out of my body. I had 2 mental breakdowns hours apart last night and my husband wants me to get seen just in case something else is going on. I don't think i have a heart condition, i feel like it's just all a part of my anxiety. Though I am not feeling anxious, my chest hurts and it feels tight."
532,"I just want to tell someone everathing that has been going on, so I am doing it here","Hey... I am 15 (f) now and I have had a few really rough weeks lately and I feel like it may help me to just write everything down and share it with somebody, even if this person is just an internet stranger. I am sorry if this is going to be a long, unorganized post and if this isn't the right place for it. 

I had trouble with my family as long as I can remember. My two earliest memories are getting screamed at by my mom, because I defended myself against my sister who was hitting me (she told me she never wanted to see me again... I was 4) and getting yelled at becuase I fell of a swing and couldn't breathe properly. My mom did and said some pretty terrible stuff over the years: that she wished I wasn't her child (I had had a migraine and asked her poitely to be a bit more quiet), that all of my mental health problems are just in my head, she forced me to do things that made me so uncomfortable or hurt me so much I started to cry etc. I basically grew up learning to hate myself and that I am wothless and... well I do hate myself very much. 

I shoud maybe mention that I have basically a constant headache. Constant as in every second, every day, for two years. It can get very bad, so that I neary pass out from the pain and it gets worse if it is to bright or noisy. Sadly, my family thinks I am just exaggeratin and likes to anoy me by screaming or banging dishes, what is incredibly painful.

I have also got this kind of phobia of getting touches or being close to people. My family, especialy my sister also doesn't respect that. She once chased me, trying to hug me, until I broke down crying and hyperventilating. This phobia is probaby pretty bad. I can't hug people, stand in lines or crowds, visit big cities, use public transportation...

The ony thing that is somehoe keeping me going is music. I love music, I play the viola and piano and even if think I am pretty bad, I still love it. My relationship (if you can call it that) with music is still pretty messed up. My mom used to yell at me if I made mistakes while practicing, she told me what I played was no music, threathened my to take away my instrument if I didn't practice. As I started playing with 4 years this has left some scars and I can't play for people anymore and am very paranoid that someone could hear me.

In the last weeks, I had just more and more thoughts about killing myself or hurting myself and that I am just a wortless piece of shit and I just can't do this anymore. I had this thoughts as long as I can remember, the first time as I was six. Everyday is just pain and fear and humilation. I don't see a reason to stay alive. I don't pan on acting on those thoughts though... because I think I a unworty and not bad enough to kill myself. I know I should probably see a therapist, but there are people who need it more than me. Not that it would matter as my mom forbid me to see a therapist. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of acting ike I am fine and happy and like everything is ok, but I can't tell anyone. I don't know what I should do know, so advice is apreciated.

I am sorry if this got to long and tiring, but thank you for reading that much."
533,Any idea what this is?,"Does anyone experience this? 

I am just walking around and trying to get trough the day. Then suddenly my body goes numb, headache, I lose my balance, my whole sight goes blank (either see completely white or black, most of the time white) and when my sight comes back I feel like a bag of potatoes, my limbs feel very heavy.. It takes a few seconds and then I am kinda back to normal.. But it just feels so weird.

I've had this for a while now (maybe 1-1,5 maybe 2 years? As far as I can remember tho)

But why I am asking today is, I lost it almost completely today.. The difference today with other times was that I almost lost conciousness, I felt like I was in a dream and almost lost my senses.. 

How this happened? I was just walking up the stairs and came across my brother, suddenly my head feels very heavy and fell backwards, me holding on to the stairrails (idk if that's a word) and barely keeping myself from falling.. Then I started to wonder off, I felt like I was in a dream, from when I got out of bed a few minutes ago until walking up the stairs, it didn't feel real.. And then my brother suddenly said ""wtf is wrong with you?"" Which got me back to my senses

Any idea what this is? Sorry if this doesn't have anything to do with mental health, but I thought it maybe did.. Also, idk if this is allowed here, so feel free to delete it if needed, thank you very much in advance!"
534,Please help,"I’m not asking someone to diagnose me but I really need help. I don’t have access to health care currently due to location I am at and it’s not really extreme so I need advice.

I’m starting to stress a lot, example I stress about things that hasn’t happened yet. 
I don’t know if it’s a control factor or what, eg If my mother talks to different I think about it and there is this heaviness in my heart and I think she is against me and I’m for myself. 
My fiancé whom I love so much, if he talks to rude one time I just think he is against me and I’m just for myself.

My back ground, I’m 23 year old, educated and getting married soon, life is good, my parents financially take care of me, I live with them and in our culture it’s very normal we live with our parents until we get married again it’s my choice, the day I wanna move ILL MOVE. I’ve been in pretty much horrible relationships, cheated on, been used again and again and realized how wrong those things were until I meet my fiancé, he is the best thing that ever happened to me, any fear or issues I have I talk to him and he knows I’m extremely sensitive and when I am like that he tries to talk to me and make me explain myself so he can fix it. 
We are getting married soon and I’m really scared one day he will have enough, he is the kind who likes to take one day at a time, don’t keep grudges and usually doesn’t let little things bother him. 
He told me numerous times that his family have history of diabetes and stress will cause him to get it so I need to relax and not stress about little things and learn to let go. I’m trying I really am but then the moment something happens I just get this heaviness in my heart and just love side goes away and I start to think of him as my enemy “as he describes it” and it’s true tho, I start to hate him and think everything he did is wrong. 
It’s not just with him it’s with my mother as well,
I tend to think that. My parents don’t have a healthy marriage They stuck it out for kids, my dad wasn’t the best to my mother not physically abusive or anything just cheating and all that stuff, favouring his mother over her and I’ve seen these things when I was young. Now my dad is very different in a better way, he has always been amazing dad to us tho but the issue was their marriage. So I told myself I will never stay if I’m not happy I won’t waste my life. 
I don’t know if it stems from this issue or what but it’s getting to me, i constantly worry about this or that I want things to be perfect, when things are perfect and little thing happen like oh my mum is sad my heart worries. 

I need to get rid of this I don’t know how, I want to enjoy the moment without having to worry or care about little things."
535,unhappy with life,"I have so much going for me and I can recognize that. A lot of things in my life are handed to me and I have a lot of privilege when it comes to the things I like to do. But for some reason, nothing is the same. Nothing is the way I remember it feeling and shitty old habits I used to have are coming back. My life is in a loop and I want to go my own way rather than a cycle. My boyfriend made a good point that I look too much at the negatives in life and that my perspective, to put it bluntly, is shit. I don't even know where to start to gain back my old optimism and how to create my own path. I don't even feel in control of myself anymore. Everything is predestined and I have no say whatsoever in what I do. Like watching a movie play out in front of me. Basically what I'm hoping for is just some tips on what I can do to feel normal again, aside from seek help from a doctor cause that won't be able to work out right now."
536,"Jealousy, Anxiety and fear of being alone","This is my first ever reddit post and honestly it’s probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to write in my life. I mean I know you’re just a bunch of strangers (good or bad), but this is just my way of trying to understand myself I guess. I’m an international student at the university of Miami in engineering and business law. I had to leave the US and my girlfriend (we’ll get to that in a second as well) in May and have been in my country for 2 months now. I’ve been getting the feeling of extreme anxiety for about 4 months now. It started off in my apartment back in Miami. It felt like I was being chased slowly at first and I would hide from my own thoughts by playing Call of Duty for literally about 12 hours a day. Hell I even reached top 300 in kills in warzone for a week lmao. I don’t know where it came from it could be from school or my relationship or even from just not knowing what I’m doing with my life. Ever since I came back it’s been much worse I’ve been hiding for so long until it reached a point where when I would wake up I can’t breathe. I am not eating at all and I’m in a long distance relationship that’s not helping. I’m not one to hate on people who commit suicide, but I always used to say that it’s a weak and selfish to the people that love you, however I thought to myself if I was in my own situation for multiple years would I be able to pull through? I honestly don’t think so.

As I’m writing this I am about to break up with my girlfriend, because I can’t take it anymore. I’m taking a gap semester or year to try and find something I’m passionate about. I’m just so scared that even when I do the things that seem to be the way out it’ll stay this way. 

I met this girl who’s a common friend with my best friend and she’s this very free spirited girl who just wants to have fun. And as per my last 2 relationships (that lasted year and 6 months respectively) I’m beginning to develop a “minor crush” As soon as I’m out of a relationship (like legit a few days after). It’s so weird to me why. I know I don’t like her, although I am one that loves to study people and really understand them, so maybe it’s that. I just don’t know if it’s a fear of being alone or if it’s just normal, but I know it’s so dangerous because I find myself getting jealous when she does anything. It’s such a pain in my chest and I know it’s wrong but idk how to get rid of it. We did do some things I won’t go into detail but nothing major. It got me on a hook and I know for a fact as she told me that she’s the type of girl that exploits that and leads on for the kick of it.

So yeah... I’m a messed up guy. I am so fun to be around usually, but recently I and my best friends have noticed that I’m so much more tired and not down to do anything and I’m just always in such a dark vibe that it’s literally feeding off me and I don’t know how to get out of it. I feel like I’m losing my mind and I don’t know what to do. I’m not asking for advice and I’m venting, but writing this hoping someone can see and tell me that this is normal or they’ve experienced it as well. I’m currently just distracting myself and running away and I want to break free of this cycle of depression and anxiety. As well as also learn why I have these attachment and jealousy problems. 

Therapist maybe? I don’t know.."
537,A very strange occurrence.,"So first of al a bit of a introduction. My name is mosby and im 20 years old. Life was rough but am now in a semi stable situation. I still live with my mom (will move out this year) and she is the one thing that is unstable in my life, sha can be very agresive. Also we have a dog that i absolutely adore, and i am not afraid of dogs.
Alright thats out of the way.
So yesterday i was having a very chill conversation with my mother. I felt great about the day and suddenly our dog bits at a fly that passes her. And suddenly a shock of absolute terror rushes through me. I felt i was about to die. And i looked at the dog for 15 seconds and was not able to look away. I was snaped out of it by my mom asking if i was alright but i was in shock for about a hour longer. I never have this. The dog barks sometimes and im fine. Nothing triggered me ever like this.
I thought it might just be a one of thing and it would just be nothing but i haven't felt the same after. I feel empty and like im not myself.

Question is. Wtf is going on with me?"
538,My mental health is deteriorating and I have began to develop extreme mood swings.,"Hi there. Im having a hard time dealing with my day to day mental health. Last year I was dealing with chronic back pain that resulted in me having to have surgery. This surgery was back in January. I was out of work on medical leave for almost 2 months and as soon as I came back nearing the end of February. I had struggled with suicidal thoughts caused by my pain and saw the light at the end of the tunnel being my surgery. ‘ I did it’ I thought constantly. I was happy that I had made it back to being healthy and able to experience life again. 

Lo and behold this virus came. I had just got back to work in and immediately after 3 weeks I went back to being home all day just like I had to for my recovery. Long story short during my time in doors I became excessively nihilistic, bitter, and aggressive. I would also like to disclose that this is all mental I dont think I could physically project this on someone unless it was self defense. Regardless of that matter Ive noticed in my day to day im becoming more and more reluctant to check myself; I feel as though I will continue to experience this and somehow it makes me feel alive. 

After suffering a tough bout of depression its helping me come to terms with being present. I dont think its healthy though. Less and less am i beginning to think about the consequences of the things i say and less of the cause and effect of irrational decision making.

I know therapy is what I should do. But i dont know if i should look into support groups, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. Im not sure where to begin. Ive had a generally tough life and struggled with my mental health when i was younger. I always knew i harbored deep anger but this is as far and as poisonous as it has ever been on my wellbeing."
539,Anyone else feel like their problems are irrelevant? Or yours dont matter? Or maybe your just being over dramatic? Or maybe Your just rlly selfish?,Cuz I do...
540,"I have a deadline, but I don't know how to get myself to make art again.","It feels like this is the only place I can ask for help without causing a ruckus.

I'm (f24) currently enrolled in an art fellowship, and we're now at the last stage of it, where the work produced is going to be exhibited. Where I come from, this fellowship is something super prestigious (I still don't know how I got accepted). I have a mid-critique coming up on Monday (we've started two weeks ago), and I have nothing. The entirety of the  program was a huge struggle for me, but I've always managed to make something, mostly things of my interest, and talk about it. Now, just thinking about the work brings me so much fear of people's expectation, that I end up overthinking and just living in my head. 

I've always been like this, even in school; overthinking things that I just end up not doing the work itself. But it's gotten consistently worse, and now the idea of being in a prestigious program, being considered as someone with enough to be in this program, has made the process of making art just... not great. (there's so much more to this mess, but I'm trying to summarize and keep it short)

So now I have an upcoming mid-critique and I don't know how to deal with it. I want to finish this without giving people trouble, and without worrying my mum. Everyone irl is too busy and too mentally occupied with their own problems that I just stopped speaking to them about this. It also feels like they don't understand and they can only just listen.

Any response is appreciated really. Thanks."
541,Relapse after 107 days clean,"I found boyfriend cheated on me with a mutual friend a few months ago, I didn’t handle it well and relapsed into self harm after 107 days clean. I feel disappointed in myself and don’t know how to cope"
542,What’s wrong with me?,"There will be a tltr at the bottom of this post. 
I’m a 22 year old male who has been born and raised in a rural area. My entire life I’ve been told to be tough and to never cry. Men don’t cry. As soon as I could talk I was classified as a man. Anyways, my sophomore year of highschool my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. ( Shes alive and well and we have since changed our lifestyle as a family.) That kinda broke me. I was completely numbed our the entire duration of the cancer treatments because all I could think of were the words that were burnt into my brain “You have to be tough, you’re a man.” Since my older two siblings were away in college and my dad was at work I would take care of her. After chemo I’d give her foot rubs and try to take care of her as best as I could. I’ll never forget how such she was, just the look on her face. It drained her. I never cried, not once. I didn’t feel anything. Fast forward to present day. Three months ago my girlfriend of two years cheated on me and gave me an STI. ( unfortunately, that’s how I found out she cheated on me) I live in a small town. I didn’t say anything about it to anyone because if you tell one person, everyone knows. She decided that she didn’t want to hold herself accountable for her actions and tried to shift the blame to me stating that I was the one that cheated, even though one of the girlfriends of the guys that she slept with came forward to fill me in. This time I felt broken, I felt a horrible feeling in my gut, but I couldn’t cry. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t do it. Then I went numb. I didn’t feel anything again. It’s like my ability to feel sad completely shut down. What’s wrong with me? Even thinking about it now I don’t feel anything. I still can laugh and feel happiness and I’m very empathetic towards others. I can feel sad for other people but I can’t for myself. Is this something to be worried about or is it just a way of coping? Thank you! 


TLTR : Some traumatic stuff happened and I can’t feel sad about it and I haven’t cried in over 8 years. I have been told to be tough my entire life and that men don’t cry. I can still feel sadness for others but not for myself. Is this something to worry about?"
543,New project... bipolarpulse.com,"Just wanted to see this communities thoughts on a project a group of those affected by Bipolar have launched.

TLDR is basically we want to give weekly research summaries on peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic of Bipolar disorder in an easy digest way. We will be doing around 2-3 a week to start. Check out the overview...

About [bipolarpulse.com](https://www.bipolarpulse.com/)

First and foremost, we are not doctors. Never disregard medical advice, stop treatment, change treatment or delay seeking treatment based on anything you see here or read anywhere on the internet for that matter. You and your doctor need to make those decisions together.

Whilst we wish to remain anonymous at the moment due to unforeseen consequences of being publicly diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder we are more than happy to share why we created this site and what we hope to achieve.

In a nutshell, BipolarPulse was born out of a desire to provide those affected by Bipolar disorder a platform where they could find a range of the latest research on the topic, provided in a non-opinionated, easy to digest, fact centric way. Doing so, we aim to empower those affected by the disorder to have more constructive and educated discussions with their medical professionals, family and wider social circles ultimately leading to better health outcomes for each individual.

As the idea grew we quickly realised that BipolarPulse could become much more than just a feed of summarised peer-reviewed journal articles. We will broaden our reach to include FAQ’s, access to global helplines and many more supportive and informative resources. We want it to become a hub of information for anyone that needs it. Whether that be a mother of a newly diagnosed teen, a husband whose wife is battling the disorder or even if you the reader want to become more educated on your diagnosis.

When it comes to deciding what research is up to our standard, we have one major criterion and that is the reputation of the journal in which it was published. We only post and discuss research from the top 100 psychiatric research publications in the world. The SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank is a publicly available portal that includes the journals and country scientific indicators developed from the information contained in the Scopus database. In short, the SCImago Journal Rank indicator is a measure of a journal’s impact, influence or prestige. It expresses the average number of weighted citations received in the selected year by the documents published in the journal in the three previous years. Citation data is drawn from over 34,100 titles from more than 5,000 international publishers and country performance metrics from 239 countries worldwide."

549,"**police, violence, and possibly watching a murder trigger warning** The mental health tax of protesting and facing off with the police.","While I’ve been out in the streets protesting over the last month in Seattle I’ve seen seen peaceful protesters get pepper sprayed and attacked by police, I’ve been shot at with rubber bullets/flash bangs/tear gas/pepper spray/etc. While volunteering as security in the CHAZ/CHOP I had to escort out crazy homeless people with knives and break up fights, a couple times even responding to shots being fired and investigating if mysterious bangs were gunshots. I watched our street medics tend to a homeless man in a wheelchair who couldn’t move fast enough to avoid a cloud of tear gas and I even saw the police fire a blastball directly into the head of a protester and they were unconscious before they hit the ground. Blast balls are supposed to be shot at the ground so they explode and the shrapnel sprays protesters, a direct hit to the head can be lethal. I still and probably won’t ever know if they survived. Now I’m getting easily startled by unexpected loud sounds and I’ve gotten into the cycle of getting home from work, getting as stoned as possible, usually falling asleep before I sober out enough to be functional, and repeat the next day. Fuck, I don’t think I’ve taken a shower or brushed my teeth in the last month. I don’t really know why I’m posting this, maybe I’m asking for help, maybe it’s just venting. Either way I’m gonna head home and probably get as stoned as possible."
550,Don't know what to do with myself in free time and have no motivation,"Hi,

I’ve been really struggling with motivation recently and I just can’t find the energy to do anything really, which is leaving me with a hell of a lot of free time on my hands. Unfortunately, I’m really struggling to find anything that I enjoy to do in that free time. I definitely have interests - I want to learn to produce music, to draw, to program and usually I’m really quite good at being self motivated and practice these things at least twice a week, but lately (last couple of months) I have had seriously diminished interest.

I notice that when I wake up I am good and really motivated for a few hours,  but after that I become really exhausted and irritable for the rest of the day, leaving me bored, depressed and just feeling a bit hopeless.

I’m going for blood tests in a few weeks because of this whole tiredness thing, so hopefully that will shed some light on what’s going on. However, in the mean time I’m just not sure what to do.

I think I’m struggling with this so much because I’m usually a really busy person and hate relaxing (have done my whole life). When I try to relax or do anything relaxing such as reading a book I become super restless and constantly want do something more exciting, but then I’m so tired that then all I manage to do is climb into bed.

Throughout my life I’ve always turned to video games to distract me during my free time or just to have something to do. Over the past few years however, I’ve just become less and less interested in them to the point where now I hate playing them but do it anyway just to have something to do that I don’t really have to think about. Not having this interest anymore is again exacerbating this boredom problem I’m having. At this point I only play them for like 20 minutes because I just get so bored.

Also my concentration is non existent. I’ve always had a bit of trouble concentrating on things unless they really required my full attention or I was genuinely interested in them. Again though, this is affecting my hobbies because while I’m bored of my usual stuff and want to learn new things, I feel absolutely exhausted when I do anything new and really struggle to concentrate on it. I’ve tried watching books and films, but find that if it doesn’t grip me within about 10 seconds (which basically never happens ofc) I just feel so incredibly bored and have no interest in continuing.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for several years and have tried several different medications and various different dosages for each, as well as talking therapies and even hypnotherapy, none of which really seemed to do much apart from the medications making me feel more emotionally numb.

This feels different to a normal episode however. When I’ve had episodes in the past I’ve felt terrible and like I was going to die, but this feels different. It’s more just completely hollow with literally nothing there at all. Like just flatlining almost.

People tell me to just keep thinking positive or to just do more exercise ( I try to exercise every day), sleep better ( I get 8 hours sleep a night) and eat better but hearing that just makes me feel hopeless and tired. I’m trying so damn hard to stay positive and look on the bright side, but all that does is to distract from my brains onslaught of self destructing thoughts and again make me more tired.

I’m really not sure where to turn or what to do, but I can’t live like this so does anybody have any advice?
Thanks.

Also sorry this kind of turned into a bit of a vent but I’m still going to keep the flair as need support because I’m asking for any advice I can get."
551,I need some advice about dealing with anxiety/panic symptoms,"Tldr: I have anxious/panic symptoms when I feel like I've overshared about my mental health. Are there ways to cope/things to look into when I have these feelings of anxiety?

So, I have a very good close friendship with someone that I met online about 3 years ago. I'd say they're one of my best friends, and we play video games together and talk on the phone often.

I guess I should say, my friend has ongoing therapy sessions, while I do not currently. I have in the past, but now can't afford it, so I'm doing the best I can with self-help activities, and read books about my disorder.

We talk about our mental health journeys with each other quite often. Sometimes I feel like I share too much, though. I worry myself so much about if I overshared with them, that it triggers my anxiety symptoms (shaking, high blood pressure, sweating, nausea) until I hear back from them. They've always been very supportive of me, and I of them. They've also established that I can talk to them about anything, with no judgement.

I feel like I can't stop overthinking when I share these things. Some of the thoughts I've had are ""maybe this time I crossed a boundary,"" or, ""maybe I triggered them by sharing too many specifics,"" and my favorite, ""I've done it, I've ruined another friendship.""

I have brought this up with them, that I overthink a lot when it comes to sharing things with them, or anyone. They've told me that they're totally fine with my sharing, and have been very open-minded and supportive.

I feel like I should be okay, and it's frustrating that I still feel anxious when I share anything with them.

I understand that these thoughts and feelings are part of my disorder, but I wish I knew how to make them more manageable. Does anyone here have similar feelings, or know how to cope with feelings like this? Or how to cope with overwhelming anxiety in the moment?"
552,In a constant state of anxiety because everyone in my life expects me to handle this covid situation differently. No matter what I do I'm letting someone down. I dont know how to cope anymore.,"I live with my dad. Hes high risk. His girlfriend is even higher risk. If they get this, they very likely will not survive.

I have one friend whos flying into town from florida next weekend for the first time since she moved away 2 years ago. She expects me to see her. I feel obligated because i haven't had the time off work or the money to fly and visit her over the past few years like *all* her other friends have.

I have another friend who just got dumped after a 5 year relationship. She wants to come hang out this weekend. We've been friends FOREVER and i so badly want to be there for her but she goes to a public gym every day and im uncomfortable with that. 

I have another friend who is flying into town to get MARRIED. Shes going to gave a bachelorette party and an engagement party and an actual wedding and im in the wedding party...SO ONCE AGAIN, i feel obligated but IM UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF THIS. 

On top of all of this, the smallest least significant part of this all, my birthday is this month. And i feel like im not even allowed to have time for ME to do ANYTHING for myself. 

Im being pulled in every direction. I feel like all of the people i love expect something totally different from me AND I CANNOT TAKE IT. I feel like an awful friend if im not there for my friends. I feel like im missing out on life by not participating. But the few times during this pandemic when i HAVE been places and been with other people (outside of my safe quarantine fam and friends) i spend the next 2 weeks in a state of paranoia thinking ""if i brought this virus home my dad could be dead in a few weeks"" and ill feel even WORSE if my dad suffers and/or dies because i brought home a virus from some unnecessary get-together i just ~had~ to attend. 

I dont know what to do. I just cry all the time. I feel so hollow because no matter what i do its wrong and im so tired of feeling scared and sad."
553,Breakup is destroying me,"So my serious relationship of 2 years is ending soon (we have discussed it) and I am just crushed. How do I move on? How do I get over her and how do I not just feel sad and heartbroken everyday? I lived with her for over a year and my life revolved around her a lot. Now I’m just empty and feeling hopeless. Please, I need advice!

ps. I have depression and now have suffered from anxiety too."
554,My friend got to me today,"I need to vent about something that happened today when I was hanging out with my best friend and figured this subreddit is the best place to do it (sorry for any poor punctuation).

I was hanging out with my best friend today and we were playing monopoly which is something we both like to do. But we can get quite competitive and whenever one person has more money than the other in the game we “brag” about it. However every time I kept doing the “bragging” she kept reminding me she had more money than me in real life. For context we are both 17 she has two jobs and I quit the one job I had to work on my mental health as the job was really damaging my mental health. She even went as far as to pull up her bank balance on her banking app after I repeatedly said I didn’t want to see it. Usually I try my best to not get things like this get to me as she likes to put me down when I succeed a lot but today it really got to me as I’ve been worried about my low funds recently as I’ve been applying for uni. But again for context my best friend lost her mum when she was 7 and has suffered from depression so is really insecure. But her constantly putting me down is starting to get to me more and more and I’m really worried it’s going to effect my already really low self esteem. I don’t know what to do about any of this anyone got any advice?"
555,Mental health disorder or just a jerk?,"Sorry for the wall of text, TL;DR at the bottom. 

I've always seen my father as an overall OK person, but he's also selfish, overprotective, pedantic, controlling, lacking empathy and not really open for discussions.

Recently I started thinking that he is the way he is beacuse he might not be doing great from the mental health point of view (anxiety? OCD?). Or maybe he's just a bit of a jerk from time to time and he's otherwise fine. I would appreciate your inputs and thoughts on this, thank you. 

He's constantly worried about some key topics, to the point where they become nearly an obsession for him (and for the rest of the family as consequence). Being worried about some of these is understandable (eg being afraid of bulgars robbing our house) , but not to his point: not only he makes his life miserable I guess, but he also torments us with his obsessions, does not accept others opinion and could be quite selfish/not understanding (eg he installed several anti theft devices without caring for the opinion of the rest of the family, when not at home checks on us multiple times a day to make sure doors and windows are properly locked, doesn't want us to play loud noises/use headphones if we're alone in the house, otherwise we want hear the bulgar coming).
Some of these issues he's always worried about are instead unreasonable (eg complaining about fingerprints on a glass table, it's the damn dinner table, how I'm not supposed to leave fingerprints on it).

Some of his fixations have been present since I can remember, other obsessions changed with time (from being the main point of his existence, after some years they don't seem relevant to him anymore).

He worries about things that are quite far away in the future and/or with a low probability to happen, not enough for  justifing such pessimistic/doomed approach.

Arguing with him it's clear that his opinions are not supported by logic or science, he's not open to really listen and understand the other person, he likely doesn't speak the truth (but I don't know if he realises that though) and changes his version quite often. His behavior is sometime in contradiction with his words (eg he's worried because, in a year, there's a really low probability  he might lose his job. He has been worried about this for a couple of years at this point, but he also buys expensive, not necessary stuff he likes). He projects his weird beliefs and obsessions on the rest of the family, resulting annoying, selfish, dictatorial and unreasonable. At the same time, he tweaks these strong beliefs when they could affect hiw own comfort, like the rules he applies to others do not apply to himself. 

Do you think he's just a bit of a jerk, or that there could be some (mild?) mental health disorders affecting him and his behavior? Thank for your help

TL;DR: Father is selfish, unreasonable, seems to not care and listen to others in the family when his ""trigger"" topics/obsession are involved. Just a jerk or mental health disorder?"
556,Having been body shamed my whole life,"I’m a 22yo female from an Asian country and I currently live in the US by myself for college. I’m 5’3 and 130lbs+ atm which is probably the heaviest I’ve ever been. I’ve been called fat my whole life. 

My earliest memory of being body shamed was by ballet teacher when I was from 5-10 yo. My mom has done it pretty much for as long as I remember, she’s constantly nagging me about dieting and exercising when I was home and now every time I FaceTime her and my dad. The first half of last year I was going through an extremely rough time with my relationship and I wasn’t eating properly, which ended up with me losing over 10lbs in two months. I felt terrible about not taking care of my body and my health, even though I “looked better” because I got skinnier, but it wasn’t my intention to lose so much weight in a short time. Unsurprisingly, my mom thought I looked great when I went home to visit in the summer. My appetite has gotten back to normal when I visited home, but she was constantly nagging me about eating less (she would call me out for eating too much rice when I fill about 2/3 of these tiny Asian rice bowels). I just felt that she didn’t care about my health (both physically and mentally) nearly as much as she cared about me being skinny. 

Today my long-distance boyfriend expressed that he doesn’t want me to visit after seeing photos I sent him recently, in which I was visibly rounder than usual because of quarantine, even though I’ve actually lost weight the past few weeks due to healthy eating and exercise. I always thought he embraced my body type even though I’ve been chubby the past few years, but he’d occasionally say things like I should exercise more or pick up running. 

I’m just so sick and tired of being body shamed and told to exercise and diet all the fucking time and especially so when it comes from my boyfriend, when I’ve never even been that fat."
557,Do you ever forget that you too can decide if you like/dislike others?,"I often forget that I can like or dislike others too. To have have the option. I always have in my head *either they'll decide to like me or not 
* and almost never *I can decide if I like them or not*. You know what I mean...


It's like I'm living in their lives and forget to live in mine. That I have my own perception of the world. My own likes and dislikes about things. My own self-worth."
558,Struggling to carry on,"Long story short, I (M16) grew up with an abusive dad, I assume my anxiety stemmed from that and it caused me to drop out of school two years ago. Earlier this year I got my first girlfriend in a long while but she felt we had to go our separate ways, while I’d planned my life with her.  Breakups are always hard but I don’t think I’ve ever felt worse after one single event in my life. She was a partner and a friend so it hurt doubly.

Right now, my anxiety has been preventing me from getting help and going to college (not that it’s even an option anymore because of COVID). College was where I’d hoped to get my GCSE’s since I missed out on them in school. I’d consider myself a smart person but without those pieces of paper stating it I’m as smart as a rock. Missing out on college also has made me quite insecure and my near constant lack of human interaction doesn’t help in that regard. 

I honestly think I have depression too, but since I haven’t been diagnosed with it I don’t want to say I am depressed for definite. I frequently think about self harming, suicide and whatnot. The only reason I’m still here writing this is because I’m too scared to carry it out. I try talking to my few friends about how I feel but I know I just annoy them with my constant moaning, and so, I’ve turned here. 

I’m not sure how anyone can help me, but I’m open to anything. As long as you don’t say, “people will be upset,” or something along those lines. I honestly doubt they would be. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply tho :)

P.S. So much for a “long story short” eh?"
559,Talking To Myself.. is it Normal?,"No one really pays attention to my well being or what I feel like, so I think in order to get validation and feel loved I always talk to myself like someone’s there listening. It could be small things like reactions to something, or pretending someone asked me a question about myself. 

I’ve tried to stop by telling myself that I’m alone and no one is watching me/listening but it’s not working. I really don’t know what else to do. Since I’m a teenager I’m hoping it will go away with time, but is this even something a teenager should be experiencing??"
560,Will she change her mind?, A little back story we actually divorced in 2017 and got back together a year later up until 3 weeks ago she split again. I had a bit of a mental breakdown which triggered pretty bad ocd and intrusive thoughta that lasted several months. During this time I was a huge stressor on her as well as having a newborn baby it all became too much for her and she shut down emotionally all together. I have since improved 10 fold with my issues but its too late and we split up. I feel like she's stuck in this emotionless trance and dosent even realize the weight and impact of the decisions she is making right now she is totally detached from herself and says it feels like she is watching from the outside. She also has a lot of childhood issues she has never fully dealt with that still trouble her on top of 15 miscarriages we endured. It seems like all these things have overwhelmed her to the point of shutting down. My question is for anyone that has experienced a similar situation and if so how did you come out of it and did you have a whole different mind set about things once you did? Also how long did it take?
561,Bpd??,I have researched into it after seeing a post about it on twitter and it would make so much sense if I had It because I have basically every symptom u can find
562,"Aderall, ssri &amp; lamictal","Anyone else on this combo?

I’m on 50mg aderall, 20mg ssri &amp; 50mg lamictal(just started)


I FINALLY FEEL NORMAL. No mood swings. No depression. No anxiety. No ADHD."
563,Dad is hurtful without realizing it then defensive when you speak up,"The longer I’ve been living on my own the more I realize how badly my parents make me feel and how just... strange they are. Don’t get me wrong, I love them because they tried but it’s just difficult.

My dads emotions are so stunted and his reactions are so robotic, and my mom is more emotionally intube but deeply entrenched in denial most of the time and refuses to acknowledge any kind of negativity; yet has uncontrollable outbursts of anger herself. I think they’d rather die than admit they’re slightly less normal than most, let alone admit my childhood wasn’t actually perfect. It just sucks.

To go back on my dad, recently I had a terrifying event at work. Won’t go into too much detail. Called my mom frantically after If happened to tell her I was okay if she saw it on the news and she was like “uhh. Alright. Glad you’re okay dear,” and just genuinely didn’t seem that interested. I brushed this off because it was night time and she was probably caught off guard by the whole thing.

The next day I visited them to explain to them the timeline of what happened bacuse by then there was some news coverage and an investigation. I had to work at the same place that day too and felt rattled. I work 7 days a week and generally have no time off, so I was considering calling out to take a day to recover.

Well, bad thing to bring up to my dad. First of all he seemed pretty dissenterested after he heard I wasn’t the one it was directly happening to, and treated me like I was a pussy for being upset. Then said that my lifestyle is my choice and I don’t get to call out because I’m “tired”. Mother seemed more interested but instantly got angry and defensive because it’s a “negative” conversation. 

I just don’t understand. These are more memorable example of my dad thinking I’m an overly sensitive moron:

-had a friend baker acted for threatening suicide and got berated and dragged into the middle of it by her family. My other friend was also threatened for doing this and it was a genuinely horrible experience. The family member doing the threatening was also my boss at the time. My dad told me that I had no control of my friends were going to kill themselves or not and if they really meant it they’d just do it. Also told me I needed to stop acting like I was a hero. When I cried in my room over it he came in and patted my back and said I was a good kid. Like it was just kind of cute that I’d cared enough to get upset. 

-Continuously told me a was a bleeding heart and that I felt bad for everyone and I was way too sensitive. 

-blamed me for all car accidents. Guy was in my blind spot. Well you weren’t looking. Guy is speeding and blocks me in the road and jumps out of his car to scream at me. Well you kind of deserved it. My breaks give out and my car hydroplanes into a median and destroys my steering. Tells me it’s my fault. I had plans for the next day so I got an Uber and I get bitched at for wasting my money and how I can’t just buy an Uber to have fun at the mall when I move out. 

-constantly rolling my eyes at me if I express any kind of emotion while talking to him. 

-if I also say anything my mother finds unacceptable she’ll just stare completely through my or ignore me and if I keep talking about it she’ll snap at me. No warning. Just me being an idiot. 

I don’t get it. It frustrates me so badly because they constantly act like they care so much and want to reach out to me and ask me if I’m okay and if I’m honest with them they treat me like I’m retarded. Nothing is ever bad enough and I’m always overreacting. I’m always doing something wrong. I hate it."
564,"Missed teen years, can’t grow up","I’m 28F. So long story short, I was homeschooled and suffered from anxiety, so spent most of my teen years in my room. I was depressed and had absolutely no social life of any kind apart from the internet. Then in college, I made a few sorta friends but still didn’t have much of a social life. When I met my first really serious boyfriend, I spent most of my time with him, and because he was a homebody, we didn’t do much. I don’t want to blame him, but it was always hard to get him to go anywhere and have new experiences. So I missed out on the kinds of things early 20s couples tend to do, too, like traveling, attending parties and events, trying new hobbies together, etc. Eventually our relationship ended because he wanted to get married and I wasn’t ready, and I’d started doing things on my own because he didn’t want to. I felt like how could I be ready to get married and potentially start a family when I hadn’t lived my own life? 

Now at 28 years old, I still have no desire to have a “real” job despite the fact I have a bachelor’s degree, just to make enough money to pay for my expenses which isn’t much since I live with my parents. It would be nice to have my own place but it also feels like throwing money out the window and too much responsibility. I also have no desire to start a family. I date younger men (24-25ish) and party. People assume I’m 22-25 and I don’t usually correct them. I’m shy but quite goofy and have the sense of humor of a 12 yr old boy. I have ADHD and sometimes suspect aspergers, which means that not only do I not WANT to grow up, it’s also fundamentally difficult for me to do the things adults have to do.

Overall I don’t have a desire to change my lifestyle, but sometimes I worry I’m a freak or truly never going to be able to live a normal life. Anyone have the same thing going on?"
565,"I get incredibly sad when I witness friends fighting, why?","I know this might seem normal, but I feel I have a disproportionate response to people i love fighting around me. 

Today two of my friends were going at each other's throats in a group chat and I han a full on meltdown. Tears running down my face, snot coming out my nose, the whole package.

I just don't feel this is an appropriate response to two people just fighting with each other, with absolutely no malice towards me personally.

Idk, could someone just please help me understand why I do this? Kinda concerned it's some deep rooted childhood trauma or some shit lmao."
566,How to deal with break up?,"In January I was dating a girl for about 4 weeks, until she told me she didn't have feelings for me anymore and something along the line that we shouldn't see each other anymore. I was caught of guard and immediately started crying. 

I cried myself to sleep that night, and the next few weeks was tough. I didn't want to live anymore, and I frequently got this idea ""What if I just jump in front of the subway? What if I just jumped out the window (from 5th floor)?"" I know I wouldn't had the balls to do it, but the thoughts were still there. I didn't want to end my life, but I didn't want to live anymore either. 

It's worth mentioning that I was at a very good place before this. I was happy, motivated and optimistic about the future. I've been single the last 9 years, and I've had 2 relationships in total. I'm very bad at handling rejection. 

About 3 years ago I was having a flirt with this amazing girl at work, and the last day before she quit I needed to know if she liked me the same way. She said she only considered me a friend. I was devastated and went into the worst depression in my life, which lasted a couple of months.  

Before my last relationship ended 9 years ago, I've never really gotten back on my feet. Before that I was always dating someone or at least talking to girls. I think what stuck with me is that my ex-girlfriend had access to my Facebook account after she broke up, and read messages I sent to other girls in a desperate attempt to move on. She said something like ""Is that how you talk to girls? HAHA, you're so \[insert something offensive\]"" and made a fool out of me. I was crushed, felt sorry for myself and started pity-drinking alcohol for attention—the drinking didn't last for long though, nothing in my life has.

I guess the question is; Where do I go from here? It's almost as if I'm a passenger in a body that doesn't want to risk being hurt again. I'm merely observing myself following my desires and avoiding situations that have the potential of causing me pain. 

Just to be clear, I'm not depressed now. At least I don't think so. I've recently learned I get anxious around girls I like (I didn't really know what anxiety was and what it felt like before), and I suspect I have ADD and rejection sensitivity dysphoria. Never talked to a mental health professional, so I couldn't know for sure of course. To be honest I don't know anything for sure anymore. I'm kind of lost in my own thoughts most of the time. Any word of advice would be very much appreciated.

Thanks."
567,I am drunk and I remember why I stopped drinking,I am with my friends and I am drunk (not very) but I remeber why I stopped drinking and I am in pain (not physical) and I can’t keep the bad down but I’m pretending and I haven’t drunk in so long that I’m drunk quicker because I stopped because I was addickted and I  I lost my train of though uhh I’m stopped drinking because I get sat and I was drinking too much and I took a lot of pills and I want to kill myself but I won’t because I know I’m only drunk so I do want to die but I want because I’m drunk and so it feels more present because I can’t force it done but idk why I’m making this but I am please talk to me I want attention so I know I’m not the only one that feels like that are stuck in some fucked up nightmare that they can’t wake from
568,Anxiety and Mild Depression - Celexa RX? Concerned about Side Effects,"I (30F) struggle with anxiety and mild depression.  For a long time now I’ve felt low.. not crippling anxiety or severe depression, I’m functioning. I just feel down, feel like I have to put on a happy face. On the outside I have everything going for me, but on the inside I have a lot of insecurity and fear that I won’t ever find a life partner. It causes me anxiety. My friends are all married with kids and I feel like an outsider, it’s hard to be happy for them. I often shutdown around them and don’t know what to say. Most of my anxiety is a result of my dating life/fear of being alone (my ex left me suddenly 2 years ago and I’ve never really gotten over it). However I also have childhood trauma which I’ve gone to EMDR for 4-ish sessions (I’m not sure if it helped to be honest).

I’m currently looking for a CBT therapist but having trouble finding one I connect with (that isn’t $200 a session). 

I eat well, excecise, read self help books constantly. I’ve tried meditation, gratitude books, l-theanine and htp-5 without noticing a difference. 

My doctor prescribed me celexa 10mg.. however in reading the side effects and withdrawal, I’m very concerned about taking it.. I’m not sure the reward is worth the risk.. But I just want to feel happier and more content. 

Any advice or recommendations?"
569,I feel like I'm locking myself out of the world by abstaining from Social media. Idk what to do I need advice.,"I'm in my 20s.

My mental health is currently in no good place at the moment because I've been feeling lonely for years. My recent experiences in the last couple of years in dating and networking have brought me to abstain from social media ""until I work on myself"". The thing is that ""working on myself"" takes too long and also I feel like I'm missing out in life by not posting pics of me online just the rest of kids my age do. I never really felt comfortable with my image online and I was selective on how I display it on social media.

Abstaining from social media and dating apps seems difficult (abstained from IG 2 years so far but not others) because I'm lonely in real life so I guess those would make me feel more sociable. 

I don't know if I should use social media on my way ""working myself"" or use them after I'm done. I feel like everyone's judging me and invisible until I get to some point.

570,Today...,"Was the first day in about two weeks where I felt well enough to do my chores without a mental struggle.

Typically, I wash dishes as I use them. I don’t bother with my dishwasher because I live alone, and it seems wasteful. For the past two weeks, I’ve gotten to where I’ll use every dish in my cabinet before willing myself to clean them. I didn’t get it progress quite far today and ended up doing the dishes and wiping down my whole kitchen. 

Laundry was piling up. I still have plenty, but I had the motivation to do most of it throughout my day. 

I took out the garbage and even did some studying.

571,Am I hearing voices or posing my thoughts as people?,"I've heard 'voices' for as long as I remember. They have distinct personalities and talking styles, and all of them don't like me.  They fall in and out of talking with me. Once, one got me to hurt myself a few times. Sometimes they argue in my head, and other times they all just jump on the me that I am most of the time, if that makes any sense. With my therapist I call them voices, but my parents say it just me making my thoughts people. If anyone has an idea on which it is, please tell me."
572,I feel like I'm not like everybody else,"Everybody else seems to get enjoyment out of things, out of life. They go places and have hobbies they love.

Everytime i try to meet new people we text for a while until it comes time to meet them and then i feel so much dread, like meeting a new person is the last thing i want to do. Then I just get stuck in a cycle of being terrified of the future because at this rate I'll just end up living alone forever and doing nothing other than going to work and coming home because no matter what I do or who I'm with, i feel like I'd just rather be alone. I dont even know at this point if it's all related to mental illness or if I'm just that fucked up"

I feel so lonely, I don’t have any friends or anyone I can really talk to like everyone else. There’s people who I can talk to but not ~talk~ to. I try not to exhaust people so I don’t really say much anyway. 

I am poor, I work hard at my job and make more than minimum wage. I am NOWHERE CLOSE to being comfortable. I only have about $5000 in savings and I’m pretty frugal. I feel like it’s fruitless to even strive for a better life because I’m going to be stuck living paycheck to paycheck no matter how hard I work or how smart I am.

577,"A close friend (female, thirties) struggling to process a recent trauma when her dad got aggressive and threatening in the home. Can she reach out to therapists for mental health support, without them reporting it?","Hi lovely Reddit folk.

My friend and her dog, based in the US, is currently living with her parents (lost job due to covid etc etc).

A few days ago, her dog and her mum had an altercation (nobody was physically hurt), resulting in her dad becoming extremely defensive and as a result, aggressive, threatening to kill her dog if he came near them again (not great of course when they all live together, but perhaps a heat of the moment reaction?) 

Now, she doesn't even know WHERE to begin processing this. Feels unsafe in her own home, in addition to a heap of other elements massively affecting her mental health.

She wants to reach out for some therapy to her her process and figure out how to begin moving on from this, but is worried that a therapist may hear about this altercation and report it as a potential threat/dangerous behaviour by her dad (who didn't touch anybody, just threatened with a kitchen utensil that wasn't a knife).

Does anybody know in the US if this is the sort of thing a therapist would have to report, or if its not at that level?

Would really appreciate any insight, thanks"
578,Grieving for a dead person that has never existed..,"For some reason, when I was about 7-8 I got a very strong feeling like part of my soul died. In a couple of months it developed to me having a strong feeling that my best friend had died, this best friend never existed, I was and still am grieving for a dead person that never existed. 

My best friend is a girl my age, well she died but she was my age. Her death caused me a lot of sadness which led to depression, I’m still now many years later depressed and hold strong feelings for her. I take anti-depressants prescribed by a psychiatrist but I still grieve for her. Despite the fact that she doesn’t exist, and never has.

When I was younger I was often bullied and had not a single friend, I think it’s possible that I may have made up a best friend. I’m not sure. But it affects me deeply and I really don’t know what to do. I even have memories, of her smile, her personality and stuff like that, although I cannot recall what she looked like other than basic features. I have no idea what her face other than her smile looks like.

Still, somehow, I feel like their disorder is what compels me to work hard on managing mine. When I learned about how my second daughter, who was the first to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was harming herself, I knew I must do everything to stay focused, to not give in to my depression.  When she was hospitalized, I prayed hard not to have a meltdown. Fighting my depression at that moment was painful, even physically. There are times when I had to roll to the edge of the bed just so I will be forced to get up because I have to deal with a lot of things. When my eldest (second to be diagnosed) was diagnosed just under a year later. I felt like my world is going to crumble, but I knew I had to hold on. All these events happened between 2016 and 2017. It's been years, and I feel a little better. Everyday is a choice not to stay focused. Everyday is a choice to fight and stay strong for my kids. The weird thing is, even if I do feel sad about my situation, I feel happy about choosing to fight everyday until the day that my daughters are able to manage their mental health."

I was feeling so hopeless and lost and trapped. I was so so angry that a tiny vessel in my eye ball burst and it looks like a red dot. Around my hairline is bruised and swollen.

590,On Self control,"Hi,

I have a spending problem. Im a 28 y.o. RN. here in Ontario. I work in ER.

I have been reading about personal finance and started with Wealthy Barber returns.

I adopted some of his advice: automatic payments to my savings, writing down what I spend money on.

My issue is spending seems to be emotional to a certain degree for me. I spend most when I am off work. When I feel I am lacking something (let's say I need to be more organized, or I need more friends) I tend to buy products like books, self help books, coaching, etc...

I realize that on one level of assessment, I am needing validation that I'm not getting in life, and I use money to satiate those negative emotions/chaos...

Do you guys know how to best tackle this issue? I know it's probably a complex issue. I'm sure you can all relate to a certain degree.

Is there any good books (LOL)?"

Justifications include, “whatever, life is short”, “it’ll spice things up in my life”, you name it. But these are common justifications.

Thought I would take the time to explain how I have succeeded so if you have the time.,"Should preface because of the healthcare in the US and myself  being broke I could not afford a Doc. Of course go see a licensed psychologist which is definitely not me. 

 First step stop being around people that make you want to die. 

Second step was long form breathing meditation. There is no wrong way to breathe. I just make sure of one thing. I let my mind go wild with music in the background or university lectures free online while deep breathing. The only rule of meditation is to have fun. 

Third step is diet, nutrition, and exercise. Let me explain the significance of the big D. At bare minimum if you do not want to run miles without your shirt outside please I beg the lord, at least go out and  get some sun for 10 minutes a day or vitamin D through supplementation. Your body uses this vitamin for a chunk of the procceses in your body. Zinc and Magnesium are also mandatory for myself. Recently I began taking melatonin as a sleep aid, but maybe you wouldn't touch the stuff without talking to a doctor first. 

Thanks people. I wish you all great luck. It sucks to be stuck in a bind. Take care of your bodies and open your minds to life. It all happens in the end. Take care and enjoy life. Peace out."

598,I need help escaping a friendship,"So a while back, me and my ex decided to start talking again, we talked for a few weeks and it got deep for me I became attached. She mentioned a coworker named Joe that she was friends with, i immediately had a bad gut feeling about Joe. Anyway as time goes on she starts talking to me less and less and every conversation we have, Joe gets mentioned one way or another. She stops preforming... maintenance on me? Not sexual but just caring how I’m feeling or even asking how my day was when I go out of my way to stay up through every breakdown she has. It kinda comes to a head one night when I’m feeling shitty about my body and I ask her for some encouraging words, which she responds with “You’re handsome” and she sends me a video of Joe making a joke about something unrelated. I confront her for not taking care of me and she  gets incredibly defensive and blows up on me. Eventually we stop talking and kinda move into a friendship, she just treated me like a friend without even saying she wanted to stop talking. After a week of almost no communication she calls me asking me to meet with her after a horrible day at work. I meet up with her at what she deemed was “Our spot” and Joe rolls up. Thinks are smooth and she’s almost immediately touching him in some way of other, he was in between me and her almost the entire time, in what I believe was a “She’s mine” type of thing. Eventually they go to sit down and he mentions “Oh hey we stopped to cuddle here before right?” At which she doesn’t respond and my heart kinda sinks. That was our spot and she took him there? A few minutes after that I left and we haven’t talked until the other night. She calls me crying saying how she does so much to help Joe (her new boyfriend), reminding him to take meds, to eat, comforting him through issues, and he can’t even stay with her through an anxiety attack. I, immediately thinking of the irony stay on the phone with her trying to think of a way to get out of the friendship without hurting her now or in the future as I still care about her. I’ve considered just blocking her but it could cause more strife if she needed me and found out I just blocked her. I know I’m just a filler guy for her and she’ll move on when she finds anyone remotely better, but like I said I want to do this without hurting her, as smooth as possible. 

Tldr: Ex and me started talking again (like pre dating talking) and she valued me at first but lost all interest in me once she found another guy. She even took him to what was “our spot” to cuddle. She’ll only call me when she needs emotional support and doesnt talk to me (like normal conversation) in return. I want to get out of this friendship but I want to do it without hurting her."
599,Battling the anxieties within me,"I have been dealing with some anxieties that have been constantly anguishing me and tbh I find it to be very happy nowadays.

I(20M) have been a perfectly healthy since young and in school, I was a cheerful guy and I usually felt happy. However, in the recent years, I joined a different organisation in which people are very dependent of each other and a lot of things have to be done through team effort. Hence, this has resulted in people always trying to be alpha and “one-up” others to make themselves feel better. Also, it is not common for people to blame others for their mistakes since they are affected as well.

How has this affected me?

Personally, I was not one of the best in this organisation and I could not do my things as good as others. Hence, I frequently came under the scrutiny of others and my peers would put me down sometimes when I make mistakes. Initially, that didn’t affect me much. However, after spending almost a year and a half in this environment, I have become very defensive towards myself and get very agitated when others scrutinise me for my mistakes even when sometimes they mean good.

At the same time, there were many people who are two-faced and people often talked bad about their peers behind their back. The effect that this had on me, coupled with the environment described above, made me very doubtful of others loyalty and intentions. I always find myself not being able to trust people and whether they are really there for me.

To be honest, I know that I should open up and trust more but overtime, I just find it so difficult to do so. The thought of isolating myself to attain inner peace has become so much more frequent recently. I wish these thoughts can stop plaguing me everyday.

If anyone can shed some light on how to improve my mindset, that would mean a lot.
Thanks!

TL;DR A change in environment made me very doubtful of others loyalty and intentions while also making me overly defensive about myself. This has greatly affected my daily mental health and I was seeking for some ways to change my mindset or just some advice in general."

603,What’s happening in my head right now?,"I’m a girl and I’m 19 yrs old

     What’s driving me insane everyday is the voices in my mind. The voices are real alive people and they sound faint. They are people I like from social media and real life. As soon as I wake up, I have back and forth conversations with the people I like and would love to talk to them at the moment. They sound nothing like them but maybe similar. I can talk in my head but I don’t hear my voice it’s hard to explain. They can talk to each other sometimes but it’s almost rare. It’s strange because, every time I go on social media, I listen to the person talking in the video and then when the video ends, I remember how they sound like and I began talking with them inside my head. I don’t talk to them out loud or want to because that would make me look crazy however, something embarrassing happens sometimes, Like when something funny I said or they said and I can’t help but smile a little but if it happened in real life I would be laughing. And classmates saw me burst laughing or smile when nothing funny happened. 
Sometimes I can’t hear the voices I like and it feels like they left. And I miss their voice. all the voices comfort me when I’m upset. But some are present and silent, I feel their presence. It’s like they have nothing to say. 


 Where it began
 
     I go to a girls only school. Since grade 9, from the middle of the first semester strange things are happening in my head. I learned about the inner dialogue from a fictional Korean series I was watching. I was in class and I started to think of the people around me could hear what I’m thinking about. I was 15 years old. It was math class, on the board there was numbers like: 1,3,5,7,9. and in my head I was saying 1,3.5,7,9 and the girl behind me was whispering to herself the numbers at the same time I was saying it. Since this happened, I was suspicious about if they can hear my inner dialogue. I’m still suspicious at the moment. but since no one is saying anything about it, that means that they can’t or I’m going to questioning my existence forever. One day , At bedtime as I was drifting off, I heard someone heavily breathing in front of my face, I can’t tell if it was me not realizing it or the bed cover. And one time as I was snuggling into bed and you could hear the sound of the bed cover at the same time I heard the girl’s voice saying how are you, but because of the bed cover I couldn’t be sure so, I went to sleep thinking it was nothing. So after the finals it’s summer break and things happened. One day I was bored. And I felt alone in my head, I was kind of jealous of people who hear voices. I wanted to draw on paper so I did that to get rid of my boredom. As I was drawing  it reminded me of the girl who was judging my drawing in grade 9 so I heard “She’s ugly” and “ She always draws girls” and we don’t have the best relationship. She’s not my friend and I don’t like her, she’s rude sometimes. Her voice is faint while she’s talking in my head. As I was in grade 10 and 11 I was always listening to other girls and learning how they sound like and at home when I feel alone like I have always been I have back and forth conversations with them, sometimes or arguing and sometimes it’s funny. 


The fantasy world I live in
  
   This fantasy world is hidden in my head and from the outside I look totally normal doing daily tasks like I’ve always been. Feeling alone in my head makes me want to talk to someone inside my head that I would wish to have conversations with. I went through hard times. One time it was midnight and I woke up to their voices (the girls I know from school) then I was trying to go sleep again but I couldn’t because at that time I was thinking that they all hate me and I was crying while I heard they’re comments. I went to the living room since I can’t sleep, I was just sitting on the couch staring at the wall listening to what they say, repeating words over and over. In my head I was saying I’m so sorry to them if I did hurt them without knowing and crying. as I was doing that I could see couples kissing on the wall everywhere I look on the wall. It was weird. but then I went to bed and woke up feeling fine in the morning. 
In grade 10 during the spring break, I was thinking why in the world I hear voices in my head then I thought I was cursed and that I’m dying after a few days and that I’m no longer under my god’s mercy and god cursed me because I don’t worship god. I’m going to quickly say what I saw and what I experienced during the daydream so, at that time it was the first time I heard a voice that it’s unrecognized and not familiar, it’s girls voice, two of them, one of them cried rarely and the other told me to pray/read. I was praying and in the carpet I was praying on I saw the devils face smiling at me and I was terrified I also heard his voice screaming outside my house whenever I pray. Another daydream where I hallucinate on my phone in my social media, I saw a strange tweet (on Twitter). Anyways about the voices I hear I also feel their presence around me when I want to cuddle them, I feel a little warmth. This year, in the middle of January, I talked about the voices to my sister and she said that what I’m having is normal it’s because you remember the people you know and you feel like you hear their voice. That made me no longer hallucinate for some reason. Maybe it’s because it made the voices not real. I have always known that the voices are not real the whole time though. The voices I hear right now are the people I know. 


What I think about the voices in my head. 

   As I said, they can be comforting me when I’m upset. and sometimes funny and it fills the loneliness. But I break down because of them, they can be annoying and won’t shut up. So, I did want to end my life during these times but seeking help is the only answer. I get tired of listening to their voice. But it feels like I can’t get enough of their voice and as long as I’m thinking about something with my inner dialogue, they will reply to me but sometimes they just repeat the words I say and that’s it. I honestly don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what mental illness is this? I’ve heard about tulpa. It’s like having unlimited tulpas. I don’t know. But I’m sure I need help."

Every time they'd ask how I'm going or how my courses are going I'd just say I'm fine and I'm on top of my work when I wasn't. It's like I compulsively lie about anything I'm struggling with, then I immediately regret it because I need help from my friends. And I know they're going to find out I'm struggling eventually when it all becomes too much so idek why I lie about it. 

Well, anyway, I think I have to tell them now because I've been removed from a course this semester and my friends are going to notice :/"
609,I found an unconventional way to deal with my depression affecting my studies,"Hello, i'll give context to my issues to some degree and explain what i've done that's helped up to a certain degree

Tl;Dr I have an exam coming up but am too depressed to study, here's an unconventional way i found to deal (you can skip to the second paragraph to skip further context)

I have an important exam coming up that will determine basically the rest of my life, this has obviously caused many mental challenges in addition to my already existing ones, I've got a chronic but mild depression (non-clinical) that can get pretty bad if unchecked, since coronavirus started i have a way harder time keeping myself in check, and since this exam is getting quite close I'm getting increasingly anxious, only one problem here, i'm not done studying and if i took the exam today i would fail tremendously, but whenever i start studying i feel like i'm having a panic attack, i can't concentrate and i even get a rush of suicidal thoughts, and a general overwhelming feeling of lack of motivation that leads me to have to lay in bed until these feelings go away (if they do), one way i initially found to help was playing videogames or watching youtube videos until i felt ready to study, but this would result in sub-optimal productivity, and i genuinely felt if i continued this way i wound't be able to make it

Recently for whatever reason i decided to wake up at 5am (i had been waking around 8), and to my surprise, when i got up i felt pretty fine with studying, i did it fine until the sun came up around 7, so that was pretty solid, but then i felt sleepy again and slept till 8, i discovered polyphasic sleep on accident, i started doing some research, especially on r/polyphasic, and immediately started my new unconventional sleep schedule, 11pm to 2am, study from 2am to 6am, sleep till 8-9am, and i have to say, i've been more productive in those 4 hours of the day than all the other 14 hours im awake

I'm not saying this will work for everyone in every problem but it did for me, i'm still a ways to go though, i used to go to boxing gym before corona, it's been 5 months of quarantine where i live and i haven't done a bit of exercise+worse eating diet, so i've gained a bit of weight and lost all the muscle mass i built in the time i was boxing, so that sucks

I also decided to give up porn (specifically doujin and hentai), i thought since they are animated it isnt as bad as porn, and maybe its not, but having that in front of me 24/7 was starting to affect my sexual relationships as well as consume alot of time from my day"

612,Friend went from normal to really odd over about a year,"My friend was just a normal college student. He was in a fraternity. He was a fun normal guy. Maybe did too many drugs including psychedelics. After about half way through sophomore year he dropped out. Once he dropped out he started acting odd. Recently he got really into reading Hebrew and he shaved his head. He posts on Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram multiple times a day. And his posts barely make sense. He tries to use math to explain Hebrew and English. I don’t think anyone understands what he is trying to say. He also posts pictures of himself doing really weird stuff at the gym. 

Could he be in the early phases of schizophrenia? His behavior has completely changed over the past two years. Everyone that knows him is either concerned or just making fun of him. And if he is showing signs of schizophrenia how should we approach him about it, because I’m sure he thinks he is fine and has just awoken. 

Any advice or or links to what to do would be greatly appreciated"

617,Excessively Crying,"I don't understand why I've been crying so much lately. I recently got in a new relationship, some back story I was in a abusive relationship for 4 years. I don't know if it's PTSD or something else like depression. I was single for year in a half so I can heal from my past relationship. I don't understand why I've been crying so much. My new partner treats me really well. He will go out of his way to spend time with me and tell me that everything is okay. He is the most loving person I've been with and he is mentally stable which is new to me. I just don't want my over crying to hinder our relationship. I call him alot when I'm upset with something. He always takes the time and talks to me making sure that I'm okay. He gives me  alot comfort and makes me happy. I just want to get my over crying under control."
618,Is there any chance that depression could turn out to be undiagnosed/untreated ADHD?,Was just curious if this is a thing that happens.
619,"i think i may have manic depression, but also struggle with the thought that i'm overreacting","i'm going to start this off by saying i don't think this is going to be well written. but more a flow of my thoughts at the moment. &amp; that bothers me because i majored in journalism &amp; minored in writing.

but for the past few years, i've suspected that i may be bipolar / manic depressive. i'm a person who loves staying active, i work out \~5x a week &amp; like staying busy &amp; feel good when i'm productive. but then i'll fall into periods where i'll barely move. i have no motivation for my job, no motivation to talk to people &amp; no motivation to get up &amp; get out &amp; work out. i come to conclusions that nothing matters. during these periods i do the bare minimum at my job (like truly, minimum) &amp; i overeat A LOT. which in turn makes me feel worse. but yet, i keep doing it. i'll also become super hyperactive at points. over-talking, making lots of jokes, coming to a ""who the fuck"" cares attitude &amp; acting ""insanely silly."" also when these kinds of episodes are going on, i thought, which i've thought for years, that i have sleep paralysis, but now i'm thinking i may be having hallucinations. this ""sleep paralysis"" occurs at the same time when these episodes are going on. when i'm falling asleep, i have mostly auditory hallucinations of things being said or noises that aren't actually happening. sometimes it's just clicks, but other times it's been some pretty scary shit. a few weeks ago i thought i heard someone in my hallway screaming ""he's killing me."" it wasn't happening. im always aware these are hallucinations when i come to out of my almost asleep state. 

when i was younger i had more suicidal thoughts &amp; did engage in self-harm, but i don't do that now &amp; don't really have any suicidal thoughts.

my grandma was bipolar &amp; my sister is bipolar (type 2 i think?) &amp; schizophrenic.

i'm the kind of person who deals w/ shit on my own. i'm the peacemaker in my family &amp; friend group and pride myself on being someone people i love can count on, so i don't air my own shit often. but i'm embarrassed and confused &amp; feel like i'm overreacting when i think about getting help &amp; feel like i wouldn't be able to accurately describe what's going on to someone professionally without actually being in this state because i downplay it all. or maybe i'm not. maybe i'm ""up-playing"" it.

i don't really know how to go forward. i guess i'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or if this is normal or if anyone else really struggled with the thought of getting help &amp; if they really need it &amp; actually being able to talk if/when they did choose to talk to someone."
620,what helps you guys feel better,just wondering what helps you guys get through hard times
621,I’m done with society.,"I’m honestly just over it. There’s no help for people with mental problems so I sit here all fucking day with mood swings from happy to the point of wanting to die. There’s no help if you’re not financially set. People don’t give a flying fuck about people like me because I’m broke. 

I’m so lost with life. I’m so done with having no one that understands or is willing to help me. I’m just so upset over how my life is and I can’t change it. I can’t change the fact that I feel bipolar with no way to get a. Diagnosis or medication to help me.

Why does no one care about me, why is society only focused on money, I don’t have any way out of my situation. I’ll be surprised if I even get a reply, I’ve tried posts before with no outcome. At least typing it helps slightly."
622,The end of the begenning.,"Last week I [25M] was formally diagnosed with ADHD. I also met markers for severe depression, some OCD-like tendencies (constantly cleaning the house, proper placement of items, etc.), and generalized anxiety disorder. This came after months of ups and downs, mood swings and breakdowns. Ca. 2018 I even contemplated killing myself a couple of times. My upbringing was something of a trip and it took years of therapy, journaling, and rebuilding myself to escape the damage that it caused. All that being said, I couldn't be happier. Finally I feel like I am able to name my demons and subsequently reduce their power over me. I'm not looking for advice or applause. I just wanted to share and let anyone struggling with similar issues that the best step to take is often the hardest one, but my god is it worth it."
623,I went way out of my comfort zone for the first time in a very long time and asked a friend to lunch (I have severe social anxiety that I have struggled with a long time and have never been able to do this). This is the response that I got from another friend who knows ab my issues.,"Here’s how our convo went 
Me “guess what I did! I asked [friend] to lunch! We are going on Saturday”

Him” cool”

Me “oof I thought it was a bit more exciting but that’s aight! Heck remember you even made a deal with me to get me to text a friend one week lol.”

Him “and then you didn’t do I stopped trying”

Me “oof but look I’m starting now tho! I mean isn’t that better than never?  But ig it’s not really that great. I’m sorry I just thought It was something good. Is everything ok tho?

Him “can’t you just let me be”


End of convo. Like legit I really felt proud of myself and this person knew I’ve been struggling with my anxiety for years. When I finally take the first step in a very long time to get better this is what I get. Was what I did not good enough?"
624,Medication withdrawl concerns,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub for medication related questions but I need advice. My doctors office has been stingy about responding to my pharmacy’s authorization request to refill my Sertaline 50mg. I’m completely out and it’s been about five days since I’ve taken it. I also have recently started taking 50mg Trazodone, both of these medications are for anxiety. Should i worried about withdrawals from Sertaline if I’m still on the Trazodone speaking as they both treat the same thing. I should get a refill within the next few days. Haven’t had any major symptoms yet besides waking up sweaty in the night despite not being hot."
625,How to stop feeling so much sadness?,"Hello everyone! This last few months I've been feeling very sad and hopeless, and I believe it's mainly because of how disappoined I am about people. I'm tired of how cold and selfish people are being to each other during this pandemic. I'm tired of the media, with all their fearmongering. I'm tired of the system that caused this illness and it's destroying the planet. Honestly, I'm at a low point myself, so all this is becoming too overwhelming, too much for me to manage. My dad died last year, I'm disemployed and now I'm questioning my career decisions. I wanted to help people, but now I'm wondering if I really want to help anyone. Idk I'm very tired, these last few years have been really hard, and things just keep getting harder. I've noticed that the more hopeless I am, the more intense my anxiety is. Lately I haven't been able to sleep, because of it. I don't know what to do, please help."
626,Any songs to help cope with my anxiety?,I’m currently having a existential crisis and I don’t want to go into details but are there any songs you may know that leave positive messages or help you go through it? Please comment because that would really help me.
627,Friends mental health,"So, my ex and decided that it would be better if we break up few months ago but agreed to stay friend. He has helped me a lot with my depression and panic attacks.

I noticed that he was feeling down for quite a while now, and I try my best to help him but I'm not a health professional so I can't do much. So, I asked him if he wanted to call a social worker ( we have a 24/7 line that we can call in case we need to talk ). They really helped me and all social worker that I talked to there, they were all very nice and I liked them a lot, even if we only talked once.

He told me that he's mental health isn't important and he's just going to deal with it. I tried to convince him that he matters and he's health too but he doesn't believe me.

I'm scared for him that he's going to fall into a depression, because I'm pretty sure he's going to do just like me and wait way too long before trying to get help.

What can I do to help him?"
628,Hello,"I see things all the time that others don't. I see monsters and other things daily. I have gotten to the point that what I see isn't real. However, family has said my house is haunted and others say I have demons. I don't tell them about the things I see. I know religious people say things like that because of my mental problems. However, it still makes me wonder. I see things scratching on my windows or following me, among other things."
629,Sleeping,"Lately I have been having issues with sleeping, and getting anxiety right before I’m about to fall asleep. I can start to feel a panic attack come on, and then I start making myself have more anxiety. And this cycle will continue throughout the night until my body snaps out of it enough to sleep. I struggle in general with anxiety, and especially with everything going on in the world today, of course it’s going to be heightened. I can’t afford to go to a doctors to talk to someone, and therapy is not an option with insurance (which I don’t have). Any suggestions from anyone who also struggles? I do smoke weed to help, but sometimes that will induce a panic attack if I do so in the wrong state of mind. I just don’t understand the sudden panic RIGHT before I’m about to doze off. Thank you for reading and any responses!"
630,Selfish act but for good reason,"I did a selfish thing today but I really feel it's for a good reason. I'm married and we do our best to be open and honest with each other. Today I did something selfish that is literally just for me because I hate this about me. I decided to get / sign up for a medical procedure that is done over the course of sessions or years. (Laser hair removal) I am a female and I suffer from a condition that causes me to have excessive dark hair over places like my stomach that normally a female wouldn't have. I also have the amazing talent of growing a beard and mustache. 
I'm aware I can shave but that also makes it worse because I get irritation and pimples and such. I did research and I really feel like this is an amazing thing. We discussed it but I think he gave me mixed signals and now that I have sign up for it he is furious. Now I'm beating myself up for finally taking a leap that will make me feel better about myself and stop reminding me that i have this condition. 

This condition already makes me suffer for so many other things in my life. I dont want to have to shave places that normal women dont have to. I want to be able to wear my work shirt and not have a chin hair get caught in it and ripped out of my face. (It fucking hurts). I want to not feel disgusted with myself. I did a selfish thing today. 

I'm so afraid that my husband wont love me anymore or want to be around me anymore all because I did a selfish thing today. 

Im going to cry myself to sleep. Beating myself up mentally because I dont deserve to feel like everyone else and be comfortable with myself."
631,"If it's really depression and GAD, why has nothing worked?","I've been had several different types of therapy, including CBT, DBT &amp; groups; plus I've tried over a dozen different types of medications over the last 20 years.

Nothing, not even a religious daily exercise regimen and losing nearly all of my excess weight has helped. I can't shake this constant state of ennui, and I still have sporadic anxiety ""spirals"" as well as a mind I can't ""shut off"" which makes falling asleep take hours sometimes.

Nothing brings enjoyment. Sex. Video games. Nothing. Literally everything takes way more emotional and mental effort than it should. Is this a normal part of aging? I'm approaching middle age and I'm starting to get worried that I'm destined to be the stereotypical ""grumpy old man"" hermit type of I can't course correct soon.

Thanks for reading this vent...and for any advice you might have. Gonna stay the current course of meds and therapy until Covid settles down and then ask to change meds again I suppose...idk..."
632,Finally booked in to headspace!!!,"I finally did it !!!! I’m so proud and excited! This is first time in my 21 years of life to reach out and get the help I need! 

I know I’m going to shit myself with the initial GP appointment next week but fuck it !!!! 

I really hope this is a turning point in my life.... it is well overdue! This space has literally made it a lot easier to reach out!"
633,My therapist sent me to get tested for covid based off of one symptom.,"This happened today and I’m still really really shook up. I don’t even know if I’m posting this in the right place. I just don’t know what to do. 

I went to visit my therapist, which I’m usually excited for. I like talking to him about my feelings because he gives me good advice and I had a lot of things I wanted to talk about. 

So I started talking about how I’ve been feeling physically. I said I’ve been depressed because I’ve been fatigued and I don’t feel like I’m getting some stuff done. I mention when I started feeling fatigued is when I started my period, which was HEAVY and lasted 10 days and was heavy the whole time. I’m also an overweight person working a job where I run around a lot. Add the mask and the heat and It’s exhausting. 

He asked me about being short of breath. I’m no more short of breath than any other fat person running around. He says I need to get tested for covid ASAP. He ends the session a half hour early and even calls the place and tells them I’m going to be there. I’m in tears as he rushes me out the door. 

I get in the car and drive to the place. I call them to make sure there isn’t any other procedures I need to take and I can just walk in there. 
They said in order to have a free test I need to see my doctor first, which to my therapist wasn’t the option. So, I might be paying out of pocket for this. 

Anyway, I go in and meet with the provider in there. 

I explain what’s been going on and she even says I’m probably just anemic after having such a strong period. My temp was 98.4. She did a nose swab and said I’m probably fine since my nose wasn’t clogged or anything. She really had to dig around. 

I leave and call all the people I’ve been in contact with. Everyone is pretty upset that my therapist would take this to this level but they were grateful I called. My dad is absolutely livid. No one is mad at me yet which is what I was kinda scared of. 

My anxiety is through the roof and I feel terrible for not taking covid into consideration when thinking about how I’ve been feeling. I’m depressed and feeling extreme guilt. I haven’t stopped shaking since he said to leave. I’m not worried about me having but the thought of giving it to people I was with kills me. 
But I only had one symptom that was pretty understandable considering my circumstances. Everyone I talked to said if they were just fatigued, they wouldn’t have thought it either. 

I’m really lost. Should I be upset with him for taking my explainable fatigue and making me get tested or should I be understanding and forgive him and keep seeing him once this is over? 
I know the virus is real and scary but I really don’t think I have it. I don’t know anyone who did. I live in a county where an average of 5 people test positive per week."
634,weird energy in chest??,"for years I've had this occasional energy in my chest. lately it's been getting worse and I'd really like to know if anyone else has it or knows what on earth it is.

it mostly happens if I try doing crafts or hobbies such as drawing, coloring, or writing. it makes having any hobbies completely unenjoyable for me. lately it's getting worse and even just scrolling through social media I feel it. hell even just typing this now I'm feeling it. it feels like I'm about to take off like an airplane. like there's a big ball of energy in my chest that has no place to go. it's incredibly uncomfortable.

I'm on Lexapro and yes I do believe meds make it somewhat worse but I do remember having this as a child when I was not on meds."
635,Malcolm Myatt is a man who could no longer feel sadness due to stroke. Is it possible to recreate this?,"Have scientists discovered a way to recreate the psychological situation this man went through? Maybe they some sort of medicine or antidepressant that reshapes your brain to match his. Lobotomy that rearranges your brain. Or maybe just straight up giving you a stroke exactly like his. Have they not done intensive research on this man? Depression could finally be cured. Those who no longer want to feel the pain of existence could simply just take ""Myatt's condition."" I want to know how he feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I haven't looked through all the Google results, it seems that most of the entries about Myatt are just news articles."
636,Small Rant/vent,"Yesterday I sprained my ankle when I was practicing skateboarding and I had to phone a friend and get her help going back home. Today the same friend took me to a clinic and I ended up getting crutches, but for some reason I feel guilty. Not only do I feel like I wasted her time, but I also feel like I should’ve just suck it up and taken the pain and not be too dramatic. I also noticed that most of the friends I thought would ask if I was okay didn’t and/or have not checked up on me. I feel that thinking like that is selfish, but it also makes me a bit sad noticing that. On another note, there’s an event I’ve been anticipating since March happening next week but due to COVID it was changed online. Because of this, my role is not as important anymore but it also seems like most people aren’t as motivated as I was for the event and it makes me really unmotivated and hard to communicate and help them out. Now with all of that, I feel very bad reaching out to friends for help knowing they are all stressing out right now as well bc of said event and even when I do reach out to people I feel more guilty and worse than when I just kept it to myself. I’m not really sure why I feel this way, but it bothers me that I can’t genuinely see someone wanting to help me and listen to me out. I guess I don’t want them seeing me differently, but I also don’t see how to reach out to them because in the end I always just end up making jokes or convincing myself it’s not that important and I should just move on and stayed quiet to begin with. I’m not really sure how to stop this mindset from happening, I do understand asking and giving help goes both ways but I don’t want my friends to see me as selfish, dumb, or over dramatic for some of the things that go on in my head. And even though I know they won’t think that way, I can’t stop my head from thinking that they do which I think it’s unfair for me to do. I’m very confused and I just needed to vent this out somewhere. Thank you."
637,What are some daily habits/routines that you put in place to keep your mental health on track?,"Do you like to plan out and structure your whole day; do you have a to do list of the bare minimum you want to complete? 


Is there anything that is red flag for you if you fail to complete (some examples: particular chores, or neglecting exercise, forgetting to journal, neglecting hygiene, etc)?


I know everyone is different in regards to what works/helps and heals them. I've been watching some vlogs and reading posts and I'm curious as to what everyone's routine is, if any at all. What is most important to you to focus on in your day, etc.?


How has the pandemic changed your routine, if at all?"
638,I feel like I’m drowning,"I am getting a proper bipolar diagnosis next week. Everyone says that things will get better, but I’ve been going through this shit for 4-6 years (I’m fairly young so that’s a long time for me). 

I’ve tried every coping mechanism in the books. I have went to therapists and took dozens of different medications.

I honestly feel hopeless. It takes all of my energy every night not to kill myself. I’m exhausted and don’t know what to do. Thanks for reading my rant.

I don’t know how much longer I can hang on."
639,Is it normal to consider suicide under emotional duress?,"Hi, I'm Ellie, I've never been officially diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything. I dont have the best relationship with my family. I'm an lesbian 20yo woman, and I often feel like they dont care about my feelings, what I have to say, they belittle and mock me, they are passively homophobic/racist/sexist and when I try to correct them or discuss it with them they never listen or care to change. Even some of my closest relatives who I love and care about do this from time to time, and sometimes that can hurt more.

I've been emotionally stunted for years. I feel like I dont have healthy responses to things. If a woman in her 40s or 50s says something to me in a mildly challenging or authoritative voice I involuntarily feel the need to cry. Its overwhelming. And usually when a family member close to me does something that hurts me or leads to an arguement, I get usually get that feeling. So I leave the area, start crying heavily, and start to get really terrible thoughts.

I've frequently considered suicide as a way to express the pain they've caused me. It's the only way I can imagine they'd feel regret or remorse for their actions. I've never verbalized this to them, as its textbook emotional manipulation to threaten suicide, but I can't help thinking it when I'm upset. Trigger warning, but it's gotten to points where I've theorized how to kill myself in moments of duress, such as slitting my wrists, walking into traffic, or swimming out into the center of a lake until I'm too tired to swim anymore.

I've never gone through with any of these thoughts, and I dont cut myself or hurt myself. I just feel like they'll never understand without some severe consequence that they cant undo how these things hurt me or grind me down over time. I dont know if this is normal or if I should seek help or medication. And to be honest I kind of just needed a place to vent my emotions after a very similar incident happened today with my Aunt.

Tldr: I've had thoughts of suicide when my family hurts me emotionally, should I seek help?"
640,persavise unhappiness,why don’t i ever feel genuinely happy? there’s nothing and no one i live for. i’m just numb and empty inside and i haven’t felt bliss for about a year now. is something wrong with me??
641,Has anyone tried virtual or over the phone therapy sessions and is it effective for you?,I’m hesitant towards spending money on therapy during Covid times where I will only be able to talk to my therapist through a video call. I don’t really have the money to go back to a therapist but I really need it currently. I just know myself and I get really anxious talking over video calls/telephone and i know it won’t give me the same in person connection feeling I need with my therapist to really be open with my feelings. Does anyone have any experience with therapy over video call or telephone? How is your experience?

643,I keep feeling this anger inside of me,"Hi, I'm a sixteen year old girl who is mentally ill. A couple months back I started taking zoloft for my depression and anxiety. At first it was working wonders, I was motivated, energized and optimistic. But this last month I've been nothing but agitated, angry and depressed. I understand that meds don't get rid of the depression, but I really dislike the effects I'm feeling. I have also been having (TW) self harm and suicidal thoughts, but I don't want to act on them. I am argumentative and heated all the time and I don't even notice that I'm arguing with anyone until they get angry! I have no ill will towards anyone but I constantly start shit, even tho I don't want to. I honestly don't know what to do, I have a med check in two weeks so I just have to deal. I'm also grounded for two weeks, I can't see anyone and I can't have my phone after 11 pm. That is definitely not helping. I wish I knew what to do, it's so much to handle and I just feel all this anger for no reason in my chest and it won't go away."
644,What country has the best mental institutions?,"For lifetime, free care

Please. This is urgent"
645,Why do I feel guilty about the most stupid stuff??,"I will often feel SUPER guilty about things not worthy of being guilty over, I have no control over, don't affect anyone, or just don't make sense. Like how I felt so so bad I didn't read the entire article on the benefits of oats beans berries ect for school just now. Because someone put ""hard work into it"" and I kind of made it for nothing at that point when I copy and pasted it. Or when I don't like a post on instagram I feel like they aren't getting what they deserve because I didn't like the post even if I don't take interest in the content but especially if I do. Is this common? Is this related to my depression, anxiety, aspergers, adhd? Or something else? IDK just want some opinions."

649,What can I do.,I'm tired of hearing thoughts and feelings. I'm tired of seeing things no one else does. I'm tired of of hearing voices. I'm tired of all these things.
650,I just need some advice,"So, every time I feel that I have made progress and that my thoughts and mood are improving significantly something eventually happens that upsets me a lot or something and suddenly I feel like I'm right back at the start with no progress made, like my bad thoughts, low mood and all the other awful things come back, what am I doing wrong and what can I do to try to make sure my progress sticks and is more permanent? I know there are ups and downs with mental health journeys and getting better but it's becoming more of a stalemate than a journey at this point and I'm getting very sick of it."
651,I need advice. My life isn't the best.,[removed]
652,Loser,I deserve nothing except eternal torment.
653,"No Purpose, Passion, Or Motive","Nothing really drives me. I don’t have any sort of project or hobby that I can spend countless hours working on. I don’t have any real plans or life goals. I just exist, and it’s awful. How am I supposed to figure out why I’m here on Earth? How long will it take? What am I supposed to do until then? I just feel empty all of the time. I’m at the point in my life where so many people in my (19M) age group are starting to figure their life out, making amazing art, stories, music, etc. You can see a bunch of it right here on this site. I’m not doing anything! I contribute nothing of value, and I guess that I don’t care enough to change anything, because I’m still here feeling demotivated and awful."
654,I don’t deserve the life,I got it good in life. People around me got it hard out here but I’m out here being sad. I’m fuckin pathetic and annoying. My life should be taken away from me; I don’t deserve to live.
655,I CANT TAKE THIS ANYMORE IM GONNA KILL MYSELF AT ANY MOMENT,I am so angry i cant sleep i dont eat i get irritated easily im stuck at home i cant enjoy the things i used to i want this to end i wanna get back to work see my friends hang out or SOMETHING IF I STAY ONE MORE DAY IT WILL BE MY END
656,What's better?,Dying and making your family grieve you or being a living disappointment and burden to them? At least grieving passes and they could still live happily for the rest of their lives instead of me dragging them down.
657,My heart was broken,"On Valentine's day of this year I was going to tell someone who I really loved how I felt about them. I went all out and bought flowers, balloons, and stuffed animals but they didn't feel the same. Nearly every day since then I end up in my bed crying myself to sleep. It's gotten to the point of whenever anything remotely bad happens I go to the bathroom, my bed, or somewhere secluded and cry my heart out. How would I go about recovering from this?"
658,A strange feeling I have. Am I ok?,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a strange underlying feeling/fear in the back of my head. Whenever a noise is sped up or slowed down to a specific speed that I cannot describe, I feel an immense form of dread and started freaking out a lot. I have nightmares relating to this sometimes that often feature cryptic imagery that I can’t recall after waking up, but still with movement and noise at a slowness that gives me that very horrible feeling. Is there something going on in my head I should be worried about?"
659,I'm not sure what to do,"*Just writing down whatever comes to my mind. Will probably post the same in a couple other subreddits*

So, M(21)y girlfriend (long distance relationship) has depression (from a past relationship plus family issues) and her parents are not really the kind who 'believe' anything like that happens. Moreover, they are separated (not divorced) and always put her in between and give no fucks about anything happening to her (I would refer to my girlfriend as 'her'/'she' throughout). She doesn't like either of her parents since they have really been treating her like shit; her dad lives and works in my home town (I study elsewhere) while her mom lives in a different place a bit closer to where she goes to college. She had gone to stay at her father's for a week when suddenly the entire country was put under lockdown and she had to stay 3 months on the trot with a very toxic father who always feels like she should be constantly grateful for everything he's done for her and that he didn't throw her to the streets. During her period cramps, he didn't believe that it pains and forced her to so some household chores which led to her fainting, which he also called fake. Plus he kept shouting at the top of his voice all the time which led to partial hearing loss for her and she slept around 3-4 hours per day the entire period of time. We pleaded her mom to file a complaint or do something about it but she was unbothered by it all.

We somehow got her out of the place to a flat which she shares with two other near her college in another city, lying to her dad about why she's going away. In this new place too she's suffering a lot because one of the flatmates eats up her food and does not take any precautionary measures while going to her workplace, doesn't clean up after coming back and sleeps with other guys at their houses not caring about the pandemic. The other flatmate doesn't even stay there right now. Also the flat has 5-6 hours of electricity shut off each day due to some maintenance going on. You can understand what her situation is

Also her dad doesn't pay her any money really. She's searching for a part time job or internship very eagerly but hasn't been able to get one so far. This and a whole lot of other problems too.

You might ask how this is relevant? Because this is where I come in. I've been kinda the only person who's been with her throughout everything. She doesn't really have any friends providing actual support, just saying ""It must be tough for you. But hold on"". I've been the guy she tells everything to. I've been the person staying awake leaving everything I have if my own to take care of her and her feelings. To uplift her and help her in any way and to pull her ahead on the darkest days when she went towards the edge of giving up her life. Till today every second awake I've tried to remain if she needs someone to talk to or needs any help. Why I do it is because firstly I adore her and secondly I'm scared because she actually has no one except me.

And all this has affected me a lot too I admit. Now a bit about me. I have never been diagnosed professionally but I show symptoms of ADHD. I suffer very severely from procrastination and I have tried getting help for that. I get really anxious moments whenever a deadline comes near because I always put off eveything till the last possible minute. This happens very frequently and I really feel low and defeated in those moments.

And that is what is happening now. I have to finish a compulsory project in ny department that I was given months to work on and I only have about 13 days left for it. This project is supposed to be under the guidance of a professor but my prof has been really unhelpful and has just stated the topic on which to work on. This is a topic which would need the help of someone with more advanced knowledge but I'm afraid to ask my prof (or any other prof in my department for that matter) because he is quite moody.

I've been putting off so much for two reasons, because I've been really busy taking care of my partner and because I have this very irritating habit of procrastination on everything.

I would gladly acknowledge any help/advice coming my way (regarding her problems as well as mine).  And if you've actually read this entire thing with patience you're really awesome"
660,Question,I deserve nothing. I have gotten mad at people and was married with kids. My kids were brought up in poverty. I deserve nothing.
661,Does my partner deserve better?,"I have depression and anxiety disorder as well as substance abuse (alcohol). For the most part, the substance abuse is manageable (2 weeks sober!) but the depression comes in waves I have no control over. I go weeks at a time without leaving my bed except to pee or refill my water cup. My partner is generally happy, successful, extroverted, and bubbly. I constantly feel like a burden and I feel so shitty about it but I can’t help it. What’s the right thing to do here?? Should we break up so my partner can move on to happier/healthier people?"
662,Looser,Why am I still alive? Nothing I have done has helped anyone.
663,Does anyone else get angry easy?,"I haven't always been like this, but I have gotten very stressed and my family situation is really bad. I've gotten in two arguments recently, one of which was my fault for getting annoying and angry without meaning to, and I apologised and my dad asked if I was actually mad at my step mom or if I was just upset in general. (He was out of town and I was at home with my step mom). I confided in my step mom about being constantly sad and upset lately and I can't seem to feel better. All she told me is that 'you shouldnt be sad, you have everything you need'. I just want to know if anyone else has similar experiences, and if so how should I try to handle this? I'm just avoiding talking to people in my house. I'm eating dinner late at night, I only eat once a day normally anyway. I also go outside to skateboard, go on a run, or call my boyfriend to avoid the anxiety being at home gives me."

665,Done I'm shit.,50 more.
666,Talking out loud to myself.,"I do this a lot, I just randomly say things out loud. I'm only 21 so I doubt it's something major but I been doing this since I was 14-15. Like right now I would say ""Frank, I fucking hate you"" really loud and go back to what I'm doing, but it's been happening more and more frequently when I by myself, sometimes I sound incoherent and just say anything and it makes no sense."
667,I'm tired of this social isolation,"I've had a psychosis twice and it was so scary, I have felt an intense emotional pain that was exhausting and I am still trying to heal from it. 

I have lost friends because of a psychosis, over things I had no control over because I say things I normally wouldn't and it scared people away. Even though I was not myself. And now I have no real life friends and I feel like it is going to be like that for the rest of my life. I do talk to people online, but it is not the same as real life friends and I want to be inspired by people for my writing as I am trying to write this book - to accomplish something. 

I have a job that I don'f like. 

What I do every day is just a few hours of work twice a week, watching tv shows, reading, sitting behind the computer, trying to work on my novel project. 

And nobody in my enviroment seems to understand the mental health issues I had, after my second psychosis last year I feel scared all the time. 

I feel stuck, and I don't know how to improve my life. I am at the bottom of the social ladder and I don't know how to climb my way up. 

And here I am, feeling sorry for myself again, sometimes I feel this resentment towards people and how everything is just unfair. Are people who have had a psychosis condemmed to a life of loneliness? Isolation? 

I don't want to live this way."
668,What's wrong with me?,[removed]
669,Should I ask my parents if I can try to get medication?,"I’ve had a severe panic disorder since I was 6-7 and It just keeps getting worse. At first, learning about it helped the panic attacks calm down but now it’s not enough. I know why I am the way I am so it’s not helping to reread the same things about it. I want to see a psychiatrist again and see if I can be prescribed anything because for years now this anxiety has prevented me from lots of things.

It’s been ruining my chance at a decent childhood for the past 7-8 years. I couldn’t stay over anyone’s house for very long (meaning a few hours), sometimes I have to stay home from school, it stops me from sleeping most days, it stops me from taking opportunities that would be good for me, the list goes on and on. It also doesn’t help that I’m kind of a hypochondriac. Whenever I had a panic attack when I was little I thought there was something wrong with me and was always worried about getting sick since illnesses run in my family, I visited the hospital and the doctors office frequently and still do."
670,COVID and mental health,"I don’t know how many of you can relate to this but I feel like the pandemic has dramatically changed me and I don’t know how long after this is all over it will take for my mind to get back to normal.

Like I’ll watch a youtube video or something and my heart starts racing and my first thoughts are “why aren’t they wearing masks or social distancing?” when in reality it was pre-pandemic. Everything I watch and think of now is through a COVID lens.

Even when I see friends (social distanced of course) or I am just in public, I am constantly trying to measure how far I am from others in my head. And I still feel isolated even when I see friends because we cant sit next to each other on a couch and every action is so measured and calculated.

I know these are small things and all caused by a current event... but can anyone relate? I just see myself struggling even once this eventually ends getting back to normal life. I really hate this..."
671,Does anyone else feel like this?,"Okay so this might be a long post but I'll try and make it not so word-y. I sort of had an epiphany this morning but I'm not sure what it means or what to do about it. Just wanting to see if anyone has any similar experiences.


For the record- I am 23 and have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, among other things, by a medical professional. 


Basically the conclusion I have come to is that I was raised in an abusive and toxic household that showed no signs of love or how to treat someone properly, (parents always fought physically &amp; verbally, neither of them ever had any friends or did anything but be narcissistic or have a drinking problem &amp; neglectful).  I had one friend from birth, until I was 15 and then they left me without an explanation or ever talking to me again.  I havent had a best friend since then, and no friendships that I have had have ever lasted over like a year or a year and a half. On the off chance that they did, they've been up and down, and just overall toxic.

 I did have a friend group for 4 years in college, but they all dropped me and blocked me over one argument that was a misunderstanding. Probably a solidification of all of the years of the toxic up and downs. I feel like I can't connect with people, if I do it's very rare, but I feel like an alien and theres an invisible wall between me and everyone else. I think I know them really well and that they know me, I consider that a really great friendship, but in reality it's all just surface level. I don't have anyone I could immediately go to with problems or really share a connection with. The people I do think I have this with are always people I like romantically. Since all of my friends I've ever had have left me, I can't make connections with people without them ending in a complete massacre, and us never speaking again. I now have a major fear of abandonment &amp; rejection from these relationships and other things. (hello BPD).

 So since I have all of that in my ever growing bag of baggage,  (it's like Hermione's beaded bag, it never ends) I've noticed that I put every single strain on my romantic relationships. I get super obsessed and I think I'm connecting really well with someone when I'm talking to a potential romantic partner, or even when we actually date, if we date.  I think this is because I dont have any other healthy relationships &amp; I desperately want to find that one person again who will stay with me and love me and we can work through stuff together because that's what good healthy real love is supposed to be right?? Except I'm not entirely sure if I even know what that is, because I never got to see it as a child, and any of my relationships that I've had as an adult have been explosive and just generally a rollercoaster and short-lived.

 I put every expectation on my romantic relationships because maybe it's the one good thing I might actually be able to have, and be good at, since nothing else ever seems to work out for me, and I want to find a best friend and partner in one person, but I also want other friends. I just can't seem to make them or keep them, but that's definitely not fair to my partner because that in itself is unhealthy. I feel like I'm trying to stuff all of my blocks into my relationship bag when they don't belong to, or fit in there, because I dont have any other bags to put them in. The relationship bag also has holes. Lol. If that makes sense. 

I told this to the last therapist I had, and I feel as if it's a decent metaphor. I feel like a sponge sometimes. Some people, you can run their sponge under water (water is love, attention, validation, etc.) And, like sponges usually do, they'll eventually get full and you have to squeeze them out so they can accept more water. However, my sponge never gets full when you run it under water. 

My emotions are so high and rocky with the BPD and I feel as if other people think I'm crazy since I tend to base my happiness on other people. I'm working on that through self love, but it's how my brain works and it's something that takes years and years to change. I'm just hoping that I'm not the only one who struggles with issues like this as an adult. Most people my age have healthy boundaries (I dont even know what boundaries are, really.) and relationships. It's tough realizing that it's hard for me to have those. 

If anyone has gone through similar problems, if you'd be willing to share some advice or personal experiences, anything would be appreciated."
672,I hate myself.,I hate myself. Everything I have done has never produced anything good. I try to help others but my help does nothing to change. I deserve to feel pain all my life/for ever.

676,I was suggested to bring this post here to seek a bit more guidance,
677,Feeling helpless,Lately I have just been going through it but have never really felt this down. I feel like crying out to someone for help or guidance but as I look around I don’t feel like anyone would answer or even understand what I’m going through. I’m in the military and I those who cry out for help are labeled as “weak” and then made fun of. I have 1 friend I consider close but she has her own problems and I don’t feel like adding more to her plate. I just feel like keeping everything I’m feeling inside is going to hurt me in the long run.
678,I just need to get some stuff off my chest.,"I was psychologically abused for 9 years by my father. Years later it happened again by a boyfriend who manipulated me and threatened to kill himself if I didn’t give him things. As a result I constantly apologize to people in fear of them leaving me because I’ve done something wrong. I’ve also grown to dislike myself, but I’m sure this is just teenage hormones. I feel like an entitled bitch for constantly crying about my feelings because I’ve been holding them in for 9 years. I feel that because there are so many problems in the world I don’t get to be sad just because I was traumatized as a child. My dad is cool now, he fixed himself and saved our family and I forgave him because it wasn’t completely his fault. I never forgot, though. I still cry about it. I still cry whenever someone tells me they’re proud of me because I never had that. I’ve always felt like my feelings didn’t matter because other people were suffering so much more than me. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Why I’m so sensitive, why I’m constantly degrading myself. I’m confused. I’m sad. I don’t know who to turn to. I feel like a burden."
679,"I've been putting off getting help for a very long time, where do I go?","I've been in and out of depression for years and (I know you're not supposed to self diagnose, but reading what other people say, what doctors say, and what the dsm5 criteria are, im 99% sure) I have undiagnosed ADHD, I live in Chandler Arizona, where can I go for help?"

685,I have a lot of self hate,"It has to do with my lack of willpower in doing things, mostly cause of ADHD, I dislike getting praise, and always seem to mess things up no matter how much I try to meditate and do coping methods to deal with my ADHD."
686,"Diagnose me please. I was told I have BPD, but could I have something else?","I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) a few years ago.  I only got diagnosed this because I was arrested and the lawyer that I wasted money on thought that by seeing a therapist it would help my case, which it did not.  So I wasted money on a therapist and on a lawyer, and still went to jail.  I already knew I was crazy, I didn't want to pay for confirmation.  Anyway, I am  wondering if there is another type of personality disorder that I have?  Here are things about me.

&amp;#x200B;

* I grew up with very few friends.  No birthday parties, sleepovers, etc.  I dated several girls but it never lasted long.
* I was not good at sports and never felt like part of the team when I played, so I always wanted us to lose.  It made me feel good to see my teammates upset as a kid when we lost, since I sat on the bench.
* I like seeing people hurt and killed.  I love a news story about a mass shooter, terrorist, or other violent criminal.  In my mind I'm thinking, good job!
* I lost my virginity to a prostitute at age 19.  Been with hundreds of girls, both prostitutes and girls I just hooked up with since then.  One long term (3 year) relationship which I cheated many times.  Happily single now.
* I did good in school in the STEM subjects, better than everyone else actually, got awards and scholarships, but people didn't like me.
* I think hackers are awesome!
* I hate my country.  I would rather join a hacking or terrorist group and blow up the country rather than support it.
* I used to have many suicidal thoughts growing up.  Those have subsided, but I still do picture my death but now I want a cool death, like being a suicial bomber.
* My favorite movies are horror, thriller, crime, espionage, good dramas that involve sex and violence.
* I am not close with my family.  I don't know if I love them or hate them but would not care if they all died.  I live in a different country from them now and have no plans to ever go home.
* I like to abuse alcohol and sleep with random women.  However, I go to the gym often so I am in great shape.  If I had the chance to do some hard drugs, I would, but I don't have any connections.  I will smoke tobacco and occassional weed if given the chance.
* I am mostly a loner, keep to myself.  
* I have mood swings.  Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of the world, other times I want to be a bumb and drink myself to death and slit my own wrists.
* I like to commit crimes that I can get away with.  My record is pretty good, only been jailed and convicted once, got away with hundreds of other crimes including one that could give me 20+ years in prison!
* I used to own several guns before I moved.  I thought about shooting myself in the head on Facebook live after getting 10000 viewers.

There is my dirt.  So, is there a name for my personality?"
687,Mental health amid a pandemic,"I had hit a mental block over the past few months, what with the world in a crisis. But I finally managed to get back to writing and I've pend down what I've been ruminating over the past few weeks. I've never posted to this sub before, hope the mods do allow me to.

I'd like your opinions, comments on my post and your coping mechanisms.

Thanks in advance"
688,My friend is showing signs of schizophrenia. I don‘t know what to do,"My friend has been acting very strangely the last 2 weeks. All our friends are noticing it from her texts so another friend and I met her in person to see if she’s okay. She is NOT okay. She is extremely paranoid and delusional. Half of what she says makes no sense and the rest is ranting about the world. She keeps thinking that we’re being watched or listened. Something about apps communicating, Corona virus isn’t real, were in a simulation, etc. This is all very unusual for her to say. She forgets things very quickly. Like loses her train of thought very often and forgets where she’s going. She does random impulsive things. She thinks everything is connected somehow. Like seeing a bottle on the floor and googling it to find a deeper meaning. She even said she’s “not in touch with reality” and can’t sleep many nights. I’m no doctor but this is certainly more than stress and anxiety.

I was able to get her parents phone number and called her mom about it. But I don’t think her mom is grasping how bad it really is. Her English is also a bit rusty which doesn’t help. She did take her to the doctors but it seems nothing has come of it. My friend seems to act more normal around others. I’ve been trying to get her out the house and off her phone because social media is very triggering for her, but I’m exhausted... being with her for even a few hours is getting so overwhelming and I’m too busy to be there all the time. 

She has anxiety medication but she took it on and off and smokes. Both of which her doctor told her not to do. I can’t convince her to take this more seriously and I also don’t want to tell her I think she has schizophrenia because she would freak out on me. She’s catching on that I contacted her mom and I don’t think she trusts me anymore. What am I supposed to do..?"
689,anyone else worry about time,i have a probelm you see i have anxiexty and i worry about the time all and being late to stuff my brain goes omg i have 3 hours to go till work that isnt much time or i dont have long till that appointment so i stay home for the whole time instead of doing other things and if i do do other thing before work or an appointment i keep looking at the time and thinking i better hurry up i dont have much time i feel like i cant enjoy myself before appointments or work because i worry any suggestions please :)
690,Can’t fall asleep,The heavy feelings back and bad tonight
691,Does anyone ever get so anxious they start to check for things?,"Been going on since I was in elementary school. If I ever stayed up way too late, I'd start to get overwhelming anxiety and wouldn't be able to put myself to sleep or do anything productive, but I'd start to check for things. When I was younger, it was stuff like school forms, homework or library books. Now I check for things like my keys, debit/credit cards, a throw, etc. It's 5AM and I can't sleep but at least I know I have my SD card from my camera! 

I'm 19F and I know lots of people this age are nocturnal or regularly pull all nighters but not sleeping makes me so anxious, I'm pretty paranoid the entire day following. Usually these sleepless nights full of checking for things preface nervewracking events, like going on a family vacation or, in this case, I'm giving a speech in a day. However, sometimes they just happen when I can't sleep.

Does anyone else experience this? The anxiety over not being able to sleep? Or the constantly checking for things in a state of anxiety?"
692,Please help me!,I was getting depersonalisation very often but then it stopped and I was okay for a while until I got exposed to a lot of stress now when I wake up I go to the kitchen to cook breakfast and I just feel angry and I feel like I can't control myself (depersonalisation) until the evening. I feel very upset about that and I need help with curing it.

Employers disregard mental health issues.,"I just read this article and the headline is just so upsetting ""A young man attempts suicide due to his employer who lied about him to save herself. He is permanently damaged and a former shadow of himself."" 

The article shows that he told his employer about his mental health yet she ignored this and bullied him out of  his job. Why do some employers and companies completely disregard the mental health issues people have almost like they aren't real to them?

I am truly living paycheck to paycheck and am not sure how to get help, I seriously can't even afford ANY ""low income"" payment plans I've looked into.

697,I apologized to someone I was horrible to and she replied today,"a few years ago i was in an extremely toxic relationship. my immaturity and young age and shitty family was no excuse for how emotionally abusive i was. i imposed my mental health on this person in super traumatizing ways and as a result i severely hurt her.

i have learned now and grown, how i impacted her still haunts me. so a week ago i apologized to her. I made it clear i didnt expect anything and it wasnt about how i feel but how i made her feel with my stupid actions. i owned them and took full responsibility. i thought it out for so long. it was years ago and i was scared of opening old wounds and idk. i just settled that at the end of the day t was what was right. so i did it.

anyways she finally replied and said she doesnt accept my apology but thanks for it anyway, and that my actions caused her immense pain she can barely cope with. and to never contact her again

that is fair and i understand. i didnt reply to respect her wishes. ppl say ik i finally gave a proper apology at least but that doesnt erase her hurt. i still feel awful and i think ill always feel awful cuz i cant change the past. it feels selfish to talk about how i feel guilty bc it is about how i hurt her with my actions and not me. after all, i hurt her so bad 4 years couldnt repair her mental health. i surely deserve it, and people tell me to forgive myself but who am i to forgive myself when my actions hurt her the most? that seems masochistic to think but it seems selfish to forgive myself. i just want to go back and take it all back, i want this feeling to end. some things dont deserve forgiveness. if what i did doesnt deserve forgiveness what now?"
698,Father denies my mental health and yells at my mother,"My father is a pretty nice person, but when it comes to anything to do with my mental health he gets annoyed and denies everything. I’ve been diagnosed with autism and anxiety, I also have depression (though that hasn’t been diagnosed, but I’m pretty sure lol) and I have tics (similar to Tourette’s)

Since I was really young, my father wouldn’t let my mum get me diagnosed with anything, even thought it was clear I had mental health issues, like very obvious. Up until they got split I was never tested, even though many teachers said that they suspected something. Once they finally split I was tested and what a surprise! I has autism and anxiety. Even though I had the report my father still denied it, saying that my mother just “put it in my head” and I didn’t actually have autism. He continued to deny it for another year up until now when I started having those tics. He said my tics were just put in my head by my mother and said that I could control it. 

I tried explaining it to him, but as he continued to deny it, I got pretty annoyed and angry (btw, I start crying when I get angry, I’m not good with hiding my emotions lol) anyway, I started crying and he started asking why I was crying and said that he wasn’t angry with me, but he started getting defensive. After a bit of back and forth with him I ended getting myself into a panic attack.

Later the same day, we went to his girlfriends house, and I was still crying. She tried helping me by letting me stay in her room but after a little bit and me finally starting to calm down she came in and demanded I left the room and spent time outside, and told me to “stop making those silly noises” (but guess what, I can’t control it! Yay!) and she told me I was being silly, which to hopefully no ones surprise made me get even more upset and sad.

She left but both my father and his girlfriend came in and asked that I left the room, tried talking to me (btw, when I start to cry or get emotional, my throat kind of closes up and I can’t speak even if I wanted to) and they left. By now I’ve texted my mum asking to go home. She ended up calling my dad when I couldn’t tell her what was going on and he went outside and started to yell at her. For over half and hour I sat there hearing everything he said and it made me feel worse. He was just being defensive and denied everything.

His girlfriend came back in and tried talking to me again and demanded I went outside. When I refused she stormed off. Later my dad came back in doing the same thing and I spent an hour there trying to calm down but just being set off again when they walked in demanding I left.

I texted my mum again, asking to go home and she kept telling me to wait it out. After a bit my dad came in asking if I wasn’t ex to go home, after a bit I nodded and he drove me home. But not before the cherry in top of the story. The girlfriend asked my dad (quite loudly) “is that seriously what’s happening?” And he said yes that I shouldn’t have to be there if I wasn’t okay to be there (thanks, I guess?) and she asked if I was at least going to say goodbye.

He came back into the room and asked for me to say bye, which I did. I even said sorry to her. As I was walking out I heard her say to me.

“You’re being really disappointing! We were meant to do stuff this weekend!” In an accusatory tone. I left the house and my dad drove me home and I apologised again.

And how here we are, hope you enjoyed the show!

TLDR: Dad gets mad at my mental health, yells at my mum and dad’s girlfriend yells at me.

PS: I know this is a vent, but I just need some support in some way rn, so thank you for reading."

701,I keep obsessing over things,"I hope this is ok here cuz its definetly a mental thing.

So i have this thing where I obsess over a random set of disturbing and upsetting things that make me feel sick. These include:
- Licking a dustpan after sweeping
- eating a bug
- a bug goes in my ear/nose
- covid testing (when i got tested the thing in my nose hurt really bad and disturbed me deeply for some reason, I couldn't sleep that night because I was obsessing over it and cried because it was so disturbing/upsetting to me)

Its really fucking disgusting and it makes me feel sick and awful and its messing up my sleep because when I lay down I start to think about these things. 

Thanks for listening i just wanted to vent"
702,"I had the worst, most terrifying dread last night","So, for a while I’ve been suffering from hadephobia and depression ( both undiagnosed, but I’m going to get them diagnosed soon) So last night I had this terrible dream, where I was told that, because depression caused me to want to die, I’ll be going to hell. Now I’m so scared. Like, because of something that I can’t control, I’ll have to suffer for ever? That’s like someone going to hell because they have cancer. This is just really scary for me."
703,I've found out I'm depressed and suffer from insomnia.,"Hello everyone!
I just found out through various sources and doctors that I suffer from depression, I've been having symptoms for the last two years. I have really bad insomnia aswell(common in my family), sometimes I can't sleep for days. And to top it all off my girlfriend broke up with me, I'm 16 btw she was my first girlfriend, we've been together for 1.5 years. So all in all this made it worse. I just do not have a clue how to tackle all of this. My parents are supportive but they divorced so most of the time our talks just and up with one of them ranting on the other.
Any advice, I do not want to take antidepressants I'm very against those pills. But any help is help so I would really appreciate it. :D"
704,"I get reaching that out is hard, and the fact you're reading this means you've already taken a major step and I'm proud of you 💙","Even though I probably can't understand what you're going through I'm here to listen to you. If you need to put your heart out or want to vent, I'm willing to listen. Just know that you've got someone by side, and whatever you're going through, you don't need to go through it alone."
705,I'm absolutely positively fan-friggen-tasic but may have accidentally made a suicidal joke and I think people are a wee bit worried...,"Okay! So first things first, I have improved a whole bunch mentally! I do however have a ""If I die, I die, no biggie"" kind of point of view. But anyways, me and my friend group were being dummies in the street and then a car comes. Everyone is running out of the road while I causally walk out of the street. One of my friends said ""GET OUT OF THE ROAD! YOU'LL GET RAN OVER"" and I said something like ""Oh thank goodness! Finally!""

Someone in my group asked me if I was okay kind of half jokingly, my sister seemed really concerned, and yeah... Basically that was really uncool of me and I sounded like a wanna be edgy teenager.  I really try not to joke about my problems and this was really unlike me. Very uncool. &gt;:/

706,There's really no reason for anyone to live,"We don't have a reason to live, it's all temporary. Could just end it all right here. If someone gave me a button that would end the world when pressed, I probably would press it. Think about it, does anything really matter? The thought of being free from it all... No expectations."
707,Am I doomed to isolation?,"So I was seeing a girl recently, it was fairly casual I guess I wasn't too optimistic about the whole thing because I recently got out of a relationship. We spent about every other day together over the last 2-3 weeks. Kissed, had sex all that jazz. Then 2 days ago she told me she wasn't sure about me due to my constant worrying and negative outlook. Sadly, these are things my ex also found difficult in putting up with me.

Basically I feel like I will always fall short of people's expectations for me. I live alone, I am working in a near empty office. Every thing feels empty and isolated. And I'll acknowledge that I am reaching out for romance due to loneliness or the need to fill a void. People keep telling me that I can't love someone else until I love myself. In 26 years I cannot be sure if I've ever loved myself and I fear that I will never love myself. And although I find myself connecting socially with other ""rejects"" where we drink until dawn and use drugs and these people seem to accept me this is not the life I want for myself. I am afraid I'll be alone forever or worse end up somewhere I don't belong. 

Before someone asks, I am going back to therapy next week and I'll be talking to my doctor about my increased anxiety in the last few weeks but I am genuinely afraid nobody will ever fully accept me with all my baggage, negativity, anxiety, sadness, grief, loneliness, pain."

Please don't let yourself or anyone you care about reach this point."
709,Feels like I'm exaggerating everything,"I feel I'm exaggerating every single one of my vents to an extent just for someone to worry and care for me more. I seriously feel so abandoned if I wasn't acknowledged or appreciated by someone and it makes me feel so selfish, because all I've been doing is attention seeking without a clear image of myself or my thoughts at all.

Exaggerating things also kinda made my emotions more intense - although I'm not sure if it was originally already that bad to begin with.

It's to the point I say people abuse me so that someone would give a damn about me. Though I've been neglected and beaten all through childhood, I think I'm fortunately living fairly fine currently but my hatred for my parents just keep getting worse despite how they haven't been doing anything to me anymore.

I really want a diagnosis as I'm aware something is wrong about me since I also do sh. Just at the same time I feel it's just me taking things way too in for myself. I can't tell if I really am attention seeking or I'm suffering from some sort of mental illness anymore."

712,What could be wrong with me?,"I was at a party yesterday at a friend's house where I was supposed to sleep with some friends in a tent. I felt cold and uncomfortable there so I left the tent for other places to sleep. I only found a small bench and a blanket to cover myself.

I spent at least 2 hours walking around the yard thinking of how I could simply leave but my things were inside the host's room, which I thought would be rude to go into unprompted at 4 am. I could call, but my phone died promptly when I finally deliberated to call.

I finally went to sleep and and woke up sore from the uncomfortable position I slept in.



I feel like something is really wrong with this scenario but I can only blame myself from not thinking ahead of the situation or actually bothering the person who could help me."
713,I need some advice.,"Let me start off by saying Im 15 and I don't know if this is the correct subreddit I should be posting this in, since english is not my native language and this is the most accurate subreddit i could think of. Now my point.

Everytime I hang out with friends or I'm walking, sometimes there are certain groups of people that I'm forced to pass by since there are no other routes. When I look at these people I don't really feel like they're going to in any way hurt me, but the thing I've noticed is every time I pass by and some people from the group look at me I feel like my ego just drops instantly and my eyes start tearing up the same as if wind was blowing very hard, but that's not the case. It almost feels like they're making fun of me but I have no proof of that. I don't know what to do about this problem. Another thing is I have never hurt anyone, I've never wanted to get into fights or anything and the idea of hurting someone just makes me feel bad. Maybe it has something to do with that. Maybe I'm overthinking all of this. I really dont know."
714,I had three dreams last night that made me cry. What could they mean?,"The first one I had, I finally texted my crush and it went ok at first. I told her how I felt about her and she immediately stopped texting me.

Then, I was running late to school one day and came late to P.E. For whatever reason an indoor jungle gym was our ""workout."" Every time my coach told me to do anything I said ""I have a heart condition."" Then, all the other students made fun of me saying ""I have a heart condition."" The period ended and we went to the locker room to get changed. I was fully dressed and felt no reason to go, but I did anyway. The guys in there also made fun of me for not doing anything. Then when I tried to leave, a rock wall was in my way and I yelled for help. A dude earthbended a door for me.

The third and worst one, I walked into english class. Everyone in there didn't notice me. I was sad when I turned around and a friend was sitting next to my other friend in what I guess was ""my seat."" Nobody seemed to notice or care about how hurt I felt because there was no room for me. Everyone else was bantering and joking around so I felt even more excluded. So I sat on the other side of the room. Nobody seemed to pay attention to me. Then I almost fell asleep when another student lectured me about how falling asleep is bad. She then left with her mom (I've never met her mom irl). I fell asleep in the dream and woke up in real life crying."

717,Need Help finding a book about ADHD,"I'm not really looking for advice, I just want resources.

More specifically books that help me understand ADHD and how to communicate with a person that has it to have a better relationship.

I'm not looking for anything religious, please not even religious vibes. I want fact based books based on the psychology and science of ADHD

Most books I've looked at so far seem to be Self Help books written by randos, hopefully there's something written by someone with credibility.

This would really help me and my partner. I appreciate any help given. Again please I'm not looking for advice, just links to books I can buy.

They don't have to be simple or super easy to understand, I'm fairly intelligent and think I can handle some heftier material.

718,Mental health and illness,"If someone asks you a question about how much you care about your [mental well-being](https://fixinfos.com/mental-health/mental-health/), think about the answer you can give. Perhaps in your hectic life, you have little time for mental well-being. Or you may think it’s not that important. But when it comes to mental health, I expect to discuss the worst of the illnesses we hear about. Schizophrenia is one of the most severe forms of mental illness.

**Schizophrenia**

This is a severe mental illness. Differentiation of the actions of the mind is the effect of the way the person thinks, feels and acts. Sometimes he shows himself and others to be risky. And they rarely respond by disrupting the functioning of the mind. Generally, they are deceived by various voices and illusions. Unlike other mental disorders, the symptoms often show up at a young age. Ties with society are undermined.

The reasons for this are the social environment, the family environment as well as the genetic status and the long-term use of various forms of recreational use (LSD). Whether a single symptom is present for early diagnosis or a combination of symptoms is still a problem.

Basically it affects thinking ability, but then it affects the behavior. Frequently angry and stressed, their lifespan is 10–15 years shorter than the average man’s. This is the most common disease with the common denominator being positive. The patient is affected by various hallucinations, sounds, and thoughts. Simply put, the patient is deluded.

**Causes of Disease**

Which you are most prone to contract the disease before reaching adulthood. Overall, about 40% are male and 23% are female. Genes are also likely to be infected, but researchers have shown that not a single gene can cause the disease. It may also affect the environment in which they live. For example, exposure to the polluted environment may include psychosocial factors. Excessive drug use is also a factor. Various pills and syrups are good examples of this.

 **Diagnosis**

Individuals’ actions and responses are used predominantly to judge [schizophrenia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443). If there is any doubt about them, they will study their history (medical and psychiatrist). The first step in treating any other illnesses that may be causing the schizophrenia. Blood tests, such as blood tests, can detect these conditions. Treatment is primarily focused on treating symptoms and eliminating them, as the cause is yet to be discovered. Treatment can help control the symptoms. There are many side effects of these medications. The management of schizophrenia does not depend on medicine, Communication is also important, for example, to educate the patient about the condition, be friendly with them and listen to them."
719,Undiagnosed ADD,"So this is kinda asking a bit further into stuff but how likely is it that an adult has ADD that went undiagnosed for nearly 30 years.

I have spoken to my family but they do what they usually do when I express concern and say it’s just anxiety and depression and they have similar symptoms.

While I was never as bad as my older brothers I usually stayed out of trouble or teachers would find me comparatively better behaved. 

Basically the more I read about signs of ADD in adults the more I realise how familiar they sound. Am I being paranoid or should I get help?"

722,I need positivity and help.,"I just recently lost a friend group that I hung out with pretty regularly and I have no idea why. They just banned me from the Discord, deleted, and blocked me on everything and now I just feel like I'm the worlds hugest piece of shit and I don't feel worthy of anyone's friendship or love and I just wanna throw this fight and give up I'm getting tired of fighting to try and stay this pain sucks so much I just wish someone actually loved me and cared about me."
723,Feeling incompetent and angry because of the pandepandemic,For context I’m a 24 year old mail who graduated college last August with a degree in material science engineering. I was working under contract for a company called BASF until my contract ended in January. I won’t lie this pandemic has me feeling many things. I feel incompetent because I haven’t been able to get a job and I feel constantly depressed because of the fact that I feel my life is going nowhere. I constantly feel that whenever things going well in my life that something or someone has to mess it all up. I tried trading on Robinhood to make money and everything was going well. I was 20 grand up but this Monday one bad trade fucked me over and I lost all my profit.  I just feel depressed because of it. Everyone in my family keeps saying “ at least you don’t have it as bad as others” and while that’s true that doesn’t help me it just makes it seem like they want me to shut the fuck up. I also have this feeling of anger that I kinda feel ashamed of. I love my brother to death but for some reason I constantly feel angry at the fact that he got a lucky break. I was the one who studied constantly in college and highschool while he just wanted to fuck around. He didn’t major in engineering but he majored in English and our father set him up with a cozy position as a sales engineer for a communications firm. ( me and my father aren’t on good terms so this feels like a fuck you).  I love my brother to death but for some reason I feel anger towards him. Like I did everything I was supposed to but I end up on the worse end of things while he ends doing well. I just want to know if there’s someone out there who feels the way I do and if they have advice for a guy like me.
724,I think I’m having out of body experiences?,"I don’t even know if anyone is even going to read this or if I’m even going to get any feedback but i just feel weird like I’m a shell of myself.

I keep thinking of myself as 2 different people, the person who I actually am and the person I should be for other people. The actual me plays this other person like a puppet. Calculating the perfect response and action that is appropriate to the situation and the person I’m talking to. Some days it’s so bad that when I get home from work or spending time with friends or family or even my boyfriend (sorta that’s another story for another time) I’m so exhausted and end up feeling no one actually knows who I am or they know a gist of me but they don’t seem to care to dive any deeper which then I don’t say anything.

I’ve been doing this thing in the past almost 10 years where if someone doesn’t ask me about a certain situation or event in my life I don’t share it because if they don’t care why should I bother.  I just quit my job for a lot of personal reasons and I haven’t told anyone because no one asked what is going on in my life or if people from my old job asked why I was leaving I’d give them a water down version. 

I feel I can’t go to my friends because as soon as I start talking they seem to devalue what I’m saying “everyone is stressed” or “i feel that way” but truly don’t understand the severity of it, that I feel alone and cold inside every day. 

I don’t know if it’s just me being dramatic or if something is actually going on but I feel like I’m 2 people and the actual me is watching this other people that looks just like me life this life that seems so fake. I’m in the process of getting myself “back to normal” after my 3 months of breakdowns but my entire life just seems off and uncomfortable.

I don’t know if any of this make sense honestly...."
725,I Need Advice Regarding A Friend,"I’m writing because I would like advice regarding how I can help my friend as I am truly concerned. 

My friend of 25+ years has always had anxiety but this year it’s gone from bad to scary. 

This morning at 5am I got this message which I believe is a pretty good summation of their problem:

“I‘m losing this fight. It's not the same as you. My entire life has been turned upside down cause of how unstable I am. Why would I ever touch a drug, I'm not an addict. I don't even think I have a drug problem, I think I have mental illness problem and in the last 4 or 5 years, it has gone out of control. Every once in awhile I get a little clarity like now, and I look at what is happening,  and I feel like I'm someone else. I dont know how to stop it. I wish you could understand. Everything was OK, than bam, it just got worse. It's gotten worse and worse. I'm losing everything. It's not just snapping myself out of it. There is no snapping out of it. Maybe when I was younger. I'm completely out of control. I feel like someone else 5 times a day. Drugs just make it worse, I know this, but I feel like I have no conscious anymore. Like I can't tell the difference between right and wrong. I just act on things, I would have never done before. Then after its done, I just don't know why I even did whatever. It didn't use to be like this. I had control over most things, and I could make better decissions. This has taken my ability to take care of my kids, take care of my wife, hold a stable job, have goals, happiness....its a little more than just sadness. I could have the best cheerleader in the world. Just having someone doesn't fix the problem. I'll make more mistakes and push those people away.  I feel so alone. I'm so tired of being tired and looking for answerers. I think almost everything I have suffered in the last 5 to 6 years has been almost all mental health. I felt something wrong, I couldn't tell what was wrong. I found every other reason to be sick. I think its always been the same. I could barely control  it years ago. Now, I have no control. I cant tell myself I'm sad and move on. It would be like cutting my arm open and while the blood pours out, I just tell myself it's ok.”

I will get messages like these daily. I believe I’m the only person who is receiving these messages and, although I am the parent figure my friend groups this is something even I do not have the capacity to deal with. It is beginning to become too much for even me to handle the constant onslaught of this friends mental illness. 

My fear is my friend is fast approaching or has already reached a mental schism that they will not be able to come back from if they are not provided help soon.

What should I do to help because unfortunately I believe these are calls for help and my brand pick yourself up by your bootstraps work hard isn’t going to help this friend anymore than it would help a dementia patient."
726,Schizophrenia is very stigmatized,"I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and this disorder is very stigmatized. People think we are going to kill people or obey the voices we hear. It’s all 100% true. There are some schizophrenics who never killed people. John Nash, the mathematician. Brian Wilson, the singer-songwriter of The Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston. a singer-songwriter. We aren’t harmful, some of us are just scared. We don’t kill nor plan to kill you. We get paranoid but we try to heal it before it gets worse. To me depression can be just as bad as schizophrenia. Any mental disorder really can be just as bad as any disorder. Suicide being the issue."

728,I get anxious when I learn about mental health issues,"I only realised it started happening when we learnt about mental health at school I mean I have always been closed off when it comes to sharing how I’m feeling so maybe that has something to do with it 

but also for example I can’t watch videos or read articles talking about Anxiety, Depression, OCD, ADHD, Schizophrenia, DID or any other mental health related disorders it just makes me anxious for no reason and i’m not sure why
even being on this subreddit

some other opinions might be helpful to read"
729,I think I hallucinated this morning,"I think I hallucinated this morning. When I woke up I freaked out because I saw a black big scurry on my bathroom rug but then when I looked for it it wasn’t there and it doesn’t make sense those bugs would be in my bathroom. I’ve never had them there. Plus I couldn’t really make out the bug when I saw it, looking back it almost seemed like it wasn’t really there, it was just in my head.

Then when I was sitting on my couch drinking coffee it seemed like the wall next to me warped for a second and I flinched when I saw it. I haven’t been taking drugs but I have been stressed lately and PMS-ing. Getting decent sleep. Does this seem kind of normal? I feel really on edge and a lot more anxious than normal."
730,How do you confront your fear of death (your own and your loved ones’)?,"hello everyone. I don’t know what flair to give this as it is also some kind of vent but most of all: a cry for help. 

have been struggling for the concept of death for as long as I can think. As a child I learned very quickly about cancer, not through experience or a relative or anyone with cancer but through it being in the news. got me terrified.

had my first thought about death really when I was in an elevator when I was about 8 years old. I was thinking of where we go after we die, why we exist and that if something would happen to the Earth, we would all be dead, basically a sudden realisation of mortality and questioning what comes next packed into one thought that lasted for 6 seconds. I suddenly got dizzy thinking about all of this. this is a very vivid memory of my early childhood (I’m 23 now).

most of my life been struggling with health anxiety, especially when I’m alone, throughout my teenage years, but wasn’t as severe.

2 years ago I moved countries for Uni, met my first ever boyfriend who I love very dearly, lost some friends and got into adult worries regarding finance, relationship,... my post history might give you some ideas of what I have been going through mentally the past 2 years if anyone interested in understanding my mental health background.

been in and out of therapy, took what I need from it so far and am taking a break from it right now as I am in an “Avoidance” phase, basically I am trying to avoid topics that could upset me.

I like to discuss the meaning of life and consider myself a rather spiritual and philosophical person. I have found comfort in understanding astrology and it gives me a feeling of understanding a deeper meaning behind everything (please don’t judge if you’re not into it, it’s really personal for me). 

but I have figured that health anxiety is just a symptom of the cause which is my general fear of dying or somebody I love dying.

sometimes I read a random post on reddit and somebody mentions their loved one passed away and I immediately worry and get very depressed how life can be so short and how things can be left unsaid and unexperienced. I realised I don’t know how to handle death at all and I don’t like to think of it but it crosses my mind more often than it probably should. 

I ask you guys, how do you guys cope with the concept of death? And while I know therapy is helpful, I am not sure if it would work in this case. Please leave your thoughts. I would like to get you guys’ opinions."
731,Is it okay to to feel depressed after watching a film?,"I watched Fight Club yesterday, and as much as that film is great, I've been feeling really weird and out of place after watching it, sad and depressed again after feeling okay-ish for 2 weeks or so. Does anyone else relate to this?"
732,Slut Shaming Husband,"I have been with my husband for 10 years and married for 2 of them. Before we were together, we had been friends for over 30 years. We have been through it all. He dated one of my best friends when he knew I was in love with him. After that, we didn't talk for 6 years. I initiated contact with him after the 6 years and we started talking again. Yes, I was still in love with him at the time, but he told me that ""we would never be together"". Crushed and devastated by this, I called an ex and ended up sleeping with him. After this, my (now) husband and I ended up being together and getting married. 

When him and I were not talking for 6 years, I was in a dark place. Had substance issues, failed relationships and had a child out of wedlock. (The best thing that could have happened to me, as i quickly got sober.)

The reason for this long explanation is that my husband slut shames me for the 6 years he CHOSE not to be a part of my life. And, he calls me a cheater for sleeping with an ex when we were not even together. 

I feel as though something changed with this last fight we got in when he slut shamed me &amp; called me a cheater, yet again. It happens every time we fight. It hurts. I am not a slut or a cheater. 

He wants to do marriage counseling, but I don't have the fight in me. I am sick of being shamed for a past during a time in my life that hhe chose to not to be a part of.

I guess my question is counseling worth it?"
733,Let’s talk benzos (Klonopin),"I’m 27[F] and I’ve been on a higher dose of Klonopin (2mg once a day) for several years for anxiety, BPD and other conditions. However, I’ve started to notice that it’s starting to give me a “hungover” feeling in the mornings to where it makes it difficult to wake up, I feel super drowsy and depressed, and sometimes I even end up calling out at my job because I feel like crap. It’s becoming an issue.

I’ve even followed my doctors advice by cutting them in half and taking smaller doses at an earlier time of day, and it still has the same effect no matter what. I know that Klonopin has a longer half-life, and this is probably why I’m having this issue. 

Has anyone had success with any other benzos that don’t make you feel this way? I’m a little scared because I’m so used to Klonopin and it’s helped me a lot, but I can’t keep having these issues.

Thanks!"

735,Anxiety?,"Every once in a while, I’ll start to feel really nervous like somethings going to go wrong and my stomach feels like it’s turning in circles &amp; I bite the inside of my mouth/cheeks until they bleed.. but literally nothing has happened? It just hits me and I feel very overwhelmed and jittery. Could this be anxiety? (I know you can’t self-diagnose or diagnose over the internet, but has anyone experienced this?)"
736,I feel like a piece of shit for not being there for my bf,"We’ve been together for 5 years (both 22, I’m F ,he’s M) So he has major anxiety ,and fear of death issues ever since he had a health problem come up in May (not Covina) ... when it began, we were quarantining in separate places and I was drifting away from the relationship, like I had one foot out the door but once the anxiety came in I came back and I fell for him again but now it’s July and it’s just weighing down on me .... I like being alone and he is always messaging me and I always reply to help him but it’s really annoying me now and I feel like shit Bc he can’t help but feel this way ... he hasn’t seen a psychologist since he can’t afford it atm... Bc he constantly thinks he’s dying and I have to reassure him he’s not ... he knows I’m frustrated with him and now he’s like “I’m not going to tell you anything anymore. I’m gonna bottle it up” Bc I told him he needs to save up money and see a psychologist Bc this is affecting the both of us ... I just really feel like a bad girlfriend ...he depends on me a lot and I’m a very independent person ,like I don’t need him and he knows it .... I just don’t know what to do ..., I really do love him but I don’t want to deal with this for the rest of my life"
737,Does anyone else’s mental health affect their workouts?,"
I have always struggled with mental health, and in the past year I’ve gotten really into fitness. I am in shape but when I have worse than normal mental health days my workouts are greatly affected.

For instance, on a good day I run 5 miles in 50 minutes with about two walking breaks. However , days like today I could barely do 3.5 miles in 37 minutes with about 6 walking breaks.
It affects my strength training days too, but not as much. 

Does anyone else have this issue? If so, how do you combat it? Should I just be happy I got out of bed and went on a run?

IDK if this changes anything, but the mental illnesses I have are Depression, Severe general anxiety. I have been getting treated for them for about 5 years now. I’m not on medication currently, but I am in therapy.

TLDR: when I have bad mental health days my workouts aren’t nearly as good. 

Any advice is appreciated!"
738,I punch myself when upset 20yo F,"I grew up with an emotionally abusive parent. Whenever I did anything percieved as wrong I would be screamed at, sometimes for hours and pushed around. Then my whole family would. Every single day. It would be me then my family. This could be for anything from dropping something, ""attitude"", doing chores in the wrong order, not spelling something right, saying something with the wrong inflection. You get the idea. This person was living in my home from the age of 4-12 then remained heavily in our lives until age 16. I'm 20 now and doing well in other areas of my mental health. But I still feel the need to punish myself when doing something ""wrong"". I full on punch myself in the face. I cut when I was a kid but stopped because others saw and it hurt them. I'm done hurting others because of my actions. I'm in therapy and have been for a while. This is just one of the few things I cant stop doing. Any suggestions?"

740,This ancient Sanskrit lullaby helped me while going through tough times recently. Hope it helps anyone in need &lt;3,"Madalasa's lullaby is a part of a story from the ‘Markandeya Purana’, an ancient Vedic text. In the story, Madalasa, the enlightened Queen of Ritadhwaja sings this lullaby to her kids. When the child cries, instead of diverting the child’s attention with material objects, she choose to introduce him to the Ultimate Truth. And that truth is sung in the form of a sweet lullaby called Madalasa Upadesha.  

I was recently going through alot of trauma in my life, I came across a version of this poem sung by an Indian lady. I would close my eyes and listen to the song in my head while remembering what each line meant. This really helped me so I though that it might help someone in times of need :D

741,Mental health issues (Suspected BPD): Looking for advice,"So for background I'm a 24 year old man &amp; I'm not at my lowest which was a couple of years ago now, but the thing which I've noticed is how dramatically my mood can switch, not just day to day but by the course of several hours. 

I can go from feeling upbeat &amp; reasonably confident to an empty emotional wreck in tears in just a few hours.

Even my friends have commented on this about how I can go from fine to just overboard pretty quickly. A couple of my friends have said they have distanced from me due to this saying I'm too taxing at times to be around.

This also feeds into the the fear of abandonment I have. I've always felt that people will eventually abandon me the more they know me &amp; I remember not being invited to something once and it made me furious. 

I've noticed my temperament has gotten much worse. I spilled over some spice I was making for my dinner, I swore at the top of my lungs &amp; threw the bowl on the floor breaking it.

I even got into a heated argument with my brother &amp; I punched him, stormed off angrily &amp; punched a hole in the wall as well (nearly killing myself because I didn't realise there were electrical cables millimetres from where I did it). Like I've never seen eye-to-eye with him but not to the extent I'd lash out like that.

When it comes to suicidal thoughts, I genuinely can't remember a day in nearly 3 years now when the thought of suicide hasn't crossed my mind. The intensity of these thoughts can be affected by my changing mood &amp; sometimes I even get into the planning stages. I haven't attempted in a long while however, not since march 2018.

I remember discussing my problems with a good friend who holds a degree in psychology &amp; she said that she didn't want to put ideas in my head but it sounds like suspected BPD. 

After going through the 9 supposed symptoms, I'd say I have 7 of them pretty concrete. Of course I dont want to say I have it as it's a dangerous &amp; disrespectful to self diagnose myself.

As I said I'm not at my lowest when I was clinically depressed &amp; did nothing, but i am by far &amp; away the most unstable mentally I've ever been in my life.

I need therapy, I even posted how I'm looking into therapy on a different subreddit (unrelated to mental health) the other day. I'm just cautious &amp; reluctant to do so simply because I don't know where to go next &amp; how to do it. Also I'm kind of scared to confront it but at the same time clearly something is wrong if its BPD or not. 

The reason I feel more comfortable coming to a forum of strangers (friendly ones of course) is the anonymity it grants me. My relationship with my family makes it hard to discuss my problems with them.

If anyone can help me out I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you &amp; stay safe"

744,Why do I feel like I need to talk about past stuff I discovered with everyone?,"Hi guys, I am a little confused. I recently randomly had a conversation about my past school life with my boyfriend and a lot of things I thought I had forgotten or just didn't pay any mind to about my past with bullying came up. Ever since then I feel like it suddenly became 'a thing'. Before that I just didn't think too much about school times but now I feel like I opened a dam and I don't know how to keep things from spilling out?

It's nothing serious, just some bullying stuff many went through but it does affect me now that it is in my mind again and I have the weird urge of telling everyone about it (like my mum or housemates) and it's making me very confused.
Should I act upon that, is it normal to feel that way? I am not a private person in general but I feel like bringing it up randomly a lot and I really don't know where that urge could be coming from. Do I just want validation?
Any insight might really be appreciated and I hope this is the right place for this"
745,Do i honestly need my ADD medication or is it a crutch for laziness? (23f),"Obviously no one can definitively answer this, but im interested to hear input, especially from others diagnosed with ADD or who have experience with adderal and/ or vyvance. 

My ADD wasnt an issue as a child,  but as an adult my ability to focus has been so bad its debilitating. Work, recreation, and staying organized can be so hard. Ill stare inti space parallyzed for hours rather than do a 10 min task. I always had trouble focussing on things i don't care about, but now it's hard to even focus on things i do care about. I hsve depression and anxiety too and wonder if lack of focus is a sude effect,  not an independent diagnosis .

Anyway, ive had experience buying these pills from dealers and i function great when i tale them. I get what i need done,  im engaged, i feel normal. I dont feel like im on sone crazy upper, i feel at peace. Then it occured to me... What if i really have ADD?

Before you comment saying see a professional...i have. I've seen 3 psychistrists who all diagnose me with ADD and have prescribed vyvance.  But i truly believe we are the only ones who truly know our own mind. 

My psychiatrist diagnosed me on the basis of ny self report "" i cant focus properly on my own"". But...how do i know i really cant? I mean obviously i physically can. Is it really impossible to be the person i want without vyvance? I admittedly love drugs. Cant help but feel like my mind is finding excuses to do drugs because its fun. But vyvance is truly rewarding for me. 

Should i take vyvance regularly and view it as a medication for a real condition or just buy from a dealer occasionally when i need something done? 
Input and personal experience welcome."

749,Panic Attacks,"I’m new to this sub and actually new to trying to figure out what’s going on with me.

I’ve been having what I think are panic attacks the past couple years. I generally have managed them ok, and try to forget them after they’re gone. Lately though they’ve been getting worse. I ended up in an ambulance/ER late one night recently when I woke up thinking my heart was stopping. Embarrassing when my vitals were all ok! They couldn’t find anything wrong with me. I woke up yesterday feeling like I couldn’t breathe properly, which eventually subsided but had my heart rate elevated for awhile. Frustrating, because I knew I was fine, but still couldn’t shake the feeling I might not be!

I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life, but Ive found ways to struggle through, and am pretty successful and content with how my life is right now. The panic attacks are a little scary though..

Went to my Dr (nurse assistant is who saw me, actually) after my ambulance episode to talk about it and her advice was to basically call my employer’s Employee Assistance Program line to see if they have free resources. I haven’t done that yet, but did sign up for Talkspace yesterday through my insurance benefits, and have connected with a Psychiatrist. So we’ll see how that goes.

Am I doing this right? Is there anything I should be looking for, or doing, to cope with this?"

751,Visual Anomalies (snow/static),"I've seen ""visual snow"" my whole life. It gets unbearable when I'm tired or stressed. I found deep yellow glasses (blue blockers) help tremendously throughout the day. 

I went to my ophthalmologist about a year ago to get my new glasses prescription. I talked to him about it. My eyes were fine physically and he thought it might neurological or psychological. He suggested I look into neurologists... I also still see bright spot long after I look away from lights or bright objects. 

I also have a slight ringing in my ears. I only hear it when I'm focused or stressed. I always hear it when it's really quiet but I can hear it anywhere given I'm stressed or focused on something. This seems to be more common. 

What do you guys think? It hasn't been as bad in the past year and I haven't needed my yellow glasses, I just want to make sure it's not a symptom of something serious. Any suggestions on what I should look into?

Thanks"

753,I Really Don't Know What More I Can Do,"I was diagnosed with Major Depression two years ago, although I knew that a long time before. I took the pills, I started going to a psychologist and many support groups, and yet I still feel the same. I just finished Highschool, and don't know what I'm supposed to do now. This whole period is really hard for me because I'm so unsure of what will happen now. Last week I broke my 7 months record of not hurting myself, my boyfriend was there and helped at the time. But now I feel like I can't tell anyone. My friends have their problems and I don't feel like they care, my parents don't take me seriously and are the kind of people that think I should just ""cheer up!"". I told my psychologist but she didn't really respond to it. I feel like something bad is about to happen and I don't know what I should do."

755,Do you think people will be kinder to one another after the coronavirus pandemic is over?,I really hope so.
756,Envy and me,"I (17F) come from an average middle class family. We’ve never had major financial issues, and I feel pretty lucky for that. 
But since I was a kid I have been around wealthy people, and sometimes it didn’t make me feel good.
As a kid I envied my cousins. They live in a huge house with three floors, a pool, a small soccer field and a pizza oven and I was envious because I lived in a small apartment and also because we were never invited to that big house! Yeah I was a silly kid. But now I’m still envious when I see them carelessly drop their iPhones and replace them with the newest model one day later.

I just graduated high school, and most kids from my school are rich. When I was younger I envied them a lot more than I do now. Once a girl in my grade posted an Instagram story asking if she should buy a Bape hoodie. If you never heard of it, Bape is a Japanese streetwear brand, known for its iconic [“shark hoodies.”](https://stockx.imgix.net/products/streetwear/Bape-Shark-Full-Zip-Hoodie-Camo-Sleeve-Black.jpg?fit=fill&amp;bg=FFFFFF&amp;w=700&amp;h=500&amp;auto=format,compress&amp;q=90&amp;trim=color&amp;updated_at=1538080256&amp;w=1000) (At least, I think they’re iconic.) At the time I was 14, I loved BTS, and once in a dance video one of the members was wearing a Bape hoodie and I liked it, and I wanted to buy one. Through that girl’s story, I found out the cheapest Bape hoodie costs more than $300! There was a poll in the story, she asked if she should buy the hoodie, and I voted “no”. I was mature enough to know more than $300 is an unreasonable price for a single sweatshirt, but I would have hated walking through the hallways and seeing another girl wear one.

Mostly, I envied other kids from my school because of all their experiences. Their parents are less strict, have lower expectation for their children’s schoolwork, and let them do whatever they want. These days I’m seeing countless IG stories from people in my school. They’re all going on holidays by themselves, even abroad. They go clubbing and they’re still out at dawn. They go to concerts on the other side of the country. And my parents have never let me do any of that. Not to mention that none of them seems worried about the pandemic."
757,I have a sibling who is mentally ill and constantly has meltdowns. Its becoming way too stressful,"Sorry if this makes a sound sense, my mind is racing because of al the shit that’s going on right now so I’m trying really hard to get my thoughts straight.

To give some background, I’m a 15 year old female who obviously still lives with family. My mum has had to deal with my sisters manipulative behaviour for ages and is over it. When I was 9, she had to go into a mental ward for a few days and I still remember that time very well even though I didn’t understand why she had to go. But now i do. 

Recently, she has been having meltdowns, shouting, arguing with other siblings over extremely tiny things (like when she was asked to do the dishes once) She has a tendency to completely blow things out of proportion.

And when she’s done with those meltdowns, she acts like everything is normal again the next day. 

I’m always worrying about my sister. I feel like she could literally end her life at any moment whenever tensions are high. It’s scary, and it’s so tiring. She’s a very delusional person, as much as I hate to say, but it’s true. She keeps praying to God as if he’s going to fucking do anything about her situation. Praying is fine of course, but she completely depends on her faith to keep her somewhat sane. Saying stuff like “I’m a princess of God” and “God made me this way so you need to learn how to deal with it”

She doesn’t want to get professional help. She says she doesn’t trust them. She won’t help herself. In fact, she doesn’t even believe she needs help.

I can’t even imagine how my mum must feel. She’s a nurse who occasionally works double shifts and has bills to pay. My dad pretty much is not in the picture. My family have said over and over that he’s a narcissist (which we don’t know, but he definitely shows signs) 

I tried to call my dad asking if he could at least come over and take my sister just to calm her down while we wait for the ambulance. (This is right now by the way, we’re still waiting) But he says he’s busy doing something. Which is so fucking annoying because as a father, he should drop whatever he’s doing and come and help his daughter!!! He never cares and it drives me insane.

We as a family, are extremely tired. We’ve been trying our absolute best to get help.

I am aching for help/advice. As much I want to, I can’t even cry because I’ve been having to deal with this for so long, keeping a facade as if everything is fine when it really isn’t so I’m basically numb to all of this. This is going to ruin my mental health."

760,Believe And You Will Succeed!,"Hello everyone. Just as the title says, if you believe, you will succeed. I shall give an example of this....

- Today I received some good news! After 3 long and hard years of university, the constant assignments, the researching, the effort, the hard work that comes with it.... I have successful got my degree in Sport Management. I could not have done this without believe in MYSELF.🎓

This is just one of million examples of how people succeeded by believing in themselves. Sure, I will admit, at times I struggled, almost gave up, but I kept on going. You’ve got to keep going, grind the days out, work as hard as you can, motivate yourself. But, unfortunately, some can’t come to terms with that sort of attitude. For millions of people around the world, this is the attitude they carry with them, day in and day out. 

It’s time to change that. It’s time for YOU to believe in yourself, you have a future. Trust me, you do. You have to believe in your own destiny, that you will succeed. Along the way, you will meet a lot of rejection and pit stops, it won’t be a straight path, there will be detours. Life doesn’t go as simple as you think, you will fall, but it’s all about rising from it, while you’re at it, becoming a better version of yourself. 

The strongest factor for success is self-esteem. Believe YOU can do it, believe YOU can be the best version of yourself, it isn’t going to be like that all the time, believe YOU deserve it and believe that YOU’ll come out of this as a stronger person. 

You don’t need anyone to believe in you, as long as you believe in yourself. But, that’s where I’m also wrong, another person believes in you, and that’s.... ME. I fully believe in you. You’re going to come out of this a much better and stronger person. 

I believe in you. That’s all I’m asking, is that YOU believe in YOUrself. 

Push yourself. Fight, fight, fight."

I’ve  been working on an informational book inspired by the American  Psychological Association’s goliath of a catalog, the “DSM-5”. **The book is called “Skies of Grey: Mind’s Eyes**”.  My format is designed to be concise and easy to read and understand.  With that in mind it should take less than 5 minutes to read each entry.

**But CJ**, *I hear you asking,* **How can I help?**  
☁️  It’s simple! I’m looking for people who are willing to have interviews  about a disorder they may be experiencing or have previously  experienced);

764,How to cope with a declining mental health?,"I honestly don't know what to do. I'm just lost. I'm not panic or anything, I'm just lost.

Maybe it's just the results of me making a chain of bad decisions. But now, I don't know, I can't deny it anymore. It's been 3 entire months and I've been feeling like shits every single day. It's been 3 entire months of me trying to convince myself that it's gonna get better sooner or later, that it's just fucking I don't know, weird teenage angst like people always say, but I've finally ran out of patience. 

Today it finally hit me that 3 entire months have gone by, I have lost that awareness of time for so damn long, and I just realized that I've been living like an empty shell, I forget just mundane things like random words (even in my mother tongue) too many times for it to be normal, I have lost motivation to do the things I used to love like drawing, writing, and participating in social projects, I am no longer able to express myself properly, both verbally and through text messages.

Prior to this, I have had times when I feel like shits, but then at the beginning of this year (during the quarantine) I've actually managed to be better. I have found a new group of friends who shared thpe same interest as I do, they have changed my outlook on life for the better. I actually felt optimistic, I actually believe things can be better, I had good sleeping routine and felt confident about myself for once. I was no longer a bitter person that I had been in the past, I felt so happy and fulfilled. 

But when it ended, reality came at me like a fucking bitch. I ended up even worse than I was before. The people whom I thought were my friends turned out to be asshats, so I decided to cut them off due to the thing they've done/said. But I have since had moments when I questioned myself if it was too harsh on them. But then I remember the things they did (one ghosted me during quarantine, one called me stupid, then proceeded to brag about their amazing background/family compared to my terrible one, and then they both ditched me to team up with each other during a competition that we all attended, great) and how they never sincirely gave me an apology for it, and I just get mad again. Then the cycle just repeats itself. For we're in this social group together, I also cut myself out of that circle too, only kept contact with two people I kinda trust. School had been such a terrible place to be at too. My teachers had been neglectful toward the class and went through with teaching the lessons as fast as possible. Then my parents' reactions to my grades + the ""stupid"" comment my friend made just completely tore down the self-esteem I'd built during the previous months. The social projects/clubs which I'm a part of as one of the core members have been failing as well, because nobody cared anymore. I was really lonely, not in the way that I don't have any friend, because I did. But I'm too scared to share too much to them as well, because I don't want to burden them with my own problems, it's not like there is something they could do about it anyway. I couldn't help but sometimes just slipped out some of my thoughts though, and it just hurts and makes me feel guilty because fuck, I just don't want it, what kind of person do it to their friends. Things just piled up and once again, I messed up my sleep schedule, and all my relationships because I can't express any other emotions than just, empty and sadness.

I have tried to ""just be positive"", ""things arent that bad"". I have tried to drown myself in work, but it also doesn't work, just most of the time I don't really put the effort in, and procastinate, and finish things at the last minute.

I know this is wrong, but fuck I don't know what to do. I just don't know."
765,How to let go and stop being possessive and controlling?,[removed]
766,Not sure if I'm spiraling or getting better finally,"My therapist keeps mentioning the word schizophrenia in some of our conversations and that’s not ok with me. I’m terrified specifically of getting that diagnosis so I just don’t tell my psych things sometimes. For the past five days I’ve felt like I’m living in a dream (nightmare obviously). Nothing feels real and it’s kinda supported that it’s not. Visually shits been a bit weird. Things kind of glitch? When I look at them. Doors will look like they’re starting to close and fans look like they’re starting to spin. Whatever I focus on kind of zooms in my vision and the outside moves around. When I went for a drive there was a car that pulled up next to me at a light with no driver and then when the light turned green there just wasn’t a car. When I parked shadow creatures started flitting in front of the car and if I looked out the sides it looked like I was going 90 still. I itch a lot because it feels like there are bugs all over me and that kinda sucks, but it’s normal ig. It’s kind of funny actually, I put my headphones on the other day but forgot to turn them on but didn’t notice because there was still a song playing. That was kinda neat. Kinda concerned that there are ants in my carpet still waiting to swarm me but that comes and goes. Other than not feeling real I feel a bit better than I did even a few weeks ago so maybe I’m getting better :) I even stopped taking my meds for a few nights, since they don’t work anyways"
767,Proud of myself :),"Hey everyone! So, I used to do bullet journaling, and i just recently got back into it. This time around, I really wanted to focus on me and creating good habits, while just to minimize or bad ones. The first page in the book is my ideal routine, something to maybe get me motivated in the morning and actually want to get out of bed. TODAY is the first thing that I completed everything on my morning checklist!!! For the past week, I couldn’t bring myself to do 3-4 of the, but I did them all this morning!!! I’m ridiculously proud and I have such a huge smile on my face. I can definitely say bullet journaling is a great way feel good about yourself! 
Thank you to everyone who read. I hope you’re day is amazing, and not too hard. Thank you for getting out of bed and breathing. I love you"
768,Recovering memories (24 F),"I have a lot of memories that I only have bits and pieces of. Some of them traumatic, some pretty positive. I just want to be able to have some clarity and remember my childhood. Does anyone have any tips or advice on defogging my past?
Therapy and support groups have helped, but I feel like I have hit a wall."
769,Disrupting Unhealthy Expectations,"Last week we talked about the difference between [healthy and unhealthy expectations](https://heem.substack.com/p/the-effects-of-expectations). Expectations become unhealthy when they are unrealistic and have high emotional investment. When this happens and your expectations aren’t met, you will be severely disappointed.

This is why managing expectations are important. They are subconscious and invisible filters that directly impact how we perceive the world. They influence and even distort how we experience life. In this way, expectations affect our mental health.

Therefore managing expectations is an important tool we can use to pay down Emotional Debt and fits into the “Prevent” stage of [PAALP](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-pay-down-emotional-debt) (Plan-Act-Assess-Learn-Prevent).

By managing our expectations, we can interrupt cycles of severe disappointment and break negative patterns of behavior. Let’s take a look and apply this tool in the following two areas of relationships:

* Expectations of Self
* Expectations of Others

## Managing Expectations of Self

When we have unrealistic expectations of ourselves, we are creating an environment to tear down our self-esteem. The disappointment we feel when we fail ends up lowering our confidence and breeds self-criticism. If this cycle of negativity repeats enough, it will turn into hypercriticism and even self-hate.

One of the tools I’ve used to help break this cycle of negativity is acknowledging that there are things that I’m good at and things that I’m bad at.

In [a previous letter](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg), I shared a story that I would get angry when I played pick-up basketball and that it was rooted in having unrealistic expectations of myself. Everytime I failed to live up to my own expectations, I started beating myself up. This eventually turned into hypercriticism and low self-esteem.

I paid down this debt by reframing the expectations I had of myself. I acknowledged that I was getting older and therefore slower. I acknowledged that I was coming back from an injury and would need time to practice. By recognizing my biological and physical limitations, I realized it was unrealistic for me to think I could go back to the level I was playing at before.

Another tool I used to help break this cycle of negativity was positive self talk. Rather than beating myself up everytime I made a mistake, I told myself that it was okay to make a mistake. That I just needed to practice more. That I’ll do better next time. By replacing hypercriticism with positive self-talk, I was able to enjoy pickup basketball again.

## Managing Expectations of Others

When we have unrealistic expectations of others, we are damaging the relationship. Our disappointment seeps into the way we interact and view the other person. The damage we inflict on others can be especially harsh if we hold positions of power such as a being a boss, parent, or a significant other.

However, the disappointment can affect us as well. It can breed anger, frustration, and resentment in the relationship because from our perspective the other person is constantly letting us down.

### Explore the Expectation

One of the tools I’ve used to break this negative relational pattern is to ask myself, “Why do I have this expectation? What is it that I really want from them?”

The reason for this is that expectations communicate desire. For example:

&gt;I expected you to do the dishes.

This statement isn’t about the dishes. It more tied to the feeling of disrespect or perhaps sense of betrayal because they did not keep their promise. Therefore what this expectation really is communicating was a desire for respect.

&gt;I expected you to be there for me.

This statement expresses a deeper issue of not feeling cared for. Therefore what this expectation really is communicating is a desire to be loved.

&gt;I expected you to get straight A’s this semester.

This statement sets a high standard based around performance between a parent and a child. If you’re Asian, you’re probably very familiar with this expectation. The underlying desire that is being communicated is that the parent wants what is best for the child. Another one could be to build up a good reputation as a parent amongst their peers.

### Accept Their Limitations

The next step in this process is to develop a realistic and objective perspective of what the other person can or can’t do. This is crucial. If we don’t do this, then we are introducing unfair standards into the relationship and creating an environment engineered to foster disappointment and criticism.

The truth is sometimes people simply can’t do what we want or need. Sometimes this is something they can work on and sometimes it’s not. Accepting this truth will help to decide whether to continue with the relationship or move on.

By discovering the underlying desire of our expectations and understanding the limitations of the other person, we can strategize ways to prevent negative cycles within the relationship from recurring. This can include:

* Finding alternative ways the other person can meet your desires.
* Accepting that it isn’t possible for the other person to meet your expectations.
* Ending the relationship.

770,2 weeks of not being sad and without suicidal thoughts,Title says it all. I'm so happy and relieved that I'm moving in the right path. Just wanted to share it 😊
771,Compulsive exercise,"So basically I have this feeling where I have to workout for a hour everyday . No matter the weather , if I’m sick , if I’m tired , or even hurt I have to do it . I would only eat one meal in the morning then won’t eat nothing else until I do my workout for the day . It’s really messing with my social life because I won’t do or go anywhere unless I have done my workout. It’s also causing me to get OCD . Like say if I’m working out I must have this one thing in my head before I begin or stop a type of exercise and if I don’t have that right image I have to think about it again and time it right or I’ll even sometimes do the whole workout again. Then even if I’m done with my workout I continue to have to think of things and time it right and do it again again till I get what Is right for me to rest easy . It occurs before I go to sleep , turn off a faucet , close a door , and even before I step in the shower I have to pose right and flex my abs in the mirror before I go in the shower and  time some in my head completely right and sometimes it take me 5 min to even step in the water because I keep doing it again to I see my abs in the best lighting and having the image In my head simultaneously . I need help getting over it but it so hard for me because if I don’t exercise I would barely eat anything the whole day or even nothing ."
772,I really don’t understand,After this while time where I have been single and I started telling people that we were threw and how it happened I had multiple people tell me that it sounded like she was cheating on my for the last 2 months of my relationship and that they were a thing before we broke up. This fucked me up and I know it did but I don’t feel anything not sad not happy nothing. I haven’t for a while. I even try to do stuff that scares the shit out of me and I feel nothing no feeling at all just me still breathing. I don’t know how to feel about this I just wanting to tell anyone. I feel nothing and I haven’t for a while. Yea...
773,"If You’re Feeling Alone And Need A Chat, Let Me Know.","If anyone needs a chat or some support, I’m here for that. 

Have a good morning/afternoon or evening everyone!"
774,To anyone seeing this:,"

I hope you have a wonderful day. I hope you see blue skies and that you find happiness within life. You are loved, you are appreciated, and you deserve the same kindness and respect that you give so freely to those surrounding you. As much as we say life is short, as humans it’s the longest thing we ever experience so don’t waste it worrying over broken relationships and fragmented memories of people who did you wrong. Try not to be too hard on yourself and understand that often there is much we have no control or influence over, and that is simply how the world works. Love yourself for who you are and remember there is beauty in our differences. You’re worth it, you always have been &lt;3"
775,My parents refuse to believe that I’m not okay and won’t let me get help.,I feel really trapped and suffocated around my parents. I feel as though I can’t be myself around them or they’ll judge me. I’ve not been happy or content with myself for over 5 years yet my parents just keep on saying that I’m fine but I don’t feel fine. I feel isolated and overwhelmed. I’m not happy about anything in my life and they just don’t want to hear me out. They don’t take it seriously. There is something wrong with me but I just wanted some help to find out what’s going on and I hate that they don’t want to back me up on it. They just want that golden child whos always happy and gets amazing grades and never ever complains. I’m not that and they think it’s me being irresponsible when I’m reality I don’t have any motivation or drive in life anymore.
776,Is this friendship toxic/bad for my wellbeing?,"My best friend and I have been friends for many, many years, and even though I have never explicitly explained or labelled my struggles with mental health as I find it difficult to open up, she is clearly aware that I do have my struggles and this means I sometimes don’t want to do certain things, such as meeting in large groups of people, or meeting new people.

Recently, we had a falling out, as we had arranged to meet up after not seeing each other for around 3 weeks, and last minute she decided to invite a friend of hers I have never met without checking with me first. I was disappointed as I was excited to see her, but I didn’t express any anger or frustration and simply explained I wouldn’t feel comfortable doing that so she should still meet with the other friend to avoid letting her down and we can meet another day. In response to this, she expressed a lot of anger and frustration towards me, and made comments basically saying that she can’t be bothered with me making a big deal as it’s just a get together, even though I didn’t at all make a big deal and simply explained it was out of my comfort zone, and she is aware of that as I have backed out of plans in the past when last minute changes such as this are made. I didn’t respond to these messages as they upset me, and we haven’t spoken since.

The situation has lead to me think I am weird and I am a problem, but I’m not sure I should feel this way as surely she should be accepting and supportive of my issues and respect my boundaries, as you would with anyone, regardless of their mental health?

I think I am just seeking the opinion of others, which is probably a bad idea considering how paranoid I already am, but I just don’t know what to do or think about the situation :(

P.S. I should note that this isn’t the first time something like this has happened, as she has made rather trivialising comments regarding my mental health in the past too."
777,On my road to healing,"Hi, this is my first time here, but I’m going through it y’all. The past few weeks have been some of my scariest. I’ve never been actively suicidal for this long (usually if I’m active it lasts a few hours, this has been going on for weeks) and it 100% has to do with my psychiatrist upping my anti-depressants a few weeks ago to manage my anxiety. All it did was send me into a PTSD anxiety, depressive spiral. I usually only have panic attacks a couple times in 2-4 months, and I’ve been having them almost daily, along with the suicidality. My romantic relationship has completely fallen apart because of my mental health. He can’t handle it anymore, and I understand that. He needs to make himself his priority, and I am my priority. But I’m just hurting a lot. I just want to feel better. I want to remember how happiness feels. How peace feels. And I’m on the road to that. My mom came to get me from my college town, and I’m going to my hometown this weekend to have a physical support system. I have friends in my hometown that are willing to spend time with me and talk with me. I won’t feel so alone anymore. My psychiatrist put me on an aggressive treatment plan to get me onto meds that we know will work and to manage my current levels of anxiety. This is my first time on lorazepam, and it helps so much. They’re supposed to help the transition off of my old meds onto my new ones. I guess I’m posting here just to feel heard, listened to, just to feel like I’m not the only one who has experienced this or has been in a similar situation."
778,I need help with my overeating disorder,"I'm a 15 year old male from Israel.

In my area, mental health isn't taken seriously and it saddens me. I think my overeating disorder started when I was in the 5th grade, which means I was 10 when it started. And for the 5 years of me having my overeating disorder, I only noticed it last year.

None of my parents noticed that I had it for 5 years, thinking about it now, it was so easy and obvious to see that I had one, I always ate fast, ate a lot, always binge eating and I always get hungry very very fast. But I guess this stuff isn't taught or known here, I mean, I can't blame them.

A couple of days ago I had the courage to tell my mom about it, and I was surprised that she had never heard of an overeating disorder. Anyways, we talked for a bit and I started telling her about my overeating disorder. I thought that telling my mom would at least make me eat less, but I think it made me eat more. Each time I eat, I convince myself that the next time I will just eat less or not eat, but I know that I'm lying to myself.

I can't stop it. It's like a demon inside me that forces me to eat more, even though I know it's bad for me, I can't stop myself.

It's awfully disgusting. I am certain that with my current lifestyle, beating my overeating disorder is impossible. 

Should I see a physcologist? Are there any pills for this? Should I go on a diet? Should I seek help?

I need to change, and I need your help.
Please help me, I dislike my body, and I want to change."
779,Am I faking it?,"I (18F) have struggled with mental illness since I was 11, I have been to the doctors about it and have been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder. As a result of these I have self harmed frequently. I have never been properly diagnosed with an eating disorder because I have always been too scared to admit  it while I was under 18, but for years now i have gone in and out of periods where i either very harshly limit my eating, or I go through cycles of binging and purging via throwing up. 

In both the self harm and the eating issues I always wonder if I'm faking it, because I feel like I have some sort of control over it, and I'm making the conscious decision to hurt myself in these ways. I really don't know what is real and what's not, and I feel like it's my fault I put myself through it because I seem to have such a conscious ability to decide whether or not to partake in the actions. 

Does anybody else feel this way or know anybody who does?"
780,help?,"ive beem having these times in my life (as esrly as being 3 or 4) like i start thinking ""okay green is green, you can see colours okay you are here you are living"" and then i realize? it and start thinking like okay im here im alive AND IT STARTS TO FEEL WEIRD AND ANXIOUS when i look at my hands like okay these are my hands

idk how can i explain it but like panic when  you realize youre alive and you see things like okay this is green and you start to think it in  a wayvlike okay i am now alive i breathe

im so scared snd panicky help what is this i dont wsmt to live"
781,I (17F) think I have BDD (Body Dysmorphic Disorder) - who do I go to?,"Basically what the title says, I believe I may have been suffering from BDD as well as anxiety and low moods for the majority of my life but I have no idea where to go with that. It’s affected me daily, I’ve been scarily close to developing an ED lately and decided to try and figure out why it is I hate myself and compare my body to others constantly. There is ofc more to it then that, I’m just at a loss. 
Should I contact my GP? I feel like it’s bad timing with the pandemic. I don’t have anyone to go to about this so I’m confused on what my next step should be"
782,Animal pictures,"I really think people struggling with mental health issues should take the time to watch videos of cats and dogs on Instagram, and it'll help them out a lot! Any animals. It helps me! They put a smile on my face. Seeing cats and dogs living in their own worlds makes one forget one's worries and problems for a while. This sub should occasionally post them here to make the people that post about their problems smile. 

I'd also like to say that one shouldn't avoid dealing with how they feel, but use this to reset where their head is at. When I'm tilted or angry, I play a bot game in Dota to 'reset'. It helps me as I'm focusing on something else. The cats and dogs on Instagram help as well! I really wish this helps!"
783,"I don't have a witty title for this (TW: self-harm, suicide)","Been reflecting on how my life means very little to me, but how much I mean to my kids, my family. I don't know how to feel. It is kind of canceling each other out right now, and I am not in danger of hurting myself at the moment...but late at night, that changes and all the despair comes crashing in on me. I did get some good-ish news: my Probation is down to twice a month appointments now. I still have a year and change to go on it though. Ugh.   


I want to hurt myself---cut until I bleed out...feel that welcome warm rush of nothingness rising up to meet me. I had almost died when I had overdosed a few years ago...I saw Death in the corner waiting, but something had saved me. I was angry about that for a LONG time, and I still am. I should have died dammit. Taken my worthless piece of shit ass off this planet. I don't contribute much to society (I am on disability, our 2 minor sons are on SSI and the 18 year old is going to be getting SSD also), I can't work due to social anxiety and just...I can't hold a job down...and my kids can survive without me. Hell, our youngest is 10 and will be a young man soon enough. The others are almost 13, 16, and 18, and 21. I know it is selfish, but the pain is more than I can bear...I have been trying to hold on and be the responsible, loving mama I am supposed to be, but it was irresponsible to even bring these kids into this fucked up, piece of shit world in the first place. I am done. I have stuff to do.  


Our eldest daughter's cockatiel ran her stupid ass into a fly strip (sticky!!), and even after bathing her in vegetable oil and then mild dish soap (as is recommended), she is still looking like a drowned rat and sitting on the bottom of her cage. She squawks at anyone who comes near. She is pretty pissed off. I am worried about her a lot though. She is very precious to all of us really and I don't know what else to do. She won't let us check her over to make sure all the sticky stuff is off (we think it is) and the oil is off (she just got another bath so probably). Whatever. You don't care about that Redditors. I am done here. Bye."
784,"I’m finally going to see a therapist for the first time ever tomorrow, but I’m scared she won’t believe me","TW: suicide
I was filling out a form for therapy yesterday and it asked me if I have ever attempted suicide. I marked yes and it asked for details, so I put that I took a whole bunch of Tylenol but I chickened our and threw it up almost instantly. This actually did happen to me, but I’m scared she won’t believe me for some reason. Like it just doesn’t sound believable even to myself I don’t know why. I’m not even sure if Tylenol can kill you, and also I’m only 15 so what if she thinks I’m faking it."
785,Life of lie,"I am 25 years old male who looks more like a 29 year old. I have lived a life of lie till now. I lie to myself as well as people around me and this has fucked my life in pretty bad way. I pretend and I appease people. Even for the things which don't need lying, I lie about it. If my gf ask me what time I woke up today I'd say 7 AM when I actually woke up at 11 or 12. And then I believe in that lie of myself and feel good that I woke up at 7. It's just an little example, imagine I do it on large scale everyday. Small lies, big lies. Lies to parents, friends and myself as well. It was not a big deal, untill I realised how bad the things have become. I am nowhere near where my friends or fellow classmates are today be it financially or otherwise. I believe myself to do great things but I never really worked for it. I took what was leftover or easy, which didn't need any efforts. I spend my day, dreaming about things which I aspire to be and sleep it off to spend the next day in same way. I fed myself lies and believe in it. I don't know where my life I going. I feel very fucked up. I have identified that this habit of lies has been due to my introvert nature and social anxiety with tinge of depression carrying along since years. I want to change it, I was a good student untill I stopped reading and started day dreaming. I don't wanna live this life of lie but I don't know how to deal with it. Your suggestions or opinion will really help. Thank you for reading."
786,I don’t really want to keep fighting to survive anymore,"I’ve always had anxiety, ptsd, depression &amp; ocd.
 Diagnosed once when I was 10, again at 16 again at 19 then 23 (now)

My disorders didn’t become severe until a year ago, I couldn’t tell you why I wish I knew. My depression and anxiety got so bad that I had to give my weapons to a friend to hold not because I wanted to kill my self but was scared of what I’d do in a panic episode.

I’m turning anorexic and I hate it so much. I want nothing more then to gain weight. I’m 23 5’6 weigh 114.
When I was good I weighed 128.

I get nauseous everyday from my anxiety, which makes me not want to eat. So I take zofran for that- which causes constipation. I haven’t had a normal bowel movement in over 6 months.

My doctor has prescribed me Ativan, a bunch of different anxiety and depression meds, they all disagreed with my body. So I stopped taking them. I physically cannot handle the bad “ month” before getting better. I can’t.

I buy Xanax from a friend because they work better for me then anything for my panic attacks. I take a quarter .5 as needed. But that doesn’t help the long term anxiety or depression.

I try to eat, I cook food, take a bite, my stomach will hurt, then I cry because not only am I not eating but now wasting food. I’ve tried shakes, toast, it’s never ending. 5 bites into a normal dinner for example salad- I’m full. 

I could have 3 good days of decent snacking but what’s 3 good days if it’s followed by starving myself for 2? 

I’m so sick of trying to feel ok. I’ve been trying to overcome this eating disorder and all this other bulldhit for a YEAR. NOTHING WORKS.

I’ve even taken supplements that are meant to increase appetite. NOTHING.

I’m in therapy. 
But honestly? I’m just done. I’m so fucking done. Guys idk what to do. I don’t wanna hate myself everyday but I do because I can’t even fucking eat a sandwich. 

I have a dumb irrational fear of throwing up so if I feel nauseous it’s game over. I can’t eat out at restaurants ( never been able too gives me panic attacks) I can’t even finish a kids meal.

If this is my life now, I don’t want it.

Also, I live alone. If that matters."
787,I'm being paranoid!,"Hello guys, i'm being paranoid everyday, it's all about things, which i've fixed in the past, and it seems in my conscience, that they have not been fixed, i'm telling myself every single minute, that it has been fixed, and it comes over and over, it goes away while i spend time with my family, while i'm talking to others, but when the evening comes, it starts to be bad, i'm feeling very bad, i'm also overthinking, and my life is being destroyed, help me please, take me seriously🥺😓"
788,Im judging people like me,U ever find urself judging people like urself u do it unconsciously. Its like I look at someone doing the same stuff as me and im like he is weird but I do it wtf it like im bullying myself
789,I’m so tired of being judged by doctors for my mental illness,"I went to the ER with severe chest pains and trouble breathing, tell them i have children at home: they tell me I must just be stressed because of my children and I’ll be fine in a few days... 3 days later i go to another ER because I feel worse, don’t tell them i have children: they actually test me and turns out i have bronchitis on top of another chest infection. They also found type 2 diabetes and signs of liver disease in blood and CT scan. 

Call my family doctor because i feel even WORSE after doing puffers and antibiotics for 4 days. She tells me I’m fine and the mental illness i was diagnosed with TWELVE YEARS AGO is the reason I’m having crippling chest pain and a hard time breathing. They want me to start taking a controlled substance everyday because of a mental illness I haven’t needed treatment for in over 5 years, a substance they told me I couldn’t take anymore in the past because of it’s extremely addictive and people can become dependent of it. Now they want me, a mother of 3 small children to take an addictive substance, everyday because they feel I’m having an severe mental episode when i know I’m not.. i just feel f@&amp;king sick. 

I’m having severe chest pains,  trouble breathing, coughing, extreme fatigue, hot flashes, nausea, diarrhea and dizziness. 
IT HURTS TO STAND UP.  

and this is supposed to all be linked to a mental illness i was diagnosed with at 13 years old? 

all they can offer me is this crappy medication and advice to go on more walks in nature. With difficulties breathing and two chest infections.  IM SUPPOSED TO GO STAND IN A DAMN FOREST.

I’m so tired of feeling like my mental illness defines me. I can’t be sick because i have a mental illness.. it’s ridiculous."
790,Need advice on an Aging parent and mental illness,"A little background. I've always believed my dad was a bit ""off""... maybe Asperger's but never diagnosed. He is very intelligent but has almost no common sense and doesn't understand abstract concepts at all. Also not an emotional person, he never hugged us as kids. He and my mom divorced when I was very young, he is now 77 and never remarried.

About 20 years ago he began obsessing about his age and looks. He was always a bit shallow and into how he looked, and wouldn't date any women who wasn't much younger and very pretty. Naturally that gets more difficult to do as one ages. For the past few years, he has become depressed and anxious about aging. All he cares about is how the people around him look and make him feel. It's all about him, and really always has been... but it's more concerning as he's much older now.

He retired last year and has a significant amount of money, and way too much time on his hands. He began supporting a woman in her 20s last year, and she ended up stealing money from him. I was able to cut that off, and get rid of her. He was also making bad financial decisions all around so I was able to convince him to let me manage his finances. Thankfully, he won;'t be able to do any financial harm to himself anymore, but the other issues about his mental health are really difficult to figure out.

I was able to get him to a psychiatrist; he had been on a light anti-depressant for many years, and clearly it wasn't working. I sat in on the session, and was blown away by how my dad charmed the doctor into thinking things aren't all that bad for him. It's like he was on a stage and performing. He would make funny comments to lighten things up, and change the topics with stories that weren't really relevant to the questions she asked him, and by the time you knew it the hour was up. In reality, he lays on the sofa for much of the day, cursing himself for being unhappy, saying everything sucks and he can't stand it anymore, and essentially scaring me and anyone else around him. He has had episodes of screaming (not sure how else to describe it, just a loud SCREAM). Physically he is in excellent shape because has taken such good care of his body - really all he ever cared about was how he looked, so he eats well and exercises to some extent, and it;'s very deceiving because he can fool doctors very easily.

He doesn't live with me, but everytime he visits, he lays on my sofa and goes into chat rooms on his phone. He has several women with whom he talks to overseas, and he chats with them all day long. I am not super concerned about scams because he isn't able to send money to anyone without my approval but the more he talks to these strangers, the more depressed he actually seems afterwards. It;s like he needs to connect to someone all day long. Ironically when I ask him why he spends his day talking to strangers overseas he tells me ""I have no one else to talk to"" . That is bullshit- there is me, and my 3 adult children. All 4 of us make time for him as much as he would like. But he won't engage with us for more than an hour over dinner, and then it's back to his phone and chat rooms.

At one point, I took him to a neurologist to rule out dementia (that was in fact ruled out) and the doctor pulled me aside and said ""things with him will get worse as he gets older"" meaning my dad's emotional state. Yet as a neurologist, he wasn't really qualified to dx anything from a mental health standpoint- he was just giving me a heads up that I am in for some rough years with my dad.

I guess I am not sure what to do... or maybe there is nothing to do. I have suggested everything under the sun to my dad. Volunteering, a companion, making new friends, etc etc etc. I actually arranged for a companion for him thinking he could take walks with this person, she was about 50 years old and in great shape, I thought maybe she could motivate him. Instead he purposely no-showed the first time they were to meet, even though he had told me he was ok with trying it out. He's done this before. Allowed me to set things up, then canceled or just no-showed. There is always some drama in his life - he has had 5 or 6 cycling accidents in the past few years, and I am not saying he falls on purpose, but I do think he likes the process of getting seen by the doctors and getting this kind of attention. He is always saying his stomach hurts or he's very tired ,and literally every day there is some issue like this that he seems to want to believe is an actual health problem.

I have been dealing with this for a while now, and that said, I do have clear boundaries and I don't wear myself out... I have my own life too, and I did learn that I have to disconnect from his issues, so that's not a problem thank goodness. I just hate to see a person like this, so miserable, and yet so unwilling to help themselves with meds or making different choices that could lead to a happier life. He could live another 20 years or so. I am just not sure what -if anything- I can do."
791,I might have schizophrenia and I am freakin scared,[removed]
792,"Panic attacks because of my incredable fear of psychosis (please read, I'm desperate)","First if all thank you for reading, I am very desperate. I'm a 16 yo male. English isnt my native language, so my apolagies for any spelling or grammar issues. So the past 6 months or so I have been getting some really bad panic attacks. The panic attacks are triggered pretty much exclusively in the dark when I'm alone. In most cases it happens when I'm in bed ready to go to sleep. Out of nowhere I'll start panicking and sweating really bad. Durring the panic attacks I am very very scared of getting a psychotic episode and losing my grip on reality. I think I understand what is causing this panic, let me explain.


In the second half of my fist year in highschool (age 12) I had a lot of trouble with the stress of highschool and I started smoking weed (not a lot, maybe 3 times in the span of 6 months). I couldnt focus on anything, and my constant stress made me unable to do any basic thing. I barely passed that year. During my summer break my stress didnt go away, and I took it into my nightmarish second year. In the second year the stress of highschool became unbearable and I started skipping school, and smoking more weed. This is where things really went south. When skipping school I'd hang out outside, just aimlessely waiting untill 3 so I could go home and pretend I was comming back from school. In these times where I was out on the street, I was still coping with the stress and I was very unhappy with how my life was spiraling down. I used to have a lot of friends and I was always joking around, but now here I was. Out on the street skipping school, with so much stress that my heart was pounding out of my chest 24/7. This got me into a deep depression and even suicidal toughts. This is where my mental health quickly declined. I started thinking the devil was haunting me and that that must be the reason I felt the way I felt, wich is funny because I am not religious and I dont really believe in a devil. But in this period of time I was convinced this was what was going on. I started communicating with the devil in my head and I genuinely believed it was real. I started smoking a lot if weed to help me calm down and I started getting addicted in a way where I really could not relax without weed. This lasted untill about 3 months into my second year of highschool when my parents found out about me skipping school. I explained abouty stress issues. My dad was furious, but my mom was willing to help me. We made a doctors appointment. The doctor told me I have a burnout and send me to a psychologist. I told my psychologist about my depression and burnout, but I left out my ""devil"" part. The therapy helped and I got permitted to take a break from school for 6 months because of my mental problems. This helped me, for the first time in a year, relax. This is where I slowly started to let go of the devil thing. But still, I didnt understand it probably was a psychosis, I tought it must have just been my depression. After therapy my depression and burnout went away. I re-did that schoolyear succesfully, in a recovering, but happy state. The next year (third year of highschool) I was 15. I was pretty much in perfect mental shape. I was happy and its the happiest I've ever been in my puberty. I kind of forgot about my past troubles and none of it bothered me, I barely tought about them. Fast forward to the fourth year of highschool (age 16) everything was just fune, untill a few months into the year, I started to realise that I probably had a psychotic episode with the whole devil thing. I also was smoking lots of weed in my summer break, I feel like that may be what has caused my overthinking about the past. Fast forward to the start of 2020. The overthinking git me to the point where I am incredably afraid if falling back into psychosis. In februari my panic attacks started. I was laying in bed, and as soon as I tought about the past, I started sweating and panicking. My heart beating out of my chest. And incredabke feeling of fear of going indane surrounded me, and it felt like I was trying to hold on to reality so I stay sane. The panic attacks only feed my fear of getting psychosis because they make me feel like my mental health is declining again, and that may causee to get an episode. 


Fast forward to now, and I have a panic attack almost every single night. I'm scared of being alone, especially in the dark. Anything with a scary vibe (horror movies, scary noises etc.) make me way more scared then before, because I'm afraid I'll get a panic attack. This is impacting my life greatly and I'm not sure what to do. I understand that I should seek out professional help, but I am ashamed and afraid that peaple will think I'm some freak. I still occasionally use weed, but most times I do, I get a feeling of derealisation, where the world around me seems fake. Also this is something new and I used to have a good reaction to weed. This is also why I am quitting weed. I really need help, and I constantly feel like I'm going insane.


In short:

I am extremely afraid if getting a psychotic episode and its giving me panic attacks, that only feed this fear like an endless cycle.

I am very desperate and need help. It honestly means a lot already that youre here. I was wondering if anybody else has had the fear of insanity as much as I have. I'd love any tips, support, or simmilar stories. Have a blesses day!"

795,"I saved someones insta as a file on my computer, and now because of my ptsd I am very on edge."," Over the last six months there's been quite the conspiracy going on around many celebrities engaging with inappropriate acts with children. One of those accused is Tom Hanks. Well, his Wife Rita Wilson posted a photo of herself seemingly at the beach. I saw this post on Facebook, and so I went to her insta to see if it was a fake post, it wasn't. I wanted to save the photo so I could personally zoom into it, and I ended up saving her profile as a folder onto my computer. I then kept trying to find ways to delete it, I ended up going to a transcript version of it. I managed to finally delete it but now I am petrified that I am wanted dead or something."

797,This is not my year...,"Obviously 2020 isn’t anyone’s year but I feel like I’m being put through the ringer. 
Quick bitch moment. 
Year starts off good then, BAM, COVID-19. Next is the stay home order where I and everyone else had school and work online, that’s really hard to do when you work with kids who are hands-on. Partner and I get a puppy and I immediately have bouts of awful sadness and depression. We get engaged on his birthday and then the same day, I’m let go from my 7-year employment at a place I loved, with people I dedicated my life to (I wasn’t let go because of anything I did). I then decided to finish college and pursue career my career and spirituality but of course an extended family member decides to assaults fiancé. Move past it and we’re onto wedding planning but then, the freaking cherry-on-top, my fiancé’s best friend/my good friend suddenly passes. I am in disbelief that this is happening. 
I figured it could really only go up from the assault, but I was obviously very wrong. 
I’m about one second away from losing my shit here and I know I’m not alone. I feel like the Gen-Zers are onto something and I’m in an alternative reality because this cannot be my life now. 
What the actual fuck is going on. 
I didn’t even include all the other shit going on on the world either! 
Someone please wake me up and tell me that I drank myself into a 7 month coma on New Years. 

PS. I am doing fine, as fine as you can do after learning an irreplaceable person in your life has passed. I feel mentally stable and safe and I am grieving the best way I know how. I just needed to let it out and this is as close to “screaming it from the rooftops” as I could get for now."

801,I don't even know what I'm feeling,"Alright here's the thing, I don't even know what I feel anymore. I am so disconnected with my own mind that I go from being joyful and full of optimism to sudden swings of existential dread and uncontrollable crying. I was recently forced to start working at my family company and although the work I'm doing right now isn't my bread and butter it's not something I despise doing, but routinely, after a week or so of work, I look back and think ""wow I am miserable as fuck"" and break down in my own mind. Then, a half hour later, I go back to feeling as if this never happened and keep the routine going, which I am sure is no good for my mental health at all. But the kicker is I don't even know what to do. I can't stay home or I'd be a burden to my family and I'd feel unsatisfied with myself, and apparently I can't work or I go into crisis and harm my own mental health. I just feel like I'm in my own stupid cage that I fabricate for the sake of feeling something.

I don't really know, I guess I don't feel like I'm enjoying my 20s as I should and I feel like forcefully working is chipping away at my will to even dedicate myself to anything. I instantly noticed it took the fun away from any prior hobby I have, and I don't feel enthusiastic about any part of my day anymore. I don't even feel like I'm working towards anything. I just kind of realise that I'm just stuck in a loop that leads nowhere and wasting the precious time that I'm told to enjoy every minute of because I can't buy it back. 

I don't even really have the necessity to work. I'm well off financially and can afford to live without bearing a burden to any third party as I have worked since I was 15 or so and I have a few savings, but my parents seem to think that after every year of university the summer has to be spent working because they won't have any leeches in the family that live off other people's shoulder. 
I just want to at least have the summers to myself after dedicating my all to studying and doing the best I can in university, rather than nosediving into working at something I feel no passion for. And to make things worse I'm working alongside my brother who not only excels at his job, he has vacation time and time off, but my parents don't seem to understand that I just want to vacation in my own room without being judged as a fucking parasite of some sort.

I guess my issue isn't as serious as what you guys read on here and every time I think about it I feel like a spoiled brat for even thinking that im right in this so I just needed a place to vent my thoughts out, maybe I'm crazy or something maybe I'm just pathologically lazy. 

Life kinda sucks right now."
802,Mental health on the internet.,"Just thought I should share this on here. I deleted my Instagram account after years of not knowing what I’ve been doin on it... literally, my ig account wasn’t me. I mean...ppl don’t care about your thoughts on it (most of them not all) they just want to know what’s going on in your life briefly and that’s not good, that’s toxic and causes mental breakdowns. At first it was hard for me to lose all my pics but I wanted to be free and LIVE. I wanna learn from real life which is rare nowadays, we are conquered with promotions and lies on the internet. Now I’m feeling free. Maybe later I can have a new account when I’m more aware of myself and mental health."
803,"Claustrophobia, i think.","I always thought i have a bit of claustrophobia. A tight, clogged place makes me very uncomfortable. And if that is filled with people, it gets worse. I cant get into a crowded elevator or a bus. Like i always have to have a clear way out of every place or situation. It feels like im gonna choke. Breathing gets very difficult. But i always keep check. Try to stay calm as much as possible.

Apart from the physical places, i sometime feel claustrophobic in my thoughts or in my conscious. Like in this lockdown, im free in my house, have my family with me, even i can go out with mask and gloves. But still it gets me that im in a lockdown. Sometimes nights get quiet scary. I cant sleep, keep tossing and turning. I pray. Keep thinking a bit more, The sun is almost up and it will help me. Also, i have a girlfriend, we have a rocky relationship like any other couple out there, sometimes she gets a bit clingy, talks about marriage and rest of our lives. That gets to me as well. I feel like this is giant web, i cannot get out of this. That makes me wanna not be in a relationship anymore.

Sigh, i don't know if its claustrophobia or it has another name. I feel like being stuck in somewhere i cant get out of. Sometimes i get an anxiety attack, very rarely though. I go to the washroom and try to make myself calm. That works for time being.

I just joined this subreddit, don't know if its the right kinda place to share things. But just wanted to let this out. Any sort of suggestions are welcome."

805,I think my mood has been effecting my appetite,"I don't usually eat much because I'm skinny, but I feel like my mind is in such a shitty place that I have to remember to eat before I go to sleep. I'm tired all the time, and I realize my negative thoughts are just making it worse, but I can't even get myself to eat. I used to love playing skyrim and video games as well, and they're just not fun anymore. Nothing is emjoyable to me anymore. The most I do to take care of myself is shave, shower, and brush my teeth because I still like to be presentable."

809,I can't ask for what I want,"■ when I need something, I terrified to go and ask for it directly. I go in roundabout ways, and try to manipulate to get what I want. Sometimes, i just steal it. And sometimes, i just sit and watch someone's ask for it and get it easy peasy.

■ When I try, I feel extreme anxiety, distress, feels like I'm gonna die, no matter how simple the thing is....so much discomfort.

■ I only feel this way around people that i'm used to. If you're a total stranger, I can ask you anything. 

■ **that makes me so self-reliant**, I can't ask for help with anything, not from my close friends nor my family."
810,Haven't had these thoughts in so long,"I was just considering taking my life. I have felt a little down but suddenly it just washed over me. I haven't seriously considered it in so long and I'm scared.

I have a family but no one is here for me. I used to go to my mom but I can't put up with her anymore. We've been having problems.

Why should I go on? I want to be at peace. The cycle just repeats. I feel better and then I crash and it doesn't stop.

I want some one to help me and hug but I'm scared to ask. I don't know what to do and I feel so hopeless."
811,I literally hate myself.,"My misses found a lump, I was of course concerned but she told me to act normal. 

I told her to get an appointment at the docs  but she left it a week, I again told her to get it seen to so at the very least we could not worry and maybe move on. 

When she did, she asked her mum to make the appointment, I had already gotten the okay from work to fuck off for the day to get it seen to. But, she didnt want me to even talk about it. 

I again quizzed her and said sooner rather than later. So she made an appointment and decided instead of me to take her mum. 

All the while telling me to act normal  but getting annoyed while I'm trying to be normal. I just yeah  I dont get it. 

Tonight ended up in an argument because she didnt think I cared enough, but when i said i did she said that it's not about me it's about her, even though I said I am worried about her and if she was worried she should come to me and tell me. 

I dont know it's just a fucked up situation.

I suffered from depression before and I do believe offloading is at least helpful."

813,How do you keep from falling into the trap of hopelessness?,"I’m feeling like I’m falling back into a state of hopelessness and I don’t know what to do about it. My entire support system is unreliable and unwilling to really be there for me and I’m having a hard time maintaining myself, much less working on cultivating emotional support relationships. 

I know rationally that my anxieties and fears aren’t really accurate and that my life isn’t really pointless but I don’t know how to actually make myself believe it. I’ve been here before but every time in the past it took me years to work through before I was in a place to even start moving forward with my life. 

I really want to get myself out of this funk before I become completely stuck. Does anybody have any suggestions of how to reinvigorate myself and get over this feeling of hopelessness? Even short term solutions are welcome, I really need to just keep myself from completely falling into a hole while I work on more long term stuff."
814,Wanna start getting my life together,"For context I'm a 23 year old male still living at home and unemployed. I don't know how to drive and don't have a car of my own but in the past I have attempted to take a few driving lessons only to stop after a few weeks because of anxiety. 

Anyway, I've been struggling a lot these past few months with my mental health and even more with the current pandemic going on. Everyday is just the same old routine. I wake up, eat breakfast, do chores, eat dinner, take a shower, brush my teeth, and go to bed. I really don't have much going on outside of my home life. I was working all of 2019 and part of this year until I got laid off from my job. Since then I haven't been very productive in trying to get my life together but I've been wanting for a long time now and each year I feel like I'm going nowhere in life. I'm just too depressed to do anything about it and my anxiety just makes it hard for me to get out in the world and start living my life. I've been dependent on my parents for far too long and I want to start taking steps to move out before I turn 30. I cant see myself living with my family well into my adulthood otherwise I'll just spiral down and maybe take my own life. I honestly feel like I won't amount too much and I'm a pretty stupid person as there's  a lot of things I can't do other then pretty basic and straightforward tasks. I'd like to have a passion in life other than just a dead end job that pays less than a thousand a month. I just don't think I could live off of minimum wage and with the cost of living being so high I don't see how I'll ever afford it but I'm trying best to save up. All of this really stresses me out and I get panic attacks at night wondering how the hell I'm gonna survive out in the real world if I'm not ready. It scares me to think I'll end up homeless and die on the streets. Sometimes I do think I shouldn't be alive at all as I can't contribute anything to society and I'm just a damn failure.

My household is pretty toxic. I have two siblings that are autistic. One is low functioning and is constantly having self aggressive behaviors and attacking people and damaging property  and needs a lot of supervision. It puts a huge burden on not just my parents but myself included as I have to see it almost every week. It's just too much for me to handle seeing my brother hurt himself that I really would like to get out as soon as possible and the sooner the better."
815,Stan.,"I think i just realized why I’ve always loved music enough to really invest into the artists (basically Stanning) that i like especially whenever I’m sad, depressed, anxious, etc. 

I don’t really feel as though I’ve ever received any sort of unconditional stable love from anyone in my life growing up and even now. (I didn’t have the worst childhood but it wasn’t really the best either) And because of that, although sometimes it is cheesy when these artists or creators say i love you or positive affirming things it actually makes me feel better. 

I know I’ve never met them and they have no idea of my existence but it’s the most stable and consistent form of attention or affection I’ve received. I don’t even have to be scared to reciprocate that love either. And not only that but i have no reason to doubt myself since i don’t interact with them so they have no reason to hate me. 

Judge how you will but They mean a lot to me and actually help me through hard times and maybe even saved my life through not only their music but also as people"
816,I’ve been struggling the past 4 weeks,"I’d say this is venting as well because I wanna get it out of my system when I can 

(17M) During this whole lockdown thing (UK, Nottingham) I was slowly getting closer to this girl I used to like and got denied by about 9 months ago. I started to develop feelings again but I know for a fact she has no interest back. She’s in my close friends group so I see her all the time and she’s one of my best friends so I don’t want to get rid of the relationship so that I can be happy again because she makes me both happy to be around but feel like shit whenever I realise I like her and she doesn’t like me back. When I say like I mean she’s literally the perfect human and I haven’t seen anything wrong before, it’s more like I’m in love with her more than just like her and it’s just shit.

It’s probably not a mental health issue and just heartbreak or some shit like that so sorry for wasting your time but here’s what I’ve been like because of this whole situation.

Every night after I’ve been on a Group FaceTime or met up with her (5 times a week) I’ve had this constant sadness that I can feel in my heart and body which just makes me feel like shit. I have to take a smile in front of my parents and I have to keep making myself smile and laugh during the day just so I can be happy

I have no motivation at all to do a level work and am extremely far behind and Ik I’m on a path to failure but I don’t know how to tell myself to start doing work.

I feel like I am a failure in every way possible, I hate how I look, my personality, my body and I can’t change any of it which crushes me knowing I can’t change this hatred

It’s affecting my life atm massively and idk what to do about it or where I should ask on reddit or what to even do and I put this on here to ask for any help I could

Avoiding her isn’t really an option because she goes to anything any of my friends go to and I have awful fomo due to bullying and being left out of every activity and never being invited anywhere by my old friend group 

Thanks for reading even if you can’t help and if you could tell me whether this is actually something or I’m over exaggerating heartbreak it would be appreciated"
817,How do I get rid of psychosis type thoughts?,"I have this consistent thought pattern where I'm the center of everything, and everything happens because of me, Covid? my fault/or blessing, something bad/good happens somewhere to someone/or to me?  my fault/or blessing. 

This megalomanic thought pattern emerged when I became psychotic after marijuana use + social withdrawing 6 years ago, they've never really left since, just always running in the background.

It's tiring, it's a burden on everything, I can't trust anyone or anything, are good things happening to me because sometimes good things just happen, or are they happening because I'm God, and I want it that way.

I remember growing up and praying that God made me anything but boring, if this is the answer, I don't want it, I'd rather just be normal and boring if I can just be regular in my head, and have regular paranoia and regular fears and goals - all based in a reasonable form of reality.

I consider suicide often, some days are better than others, but this struggle doesn't really seem to have an upside, it's been 6 years. Add to that, I've had this consistent physical pain in my jaw, cheeks and forehead for the past 2 years.

819,Is it possible to be suicidal if you know you won’t actually do it?,"This is something that has been on my mind constantly and sometimes I wonder if I’m the only one that thinks this way. I have never in my life had suicidal thoughts until two years ago when my dad died and I was diagnosed with alopecia and lost my hair. To this day I am still struggling with grief, alopecia, a divorce and now this pandemic and I am over the edge. I constantly think about what it would be like if I shot myself. How it would be so much easier some days to just end it all and not have to have constant stress anymore. These thoughts constantly cross my mind, even when I’m not thinking about anything that makes me upset. It’s just like a voice whispering in the back of my head. The thing is though I would never do it. I know for a fact that I would never kill myself. I am too afraid to die and I desperately want to live to be able to see a more positive future but no matter how much I try to see the positive and get rid of these thoughts they never really go away. Does anyone else ever think like this? Am I actually suicidal? I’m not really sure anymore."
820,it’s going to be okay,"i know it doesn’t feel like that, it might feel like the whole world is against you, but i promise you, it’s going to be okay. you are going to be okay. time changes everything. the horrible feeling you’re feeling? it won’t last forever. there will be a time, where you will feel on top of the world. please hold on, just for that feeling. reach out if you’re struggling, letting it all out is so much better than holding it in. i’m always here for you, please don’t hesitate to message me if you need a friend, or just someone to talk to. take care of yourselves, drink some water, and don’t forget to take your meds 💗"

I was just researching about mental health stuff(I like doing so sometimes, it fascinates me) and I stumbled upon PTSD. I go through most of its symptoms. I have nightmares almost every night, trouble sleeping, I keep having unwanted images of her going through that.. stuff, and have panic attacks because of them. Whenever we aren't talking(we met online and chat online) I'm constantly anxious about her safety, wellbeing and give myself anxiety attacks as well in doing so.
I get emotionally numb at times but I think that's just my coping mechanism and have been doing so for years so I don't know if its related..

I already am currently going through symptoms of Schizophrenia, and this on top of that isn't.. helping to say the least.

Is second hand trauma or PTSD a thing?"
822,Hey..,"Hi, sorry for the bad title, I just am not sure what else to call it. Let me just get straight to the point to not waste your time reading any long sentences. I cannot control what my mind says, it blurts out stuff I don't like and stuff that makes me worry. Let me give an example, I lift weights, and before a set my mind would say ""please let my muscle tear"" or something so, when in reality I would never want something like that to happen. This goes on for the entire day and has resulted in me developing awful anxiety and sometimes I have random depression episodes. It's...too much now, I don't mean that in a suicidal way or anything, I just mean that it's very overwhelming. Can.... anybody help? Is there anything I can do? Please"
823,"Intrusive, unkind thoughts?","I try to be kind, and balance everyone who is horrible to me by putting more kindness in the world (e.g. boss was a jerk, I sent donations to a charity).

But I get these intrusive thoughts about being really mean. Like sending a mail letter full of awful truths to ruin a life or reporting someone to the authorities for something horrible, or setting off my car alarm because I don’t like how near people are sitting even though they do no harm.

I don’t act on these but fear it’s because I’m afraid of getting caught as opposed to not doing it because it’s unkind or wrong.

Do others experience this? These thoughts of how I dont want to be as a person, but begging me to give in?"
824,how do you forgive your past and move on as a person?,"lately i’ve been having a LOT of past feelings affecting my current relationships with my significant other and friends. i have severe trust issues - i grew up with two parents hating each other, my friends basically left me in high school because of “my baggage”, and my ex lied through their teeth for 6 months before i found out he had feelings and was talking to another girl. i guess now i just have this HUGE fear my current friends i have now are just going to get tired of me. i also have a bigger fear of my significant other finding another better than me which honestly is ridiculous because there are no flags like there was like the other, but there is always this constant fear that eats me inside. i recently got put on antidepressants which helped a lot but the anxiety is kinda eating me up inside. im trying to change the way i think but sometimes it does get overwhelming - would anti anxiety medication help any? any other advice? thank you in advance"

826,best ways to get a hold of your mental health when you feel like there is no hope?,"i’m in university and i’ve come to the realisation that as much as i want to i will most likely not have a university experience that i wish to have, as my depression and anxiety mean it’s extremely difficult to make friends, and when i do make friends i ruin it by overthinking or pushing them away. knowing this, what is the best way to get a clear head and get a grip on sorting my mental health? i’m currently on 50mg of sertraline for about a year (i want to talk to my doctor to get this changed as i don’t think it’s working well for me) and have requested help from counselling services, what other advice is there to “start fresh” almost?"

828,How to help my mentally ill teen brother?,"I feel like I’m grasping at straws here. 
My little brother is struggling with a lot of different things: right now, he is severely depressed, and he has struggled with self harm, suicidal ideation (not intentions), and disordered eating - apparently he “doesn’t do those things anymore” but it’s hard to know, obviously. 

I have talked to my parents multiple times and I don’t think they are doing enough. He was in therapy pre-covid but not now. I don’t know if therapy helped much. They generally try to help him, but clearly he needs serious intervention. I don’t know if they are taking him seriously enough. 

I’ve been through the same things as him, except nobody intervened, and I want so badly to stop things before they get as bad as they did for me. But my advice doesn’t seem to help much.

The only thing I know to do is just hang out with him and take him places?? But I don’t have the energy + time to do that all of the time.

I just don’t know what to do anymore? I feel like there’s nothing else to try."
829,How do I (21M) find support when I keep my problems secret?,[removed]
830,I’m schizoaffective and I tried vaping for one day and it wasn’t good for me. Thoughts on research or similar experiences?,"This is just coming from my experience, but I thought I would share both to warn and get feedback.

I’m 39 and have been diagnosed as schizoaffective since 22-23.  I haven’t had a drink in years and I don’t do pot although legal in my state.  I know not to do either as they have negative interactions with my medication and they both are triggers aggravating my condition.

I do smoke cigarettes though.  In particular, I smoke rolling tobacco called Golden Harvest, in tubes by the same Golden Harvest brand, made by a Top-O-Matic Machine.  This post is intended for those of us with mental health issues that already smoke to discuss whether they have had bad experiences with Vaping.  It’s not meant to encourage those who don’t smoke to smoke.  

I tried vaping three days ago because I thought it would be a healthier smoke.  I went to my local tobacco shop and the man provided me with a fifty dollar starter kit and he threw in the vape juice.  I picked a delivery system that was cost effective but reliable.  If people want more details just ask.

When I first took a puff, the vape hit me like sweet relief, it was a rush.  So, I felt really good about my purchase.  Unfortunately as I puffed throughout the day I didn’t realize I became manic.  From experience I know if I go manic I have an episode.  Sure enough by nightfall I was having an episode of paranoia.  At 39 I have enough experience with this illness to take a cold shower, medication, sleep to let the episode pass.  I highly recommend Luke cold showers moments of discomfort like the paranoia and anxiety that were hitting me.

It’s been two days now and I’m feeling much better.  The episode has passed and all I have is a little depression.  I’m pretty certain it was the vaping that caused it.  That’s the only thing I did different recently.  So, now I’ll just stick to rolling tobacco and the occasional box of L&amp;M cigarettes.

Has anyone had similar experiences?  Does any know if this has been researched?

Again, this is only personal testimonial.  I understand some people are fine with vaping.  I just know it doesn’t work for me and aggravates my condition."
831,How can I help a friend who is isolating himself?,"None of my friends want to get old but this friend might not even make till next year. Since he moved into a new town we used to chat daily and met 1-2 times a month. In April this year he suddenly stopped responsing and due to Corona I haven't tried to meet him.
At first I wasn't worried because when I first met him it was a habit of him to not response but after a few weeks I found out that he's doing very bad. Last week he responded to some of my messages (I still him message multiple times a week) and it looked like it would become better. Unfortunately that's not the case. 


Today we decided to go to a concert together in october. It's one of his favorite artist so I think unless he doesn't over dose he will live until october for sure and I think that he thinks that he will get better until then. That's the only good thing currently.
He does a lot of drugs, drinks to much, is harming himself and is not leaving his bed. He don't want to meet me and our mutual friend because somehow he thinks he doesn't deserve to.


How can I help him? I'm currently think the best idea would be to just visit him without his consent and staying there until he either talk about his problems with me or goes to a psychiatrist. In pretty sure he won't react very to this and won't even open the door. 
I don't know what to do. He needs help. Preferable professional help but he doesn't want any help."
832,I feel worthless,"My first and only true friend just broke things off with me after I fucked things up.

833,"How to know if I'm ""slow"" or have a learning disability?","So straight up I never checked for anything or got a dignasois but I know for a fact I'm rife with mental health issues.

I definitely have anxiety ,I lived with it all my life I can feel it ...I just know,and I am also like the biggest daydreamer there is !!I have maladaptive dreaming to the nth degree,im talking everything I do,I'm gonna shut down for moments and day dream then continue then day dream again and the cycle continues.

I wonder if these effect my studies cause I feel like they do but I also would like to know if I'm also just slow or ...plain stupid .

Im in college,I do excellent ,but I take unfathomable amount of time to study,I also can't do books,it's literally a goal of mine to just do 1 book ...1 ...I always give up cause I take like an hour on 5 pages !!

The academic book that I'm going through right now,people comment that it's the most concise least complex academic book on the subject yet here I am reading a page like 10 times struggling for knowledge,and I'm in the introductory chapter mind you xD.

I do better at visual learning ,I'll watch lectures and other learning videos on YouTube and get along fine for the most part but books kill me ,it's like I just derp and I feel like I have 5 iq whenever I see scientific notations or writings.

I also would like to mention that I feel slow af irl,I gave up on going outside and hanging out with people cause there's gonna be everyday situations where I'm gonna get made fun of for how I act,I always feared real life cause at least in my own space I get to be a failure in my own eyes,but out in the real world it's there for everyone to see.

I wonder if me feeling extremely useless outside has to do with either my severe social anxiety or lack of intelligence or both.

I don't understand people that can take like 6 subjects and some that have jobs and still study,and I'm out here barely able to keep up with 2 subjects."

835,I'm always thinking that I'm in depression but I know I'm not.,"Maybe I'm just an edgy kid who think being depressed is cool because of watching mind game animes and movies but it's kinda out of control or because of my poor diet and always laying around but even I'm not depressed my mind keep telling me. I want it to stop. I know the possible reason why I'm feeling this way and i know I need to change not just the situation but also me. Maybe I just want attention  or something. I'm frickin tired with this of my own.

836,I dont know whats wrong with me,"

I (15m) feel no empathy or emotions towards anyone in my life, i am a pathological liar, i torture animals for fun and mutilate their dead bodies. I have a strong desire to kill a person, i self harm to keep myself from doing so.

To everyone in my life im just a standard person, only  one in my life who even has a hint about my hidden personality isnt capable of helping. I have tried talking to school psychologist and my parents but i automatically start lying to them and that has lead to no one believing me.

I fear that i wont be able to control myself and i have been pushed down a hole that i cant climb out of."
837,"18f self harm relapse, triggered.","I’ve self harmed on and off for years and had a continuous eating disorder during that time. I was a few months clean again but relapsed during the week twice.   Tonight I feel really anxious and  unsettled and have an urge to do it again. I’ve tried all my different coping skills, distractions and to sleep but I feel too restless to sleep because of the anxiety. 
I feel really bad about myself for relapsing and I don’t want to do it again but I just want this feeling to go away. I’m so tired and want to sleep.  I know what caused the fall in my well-being enough to relapse but it’s not something I can fix.  
If anyone has any words of wisdom or encouragement they’d really be appreciated right now."
838,Phycosis?,"I often have feelings of things being unreal and sometimes I feel like I'm ""high"" even though I have not taken any drugs or drank alcohaul. I have had paranoid thoughts ever since I was like 7 and I sometimes convince myself of things that could not be real like sometimes I'll think one of my family members might hurt me or molest me even though I know they would never do that. Sometimes I can imagine things that feel so realistic that sometimes I forget if it's reality or not, it kinda helps me escape reality and it's fun sometimes, does anyone else do this? I've also heard voices one time when I was walking up and I've heard things a few times while trying to fall asleep, very subtle quiet things but still I'm not sure if I could be hallucinating or not. Could I have phycosis or schizophrenia? I can name a handful of times where I've heard things that may or may not have been real, like faint music or faint guitar music in the middle of the night. Or the time I was 8 laying in bed and I heard someone scream loudly into my ear and it scared me so bad that I ran to my sisters bed. It's hard not to be ashamed of this as terrible as that may sound I've been told it's just my imagination but if feels so much more than that. I don't halluconate frequently which is why I don't think I have schizophrenia. I feel like a crazy person and I can't imagine telling anyone all the things I've experienced which is why I keep it to myself . I've had very disturbing dreams lately, dreams involving me getting raped or watching others being molested, and I have experienced a bit of trauma from those dreasms even though they weren't real. How can I even tell anyone this?"
839,I don't know what to do😣,"I used to be a very polite and friendly guy with a lot of friends and confidence. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and depression. I kept thinking I could get through the depression without therapy, but it's gotten worse and worse, to the point where I've lost all of my friends and a lot of family, and 4 jobs in the last 2 years. Since I'm unemployed, I don't have insurance, so counseling isn't much of an option. I'm completely lost. Even gathering my thoughts to write this post was a huge struggle. My heart and sympathy goes out to anybody who is going through even anything close the same thing because I wouldn't wish anything near how I feel on anybody."
840,19 M Struggling to manage mental health,"I'm currently struggling to manage my mental health and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Ive recently realised some recent traumatic experiences I didn't realise where really traumatic till the other day where I was frozen in fear as a result, that have been really draining me and causing some. Major issues. I have been trying so hard not to relapse into old coping methods of self harm and drug use but it's been really hard and I've relapsed a little wich I'm super sad about. I'm in the UK and looking for some different types of chat support or someone to talk to. I'm really looking to better myself but it's just so hard and I'm just so drained mentally and would appreciate any help."
841,Am I normal?,"Reddit is a place where you can find like minded people who can echo your thoughts and give insight like no other so here goes. I’m in my mid 20s and fresh out of a breakup which is at best a addition rather than a cause of my mood. 

I have often had bouts of depression in my teens but around a few months ago something changed and I just kind of molded into a new person. I speak my mind more. I’m more opinionated. I’m sharper. But I’m also more irritable and I have been isolating myself as a result of my so called insight . The only thing I can think of that changed was I had a period of time when I quit smoking tobacco about 2 months ago and I didn’t sleep for 4-5 days but even that has an unknown cause . I haven’t been to see a doctor but I’m uninsured and if I’m being honest I feel I’m more of a rationalization person than needing medication(not to downplay it I just don’t really care for the forced change in my brain )


My question is that, is it normal to randomly become super aggressive? I haven’t really had any negative changes in my life . Nothing out of the ordinary that I would call trauma. But My lifelong asocial tendencies amplified and now I’ve basically cast everyone out and I don’t know what I’m looking for with my change in mood. Like WHY have I become so bitter? Even being away from my ex who I assumed was the problem has had zero effect on my mood.

And assuming I do have a mental illness , how does one know when a change in personality is normal and not an “illness?”"
842,Terrible experience at a mental hospital,"When I was 14 I was voluntarily admitted to a mental hospital for planning to commit suicide . The staff were just overall rude and when I was trying to tell one of the staff there that I used to starve myself, he just laughed in my face and told me to sit down. Another staff member purposely misgenderd a transgender patient multiple times. Everyone there was terrible at their job. What the fuck is wrong with mental hospitals nowadays."
843,How do I stop feeling anxiety whenever I remember a story that freaked me out?,"a while back i read a short story that was intended to be shallow entertainment but ended up freaking me out completely. It wasn't a horror story but it's ended up affecting me like one - it unnerved me a lot when I read it, but I found myself unable to stop reading. Then afterwards thinking about it filled me with anxiety, like real physical anxiety that i felt in my chest. It drove me crazy and somewhat still does.

Eventually after months of just kind of trying as hard as I could to divert my train of thought whenever it strayed towards that story, I went and fucking did it again. I read another story with a similar concept but even worse, that just freaked me out even more. The anxiety that fills me whenever I accidentally think of it makes me want to tear my brain out, just to make it stop. It's like there's a little minefield in my head and if I step in the wrong spot my day is ruined completely.

I want so badly to just excise the memory of these stories from my head, Eternal Sunshine style, but I can't do that. So do you guys have any advice for getting over the stories themselves? Being able to deal with the anxiety or stop feeling it. Or somehow truly avoiding thinking about the stories. I don't want another 6 months of having to tiptoe around my own head

what makes it so much worse is that the content of the stories is incredibly dumb and embarassing, I hate that something this ridiculous is honestly freaking me out

Alabama, USA if that is at all relevant

im really nervous about posting this because so often when i expose myself to the internet it just makes things worse but here goes"
844,Why can‘t I be alone anymore?,"I don’t like posting personal things online because lately that has given me a lot of anxiety but I guess it’s okay because nothing on this account reveals my identity. Basically I really don’t know what’s been wrong with me lately. The only mental illness i’ve really been struggling with lately is anxiety. I think I might also possibly have depression but I haven’t been diagnosed and I keep convincing myself that i’m faking all of the symptoms for attention. It’s been really hard for me to be alone lately. It’s not actually that bad once I actually am alone but when people start to leave me alone I start to panic and beg them to stay. It’s worse with my boyfriend than anyone else. Keep in mind that i’m a teenager. Basically, when i’m on the phone with him and he starts to say he’s going to leave to go to bed or do something else I start to freak out and beg him not to leave. When he eventually does leave I start to either cry or panic. When i’m on the phone with a friend and they leave I don’t usually show anything on the outside but I either feel a deep sadness or I just start to cry a little bit. I don’t know why this happens. Everyone keeps telling me that lately i’ve been acting very childish and that even my voice sounds childish and whiny most of the time. I don’t try to do that. I know that I used to speak in a higher pitched voice when it would get late at night and nobody had an issue with it and some people even complimented it so I continued to do it. Now though, it’s turned into something that I don’t feel like I have control over and it’s not just at night. I’ve just been acting childish in general lately which is really disturbing to me. I feel like it’s maybe some kind of subconscious coping mechanism but I just want it to stop. Does anybody know what this could be or have any similar experiences? I really don’t know what to do and I’m embarrassed to talk about this with anyone."
845,First Time Medication,"Hi Reddit, I (23,f) have been prescribed Sertaline along side with my therapy. It's supposed to help me with my PTSD, anxiety and severe depression however, I am apprehensive. I've usually turned to forcing myself outside being in the sun, gardening and cooking trying to make myself better or dive into music (not working). I think I want to take the medication and I am aware it is my sole decision, however, my boyfriend (37, m) is highly against it (dependency and thinks big drug companies just want my money) but I want to ""balance"" my chemicals and get better but I fear not being myself??...A contradiction, I know, as I dont really know if I am myself regardless of medication. I was leaning to dipping back into my habits of social exposure and normal things but I felt my PTSD trigger today at work (restaurant) and I just want to hide away. What should I expect with this medication and what are some people's experiences good and bad? Thank you for reading, I appreciate any new perspectives I can get here."
846,September and October,"It’s almost the months of September and October, those months are pretty bad for me, I tend to get extremely sad and I get very angry in those months, I went to 3 mental hospitals and I got admitted in the months of September and October, my attempt to commit not alive was in September 2018, I don’t know why I get like that specifically in those 2 months, my mom thinks I might have some trauma, but I don’t remember  anything traumatic happening in either of those months"
847,my sister’s mental health,my sister (age 13) has just opened up to me about how she feels. she says she feel so so angry all the time and wants to hit things/ things when this angry happens. she also said how she hates talking to people about these problems and how when people do want to talk to her about certain things she wants to cry. we are going to talk to my mum and go to a therapist. however i just wanted to know what people thought could be the issue. she explain how she has no reasons sometimes for feeling this angry and also said sometimes she what’s your punch a wall until she herself is hurt. could anyone just give their opinion or anything on what they think could be the issue. thank you.
848,New and Revised: 10 Commandments for Mental Health,"I created a light-heart spin on the 10 Commandments, that I think may resonate with those who live with a mental illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You shall have no other Pharmacist than the one who keeps accurate medical records.
2. You shall not make idols of celebrities with mental illnesses. For they have personal doctors, nannies, and millions at their disposal.
3. You shall not take the name of Lithium in vain.
4. Remember to have a ME day and keep it holy.
5. Honor your body and mind. They have not given up on you, and you shall treat them as allies.
6. You shall not murder those who say, ‘snap out of it.’ No matter how much they deserve it.
7. You shall not commit adultery on your mental health routine with unscheduled binge drinking and Cheetos.
8. You shall not steal medication from another’s medical cabinet, even when you’re running low. Because, like seriously?!
9. You shall not bear false witness against the progress you’ve made thus far. For you have come a long way from where you started.
10. You shall not covet the lives of those without a mental illness. For their lives are predictable and would not make a good movie."
849,Stuck in a loop.,"For background I have PTSD, cause by repeated medical trauma involving my family and myself.
For the past 2 days I've been stuck in a loop playing though everything from the day I almost lost my son at 4 months old. I'm at work right now on the verge of tears. I work in a mill, everytime there is a loud bang or something it is echoed by the sounds of my son screaming. When I try to relax I can feel him cuddled into me looking for someone to save him, or like I'm back in the hospital waiting room to see if he's going to make it through surgery. I took a break to try and clear my head but I can't even close my eyes without visions from that day."
850,Im not to sure whats happening,[removed]
851,How can I change my dealing with problems?,"nothing is going right in my life at the moment.it never went really well, but since I went to college I feel more and more unhappy. I study Latin and before I started it was a lot of fun. still make it to me but I completely fail my exams. I do my best, but it's never enough. I'm setting myself under a lot of pressure because I am already 22 and all my mates are younger and doing better than me. i always leaned towards violence whenever i failed. I started hurting myself at school by cutting or burning my limbs or beating my head hard against the wall until I had no power left. I've never been able to control my emotions especially when I'm stressed, but now it's getting worse. after each failure i lose my grip and start to beat my legs and cut them open until they bleed a lot. I know there are people who have suffered much worse, but I just want it to stop and learn to deal with problems like any others do. is there a way to let go of that? Is that kind of behaviour the cause because someone is naturally like that or is it because they are generally unhappy with what they do? (Job wise or university?) I'd appreciate some advice, maybe some of you act in a similar manner. Thank you."

853,How can I deal with anxiety when I don't know what's causing the anxiety?,"I suffer anxiety normally but not that severe, sure there are many things to be anxious about but they're all things that have been issues long-term...so I'm not sure what's triggering this sudden surge of anxiety. It's just been going on the past couple of days and I've no idea what's sparked it. 

Note; I'm on low dose antidepressants, therapy isn't accessible to me, and this is an immediate problem I'm looking for help with."
854,Does anyone else experience this?,"Okay so this is extremely difficult to put into to words that will accurately explain what I mean but I'll try my best. I sometimes get this sudden feeling of dread and pure anxiety when I realise the reality of life and my existence. Like what even is this? This is really all there is.

I can sometimes distract myself when I get this feeling but a few times it's caused a panic attack and it's honestly the most terrifying thing in the world. I've tried looking this up but the only thing it comes up with is things about derealisation/depersonalisation disorder and I really don't think that's what it is. I guess it just makes me even more unsettled that it seems I'm the only one who experiences this."
855,please help,"my doctor wrote a prescription for my psych meds in a 30 day supply, but the insurance company refused to pay for it because of their requirement to get 90 day mail order prescriptions. When he wrote a script for 90 days, the pharmacy refused it because i'm a persistent suicide risk and i'm red flagged in their system. Now, I just found out that my health insurance dropped me as a client.

How the fuck am I supposed to get my meds and succeed? I've been without psych meds for 20+ days. I feel like killing/harming myself every day."
856,From then till today.,"So to start this off I wanna say I’m on mobile so I will have miss types and stuff so in advance I’m sorry, I’ve posted on here a few times and it seems to help very well as I’m not good with words in person. So here it goes, yesterday was a very good day for me I’ve worked in my anger very well and in the last two weeks I’ve had one episode I broke my hand off a porch not my best moments but it’s so much better than I have been. But back to yesterday me and my girlfriend did something that I should of done a long time ago. I was homeless when we first got together well high school everyone saw me as a future “NFL player” and put labels on me but truth was I was homeless I wore nice clothes that I stole and even stole money to get them. My girlfriend grew up in a world of money so I wanted to impress her. After we spoke she told me we needed to go to all the people I remember stealing off of and give what I stole back I went house to house giving money back to people who didn’t know I even took. Some where disappointed some told me they were proud! But the final house was my fathers he was the reason I was homeless he kicked me out I had no where so naturally I didn’t wanna go there but I did. He opened the door gave me his same blank expression and we sat down I told him what I did but I doubled the money I stole. And we both had a heart to heart and the first time in 8 years he gave me a hug told me he was proud of me. Even told me he loved me. As I’ve mentioned before I’m not good at letting my feelings out, through the life of pain I’ve had I’ve never hurt myself or got into drugs or any of that I had sports and I did a lot of wrong in my life. But yesterday was the day I finally felt I had hit a point I always wanted to hit. I’m 18 now I’m with a very beautiful girl who I love with all my heart. I have my own pet a job and I can finally control my anger. I wanna thank all who have commented and helped me and to anyone else who is dealing with anger. Just know your not alone in this world and all you have to do is reach a hand out for help, someone will be there to guide you I promise!"

My brother has everything he has ever wanted and my little siblings have good friends, i don’t want to hurt them but i can’t stand being in the same room as them. I hate feeling like this, i just hide away from everyone because i hate seeing everyone smiling. I know my family is talking ill of me, i’ve heard them talking about how lazy i’ve gotten and everyone agrees. I just want to end it but the only one i feel would miss me is my dog, he never talks bad about me behind my back or judges me. He just lays with me listening to music and he comforts me when i cry, which has happened alot over the last month. I hope i posted this in the right place, thanks for reeding"
858,Whoever needs help and Whoever is will to help them,"I have been seeing many people trying to cope up with stress, anxiety, depression, and other problems which are not usually acknowledged easily in society. With this year being most strenuous due to COVID-19, and the problems carried along with Lockdowns all over the world.

I have been working as an overnight associate at walmart, and I too have faced few problems that occurred due COVID19, which made me realize how people have been tackling this situation, and how my problems have been nothing compared to what a lot people have been facing.

Please feel free to post your problems in the comments as I will try to help you relieve some of stress you have been facing. 

I have been thinking lately to start an NGO towards helping people in need. I am not experienced towards helping people who have been facing issues. But I want to start something today! 

I hope people will join this cause."

861,"Nothing special, just having a bad mental health day and feel the need to vent","I started my period yesterday morning after not having it since February, maybe March, and it’s like all the irritability and mood swings are in maximum effect after it being gone for a few months. I have medically diagnosed MDD, severe anxiety, and bipolar disorder, as well, so it’s not a good mix.

My mind is just being pretty fucking mean to me today. I miss my ex boyfriend normally, but today especially, I’ve been crying on and off about him and I feel selfish. I live by hypocrisy by being upset he’s moved onto another woman whereas I feel betrayed when in fact, I’m a regular user of Tinder and Bumble. Never met up with anyone, but still trying to move on, myself. I check his socials a few times a week and I just fantasize about us still being together. He cut his hair off when he left me, and I wish to just touch any of his hair one more time. I fantasize about sex one last time, and I fantasize about him supporting me in my career path. I think he was my first real love, minus high school boyfriends I’ve had, just first mature and serious relationship. It lasted about a year and a half, which isn’t long for lots of people, but nonetheless, I still loved and love him very much. He turned into my best friend and I would have done anything for him.

On top of that, I keep playing Lana Del Rey to make my day a bit more upsetting, on purpose. I also keep playing a playlist I have of his favorite songs that reminded him of me. It’s a terrible move, I know that’s now how you get over things.

My mom also asked me to do some chores and I’ve just done the bare minimum I do myself, which is just cleaning my cat’s litterbox. I have zero motivation to do anything else. I’m a fat fuck and I practically live on my couch when home alone, which is a lot, because my anxiety won’t let me go back upstairs when everyone’s gone. I feel so lazy and I hate to disappoint my mother, but I just can’t do the other simple fucking tasks.

I speak to my therapist once a week over facetime and have been wanting to move up to twice a week, but some weeks I just know I wouldn’t have anything to talk about. I also have a psychiatrist I talk to once a month, usually just about medications, but I skipped my appointment to speak with her yesterday because I was just feeling too blue and didn’t feel like talking to anyone.

I seriously considered suicide today but didn’t have “the energy” to put myself through a crisis, just sat on my couch and had true, deep thoughts about it. The only thing that stops me anymore is my newborn niece and cat. I don’t know how I feel right now, but I’m hoping it’s just my period. For now, I miss my best friend wholeheartedly and will likely continue to cry for a bit."
862,how can toxic internet friendships affect you?,"from the age of 11 i’ve had to talk multiple internet friends down from hurting themselves or straight up committing s*icide, not knowing if my friend was dead cause they wouldn’t answer until the morning after. plus being in a relationship with said friend who would threaten to block me and followed through with it multiple times. i just wanna know how badly things like this could actually affect your mental health as you get older, this was from 11-14 years old and most of the friends were 2 years older than me. i think my brain has blocked out much of those years and the things i do remember feels more like i’m watching someone else experience it and removing myself from that situation kind of?"

864,Since the start of covid 19 my life has only been competative pc gaming and it's taking a toll on my mental health,[removed]
865,Back in my parent's house,"So I'm back in my parent's house due to it being my summer break and the pandemic. I've been studying abroad and for next semester, it's going to be online. I'm not really that pleased with being back in my parent's house due to a lot of bad memories and experiences when I was here. When I was younger, I was able to go out or have other avenues to get away and not be here. I can choose to go back to the country I'm studying at, which I'm fortunate about. I also have a significant other, who I've been with for awhile and we haven't seen each other since last year before I left. If I choose to go back that would mean, I wouldn't be able to see my significant other that much anymore since I was back. So have a huge dilemma right now."
866,My Situation.,"I have no idea what’s wrong with me. It’s so difficult to post how I’m feeling due to my lack in confidence to do so but, even I’m confused on how I truly feel... I guess I need help?

Recently my emotions seemed to swallow me up and told my dad that “I hate him” and proceeded to call him disrespectful. A part of me is so sure of that opinion I have of him but for some reason a part of me is ashamed I feel that way. I feel as if I’m not a human. That someone is controlling me to prevent myself from saying things, preventing me from thinking straight, removing emotions an average person would have. 

A part of me loves being sad and is driven amongst pain i inflict on myself. This pain could be physical or mental. I love to cry because it’s the longest emotion I feel, but the emptiness afterwards is unbearable. 

Last night I went into a full panic. Tears were streaming constantly, I couldn’t stop my shaking. As I pinched myself to calm my emotions I started to realize I didn’t actually want to hurt myself, I didn’t want to genuinely kill myself, but before for several years I’ve been so sure of those feelings. 

(Sorta brief summary): Again, I feel like someone is controlling me. I’m so unsure if I’ve been true to myself or others in my entire life..."
867,I stopped taking my meds because my boyfriend wanted me too,"It’s been maybe a month and a half since I got off Prozac. He never said I had to but he’s expressed multiple times that he doesn’t believe in taking meds for depression or anxiety and he wishes I wasn’t on them. So he kind of convinced me to stop. 

At first I didn’t think it was affecting me but now I feel like I get emotional very easily over small things, like my emotions seem less manageable. I guess I chose to get off of them because I want to be able to fully heal and deal with my emotions without needing the meds, but low and behold we’ve been fighting much more lately because I’ve been more emotional, and I can’t help but think it’s because I got off my meds.

I don’t know what to do now. I feel like I made the wrong decision but I’m also reluctant to start relying on medication again."
868,"Finally Got Over Breakup After 4 Yrs, Didn't Have a Trigger Today","4 years ago I \[23M\] broke up with my first SO \[22M\]. We basically went from permanent honeymoon enmeshment to her not wanting anything to do with me the next day, with no warnings or reason. I was in such bad shape that I was diagnosed with CPTSD. Everyone thought I lost it, I thought I lost it. In the last 4 years, I've tried to kill myself 3 times but miraculously survived each attempt.

I've spent 4 years beating myself up for not being over her, being constantly confused, not knowing what was reality, and refusing to form meaningful romantic relationships because our relationship was the disastrous prototype.  I let her gaslight me into thinking I was insane for not letting go of her or making peace with the breakup or thinking I deserved an explanation. I let her continue to emotionally abuse me with spontaneous phone calls.

The other day, I found out that she has BPD. This explained everything. I felt the weight of the world lift off my shoulders. I wasn't crazy. And relationships with people aren't supposed to end that way. I didn't hallucinate our relationship. She really did love me intensely one day and not at all the next, completely outside of her control and with the lack of any reason.

Things are finally looking better. I'm no longer having triggers. I can open up without the irrational fear that something completely random will offend someone. I don't have to constantly worry that my friends are secretly plotting to leave me. I'm not depressed and confused all day still trying to figure out something that happened years ago."
869,My life sucks,[removed]
870,I can’t find motivation,I’ve struggled with mental health for a long time but recently i’ve been doing much better. A longtime goal of mine has been to stretch/work out consistently. I can’t seem to find the will to actually do it though. Any advice??
871,A way to harness my need for praise and recognition in a healthy way and turn it into motivation?,"A while ago, I had a psychometric test done by my therapist, and certain personality factors went off the charts, such as Introverted Thinking, and curiously, an element called Extroverted Audacity, defined as a need for external stimulus in order to be productive which in my case can lead to the dependence on praise and acknowledgement for my creative processes or work output. And certainly, one of the most problematic aspects of my life has been that, even if I'm skilled, if my actions are not acknowledged or praised in some way, I lose motivation and can't progress. I know this makes me sound like a spoiled brat and that it's a probably a deformation of my own personality that needs to be explored further, but I thought that rather than overhaul this whole aspect of myself (at least for the time being) I could seize it and canalize it as a motivator in a healthy way. The thing is, I have no idea how to it. So, any advice? thank you!"
872,What should I do?,"One of the members of a discord server I joined was someone I had a bad experience with, leading me to quit the server almost immediately after joining. I could live without the server, but seeing their messages haunted me. About this time last year, my predatory and clingy behavior destroyed our friendship, and judging by their messages they're still traumatized, they're afraid of me. Seeing those messages gave me feelings of guilt I haven't felt since the incident. I can't help but feel that numerous recent events in my life are the result of bad karma from this event. Fortunately, they had no idea I was in the server for the few minutes I was there. I'm not a part of any other servers they're a part of. All I hope is that their trauma goes away and they can live in peace."
873,I can't enjoy anything,Hey. I know I'm not depressed and my life is seemingly going well regardless of my childhood. The thing is I've lost the inspiration I can't think of something creative nor enjoining any thing even when I talk to people I show no interest even inside I think of something else or I pretend to show interest. Sometimes I describe myself as emotionless maybe 80% of the time I don't know but I care how people see me and what is their perspective of me.
874,Looking for advice for possible work accommodations...,"I am absolutely terrible about asking for help when I really need it. Like, I could be drowning in a pool and tell the life guard “it’s okay. Watch the kiddy pool - they need you more” level of self-detriment here. But I’m trying my best to change that and give myself the care that I actually deserve.

Officially my diagnosis includes PTSD and OCD, but very recently it’s come to my attention that the odds are VERY good that I’m also on the spectrum for autism - something that I am bringing up with my psychiatrist next time I speak with her in two weeks.

I can’t always tell when people are joking with me, and it’s very common for both customers and coworkers to get frustrated and yell “I was just joking OP!!!” when I answer rhetorical questions honestly and to the best of my ability. I do not handle changes to plans well - I had a mild anxiety attack after realizing that when I had placed a food order that I had not confirmed what actually went into the meal and was now being faced with an additional ingredient (one that I actually enjoy but because it took me by surprise I was freaking out about having wasted my money/the restaurant’s time and supplies). 

I suffer from blackouts. No warning, no real discernible trigger aside from intense stress - and worst of all no need for alcohol for them to happen (though it does expedite the process even with just a single 5% APV seltzer). These episodes occur mostly at home but I can’t be certain that they haven’t happened at work too as I don’t act any differently during them - I just don’t retain any memory of it until the following day.

I’ve been working with my doctor with my medications, and with her approval/knowledge have been supplementing my meds with hemp now that it is legal where I live to use. I have things mostly under control to the point that I “function”, but there is a promotion opportunity that I am qualified for at my job. It’s a managerial position, but I know the job backwards and forwards and could absolutely kill at it if I could get the help that I need to rise to the challenge. My only issue though is that I’ve never asked for this kind of help before, and I have no idea where to even start. I don’t know what’s “reasonable” to ask for, especially given that for the majority of my life I’ve been forced to suck it up and push through it all. I only started getting medical care for all of this in the past 6 years despite having life-long symptoms.

I’m not asking for what specific things to do for me (that will come up with my doctor of course), but I would absolutely love it if someone could give me a general idea of what to look for so that I can bring a game plan to my psychiatrist and bosses at work."
875,What does this sound like to you all? [21M],"First and foremost I want to make clear I'm *not* looking for a diagnosis from anyone, I'm currently on a waiting list to see a professional, but I want to hear what you all think. And yes I am on medication; 2 anti-depressants and anti anxiety meds.

I would say most days of the week I have pretty bad mood swings, I can go from crying, thinking I'm the worst person in the world and thinking of ways to kill myself, to happy hanging out with friends just like anyone else, all in a matter of hours. Now I know that I've always been a naturally sensitive person but this can't be normal.

I have the worst fear of abandonment, this was apparent when I was last in a relationship (the only one I've ever had) and it does still happen with my friends, specifically the friend I would say I'm closest with. I've always had this problem and I think getting bullied as a child from 7-11 has something to do with it. Just earlier today I started thinking about how I don't deserve them in my life and how one day they'll abandon me, that literally gave me a panic attack. This makes me appear very clingy and sometimes I can't just leave people alone because of this.

I have a big fear of rejection too, as a result it's very hard for me to get into a relationship, and right now I am jobless and this affects applying for jobs and in the past college too.

I frequently self harm, I do it for multiple reasons, first is when I feel down or anxious doing that makes me feel better, and I also do it because I have a *need* to see my own blood, not sure why but it makes me feel very satisfied.

When I get stressed I do some compulsive behaviours like certain twitching, or I'll have to check something 5 times before I'm okay with it. Even when I'm not stressed I still count the amount of times when I do anything, I can't do things an odd number of times unless it's once or five times. Everyday I get random thoughts like, ""If I don't pass this sign post before this car does then my family will die"" or ""then this friend will leave me"". These thoughts I know are stupid but I just can't ignore them.

Although I do have social anxiety I do crave interaction with others and sometimes I can be a bit of an attention seeker. I will do things and regret it later as a result. I can look for attention even with minor things like wearing bright colours when going outside just so more people look at me. It's like I've been starved of attention but in reality that's not really the case.

Thanks if anyone reads this 🙂"
876,I feel like I'm really odd.,"I'm not trying to be like ""xd imso qUirKy!!"". I'm pretty serious. I feel like I do things that people notice are weird, or have mannerisms that I feel either u comfortable not doing. Do when like, happy or something, and just feel wrong not doing. 

So, lets start off with one most people notice pretty fast. I sway. Alot. Standing still at a stop light, chatting with friends. In the kitchen. I sway. I buckle my knees and in the same pace Every time away side to side by the hips. I don't even notice myself doing it. But if I try to not do it, I feel physically uncomfortable. 
I can't stand some textures. Like. Chalk. I feeI my a stomach queeze when I touch it. I still use it, like at school. But other wise I still look uncomfortable. Actually, many things make me physically uncomfortable. Like, wearing both headphones, I can't hold forks properly, i hold them mainly with my pinkies.  

I talk to myself in the sense that I basically have full on conversations with myself. I will be alone (or so I think) talking with myself. Thinking completely outloud. Thinking in my head often leaves me feeling overwhelmed by my thoughts and like I can never fully process. I even laugh at my thoughts 

Recently I've been clicking. Like. I don't know why?! Just. I've been clicking my tongue for like up to 5 minutes at a time when enjoying something like a game. Or just on my own. I also find myself the moment I stop focusing, or focusing to much to be touching my lip. Like, my, always left, eye. 

Constantly cracking, my toes. 

I crave affection but feel my stomach tighten any time anyone touches me in anyway

But the thing is, this could all be completely normal!! My repetitive nature, my constant sort of mannerisms. I have no clue. But my family keeps pointing it out and it keeps getting to me.

877,"No one ever remembers my birthday, and I feel like it bothers me more than it should...what do you think?","I'm the type of person who texts people first to get conversations going.

The type of friend who puts in 95% of effort into friendships and that if I stopped caring so would the other person.

I'm the type of friend who loves giving gifts and letters on birthdays and seeing smiles on people's faces who wouldn't expect me to remember it. I just love making people happy, that's how I get happy. I always put people's birthdays in my calendar and make an effort to call or at least text them (depending on our friendship). Because it makes me so happy when people remember so I want to spread that feeling if I can. (granted if I go to text someone happy birthday and our last conversation was a happy birthday then I don't, haha). 

Anyway, no one ever remembers mine. I only get those messages on Facebook because Facebook tells people. On snapchat because I have the cake next to my name.

I remember growing up and seeing these long posts on instagram for people's birthdays and snapchat stories. I never got that. Mine was in the summer so I couldn't make a big deal at school for it. No one was around because it's in the middle of summer.

Even to this day, I rarely ever get texted from anyone outside of my family.

I turned it off on snapchat to really see who remembers. I mean yea it'll make me sad when no one does, but if someone does I know that it means they really did remember, and it'll just make me so happy.

I'm really just setting myself up to be sad but if it does happen I'll be over the moon.

But basically. I feel like I'm making it much of a bigger deal than it is. And because of this, I've gown to literally despise my birthday because no one remembers it. I never tell anyone anymore just because I know it means nothing because they'll never remember. I mean if it comes up, I'll say it, but I don't like making a big deal of it anymore because I feel like I'm 'attention seeking' if I do it.

Am I overreacting? Is this an okay thing to be sad about?

I'll add I have really bad depression, anxiety, BPD, PPD, SPD. So this stress is just heightened by all of those, but like, idk. It just bothers me so much and makes me so sad"
878,#freebritney,"Britney Spears was the first person I saw in concert. I have zero questions why 2007’s breakdown happened. It’s happened to me before and I’m not being followed around and harassed by 57,000 people everyday!

879,Update on my experience with ketamine treatment,"I’ve had clinical depression as long as I can remember, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. I’ve tried multiple antidepressants that only made things worse, I’ve had to take months off work because of multiple panic attacks a day. I go to therapy twice a week was slowly getting better but everyday was still a struggle. I finally realized this isn’t sustainable. I am halfway through my ketamine treatments and so far it’s changed my life. I never realized before this that I never went a day without being affecting by my condition. I always just thought I was dull, bad at focusing, low energy. In reality I just had a mood disorder. This has relieved all of my symptoms within just 1 treatment. I have energy, I’m better at my job, happy to wake up in the morning, no stress, more logical, better sleep. For the first time in my life I feel truly happy and there is no weight on me. Of course this isn’t for everyone but if you have treatment resistant depression I urge you to look into this. It’s expensive and is not covered by insurance. I’m not wealthy by any means. I’m a 20 year old girl who moved out at 17 and struggled through my fair share of financial stress. It’s something I started putting money aside for because I realized I deserve to be happy. It is $3000 and it has been worth every single penny. There is stigma around this treatment so I just wanted to share my very positive experience with it."
880,I can stop laughing and smiling.,"I was laughing for half and hour today and I couldn't stop smiling. It was so painful. I cried for a bit and I feel like I'm going from depression to hypomania in a matter of minutes. I can't control my own emotions and I feel like I'm psychotic. Help, please."
881,Is this all therapy is?," I've seen several therapists now, and one thing they all have in common is not asking for details. A conversation with one still usually go like:

Me: I get really scared when x
Therapist: how do you deal with fear? Here is a list of stuff you can think about during an anxiety attack

It's like, I could just Google ""cope with anxiety"" or read a self help book. Nothing my therapists have ever said seemed very personal to my situation, so what's the point in paying? Even after several sessions, none of them seem to know the major events of my life, or what's going on in my life, or anything. They just lead the conversation with basic vanilla advice that could fit anyone in the world and I've heard over and over again.

Is this all it is?"
882,Should i get a second opinion?,"My previous therapist told me I didn't have PTSD from my past marriage because I wasn't exhibiting any signs of trauma. For the last 3 years since my divorce, I have had numerous breakdowns caused by flashbacks that randomly happen. They've happened while driving, the breakdowns can be minor where I need to pull over and just cry and panic. Or they can be severe where I completely blackout and don't realize what happened. Typically when I come to, I've destroyed things and even hurt myself in the process. I have kids with him and we have split custody so I see him every other week. Lately the flashbacks get triggered by anything, literally anything. I don't want PTSD, but I do want answers and I want to know what I can do to help ease it all. Any advice?"

886,intrusive imagery?,"sometimes when i close my eyes i have these rapidly flashing images that aren’t necessarily harmful or gross but are just disturbing in nature. and not clear pictures either—mostly shapes or silhouettes that seem to have a foundation of a fear or helplessness, dying, guilt, etc. like shapes of people dissolving. or people’s bodies (silhouetted) stretched out in unnatural ways, being contorted. shapes flashing farther away and then getting closer and closer. it could just be a black square or diamond flashing closer but there’s something so sinister about it that it really unnerves me. does anyone else experience something similar? do you know what it’s called?"
887,Life sucks rn,"I’ve barely seen my friends for weeks, the last one I saw was a fucking bitch last time we hung out, my best friend is with her boyfriend so she doesn’t ever talk to me anymore or see me which sucks bc she lives far away so it’s not like I can see her daily. And all my other friends live in the city only one of my friends lives here and she is just so fucking annoying and makes me feel so shitty. I haven’t been doing anything except getting high and eating a bunch of food and binge watching tv shows. I’ve done a couple projects around the house and stuff but that’s it. My dogs r the only things that make me happy. I miss being able to feel things and do things. Even just going to the movie theater or going into places without stupid fucking masks and god I miss going to the city so much. And seeing my friends and getting crossed and listening to good music and having things/people to look forward to/care about like I’m dying in here I feel so empty and lost. But I’m gonna try to change that tomorrow, I’m gonna start doing the things I know I should be doing; going outside, drinking enough water, getting 10,000 steps, working out, meditating. I’m gonna do it tomorrow whether I like it or not! I still feel absolutely nothing but I guess I’m hopeful that will change!!! Haha if it doesn’t I’m srsly gonna lose I can’t even cry anymore please send help"
888,i feel pain in my chest and heart,so i watched a video of rick may(tf2 soldier voice actor) and it made me think of losing my grandma so long ago. i have suffered through painful memories and i feel like I'm losing a peaceful life. i love life but life never loved me. i lost alot of happy things in my life. when i lost my grandma it felt like i was cut open and i felt lonely. i have lost a person in my life and yesterday my sister was in a accident. she is ok now but it reminds me of my accident 6 years ago. the truma from the car scars me. I'm scared of losing people in my life. i blamed my grandma death when it was her time. the holidays are different since she isn't here. she would have a joking side and she would be a happy person but she knew that she didn't have long. she was a star that shine. she had so many times. she dead in her sleep and i never saw her again. it hurts me.... it hurts me so much that i can't be happy during the holidays. she would have happy memories of me when i was younger. she would tell stories about me and i would be embarrassed. i wouldn't lie to myself that I don't miss her. she helped me through alot of things when my mom would work. i was happy when she did that but i was lying to myself that no one is happy forever. my memories are fuzzy so I don't remember much so I'm a mess but my parents would remember me of things i did in public or at home. but that memory of the car hitting me still remains. i have nightmares of it when i know I'm scared of death. when i have that nightmare i wake up in sweat and tears because i never wake up. i feel like I'm a dead man that is haunted by that. i don't sleep alot because if i do then i will have a nightmare of that day. i have the scar on my eye from the glass from the car. i want to forget that memory but I'm reminded that I'm going die in a horrible or peaceful way. I'm nothing but a ghost to my friends in Dawsonville because they don't remember me. i suffered in silence through middle school because no one cares about me. i felt alone when i wake up in the hospital room. i know that I'm helping others because i don't want others to suffer through pain. i don't want others to be afraid of me because I'm trying help others by talking to them. if i lost my sister then what would happen if I didn't know? i go through the same thing like i did as my grandma. i don't want to suffer anymore. i want help from others. i have to face the truth and say that I'm not ok.

891,Mental block with weight loss? 17M,"Apologies if this is somewhat of a ramble or more of a vent than a question, I’ll try to keep it short and collected.

I’ve been heavyset for as long as I can remember, and it’s been a serious point of distress for me. Especially in the last 4-5 years, I’ve had very bad self esteem issues. I’ve gone through stages lasting anywhere from 3 weeks to 4 months where I go to the gym very frequently and diet to the best of my availability (I live with my parents and can’t spend much on healthy foods since I have to save for college), but at some point I’ll get discouraged and become embarrassed of my body at the gym. It seems I’m stuck in this loop of becoming over confident/determined to getting so frustrated I quit altogether. But at the same time even when I do try my hardest my parents refuse to switch to healthier foods. I know this seems selfish of me to try and change the whole family’s eating routine for my own sake, but we eat extremely unhealthy and it’s very difficult to eat right when I’m living with them. They’ve been very unhelpful and telling me that I’m just naturally big and should accept it, but I can’t accept it. This doesn’t feel like me. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I don’t recognize myself. I’ve always been heavy, yet somehow it feels like I shouldn’t. I just can’t get it through to them on how upset being the weight I am makes me, and it’s very distressing because it feels like they don’t care.

I guess the point I’m getting to is: is there anyway to break out of this loop? Is there any therapy that could help me get in the right mindset? Or is this something I need to work out on my own. Any help/advice/resources would help immensely. Sorry this isn’t well put together, I wrote this when I was rather emotional. I live in the US if that helps any"
892,Need help. Active duty marine.,I have serious problems for the past 3 years.
893,how can i help a friend experiencing low self esteem?,"So recently, one of my best friends came clean to me about the fact that he absolutely hates himself. It broke my heart to hear, and he mentioned that even hearing compliments from me doesn’t really do anything to fix it. He doesn’t need the validation from others, but he doesn’t give himself validation either. What can I do to help him without complimenting him? I’ve already suggested counseling, and he will be looking into that. Any other suggestions? Thanks :)"
894,How the fuck do people do it,"Every single fucking day is just the same, monotonous and numb and fucking devoid of any feeling or emotion at all. Even at times where I should be happy like a nice dinner or something I'm just numb and quiet and zoned out the entire time. I'm literally incapable of just being happy or being sad I'm just here with no motivation or goals or aspirations or feelings. i ended my 3 year freedom from self harm on accident the other night and relapsed on the 2 weeks I've been free from nicotine and I've got a therapy session in 10 days that I actually wanted this time so I could not lie and actually hopefully get better or I'll probably just fucking end it because I'm tired of being numb every fucking day of my entire life."
895,How can I deal with stress and anxiety in healthy ways?,"Recently I've been getting more and more stressed due to anxiety issues, is there any way I can deal with this myself in a healthy way."
896,i dont know know what to do,"this might be long but i (19F) am so pent up and unhappy that i have decided to dump my problems onto the internet because i have no one else to tell this to. 

i have convinced myself for the longest time that i am weak and lazy. that’s why life is so hard and dreadful. i never considered that i might have some kind of mental disorder that’s making it hard for me to function because all my friends are diagnosed with either depression, ADHD/ADD, or anxiety. if around 10% of the US population suffers from depression and around 5-11% of the US population has ADHD, then it wouldn’t make sense for me to have it too if all of my friends do (probably not a correct usage of statistics but this is just how my brain thinks). throughout high school my friends would praise me for being neuro typical and say how much they wished they could be normal like me. i took on that role so that i could look strong despite the fact that i hated waking up everyday. but hey what teenager doesn’t hate waking up in the morning right? is it not normal? 

Anyways i’m in college now and i’ve been doing my part with social distancing. this has given me plenty of time to myself and i’ve been thinking A LOT. literally to the point where i can’t tell what’s actually real anymore. i think there’s a lot wrong with me but i’m not sure what? maybe there’s nothing wrong with me and this is just my personality or i can’t handle normal human suffering? i don’t know im not well versed in mental issues at all. no one ever taught me about this. my parents always told me it wasn’t real, you’re either normal or batshit crazy. 

so here are some things that i’ve been questioning:

i don’t think my relationships with my friends are real, at least on my end. i have a few close friends who have expressed their gratitude and my importance in their life. of course i reciprocate and tell them the same exact thing but the problem is that i don’t actually feel that way. it feels like i’m acting the whole time. i say what i think they want to hear to make them happy but in all honesty i do not care. when i hang out with them i’m mostly quiet and i dont have a good time. 

if i interact with people, i will dwell on the smallest thing and beat myself over it wondering why i ever said or did that. these “embarrassing” moments get replayed in my mind over and over again and sometimes it even makes me have a physical reaction like a shiver or a gag. this sounds insane but it helps if i make a finger gun, hold it up to my head, and say bang. i guess this counts as suicidal ideation. i’m not going to act on it but on some days i start planning methods which is as far as i’ve gone so don’t worry. 

i dont feel affection or attraction to people. i have had many guys speak to me with romantic intention but i never feel anything back, in fact all i feel is disgust. knowing that they’re probably thinking of me sexually makes me uncomfortable and i have turned everyone down. therefore i have never ever had a boyfriend and now there are multiple rumors of me being a lesbian (i am not this is the one thing i know for sure). maybe i’m just picky? 

nothing is fun anymore. i find every tv show boring and movies are too much of a time commitment. maybe because all i’ve been doing is watching tv? isn’t it natural to get bored of things after a while? i’ve tried starting new hobbies but i’m someone who needs instant gratification. if i am not good at something right away there is no point to me. i find myself being an amateur at something embarrassing and i don’t want others to see me fail or struggle. 

sometimes i go into this weird state where it feels like i’m in a dream. i look around at my surroundings and it seems so familiar yet so foreign at the same time. i look down at my hands and move them around but it feels strange, like i didn’t have hands before but now i suddenly do and i have to learn how to use them if that makes sense. i have to remind myself where i am and who i am and then it gradually goes away. 

so yeah those are a few of the thoughts that have been keeping me up at night. thank you to whoever read this far. i just don’t know what to do i’m tired of feeling this way i want to start enjoying life. therapy is an option i know, but i always start crying when i talk about myself and it’s hard for me to trust people. i’ve never told anyone about the things i wrote above that’s why i’m using reddit because no one can know who i am. even so, i’m probably going to flee from this site for a while after posting this because i’ll get morbidly embarrassed for sharing things about myself."
897,I dont feel any emotions very strongly and it's been this way for years. Should I worry?,"What I mean is that I still feel things like happiness, sadness, anger, ect often. It's never strong and never long lasting. After a few minuites of feeling something I'm back to just being jaded."
898,Confused about my diognosis,"Hi everyone 
I'm a little confused about my diognosis can anyone clear it up for me please? 
I've recently moved to a new area and have had to change mental health services. I had a review 2nd July over the phone  and recieved a letter with a different diognosis. It said that he suspects that I primarily suffer from eupd and that I also have a strong flavour of a rapid cycling mood disorder. Originally rcmd was my only diognosis with undertones of eupd. Do I have both? I take lithium will this be used for both of these conditions? 
Any advice or info or own experiences ut would be much appreciated"
899,"Intrusive thoughts, mental chatter, or what the heck is this?","Sometimes as I’m laying in bed I hear some sort of subconscious chatter in my head. It’s not any sort of conscious thought, I feel like I’m not in control of it, it’s kind of like I’m listening to a radio station. I don’t think it would be considered a hallucination, its not an external sound, it’s all inside my head. It’s nothing distressing and it doesn’t even make sense most of the time, just random words and phrases. Does this happen to anyone else or am I just weird?"
900,How did you tell your parents that you want to try and seek psychological therapy and counseling?,"I’m 22F and I’ve been struggling with my mental and emotional health for the past years. In 2019, I wanted to try out and get counseling but I never got to, because I was scared. What if I was only overthinking that I have a problem? What if I’ll get better after a while? What if what I’m struggling about is so shallow and I was just overreacting about it? And I felt I got better, but then here I am again. Struggling. My friend who is a psychologist was the one I’m consulting with if I should get therapy, and she told me I should by this time because it keeps coming back. Now my problem is, how do I tell my parents that I would want to go through counseling and therapy? I do not open up much to them and I’m scared that they’re just gonna shrug it off. 

Any tips on how do I go about this? And if my decision to get therapy is a good one?"
901,What does this sound like? (Possible adolescent issue),"I have a son, 7M who is very normal for the most part. He does have controlled epilepsy and has focus problems at school diagnosed as ADHD but for the past couple weeks or maybe months he’s been complaining about the same “sensation” he’s been experiencing. 

Every couple days or so, he will hear someone say something and it will repeat in his head over and over again for minutes. We were at the grocery store earlier and a stranger asked us “hey, you guys in line” and he says he can hear the line, in the strangers voice repeating. I don’t think he’s making it up because it seems to be genuinely frustrating to him. I tried doing some searching but couldn’t find the right words to explain it. 

Anyone have any ideas? Thanks."
902,I'm just so tired.,"I was always seen as the happy person in my friend group, nothing going on in her life, just happy. I was the therapist of the group if that makes sense. I put up an act that my life was perfect so that my friends has someone they could talk to without feeling like they were putting more pressure on someone dealing with their own stuff. I was the person that, if they needed to, could be used as a bit of relief. And eventually, someone I knew abused that. They knew I was bad at saying no. They knew I would do anything in my power to help my friends. So they used me up, put everything on me, and eventually I couldn’t handle it. Once they realized they got no more benefit from me, they left. And that shattered me into pieces. 

Now, I’m just so tired. I can barely get out of bed anymore. I can barely talk to my friends. I can barely do what I love to do. I went numb. I couldn’t feel a thing. I stayed like that for a few months. Eventually I got back to doing what I loved, and I started talking to people more often again. But something happened. I felt too numb. I broke. So I started cutting a few days ago. It hurt, but that was a feeling. It was actually a feeling. But with that feeling came guilt. And all my “progress” crashed down. I’m back to the shell I used to be. I can’t do what I love anymore, I sleep for half the day, I stopped talking to my friends as much. And now, I have no clue what to do with these cuts on my arms.

I couldn’t cut tonight, and I’m so glad for that. But I know the only reason is because I stayed up late talking to one of my friends, and he made me feel better. He actively put in an effort to make me feel better. And I can’t imagine what he’d do if I told him what I did to myself. But if I can’t talk with him tomorrow, I’m scared I’ll cut. And each day we don’t stay up talking, I’ll cut. But I can’t tell him that. And I can’t make him the therapist friend. Not after what happened to me. I just need someone to open up to, but I can’t. I want to be me again, but I can’t.

So I’m tired. I’m tired of being a stupid therapist friend. I know I won’t change just because I’m tired of it, but maybe I’ll be able to talk about my own problems someday. For now, I’m just rambling on the internet, hoping someone reads this and can comfort me in some way. Because I’m a shell of who I once was, and I just want to go back."
903,Been feeling stifled - How to be more individual? (as a twin),"Hey redditors! I've been feeling incredibly stifled and almost depressed for a while. I feel like I've lost having my own life and like I'm a shadow of my past self.

For context, I live with my twin, whom I went to the same college with, but now we've graduated and are both working from home rn, so we're just constantly at home together doing the same thing). We do literally everything together, socially as well which is the main point of annoyance. Cute in theory, but I notice myself getting pssed off/distanced for no reason because I miss having my own life and I need to do things alone once in a while... and she likes doing everything together. But I'm getting so so sick of always having to take someone else into consideration when making plans. 

For example, I'll mention I have plans with a friend and she'll be like ""can we not go for too long though I still think we should \[insert task\] today"". I wanted to go alone though, and I wouldve just finished that task on my own time.. whenever I have plans with anyone, it's always a package deal.. All of our friends have become mutual. Any friends who text me, it's in a group chat with her. It's like we've become the ""twin blob"". Sometimes I feel myself zoning out whenever we see anyone because... idk I've been talking to her all day and I just don't feel like socializing with her more at the moment. Also, having her around changes the dynamic with certain friends. I have probably only one friend that I try &amp; talk to and hang out with without her - one best friend that isn't also her best friend - and she's kind of weird about that friend because I'm more assertive about hanging out with that friend alone and have to consciously exclude her. 

We work from home and make our own hours because of Covid, so it's not like I can go to work or be out and about by myself either until like next year. During college, we had different classes, saw our friends at different times, had different social events going on during the weekends. Now... not so much. It's like ""WE have xy's party next week"" or ""WE're getting dinner with xy"" cuz really, there's no reason to go separately. Now that we're out of school we probably manage to see individual friends twice a month or so, even best friends, everyone's busy with their SOs and careers and it's just harder to coordinate seeing people. Maybe that's a reason that we always ends up going together.

Growing up, she also always used to be the ""alpha"" twin. I actually talked to her about how I crave doing things without her sometimes to kind of be seen as my own individual and she just... didn't get it. She's like ""what, why, I love doing everything together."" Probably because she was always seen as her own person regardless, while I was slightly more shy and just seen as ""the twin."" For example, she used to write in her diary that she thought all the boys had crushes on her and she couldn't decide between them, whereas I would write about not being seen and no one ever liking me lol. (We objectively look extremely similar so it wasn't about our looks)

Any advice? I just want more autonomy, and I want to gently let her know what I want to do without it getting weird. Our parents are also extremely involved in our lives even though we're in our 20's, so I just don't feel like I'm able to live the \~young wild and free\~ life most people our age have. I still feel like I'm the little girl doing everything with her twin sister under her parents' approval. The only way out of it that I can imagine getting more individual is starting to date someone, but there's no one in sight right now lol cuz no one's getting out and meeting people."

906,I am confused,[removed]
907,Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?,"Ok, I understand that guilt is a huge factor when it comes to people with mental health. I have been diagnosed with DID and Severe Generalized Anxiety. It has taken me years of medications, various therapists and learned coping mechanisms to be the functioning human I am today.  Everyday is still a struggle but, I’m at peace with that and just take things as they come. 

The problem I have is that I sometimes feel like I don’t deserve to have a mental illness. If that makes sense. I had a rough childhood, but when I start to have a break down or anxiety attack, I always think something along the lines of 

“There are definitely people that have had it worse than I have and they are just fine.” 
Or
“Whatever is happening isn’t as bad as what other people go through and I should just suck it up” 

My rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah, blah, blah. All the logical and rational things a normal brain would think. Then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that I don’t deserve to have these mental issues because my life “isn’t that bad”

I feel like I may not be doing the best job of describing what I’m feeling lol but can anyone relate?"
908,Does anyone else ever get that random feeling of dread like something bad is gonna happen?,Not really a major concern or anything but sometimes I get this feeling of dread like something bad is gonna happen but nothing happens and the feeling passed after a minute or so.
909,"Found out i had tonsillitis, now i'm super anxious.","I haven't felt this anxious in months. I was experiencing horrible symptoms the last few days and a very sore throat and ear on ome side. Checked my throat today and found my left tonsil looked infected and had white spots and was suuper swollen and I'm just having a panic attack right now. I can't eat because I keep thinking about it, I can't swallow without thinking about it. I dont know how to calm down, I've been crying for 15 minutes non stop."
910,Living sucks,"Nothing has motivated me to do better for a long time. Dropped out of high school even though my teachers told me that if I finished the second half of my class work (online school) I could move on to my next year of school and do the extra classes then. This was a while ago. Didn't motivate me.
Got held back, had to redo my first year. Didn't get too far. Dropped out after that.

I should get to fixing my health, but I don't have the motivation for it. Everyone always thinks I'm just being lazy and that's it though.

Nothing gives me motivation. Not fear. Not inspirational quotes or inspirational videos or inspirational posts. I'm just without motivation. I don't have it. I don't know why.

Hardly did middle school, hardly did high school. Maybe it would have been better to stay in public school, but I couldn't handle being in a school after elementary. It made my anxiety skyrocket. There wasn't a second in my short time at middle school (while I was waiting for my school materials to arrive in the mail) where I didn't feel anxious to some extent. Now I really, actually can't go back to school because I have health issues that make my immune system really not as good as it should be and my dad already doesn't care about me or him getting sick. I can't be in a crowded school all day, waiting to get sick and go to the hospital.

Now I'm just kinda in a shit situation and I don't know what to do. I keep telling myself and my parents that I'll just get my GED instead of a high school diploma but they don't trust me and honestly I don't either, I don't feel like my brain can learn anything else. I always forget what I learn unless it's something my brain somehow thinks is really important. I don't even remember most math that I learned in 6th grade (last year of elementary. Not hard math, I probably should remember it.)

My parents never taught me how to be an adult either. I'm not an adult yet, but when I turn 17, it'll only be a year. Then my dad is probably gonna yell at me to ""get the fuck out of his apartment"" either when I'm 18 or a couple years after. Maybe school is supposed to teach you adult stuff, I have no idea. All I know is that he doesn't seem like he wants to teach me about it anytime soon. He usually gets angry when I ask a bunch of questions and acts like I should just KNOW stuff that I haven't been taught. There's no way to tell when he'll answer my questions with no problems or when he'll start getting angry and telling me to leave him alone so he can ""watch his goddamn show already.""

Don't know how to be an adult, don't know how to drive, dropped out of school, unhealthy, can't motivate myself in any way, hardly remember anything from school besides certain things, socially awkward, don't want to live here anymore, anxiety, possibly depression but it isn't clear, dad doesn't really care what I do as long as I just don't bother him. I mean, what am I even supposed to do? 

This whole thing honestly just makes me want to give up on everything. I'm not actively suicidal but when I start thinking about this stuff, it makes me feel like it would just be better to not exist because this is just so fucking exhausting. Thinking about the future is exhausting. Thinking about the past is embarrassing. I can't just think about the present because then, I'm just avoiding thinking about what I'm gonna do in the future."
911,I don't understand why I'm always mad at home,"The past few years I've been noticing how I'm only mad at home, my family always tells me I'm useless, selfish and have anger issues. I don't understand why I'm always mad around my family, even when they aren't saying shit about me I get mad when they come near me, touch me and talk to me.

School started three days ago and as soon as I got to school I started being happy and excited about everything, I like talking to my friends and hugging them or them playing with my hair makes me happy. Yet as soon as I get home it's like a switch, I'll lock myself in my room and avoid talking with anyone.

I'm just always so angry and sad and I wish I knew why"
912,What could it be?,"
I have some weird periods in my life. I am either really productive or depressed. They switch within a month and they both last for a few weeks or days. A few days ago i felt numb, my head felt heavy, i couldn't think properly, i wasn't productive at all. I did everything on autopilot. I didn't feel any emotions. I had derealization. I just wanted it to stop. Just nothing mattered to me. I don't feel suicidal in these times, i never do. But sometimes i do selfharm, just to feel something. I don't worry about it, because i don't make deep cuts and it calms me down. It's like drinking sedatives for me. 

And now i feel this adrenaline rush, i feel unstoppable. I want to live, i feel extra confident about myself. I can't sleep properly. I fall asleep at 2-3am,because of the anxiety. Like these adrenaline waves go through me. And i don't feel tired. Maybe a little. But i'm still extra productive. Or at least i feel that way. I started reading books again after a long break, i took up online courses, i can't rest. I feel this constant urge to do something. I'm excited to meet new people, to impress them. I kind of enjoy it, but it's so tiring, and sometimes i want to be calm for a change, but i can't. I can't concentrate. Lots of thoughts rush through me, there's so much of them, that i can't even follow my thought process. I want to rest, but i can't.

I go through these ""productive"" and ""lazy"" times within a month. Sometimes i have ""normal"" times. It all happens too fast to be a bipolar disorder. I did some research,usually these periods last for months or years, but my ones switch within days. So what could it be?"
913,"Never saw suicidal ""urges"" being discussed","I never saw this being mentioned anywhere. This happened twice in my life. Once due an INSANE level of pain where I was woken up from a major spine surgery without any pain killers and another time due weeks of insomnia. It's not suicidal ideation nor is it any kind of planing. It really is like an insane urge to end your life. The two times I was in those states, it would have been a piece of cake to end my life. First time I couldn't do it and second time I held my finger over 911 as I was scared I would lose control.

I can never understand how I can end up in those states. Normally, I am scared the heck out of death... These experiences were really disturbing as they go contrary to anything I know about myself. It took me a decade to even open up about it."
914,I'm not sure if I have ever felt empathy or sorry for anything.,"Very recently my memory was jogged after I was informed that a my friends mom passed away. She always treated me so well and I really enjoyed her company. When I was told, I expected myself to be sad or feel bad for my friend. Instead I felt nothing different. I almost felt pressured to react in a certain way so I tried my best to express condolences to my friend.

Looking back I don’t think I’ve ever felt much in situations other people would feel sorry or empathic towards others. I’m not sure what empathy really feels like actually. Is it more so expected behaviour? Or is it really a stand-alone emotion? Am I a damn psychopath or something? I’m concerned about this"
915,I no longer have friends,It is a long story overall but I’ll try to make it shorter. Back a few months ago I started dating a close friend in this group I had of about 8 or so people. Overall this group was who I considered real friends who I actually knew well and trusted. So that girl dated my best friend back a few months before I did and he didn’t tell me but she did when we started dating. As a result he started getting distant with me because it was kind of weird and I think he was upset I did that. Now during this time the person who I was dating and her closest friends in this group essentially removed one of the people because they didn’t like her. As a result there was a lot of stupid arguments with the remaining people in the group argued about who was in charge and it escalated to where the person I was dating and 3 other people were against my best friend who I previously mentioned and someone else who I considered a friend on the same level as him. At that point I got dragged to my girlfriends side by default so the group splintered even further and more bridges were burned. A few weeks later my girlfriend broke up with me because of my mental health issues and I got really fucked up after and as a result I pushed a lot of people away and I kind of separated myself from the group. During that time they added a new person to the group chat and they essentially took where I used to be and now I barely talk to them because of a lot of tension still there and the fact that my girlfriends best friends are in that group. I just had what I considered one of the most stressful weeks of my life for reasons I won’t talk about and I literally haven’t had a conversation with anyone outside of my family or a conversation that has lasted more than 2 minutes. I feel alone since everything splintered and I burned a lot of bridges unintentionally. I know it is just a minor problem but I just have nobody anymore.
916,Why cant I be normal,"Yesterday I self harmed again and had suicidal thoughts . I had been feeling better , and boom. Everything fell apart in front of me .

917,how do i talk to my parents about it,"i don’t wanna be the edgy teenager that self diagnosis their self but i feel like i have some form of anxiety or depression, i’ve self harmed before and often get extremely scared of my irrational fears, i’ve tried to hint to my mom that i don’t think this is normal but she brushes it off as it could never happen, which i find strange because her and most of her siblings have suffered from depression or bipolar disorder. i know i sound like i want to be “cool” and have a metal disorder for quirky points, but i’ve taken a few tests online, and all of them have pointed to moderate to severe anxiety, i just want my parents to take my concerns into consideration."
918,I want to die,"As the title suggests, I want to die. I cannot find a reason to survive. I've tried living for the little things until the little things stopped happening. Now I lay in bed like a lazy pos and I cannot get up. Eating anything makes it worse because I'm not only rotting alive, I'm rotting alive in my new fat. I just want to end it all."
919,What is it called when you wake up and you just want to do *anything*?,"About once every 4 weeks or so, I will wake up and want to do \*exactly\* whatever it is I had previously been planning to do.    Doesn't matter much what is is... I want to do it, and I want to do it NOW.    

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I will wake up, take inventory of the 1 million things I \*need\* to do, and then just ignore all of them.   But every once in a while (roughly every 4 weeks), completely at random, I will choose the most recent task that I'm actually capable of accomplishing, and I will dedicate roughly 1 day toward it."
920,Serotonin meds advice,"Hello, my sister 19 was diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric disorder and was given serotonin medication to take a week before her period. (Apparently this stems from her adhd) 

I’m really concerned about medication as I always believe in a holistic approach as many of those around me do. We know so many people that have become dependent on medication and it has affected them negatively instead of bettering them. 

If you have an experience with serotonin meds I’d really appreciate the advice on this."

923,Is it Imposter syndrome? I need help!,"I feel like there are too many layers to me and I don’t know what to call this. 

I love myself. I am accomplished student and musician (I’m studying to be an opera singer), I’m pretty (a bit chubby but like oh well) I’m a genuine person. I am proud of what I have accomplished in this life. I feel like I am talented and beautiful and I deserve good things and a healthy relationship. I feel like I have soared above my peers in so many ways but it is still not enough.

my subconscious says that maybe I’m not truly good enough to actually be proud of myself, like I don’t DESERVE to love myself as much as I do. and that I’m not beautiful enough to find a partner so I’m not good enough. Even though I feel like I am! I feel like no matter how hard I work it’s never enough. 

On the surface I am confident and out going, extremely extroverted. People do not like me bc of this even though I have never really hurt anyone with my actions. I have said and done things I regret but everyone has. Once people get to know me and truly try they love me I have close friends who I adore and I feel like they love me too. 

I genuinely feel good about myself and That I deserve great things like relationships and success and winning competitions.but I also feel like I’m not supposed to feel that way because I don’t deserve to. This applies to any aspect of my life. Looks, work, school, friendships, relationships. 

I am begging Someone explain this to me. I can’t find a single person who really relates I feel like there’s two of me and they’re constantly fighting."
924,My Therapist wants to talk about my Abuser,"So the title pretty much sums it up, he wants me to talk about what my abuser did to me next week. And to be honest.... I don't think I can talk about it. Its still so raw and horrifying to me. He did things to me that I can no longer do with anyone else. 

How do I talk about something that still gives me nightmares?"
925,"Why can't I make a doctor's appointment online? Im almost never awake during the day to call, and the reason I need to make an appointment is my crippling social anxiety, is there a way to schedule online at most/ any doctors offices? I haven't found a way","If it would help to be more specific, im looking for a psychiatrist in Chandler Arizona"
926,is there something wrong with me?,"i wanna apologize in advance for my vocabulary, i’ve been living in mexico for a year and i’m starting to forget some words, so i’m sorry! 

for years i’ve been having a little voice in my head that just makes me anxious, every time that i do something, i start having this strange thoughts. for example, if i’m showering, this little voice starts telling me these near-death thoughts and it honestly makes my anxiety worse. i can do simple things but this voice just won’t leave me alone. sometimes i can even hear it saying that i should kill myself and that scares me. 
i’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and an adaptation and isolation disorder (i think it’s something like that) so i don’t know if it’s something that was caused by my depression."
927,OCD Medication?,"so i’ve finally faced reality and pending a doctor’s evaluation, i know i have OCD. especially obtrusive thoughts. i already have some anxiety and stuff, who doesn’t? anyway, i’m thinking of getting on prozac because i’m tired of being like this. 

anyone know what it’s like? how long it takes to work? side effects? does it really help?"
928,Sick of this.,"I think I'm ready. I'm ready to be done with this life. Not like, I want to die, because death is my worst fear, maybe not dying, but fear of the unknown. I'm just so tired of my brain, I want a new one. I'm tired of being tired, I'm tired of feeling stupid and sad. I think I have to stop my medication, try something new, but I'm tired of feeling like some sort of lab rat, I keep trying all these drugs trying to find the one that works. I just want to be normal. I want to be happy, I want a reason to be here, because right now the only thing keeping me here is my fear of dying. It's miserable.  I'm miserable. I've tried everything, therapy, medication, self medicating, journaling, meditation, exercise, nothing helps. I want to make it to the day I can say I am strong capable women but right now I don't think that will ever happen and I am terrified. What happens when the people who support me disappear, what happens to me?"
929,I don't want to keep going.,"It feels like a never ending cycle. Every time I feel like I'm getting better, I just go back a thousand steps. 

And I can't get help because there's something lodged into the back of my mind that's telling me I'm just a burden. That I annoy everyone and no one really cares to help. It's this same part of my mind that tells me I'm alone, even though I know I'm not. I know, deep down, that I have people who do care about me, but that part of me isn't strong enough to fight the rest off. 

So I feel alone. Completely alone. 

And I feel so weak and so vulnerable. But more than anything, I feel so tired. I'm tired of feeling all these emotions and feeling so much pain for no exact reason. 

I wish I could take away all of my paranoia, all of my insecurities, all of my pain in the blink of an eye. I wish it was that easy, so I didn't have to be this mess that my loved ones have to deal with. I wish I didn't feel like I was annoying everyone with every little thing I do. 

I wish I could feel happiness without the abrupt interruptions. 

I've tried to find happiness. I've surrounded myself with good people, loving people, but nothing changes. It always comes back to me, feeling unaffected by anything. I just can't be happy with things anymore. And the only person responsible for that is me. No one else. I'm the reason for my unhappiness. 

I want to give up, but I don't want to hurt my family and friends. I love them so much and I know they care about me, but I just can't do it anymore. I can't keep putting up with this. I can't keep living each day trying and eventually failing. 

I'm afraid. I'm afraid that it'll just keep getting worse as time goes on. I'm afraid that one day, years from now, I'll feel amazing and then it'll all come crashing down like before. I'm afraid of it, every time it comes back.

I'm tired and just want to sleep, never waking up again."
930,Getting repressed memories back?,"I’m just wondering if anyone has tried to get repressed memories back??

I can’t remember most of my life and I’ve been told that I’m lucky I can’t remember the bad things.. the problem is I can’t remember the good things either. 

Huge chunks are missing from my memory. Even people who apparently I was friends with, just gone. 

And it’s continuing to happen as an adult. I don’t want to keep losing important memories and people..

What did you do to try and get the memories back? Were you successful? What was the process like?

Thank you in advance"
931,How to deal with episodes?,"So a little bit of Backstory, around 2 years ago I lost a lovely lady who i was very close with to Suicide and then shortly after that my best friend took his own life when he went to university, this crushed me,I between these two events my mum (the parent im close with) left to move very far away from where we used to live, I could not move because I had to many commitments where I was (job , study’s, gf etc), this was a serious challenge as I had to move in with my dad who has a narrsastic personality disorder and my whole life I’ve been crippled by his abuse. Fast forward 2 very long hard years I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. I’ve never really considered my self to have any “mental illness” I think it was trying to play it off as me being weak and a wimp and I drank a lot to cope with these things. But it has now got worse than ever I’ve moved down to my mums again because at my dads I was binge drinking very heavily to try and sedate the evenings (night time is the worse) but my question is how do I stop my self getting into these horrible episodes of extreme anger and depression. I understand I can’t “stop” it for now but when I feel my self going into one of these episodes which is dark thoughts, anger , extreme paranoia or how do I try and prevent or at least try and deal with it fast before I go to deep into them. My gf is really struggling right now because I can’t control my head and unfortunately I can not afford to go private for therapy so I’m still on a waiting list. Is there any exercises to do which when I feel the adrenaline and the paranoia kick in the mean time? Or can try and flatten it or make it end faster? 
Sorry If I haven’t worded it quite right I’m very new to this , I’ve played it off for two years saying I’m just weak and being a wimp. I think that’s due to loosing my best friend I always told my self I would never get into that position he was in. For his sake and for my family friends and family’s sake because I saw how much it crushed us all. 
Also please don’t give my mum hate for moving far away she did what she had to do to get away from my dad and I’m old enough to fend for my self I have a huge amount of respect for her and still saw her every few months, and yes I’ve stopped binge drinking at the moment."
932,Anxiety,My anxiety causes me to have panic attacks that make me feel like i HAVE to act now. whether it’s regarding sending an impulsive text to someone or getting something done that doesn’t have to be done right then. I was wondering what some coping strategies are to slow down and clear my head so I can stop being so impulsive?
933,My mental roller coaster,"My mental health has taken a hit. Initially in February my father got diagnosed with Neuropathy. He shifted to a renal diet which deteriorated his health. Then came coronavirus induced lockdown. Few days later my girlfriend calls me early morning saying her father's health was not good and they took him to hospital. I had to tend to him as we live in the same city and none of her family could come. Watching him unable to put on his shoes broke my heart. 1 week on he got better and was discharged. Good going. Next, one of my uncle contracted COVID, and was in a hospital in a different city. In the meantime one of the drugs prescribed to my dad started showing its side effects such as weight loss, loss of apetite, increased sugar level, insomnia etc. He lost so much of weight in a period of 3 weeks. Then my father had a carbuncle due to which he then had to be admitted into a hospital. He underwent surgery and was discharged within the next week. The carbuncle left a huge cavity as such we had to visit the hospital every alternate day for dressing. My uncle who contracted COVID showed some signs of respite as his second RT-PCR test came negative. He was off ventilator and improved somewhat. All information we got was from the doctor attending to him as nobody was allowed into the hospital other than patients. Last night his oxygen level fell, went into ventilator , multiple organ failure by today morning. Got news few hours back that he passed away, COVID being the underlying cause. My family is devastated beyond measure. My father and my uncle werefirst cousins, so you can imagine the effect of his passing away on my father. I need help to help my family. 2020 has not been kind to us"

937,Is something wrong with my emotions?,"I've noticed that I don't feel any strong emotions, only light emotions. Like at a funeral, other people are crying while I have close to no reaction, horror games or videos don't scare me as much as other people, and its hard for me to feel sad or stunned when I normally should be. I doubt there's anything wrong with me, but i'm just making sure"
938,Introversion - Need of Alone Time,"I had a recent outburst but people misunderstood me by labelling me as bad person or crazy. This happened last thursday, Im on my alone time because my wife and I had fight last Wednesday. She annoyed me and I dont feel like talking to her. I also dont eat much food and just having minimal food intake because I dont have an appetite. Im finishing my work thursday night, and our babysitter kept bugging me asking to eat when I already said I dont want to. I got annoyed and raised my voice but she got angry and told my wife. My wife rushed to me angrily and said things and I explained that Im not doing anything bad, I just got annoyed because I already told I dont want to eat. But my wife keep saying things, I also told her I just want to be alone and I dont have an appetite. But she keeps nagging, she even said that there is no room in our house for alone time, I should not stay here (they are a family of extroverts, thats why I partly understand where it came from). Her nagging doesnt stop, and I repeatedly said I just want to be alone until I lose my control, shouted curse word. Everyone heard it from 3rd to 1st floor of our house.
I feel guilty that I went outburst but I dont like the feeling being blamed 100% for what happened.

We are newly wed for 11 months now and have a baby. But we are together since 2017. Being together for 3 years and I still feel she doesnt fully understand me. I told stories of my situation before, I also keep a journal which she can read. My mom also talked to her about me requiring alone time. I even tried to explain it to her before but it seems she's not interested.

It is very difficult for me when these things happen. People dont understand you and they dont even bother to try.

Are my feelings valid? And my behavior of needing alone time even I am already married normal? Should seek counseling? or Mental Health professionals?"
939,How can I stop anxiety from killing my dating confidence,I [M23] just feel so weak and unattractive when I get anxious about stuff like replying to a woman’s text or when anxiety creates awkward situations.

940,[REQUEST] Someone qualified to do an AMA on OCD and how to care for people with it.,"Religious subreddits like r/Christianity often attract people who either self-identify as having OCD or otherwise demonstrate the symptoms of religious scupulousness.

For some, posting on Reddit itself is part of their unhealthy fixation, but well-meaning responders are engaging in debates with them that actually reinforce the destructive behaviours of the illness.

We want to care for these Redditors, and educate a wider audiance on how to do this too. We hoped an AMA with a mental health practitioner might be able to explain how disfunctional religious scrupulousness differs from healthy devout faith practices? And helpful strategies for people living with OCD, and their carers?

Please respond here, direct message me or the mods over at r/Christianity."
941,How easy is it to spiral,"Everyone knows how difficult life can get sometimes and how drastically it can impact your health. No matter what though it is essential to know that regardless of how dire things might seem, life does go on, and things always have the capacity to improve. Everyone has bad things happen. Recently, I was experiencing severe depression and anxiety. My aunt died of a drugs overdose, then my grandma committed suicide right after. Then my mum got diagnosed with cancer. I was immensely behind on work for my final year of university and completely shut down. I felt like I couldn’t talk to anyone about how difficult I was finding it, and was totally isolated. Then, as if that wasn’t enough stress, I accidentally burned down my parents’ home by discarding a cigarette carelessly which set fire to the shed and the fire spread to the main building. For a few nights everything was dreadful and I couldn’t see any way that life was ever going to get any better at all. But, things pick up. Society is built so that there are processes in place to help when things go wrong, and no matter how trivial things might seem, people do actually care and if you’re going through bad things will help. Insurance procedures kicked in, university gave me extensions. My mum got treatment and has begun to recover, and with time I came to accept the passing of my family members. Obviously I still have extremely low days, but from my experience I’ve realised it’s essential to literally never lose faith and to never give up. Expect the worst, hope for the best. Don’t catastrophise. You aren’t alone. Life is a constant state of change and things that seemed like they would define you don’t have to if you don’t let them. It’s so easy to think the world is over because of things that happen. It’s so easy to spiral, but always know that you can reach out and that people care. Things can, and often will, get better."
942,How to express anger without exploding,"Ok not sure if this forum is the right place to ask if not apologies. I need to know how to positively express my anger. 

I'm generally really passive and this builds up. As a result when I do express my anger it just cones out as an explosion. There's no in between it goes straight to 100.

I'm normally pretty passive so I genuinely don't know what to do here."
943,struggling with communication,i feel like communication is just an attempt to rectify the fracturing of being. or like the separation of us all.  i know this sounds pretentious but its really how i think and im bad at communicating so that theory doesnt work out very well for me. i think i try to take other people into account simultaneously as i express myself and it confuses me and affects what im trying to express.  i was really into heroin a few years ago and it seemed to clear everything up for awhile.... i ended up thousands of dollars in debt and had to rope it off as an irrrational answer to the problem. idk what to do now. im better than i was but im not happy. happiness seems like such an abstract concept to me now that its nearly impossible to believe that its attainable. i guess i just want someone to listen.
944,"My ex planned her date to "" leave"" us. I need help immediately","I try to let go of her yet so many worries give me anxiety every day. Today she invited me to a chat to tell me of her suicide plans. She said I was the one leaving, I feel like I'm the one who broke her hope even though she was the one breaking it to not pull me through her problems.

I didn't want her to be pulled through mine, I tried to move on, but now it seemed like a mistake.

What can I do to stop her? As much she hurt me in the past, I knew it's not what she wanted.

She doesn't want me to contact her parents but to me it's the only option to stop her"
945,Am I being an attention seeker,"Written on mobile


I (14f) have been struggling with mental health since I was 8 and my gran got sick. She was the only one I felt I could trust and I loved her more than any other family member. I didn't talk to my parents about it till I was 11 and they just brushed it off punished me and pretended nothing happened. I tried talking to them again and they blamed it on Instagram???making me pretend I had bad mental health. I just dropped it as they obviously didn't care but recently I talked to them about getting some help and the said im just a huge attention seeker and I need to stop being so pathetic.

948,Any idea what this might be?,"I’ve currently been in an LDR for a little over 3 months now. Everything’s been going absolutely perfect until my boyfriend suddenly just wanted to be alone all the time. He’s super busy with work &amp; tells me he feels numb and bland and doesn’t know why. 
He’s told me he acts like this a lot too, being happy for a long while and then suddenly feeling numb again for months on end.

He still shows me how much he loves me &amp; tells me it, too. At his worst, we only sent each other 1 text every day, almost always right before he falls asleep. It’s been getting a little better recently though because he now seems somewhat happier &amp; talks to me a little more.

I love him so much, I wanna know how to help him or at least not be a burden."
949,Need serious help.,"I've been having a lot of varying problems since I turned 15 and I really don't know how or if it's possible to fix them. I haven't been able to learn anything more than very small things and remember even less, I can't do anything without messing up like anything I pick up I'll drop 3-6 times on average. My reaction timing and reflexes are extremely slow. I walk into rooms and leave because I forgot what I was doing most anytime I enter one. When I try to pick up objects I almost never reach far enough the first time and end up just grabbing air. In short just Imagine the most useless person you can conjure up in your head and think of all of the physical issues that could be causing it and how/if they are/could be tied to mental problems. I've dealt with severe depression, psychosis, social phobia, general anxiety since I was 9. I use to not feel like everything was so impossible but even then I still couldn't do anything just the same as now. I just want to know what's going on."
950,Im so confused,"So ive had my history with depression and i guess ill give a brief summary of where im mentally at. I was abused physically and emotionally for around 17 years with one suicide attempt. I joined the military and currently serving a tour overseas. Im 19 years old and this is my first time leaving the states and this is my first real job. And im really good at it. However its been a fucking roller coaster with my mental health. The army subreddit has been super supportive of my mental breakdowns and rants. Ive been getting help for about 6 months now and i do not know what is my issue. We think is bipolar disorder but i also show signs of schizophrenia. Ill describe it.

For about 2 months ill be totally depressed. Borderline suicidal. my thoughts are slow, i dont engage with many people and isolate myself. Then for 1-3 weeks i have a complete psychotic break. I feel like everyone on earth is looking at me, i feel like i cant trust anyone. I have hyper realistic dreams thats hard to distinguish from reality, and i can hear my thoughts out loud as if its instructing me to do things. i dont know what they want me to do because i try so hard not to listen to them. This leads to extreme fear and paranoia so strong where i am afraid to leave my room. Then in the span of a day, im alright. Im so alright i have a very high level of confidence and it leads to arrogance where i think im smarter than everyone else, more attractive than most people and think certain things are beneath me. This will last for 2 months. And it cycles over and over again. Its borderline insanity because i do the same shit every time over and over again. Its predictable, i cant do anything about it. Its like watching a movie from start to finish and rewatching it once its over. Its mentally taxing, i cant just cant think straight most of the time and it drives me up a fucking wall that they haven't told me anything yet. Its always ""lets do another meeting, lets talk about something else"" like beating around the bush. I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me. 

So thats why im here, anyone have slightly similar experiences? Please give me peace of mind."
951,What do you do when all your depressive thoughts about yourself are true?,"I try to change my thoughts but they’re literally just accurate. I’m 22 and have no degree and no college credit, literally went to community college part time and dropped out after half s semester because it was too hard. I’ve had one job my adult life, and it lasted a little over a month. I have no friends. I have never been in a serious relationship. I still live with my parents. It’s pathetic. I have no idea how you could frame that as not being absolutely pathetic. So I don’t know how to make myself feel better about the situation."
952,Feel myself slipping into the darkness...Don’t know why,"Sometimes I feel like my brain decides “She’s having a swell time, she’s got her life in order...let me F with that” 😑

I have MDD, SA, OCD, anxiety attacks and panic attacks are my BFFS.. in short, I’m a mess🤦🏽‍♀️

I vent today bcoz I realize that I’m slipping into that all too familiar dark pit of depression and I can’t tell why! 
Been on my couch for 4days, haven’t eaten, and somehow I’m “ok”.

953,Self harm/ anxiety &amp; depression,"Hi all I’m 29 female and from UK England Leeds. 
I’m in a relationship of 11 years. 
Have a daughter who is 13 nearly 14years!
Where do I start?!
Well when I was 14 I got raped, just had to get in with it cause no one listened back then. 
At 15 got pregnant had my daughter at 16
Daughters real dad left us when she was 9 months old and was in and out of her life. 
Had another relationship after him met another guy who was 27 and I was 16 that was a domestic violent relationship he used to hit me with him nearly two years left him when he got sent to prison for breaking and entering a car and found out he was using heroine and was a alcoholic. 
I left him moved back to my dads
A month later met another lad who I liked for ages that only lasted a few months as he was a drinker and felt more like mates than out.
Then a few month later I met the fella I’m with now. 
Like anyone and everything it’s all good to start with he brought my daughter up as his own for past 11 years but then he had two awful attacks happen to him. He got jumped in town by another lad stamped on back of his neck moved his vertabrae another time a lad got hold of him wacked him round side of head just missing his temple. Eve since then I cared for him, he wouldn’t go out sank into depression wouldn’t eat unless I cooked wouldn’t go to appointments in end it had to be telephone appointments and me doing everything. We tried moving a few times nothing worked.over years it was getting hard he become addicted to his medication so when he wasn’t having them he would carry on and house be upside down I try reason with him but have none of it I’d try make him understand you can’t have more than what your supposed to only what doctors prescribed he would even take them off me or search the entire house till he found them. I got to point where I had to take them out with me everywhere I went. It eventually got to point where me and him ended up fighting with each other the whole house be up. Always on edge everyday we would be fighting. New Years came this year we was in drink we went out to his aunts and uncles had some drink down there everything was fine then returned home early hours I blacked out and next minute I stabbed my partner. I phoned ambulance pop came, I got arrested told truth got sent to prison was on remained a few month. Whilst I was in there I was totally messed up, didn’t know how my partner was if he was alive or dead didn’t know properly what happend cause I black out, didn’t know where my daughter was or anything so I was self harming and try to end my self. I finally got a visit from my mum she said my daughter was with my dad her grandad and my bf okay. It was killing me to not knowing how he actually was I wasn’t allowed no contact or out with him. He finally wrote to me in prison and then visited me. Said he wanted to be with me and never went against me no statement or out. I got my daughter taken out my care and now my father got kinship if her.Finally our visit got stopped so I could only write to him and call him we still had ways. Lockdown came in as we know and it was well tough. My mum died whilst I was in there wasn’t aloud to funeral cause of this covid 19! I did have mental health and together woman who phoned in every so often to check on me or send distraction packs out to me but that only helped for so long. A week later after funeral Chaplin came to my door and took me to chapel to say a prayer and light a candle for my mum. I eventually got out on a suspended sentence. Since I been out it’s been well hard and strange to cope with daily life. I’m still having flashbacks of New Years but still don’t remember that night properly or understand why I stabbed him. I’m on medication now mirtazapine 45mg and propranolol 40mg. I have a few organisations in involved like forward Leeds together woman probation i speak to doctor every week or two and self referra to iapt just got to wait for I apt to phone back in a week to do a screening test. I’m also in middle of trying to get my own place with a housing organisation but got to wait. At the moment me and my bf are back at the family home where it happend and it’s not good for us at all. Recently we had a few arguments while been in drink now we’re not drinking a lot just a few beers but when we do he will start a conversation about us moving what we have discussed about for a long time but when I try explain to him that I can’t move yet as I’m on a suspended sentence and all this help I’ve got in place at minute i need and these services are not available where he wants to go. He is in middle of getting help too but too concerned on moving. So this ends up in us arguing and I don’t like it I now start getting bad gut feelings and get scared it starts me off with a panic attack so then I remove myself out of the situation and go up stairs but then I can’t win because then he follows or shouts things back up at me or throws things and brakes them. I get really scared I start cutting my arm as I have only just got out of prison from doing what I did to him and now when this happens it scary cause sometimes I’m blacking out and don’t know what’s actually happening. To make things better whilst I was inside Ihe said he would wait for me only wants me and wants to help me. When I got out he tried telling me he went on a few dating websites but nothing happend, well I found out more. He was messaging lasses on a app whilst he was on phone to me when I was in prison telling them everything and saying I was his ex! Instagram snap chat you name it! Well I pulled him and all he says is I didn’t do out wrong ! ? Really ? tell me ya wait for me which I never expected really thought the worse getting sent down my life over but no says he will wait for me and be like that! I know I deserve a lot worse this is what I said to him but why when I said to you when I was in there if you want to move on I ain’t gonna stop you just tell me truth. Now I’m a morning and night I be on phone to him I got bad gut feelings and it’s weird as I say this but it’s true, I could picture him messaging and been on phone to these other girls but I tried punching it away and I was fucking right! He even said he wanted to meet up with a lass after lockdown he tries saying his head was all over place and family telling him not to be with me. No he chose to stay with me and help me why do that? I even gave my tenancy up when I was in there, I wrote letters to social and to solicitors for him, he had no bank card or anything I let him take mine what had money in it so he had something to sort his self out. Aw yeah as well he decides to tell me two days after I got out a Month before I got out he claimed universal credit in my name bearing in mind he had his own claim, sent me £100 and he was having sessions with sniff drinking alcohol whilst he was on some high dosage medication. Just feel like I’m taken for a muppet. I know I got issues real bad but I’m addressing them and trying to get the right help I need and trying to get in control of my life but can’t cause when we argue or he gets upset he throws it back in my face about me stabbing him and wants clarification but I can’t give him it and then tells me I’ll never meet anyone and that if I did he would kill me and then and my family and that I’m a cunt! I hate that word! but after when he’s had a joint says no I don’t mean it. He games all day everyday and when I go out for a walk with dog he will phone me constant and then come pick me up and brings me back home to be bored to watch him game, if I go sit upstairs on my own he moans at me and questions why I’m not down stairs but if I explain it causes an argument 🙄🥺. Anyone got any advice please? 
Thank you"

I'm gonna try to give you guys the details. I feels like this is not real but it has been nothing but real so.. 

I felt like I was split into two people? I just call them One and Two for easy understanding.

One being very capable of all positive emotions but hates me a lot (like...Kill yourself hate).
Two is just so angry at everything and so sad all the time but they are the one that cares about other people that is not me. (

Lately, I had a fight with some family members and I felt like I'm three now?
The latest addition to this weird mental salad is weirdly calm and just want me to live but doesn't really want any attachments or emotions to get in my way of thinking?

It's hard to explain but I'll try.
The argument. After that even after we cleared things, I am not able to feel okay around my family anymore? I feel sad and I seek comfort in them but I can't be around them. I just feel nauseated when I try to say anything to them.

So ...in my mind people perspective. Three is really dominating over the first two. Not like it's all bad. Since One really wants me to die for some reason and they kinda put them in a cage.
One would scream intrusive thought in my head but at the same time..I can't feel comfort if she's in a cage? So I'm just here miserable???? I always have my headphones blasting music as loud as it can so it'd drown out the voices but idk how long that'd work.
I wanna be okay around my family. I know they want me to be okay but I can't??? 

Is there a way that I can get the Three to like... compromise or something??
Why does this feel like fiction??? I swear I'm telling it as it is."
957,How to deal with anger and frustration?,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

well the title pretty much says it all.  
I get angry and frustrated easily. Like, extremely easy. I do not get aggressive or violent against people, but when I am alone I sometimes hit walls, furniture or just straight up myself (head, hips, legs, stomach - whatever I can reach).  
Most of the times I get angry at myself (I am a piece of shit after all) but also at other people. Arguments always make me crazy mad. Even then I hurt myself to cope. I can even get mad when thinking of discussions I have had month before.  
I also turn to alcohol a lot which sometimes calms me down but sometimes just worsens it.  


I know that I need help and i am currently looking for a therapist. But until then I am interested to hear what other people do when they feel anger. What are your coping methods? What can I do instead of hitting and cyring?

Thanks a lot for reading.  


All the best to you.

958,Why are the barriers to work as a mental health professional so high?,"I've just taken a quick look at how I could work as a councillor/therapist/psychologist and have noticed that most courses/accreditations have entry requirements which include a degree in a related subject and mental health experience. This means this route will take at least 5 years of training.

&amp;#x200B;

The psychiatrist route will require a doctors degree plus additional training.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who is interested in working in mental health and making a contribution, seeing these barriers is incredibly off-putting and I don't see the justification in it either especially as mental health is something that health services are struggling to treat.

&amp;#x200B;

They should make it easier for people to get involved - does anyone know any career paths in mental health that have looser requirements?"
959,Hi. I dont know where else to go but found this sub.,"I don’t want to be too specific but for me, most days are mentally turn physically exhausting. I get depressed and have anxiety along with that. The last two years have been tough yet I still want to push through. I’m looking forward to a better tomorrow. I was suicidal in the past and recently. I don’t have the right headspace for some things. I’m still trying to get myself together. This week has been steady until tonight. Nothing to do with me yet I was pulled into talking to someone because they’re we’re drunk and talking about suicide. This isn’t their first time. I was there for them but I couldn’t be there very long because I could feel myself getting mentally exhausted. Not that I couldn’t be there for them but I’m not a professional. So I called someone else to check on this person. I’m feeling emotional right now and it’s a sucky feeling. There’s more to the story... if anyone is willing, PM me please. I could use the support."

965,"I may have attempted it in the past but, I'm not quite sure.","I remember some years back, I went to the local park in my hometown. The park had an amazing open view of the sea and, a cool breeze always blew no matter what time of the day. Let’s just say that my thoughts at that time weren’t right and, I thought of setting them straight by visiting the park. When I got there, I found a bench and, I remember that I just sat there and stared onward. I don’t know how long I’ve been sitting there but, at some point I had this instinct to jump off the seawall and swim away as far as I could until my limbs give out. When I was near the edge, I could see and hear the waves violently crashing on wall—looking back at this moment, it may be the calmest I’ve ever been and, is one of the sharpest memories I have. As I stood there, I got somewhat splashed by seawater and, that’s when I felt fear and this sense of dread. It was so abrupt that I panicked and stumbled back to the bench. I sat there and tried to keep my composure. Then a while later I went back home. I must have been exhausted because my sister told me that when I got back, I ended up sleeping for the rest of the day. 

I have never told anyone about this. I’m bothered by it but, I’d always think of it as some weird experience. I thought that perhaps, everyone has had this kind of experience and, that maybe it’s normal so, I didn’t really think much of it then. In retrospect, I may have to reconsider, especially now with the state I am in. I don’t know."
966,"I have never addressed any of the issues ive had throughout my life, alot of it is from childhood/family + being raped at 18. Idk what to do","I 20F have had a shitty life family and friends wise. I have serious issues that began as a child and i still dont understand. I want to know whats wrong with me, i need clarity from a professional that its not my fault my family are terrible people who have ruined my mentality and upbringing. I cant connect with people/i dont understand people my age, i dont trust anyone and have serious anxiety/depression issues. 

i’ve had moments of feeling nothing but rage/sadness to the point of it being overwhelming-last happened 2yrs ago while under alot of emotional stress. My head started to hurt and it was a high pinched ringing that woulsnt stop, i was on my knees crying while crushing my ears so i couldnt hear anything. I would also switch from that to just extreme sadness and id cut myself to feel something/realise the pain i felt inside. Its like a seitch goes off in me and i change.
I think i may suffer with ptsd as a result of being raped in 2018 but idk as covid happened and therapy etc was delayed (it took awhile to tell anyone) I think i have ptsd from shit that parents did and being raped, ive always been depressed (diagnosed at 10 but showed signs alot sooner) i get triggered (panicy,paranoid or scared) when i see someone wearing a black puffy coat, a red cap and if im walking my dog late and someone is behind me. Since it happened my memory has been getting worse, i cant remember basic things and its like im in lala land constantly. Also anytime i was near my mother or even texting her id get crazy anxious (im no contact with both parents now). 

I dont feel normal, i dont think my brain properly anymore. I have no motivation to do anything positive - no point in making friends as they’ll ignore me anyways or exclude me, no point in trying at work as i would get shit on for things i didnt do, no point in exercising as it wont make me like my body at all. I do have alot of body issues too now that i think about it. 

Ideally i just want to be able to speak to someone, i have nobody. I want to ask why i get left behind by friends, why im never apart of the group or someones first choice. Why did my parents have fuck me up so much mentally that i checked out for about a year at 12 and stopped eating,sleeping and wishing i was dead constantly. I still do sometimes, with abit of guilt for my dog and bf but i feel so sad inside idk what to do. I feel so alone, ive always felt alone.
My earliest memory is about 4yrs old sat on the floor of a playground by myself during break watching the other kids have fun and wondering why nobody would involve me. I dont want to be alone but i always have been. I wouldnt say im suicidal but given the opportunity of a quick death like if someone gave me a gun id straight up pop a bullet in my skull. Despite what ive gone though and my thoughts i just hate the planet too, i dont want to live on this planet anymore - i see no point as none of us are actually living, just part of a rigged system that will forever fuck us over."
967,Need help due to covid,"Please. Can someone post some positive news for me? I’m so overwhelmed how the U.S. is handling the covid outbreak.

There are so many people that have theories, don’t think this is real, all political, etc. Am I the only one that believe this is a virus that can kill people and it’s spreading, again, like wildfire here. I need some positivity. I’m really depressed. Just started meds because I’m terrified for my family."
968,should I switch therapists?,"the therapist I'm currently seeing is very caring, empathetic, and objectively quite good at her job. my problem is that we both know I have trauma but I keep successfully derailing the conversation to avoid talking about these difficult subjects. I'm not sure if I want someone who can see through those attempts and force me to feel the emotions I'm avoiding, or if I want someone to take care of me so I can feel protected. there's no way I can have both, right?

optional side note: I've been told on many occasions that I'm too smart for my own good, and my therapist has mentioned that we've had quite a few sessions and still haven't really discussed my trauma(s). obviously I'm not going to bring it up on my own, and when I can sense she's about to bring it up I sidetrack her for the rest of the session. that being said, she doesn't stop me, and I feel like she's too gentle to start the session with the goal of getting into the nitty gritty. 

I guess I'm just wondering if there is someone out there who would be better for me, or if I just have to take more initiative?"
969,Just found out that my favorite Japanese actor had killed themself. My whole world is collapsing.,"He's a Japanese actor whom I adore and is a great performer and actor.
I can't seem to wrap my head over that fact that hes dead. It's so cruel. Death by suicide is the worst way to die, with no one by your side, and your body stays cold for many hours to days before someone finds it. It wrenches my heart just thinking about it. I feel guilty for some reason whenever someone takes their own life, even people i don't know of. Like I've let them down. As people, aren't we supposed to embrace one another? I had severe depression for a while when I wanted to die but I just couldn't because that would make my family very sad. People who take their own life must have gone through the same. But how much greater the pain must've been to actually go through with the act? I don't like living and I'm alive because I hate dying more. But to choose death over life, to think that living doesn't matter, what hell did they go through?

Well it has felt like I am being taking advantage,of by the company i work for.  It feels like I only got this job because they just needed a work horse until they find someone better to take it. It happened at my previous site and i was okay with it since i was wotking 90+ hours a week and I was tired.

Im tired of people saying they need me then they turn around and throw me away. 

My girlfriend and I are close to breaking up because all I do is work and i never have time for her but she doesn't understand that me working is the reason we can go do what we wanna when we can. I think she doesnt appreciate the fact that I am willing to work every hour of every day just to come home and see her, feel her, and smell her for a second to recharge my purpose so I can go and do it again. I hace told her this time and time again but I just dont think she understand I was raised, ""the man provides no matter the cost to himself"" by my dad who has worked himself to the grave almost for his family. Shr hasnt met my parents yet because i dont want her to pity me or have more questions then answers I guess.

973,COVID-19 calls for shift in operational and leadership approach,"  

COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people work these days as many are struggling to maintain a balance between their professional and personal lives while working remotely from their homes. Noticeably, the unprecedented work-from-home culture has resulted in people working for longer hours than before.

Evidently, it is because earlier there was a fine line between office and home according to which people used to schedule their meetings, appointments, and personal commitments. Prior to pandemic restrictions, it was easier to unplug the professional life at the end of the office day to give the rest of the day to personal life. Nowadays, from work meetings to birthday and anniversary celebrations, people are participating in social interactions through video conferencing apps such as Zoom, all thanks to the advent of the digital age. 

Since working from home is here to stay in the wake of the global Coronavirus crisis, managers and team leaders are required to take efforts towards engaging, connecting, and empowering their employees and teams.

974,Do you ever feel like you aren't doing enough with the tools you have in life?,"I feel like I have pretty good genetics when it comes to physical ability and also the ability to learn to do more and be more. But sometimes I just want to lay back and watch YouTube or play Video Games.

Sometimes I end up beating my self up mentally asking ""Why are you being so lazy and why don't you get up and move and do something?"".  But then there is the other side of me saying ""Just take it easy mate and watch another video, YouTube is fun"".

Maybe it's normal to feel great some days and feel like crap on others. But I just want to make sure productivity is the main driver and I use my tools efficiently.

Hope that makes sense and wondering if others feel the same?

975,I can’t afford how mentally ill I am. My life is being severely impacted but my insurance can’t give me weekly therapy. Vent I guess.,"

I honestly feel hopeless right now. I think I just need to vent and attempt to find some sort of solution for the chaos that is my mind. Also, to preface, by severely mentally ill, I mean I have a personality disorder (borderline) and extremely high anxiety (among other things) but somehow manage to present really well. And I’m just doing extra poorly right now and not getting therapy. 


I’ll talk about what’s been going on with me mentally below and then go into my insurance afterwards. I really just need to vent, typing things out always helps me get through my thoughts better and if anyone has suggestions for what I should do, I would love to hear them. 


Anyway. In life, I generally manage pretty well but I guess with everything going on in the world it’s become a lot more difficult. Basically, I’m doing really bad right now. I’m extremely depressed and I’m the recent weeks I’ve become more and more agitated and aggressive. I’ve been having frequent crying spells and anger/rage episodes.  I have a tendency to be kind of really mean and pretty much emotionally abusive. I’m trying really hard to work on the meanness but it’s pretty difficult within the confines of my own mind without help. 


In the last month, I broke all the plastic coat hangers in my closet (and then bought new ones), ripped up at least 4 shirts, thrown my keys at the wall (small hole in wall), thrown my purse at the wall (2 leather marks on wall. glasses case absolutely ruined but glasses ok.) and slammed lots of doors but fortunately didn’t crack the door frames. 


I’m supposed to take a medication and I had been bumped to a “moderate” dose a month or two ago. I attributed the medication increase to all my anger outbursts so I kinda stopped taking it for a few days and now I’m taking the dose I was on prior to the “moderate” dose. 


In accordance with the physical aggressiveness on things, Ive also been emotionally aggressive and have lashed out verbally at her nearly daily when she’s done nothing to me. She’s improved so much as a roommate and I couldn’t ask any more of her, and still I lash out. It’s really bad. I know I’m hurting her and I hate it. I don’t want to do it anymore but I’m so easily triggered it’s really hard to control myself. 


At work, the other week I had a panic attack every day for 4 days and cried on the floor during my shifts. Yesterday I lashed out at a co worker and was extremely rude and hostile towards her. Like to a point she was going to take it to our bosses. I sorta apologized and then afterwards I felt horrible all night and still horrible this morning. I’m planning on apologizing but not sure if we work together again tonight. 


Personally/emotionally (aside from the anger), I’ve been hating myself and kinda wanting to die but not really. At least not enough to get good help lol. Everything just feels pointless, I’m lonely, and I’m becoming increasingly tired of the shit I’m pulling on myself and others. I feel like I can’t get a leg up on anything and I’m terrorizing myself and those around me. 


Ugh. So. There’s my life ramble of what’s going on. Now into my insurance. My insurance medical building is so busy in the mental health department the most I can speak to a therapist is once a month. And uh yeah, no, one hour a month has not been working for me obviously. I was able to get weekly therapy at the beginning of quarantine only because I was put into an intensive outpatient program (phone apts) for being too depressed and wanting to die. Once I didn’t want to die anymore the therapy stopped and subsequently I want to die again. Funny how that happens. 


I know I need weekly or at least twice monthly therapy. I also know I need to move out of my house because it’s really triggering for me and my mom isn’t happy with me in the house constantly berating her. I know getting therapy is probably the more important one here... so... I guess I should do that? I can afford the therapy while living with my mom but I can’t really afford to go to therapy and also move out. It feels like such a waste to spend $250-500 on therapy a month... I guess if I can eventually just do two sessions a month for $250 that’s really not that bad... 


Eventually I’ll go to school once covid ends and get a better job but for now it sorta seems one or the other. My dad pays for my insurance and I don’t really use it to go to the doctor much anyway so my mom suggested maybe I get a cheap insurance if I qualify (Medicare or something I honestly don’t know how any of that works) and have my dad cancel my more expensive insurance and then help me pay for a therapist instead. So that’s an option, I guess. 


I don’t know if there are any good online resources for therapy but if anyone has suggestions, feel free to let me know. I’m really anxious about doing that sort of thing so if someone could walk me through the steps/tell me their experience I’ll be more likely to do it! 


Also, thank you if you read, I appreciate it. Even just typing this out has really helped me sort out of my thoughts and look at things more subjectively and not clouded by my feelings."

982,Am I Ok?,"Uh so for some back story I (14 F) use to have depression. I'm not surprised, growing up with strict parents and basically having no friends is not exactly the healthiest thing. Thankfully things are getting better. But, some things still bothered me:

1. I don't trust my mom. My mom studied psychologic. In theory she's supposed to be understanding. I mean, she isn't a full on abusive mom. But she's not the best to. When i was 6/7 yo, she would hit me till i bleed if i didn't study. She would also force me to study till 3 in the morning. Belting, slapping, and hitting happens to me kinda frequently. 

 When I was 5/6yo I remember drawing a some horrible and childish drawing, because in cartoons the parents will usually praise and coo at the drawing. When I showed it to my mom, she started to scold me and pinched me , saying how I wasted paper. I was heartbroken. 

 When my mom learn that I was Suicidal, instead of trying to comfort, me she points a knife at me and told me to 𝘬𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘺𝘴𝘦𝘭𝘧 then and there if I'm suicidal. She also told me that if I kill myself, she wouldn't be sad, she said she would be angry and disgusted at me. 

2. I was happy that my dad died. As horrible as it sounds, I have some reasons. My dad passed away when I was seven. He doesn't condoned my mom's abusive behavior nor does he stopped her. Other than the initial shock and sadness, I feel nothing now. I don't miss him. I don't care about him anymore. In fact I was happy cause my mom's temper mellowed out a lot. 

3. Although I'm no longer as depressed as I used to, sometimes when I get my hopes and expectations to high  about getting/doing something or going somewhere and it didn't happen because of someone, I feel an immense amount of sadness and numbness at the same time. I also feel a great deal of hatred to the point that I literally want to kill them. 

What the hell is wrong with me?"
983,Raised with a very messed up parents' mindset. Currently in self-rehabilitating.,"  

S Summary : Am 21 M. I aplogize beforehand because this probably isn't a very well constructed post cuz I'm not that good at it. But here it goes.  
Am raised in a family that is very ""asian"" (but well I am asian, Chinese), where everything is done for ""the sake of the future"".   
My parents only fended for me in terms of actually helping me to be better in academics, but other than that I am totally left off. I was not allowed to watch TV when I was little, I have no video games, nintendo 64, PS none of that stuff that everyone has, just piles of books to sedate my boredom.

Sounds pretty normal till this point, like it's just a strict asian family. But then again, I wouldn't mind their strictness if it weren't for the lack of care they've given to me when I was small (we'll talk about this later). Whenever I some art project in kindergarten or something that a 3-5 year old would see as an achievement, I would show my parents my drawings/sculptures/etc. and I'll be **ignored** or just chalantly being ""yeah that's great"". Being ignored was a norm for me in my hosuehold, it would be the usual : me trying to talk to my parents and they'll reply with phrases that basically underlie a ""please stop bothering me"". It ultimately went to a phase where I can be calling or talking a full sentence in front of my parents and they would be ignoring me. The short summary for this part is : if it's nothign related to studies, they will ignore me totally. This led to a lot of fights in my late teens because I felt disrespected.

I don't know how to categorize this but I'll just write a short scenario :  
Was bullied from 10-12 in school, told my parents about it and they did squat. And when I said bullied it was not the usual bullying. Like I said I was raised in a way where reading was the only form of entertainment I had so being that kid in class that always reads, I would get called names, I would get my books thrown off the balcony, my bags yeeted into the trashcan, all those stuff. And the thing about what my parents said was probably so fucked up, its very hard to describe. Instead of helping me, they called me to ignore it (like how they always did with me), and instilled the idea that I was the problem child and I need to figure out my problems. It was a 3 year span of getting bullied, so the constant heed for help always ends up being me, shouted by my parents from ""figure out your problems"" to ""you're the problem""

There's still tons more stuff that's very fucked up but I don't wanna waste anymore time because the stories will be too long to read.

I won't really get into the rest of my teenage life, but the short summary here is that before I graduated and entered university, I was :

\- Told that I was a useless child without them (I was not allowed to work to get money, yet I don't have allowances) and I am not allowed to be like other people who work for what they want because what they want is just excessive necessities (funds for games, holidays, hanging out etc.). Verbal abuse in a sense  
\- A person that is direct af with everyone due to years of being raised in that kind of environment, in which led to me having no sympathy or empathy to read people's emotions, often hurting people and that led to me being very antisocial for the sake of not offending anyone anymore  
\- A person that is also quite antisocial because the after-effects of being bullied carried onto middle school due to ""oh look it's that guy who get bullied let's bully him mroe because why the fuck not"". It ended up making me very passive aggressive to distance myself from other people as much as possible.

\- Not allowed to hangout with friends because it was time wasting and I should not succumb to the need to have friends (because it was a waste of not only time, but also money), reading is enough

\-Not allowed to play sports because it's time wasting (but the underlying tone is ""I don't want to deal with shit in case you get injured"")

\- A person that always blames everything on himself because he always thinks that he's the problem in this world 

I was always being poured with negative emotions, and that led to me being very self-deprecating, and with totally little skills to socialize, I was essentially fucked (but I didn't know back then). I always told myself that I was useless because of how my parents told me, and how we were taught to always listen to parents. I always relied on my parents and I never questioned what they said were wrong. I just felt grateful that they were feeding this child that got scolded on just because he was just 2As away from getting straight As in a national level exam (you get the idea).  


Once I graduated, we had a grace period of a few months before entering uni. This is when I went to the gym and just trained (because I was not allowed to work). Met a few guys there and this is probably the start of my realization that I was living a wrong life. Met a few people in their late 20s and 30s and started to talk there. After a while I started to just tell them how I am  because they noticed I was a very weird kid. They got a lil startled and just told me this is not how parents should act and I need to know how to think for myself. I took their 2 cents on ""not every parent can be a good parent"".  


Fast forward to New Years, I had a New Year gathering with a bunch of friends at their house. This was when the second wave of self-realization kicks in. His parents treated him and all of us in a way where I feel like they put us on equal planes. This was a shocker for me because I never knew parents can be like that. The mindset that I have from parents were that they will always be strict and we must always put ourselves under them. But no, his parents were so nice I led me to contemplate how had my parents been treating me for the past 20 years. 

Got to ask my friend about this and he said the same thing like the peeps from gym. The 2 cents I got became even more apparent.

Uni started. And y'know, from memes you can kinda see that uni is a place where ""people can get to experience a part of society"". So I was ready and just tried to be as antisocial and passive aggressive to prevent any unnecessary outcomes. But I kid you not, the people in my university are the kindest souls in the world. It felt like I was greeted with saints. Unlike the usual people I deal with a daily basis that know me because of my past and tend to treat me like ass, I was in a new setting. A new person. Everyone was kind.

This was kind of a sudden realization that I can start anew. I won't get into the details but the longer I talk with people in my university, the better I was feeling day by day. They gave me things that my parents never gave me. Care. It was really weird to be cared by people you only met a few months because they were shocked that you only go to books as a form of entertainment. They were so kind enough to try and spoil you and take you on to outings, watching cinemas, arcades etc. It was like a surreal experience. I never felt happiness and positivity in my life but when I'm with them, I feel so much better.   
There was a time when we were talking about our childhood and everybody shared theirs. Full of fun, carefree times. When it was my turn to say, I felt reluctant to share because in contrast with others, mine was just a shitshow. In the end I talked about it and a girl had a slight breakdown and cried when she hears what I've been through. Pretty much from there on the ""rehabilitations"" were even more extravagant because they were trying to make me better and not feel any guilt when I'm actually enjoying myself as a normal person.

This took months, but all I can say is that as of right now, as I'm typing my story, I can say that I've changed a lot in a sense where :  
\- I learnt to be mroe positive  
\- I learnt to have more confidence in myself  
\- I learnt to have discretion and empathy  
\- I can socialize  
\- I can stop feeling guilty when I go on hangouts.  


This was a stark contrast from who I was.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came back from uni because of lockdown, all I can say is that I don't really fit well with my family anymore. I don't like the fact that everytime I talk to my family it must only be about academics. Sharing anything other than academics, my parents would tell me very harshly that I'm wasting my potential and those people are just fucking up your future. 

Even sharing that I've met new friends in uni caused a lot of arguments, saying that they are all useless people that will only waste your potential on studies. So yeah that's the gist of it

FYI am currently studying medicine because I was physically threatened and verbally abused to. I had an interest in physics but I had to drop it because they wanted me to ""bicum eh dokta"". Rethinking back, Im pretty sure tyou guys are fucking me up more.  
At this point in time I'm only studying by using that realism personality of mine to cope with it, because academically I can handle, and I am still silently trying to find what I want to do in life.  
But other than that, I can't wait to go back to university, not because of the studies, but because of the people there that treat me like an actual human being, as compared to my parents.

I still feel like things are a little off. I feel a little shakey and anxious and weak. I feel like things may taste a little bit different. It’s really hard for me to describe. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this before? I went to the ER and got a CT scan and that didn’t show anything. I was told I have a UTI which could cause confusion, but I feel like that’s quite a stretch. 

My mom had a brain aneurysm, so did my grandma, and my sister did as well. But then I think - maybe it was just stress or anxiety and getting worked up about it is going to make it happen again."

987,It seems like everything I want to do is taken or sold out.,"Through COVID-19 I’ve struggled with trying to get into things but, by the time I decide to do it, it seems everyone else who had more gumption already bought it up.

Example:

I had an idea to buy a beater, manual transmission car to dink around with but there are nine to be had for a reasonable price. I’ve witnessed a car get bought just to be resold for thousands more.

That’s just one example,

Bikes, Ring Fit Adventure, parking spots at hiking trails, other cars, anything home-improvement related, etc.

I’m not delusional, I understand that everything is constrained because of COVID but I’m really struggling with this. It’s a lot of regret for not having done these things sooner and as soon as it’s a possibility for me, it’s too late.

Also, I partially blame reseller culture for breeding a dozen generations of people who think the junk in their garage is worth original value and everything that WAS cheap is now expensive."

989,"I dislike my name, but it's my name?","Tldr; Negative associations to my name giving me anxiety when spoken out loud, any advice on fixing this or how I can make it better? 

So, my(21F) earliest memory of wanting to be named something else I was 6. I later  realized sometime around the age of 16 that I generally react negatively to my name. Doesn't really matter in what context it's being said, but if its not super cheerful, I'll most likely feel a sense of dread as somebody says/mentions my name. I'm going to guess it's from my upbringing, as my father had a bit of a temperament, but never really laid his hands on me except for maybe 3-4 times during the 18 years I lived at home. (I moved out before finishing school due to a situation like this) My close friends never call me by name, usually a nickname completely unrelated to my name, as my name isn't really one to be shortened (think Claire). And my bf of 2 years usually doesn't call me by my name either, as he knows I don't react very well to it. I don't really know how to explain it, but I think I get a bit of anxiety? Cause if somebody just mentions they got their earrings from Claire's for example (not my real name), I'll stop dead in my tracks and just look at the person speaking with a sense of dread/ feeling really uncomfortable. I don't really know how to better my relation ship with my name, as I don't really want to change it, cause what would I change it to, I mean, it's my name? Anybody got any advice? 

Also: I changed my name a bit to include my mom's maiden name when I was 18, helping to make it feel more ""mine"".  Ai also  plan to take my future husband's last name when I get married/elope.

994,"Ever since my breakup, I've had this strange urge to figure out what could've made her lose feelings in just a month, when things were going perfect?","I have a few ideas. Right before isolation, we were fine, dated until May in quarantine, and then at 3am on May 25th, she broke up with me. The same day my friend was killed by a drunk driver. Now, that may seem harsh and pretty damn cold but, I feel like the breakup wasn't her fault. 

Here's the running theory:

Her emotions are all out of whack, because of untreated mental illness (which is why I came here). Before, when she was on meds. She was sweet, loving, always willing to talk and was never too upset. And if she was we would talk thru it. After though, thats a whole different ballgame. She felt empty, nothing but sadness, she was distant, wouldn't say whats wrong, and extremely promiscuous, wanting to ONLY talk about sex. I didn't correlate it to this in the beginning, but I did think her behavioral switch was different. The adderall was most likely used to treat depression and ADHD at the same time by tricking her dopamine sensors into making her feel good. I think her stopping them is what is causing all this.

I'm lost at what to do, I'm scared for her, because the likelihood of someone with untreated ADHD becoming a criminal is super high, and it's terrifying because she was trying to become a nurse before she stopped taking meds and now she's flunking every class. I know I'm her ex, but I feel like I should reach out and try to get her mental help and back on medication. How she's feeling now is not healthy and not safe for her. What should I do? Call her, arrange a docs appointment, try and slowing coax her towards help? I'm really scared for her."

998,I'm concerned about my mom,"(This post was in no way made to offend those who have diagnosed conditions or those who struggle with mental health. I am only seeking guidance and advice, and if I offend you I will take the time to apologize now. Thank you)

Since about 2-3 years ago, my mom has started to strike me as odd. She doesn't act like a competent mother, she's irrational and highly irritable etc etc

And considering I am still a teenager, I've weighed the fact that maybe its just my 'teenage angst' getting to me. Maybe I'm the one being irrational and unfair, maybe she's just trying her best.

But ever since about a year ago my thoughts on that started to change. I have a gut feeling that she has some sort of undiagnosed condition.

Currently, I'm not in the position to go take her to a psychiatrists to do an evaluation as mental health is seen as a taboo topic in my culture. (It is a very sad reality) So I figured my best bet was to try and figure out what she has or has characteristics of and try to match to that to lessen conflict and stress. I've already determined that its a game I can't win-- so I'm just going to play along.

Here are some behaviors that my mom shows throughout the day:

Highly irritable

Self-centered

Shift blame onto everyone else except her even when the conclusion is illogical

Somewhat violent (over small things)

Shows lots of jealousy

Doesn't like when I 'outshine her'

Does not understand boundaries

Lazy

Passive Aggressive

Hypocritical

Body-image issues?

&amp;#x200B;

Descriptions:

My mom for about 50 percent of the day seems like a completely normal mom (I'm not around much during this 50 percent though) but as soon as anything ticks her off its over. She gets mad at everyone, she just ruins the entire mood of the house, and she just ends up being the person listed above.

But because she is 'normal' for a little bit, I have had trouble distinguishing whether she is actually 'weird' or if its just my perception.

Last night was probably the most concerning for me and its part of the reason why i am turning here to maybe get some answers.

I got a kitten recently and well, yesterday I was out all day at an event and I left him at home with my brother, my grandpa, and my mom who would be leaving for work soon after.

I got home after the event and my mom told me she had a 'confession to make. She had yanked on the cats tail because he was getting too deep into the pantry. (My pantry is in no way deep, and it is actually a very open space where all areas are easy to access. This was most likely an excuse.)

And Idk if you guys know this but a cats tail is very sensitive, and yanking it could cause paralysis. She looked at me all guilty and was like-- it was my instinct.

Later that night she was petting him in my room and whispered to herself, maybe I should hit him

I was sitting there with her (I don't trust her alone with him anymore) and was like... what

And she just said that she didn't say anything

Later I caught her saying I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

What the heck does that even mean. Keep in mind that she has broken countless relationships between my family and she tries to get me to hate everyone too. She despises my father and is very vocal about it as well. I have a younger brother who is quite fond of the 'family unit' idea and Im afraid of how this affects him. She's driven my mental health to the absolute floor before but she still reads self help books when she's bored. She is a self proclaimed christian but I see nothing christian about her.

She still puts food on the table and does laundry for me though.

I've asked a few people about her behaviors (some of which I did not include in here) and some think that its characteristic of BPD.

I asked my dad about it and he said thats just the kind of person she is.

Anyone have any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My hypothesis:

My mom immigrated from asia when she was about 16 and according to her english was very hard for her. I don't think she had many friends when she was younger and maybe that contributed to the problem. My dad had also said at one point that her dad was exactly like her so, maybe its a learned coping behavior? I honestly dont know how to make sense of this, but I do feel that those may be realted."

1000,(TW) Advice for Friends of People with an Eating Disorder,"One of my best friends suffers from anorexia (been hospitalized a year ago for it) but currently takes medication and does intensive therapy for it. She confided in my the other day that she wants to starve herself again, and me and all of my friends held her while she cried and told her how beautiful she is and how us and God love her the way she is (she is very religious). I’m just not sure what to do now if she is already getting help for it. Is there anything we shouldn’t talk about in front of her? She *did* tell us she wanted us to treat her the same as before, but I want to be self-aware and help the best I can. I worry that our other best friend with body dysmorphia (whom talks about her weight and body type 24/7) will trigger her, but they are both suffering so I can’t just tell her to stop talking about it when we’re the only people for her to vent to. So long story short- what can I do/say/not say to help my friend with an eating disorder? If you have/had one, what do you wish somebody would have done/said/not said to you? Ty xox"

All life is is pain and suffering.

1007,Girlfriend always compares herself to others.,"I need advice on how I can help my girlfriend feel better about herself. We've been together for 4 months now. We are long-distance, she is about 180 miles from me and we try to see each other for a week once every month. 

One thing that is killing me is that she always compares herself to others which makes her insecure about herself, and that is because of her past. She was disregarded in the past. And all this makes her feel like I will leave her for somebody else.

I always reassure her, call her beautiful, say all the nice things I can think off. I asked her to try and improve on it about 2-3 months ago, and she has been and I've noticed a difference. But she said she feels like a burden to me and things like ""I can't say anything that is perfect about me, therefore, everything isn't"". She did say that sometimes she feels happy about her self when she gets ready.

Apart from reassuring her and being there for her is there anything I can do to make her feel better about herself, or make her not compare herself to others.  If it matters, we are both 18 and from the UK."

1009,"Trying to get access to in-person mental healthcare during this pandemic, is it possible?","Just recently got a new healthcare plan through Kaiser from a new job. It's expensive, but I want to give it a shot because I'm approaching my wit's end and am willing to try anything at this point.

So far, it seems impossible to get anything but a phone interview, and even then you can only get appointments several weeks out. I managed to twist some arms and got an in-person apt with a NP. The best they could do was give me a referral to a Psychiatrist, which is a phone interview only, and not for another 3 weeks. I mentioned specifically that I think I need therapy, but was told ""you don't need therapy, you need a psychiatrist since they can prescribe you pills.""

I don't know how to feel about this. I've never seen a psychiatrist before, but I had an ex-gf who had bad experiences with them (basically saying they don't really listen to you, they just want to keep shoving more pills down your throat). I want therapy, someone to talk to. I don't want a 10 min phone conversation with someone who is going to prescribe me pills that probably won't work, and take weeks to work anyway.

Is this the best healthcare can do right now? COVID is more important than anything, and go fuck yourself if there's anything else wrong with you? I'm beginning to think I made a mistake trying to seek healthcare right now, if they can't provide adequate services to patients who need it."
1010,Medication?,"I have a chronic neurological condition. It won’t kill me but it can make life pretty miserable. The reality that I have a condition that is incurable and will follow me for the rest of my life is devastating and is destroying my mental health. I’ve been diagnosed with ocd, bipolar, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. I used to take medication but stopped for person reasons and beliefs. When I was on medication I had a job, attended a university and could function relatively well. For the past 6 months I’ve done nothing but lay in bed. I was ready to end it yesterday from fear of my condition getting worse in the future. The first time it got worse I was put in a straight jacket because I went mad. The second time happened recently in March and I haven’t been coping well. I’d rather just kill myself than have to play this game with my brain anymore. The part of me that values self preservation is somehow still working however but I’m afraid of medication. It could possibly make me act and feel somewhat normal but putting things in my body that alter my brain chemistry make me feel uncomfortable."

1012,"It’s my 15th birthday and I’m stuck crying, exhausted in my room. I want to end the day on a good note but don’t know how to","**TL;DR:** I’ve been stressing a lot in quarantine and I have a week every month where I just break down (normally PMS/period week). Of course, I’m having it now— on my birthday. I’ve been crying off and on, can’t focus on anything (especially anything that used to be fun), I’m bored to death, I feel like I don’t have the energy to do anything, I’m mentally and physically exhausted, and I feel worthless. It feels like every other boring day. I want this to change by the end of the day but I don’t know how. Help, please?
_____________________________________________________________________________________

I already broke down in front of my Mom so... fun. I told her it was just the hormones with periods and stuff along with my allergies not allergies (which isn’t bad but now she’s thinks it is, so no my choice of carry out, which I actually wanted to do. I kind of was craving something but I don’t know how to tell her that without her worrying or thinking I’m lying). I mean, that’s mostly true but I’ve been worrying about a billion things these last couple weeks. Now I don’t have the energy to worry, which is kind of nice I guess...? I wasn’t going to say anything but she noticed something was off, and once you ask me “what’s wrong”, even if everything is great, I’ll start crying. 

I want to do something fun to make up for this and to make myself feel better but I don’t have enough energy to. I don’t want to sit in the same spot in my bed for my entire day again. I always feel hopeless those days. Really, I just feel exhausted. I slept fine (except for the fact that I cried myself to sleep for about an hour) last night. I feel like crying and have been off and on for awhile. I don’t have much of reason I just am (yay hormones). I feel gross too, I don’t know why. Never thought smiling would be this difficult (especially on a birthday), but here we are. My allergies (drainage) are starting to act up too but that could just be the cold I get from my period every single time. But they really aren’t that bad but I used that as an excuse so... y’know...

So far I’ve had a couple friends and some family members wish me happy birthday which would normally make extremely happy but today?... no. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting to get any, so Im happy that I did but at the same time, I still feel like crap. I need to respond to them but I really don’t want to talk to anyone, but, at the same time, it’ll probably make me feel better. It sounds like too much work. I just want my energy back. I don’t have the energy or interest to even play video games or play guitar or even watch a movie or video! One of my passions, music (listening and playing), sounds boring now. This bothers me because I can’t imagine a life without it. I’m not ready to grow out of my favorite bands yet. They are my escape and I don’t want to lose them. This is just one of a million worries that I’ve been experiencing this last week that I no longer care about today. 

I don’t even know how to celebrate my birthday when at home. My family normally takes a vacation this week to celebrate our birthdays (they’re all in the same month). It’s the highlight of my year most of the time. But, obviously, with coronavirus, we can’t do that this year. I’ve accepted it but it’s still kind of disappointing. I always have my birthday on that week so I haven’t had a “real” party or celebration since I was around 6 years old. On my 13th birthday, I just chilled in my room (we had to change the vacation to the next week because of availability issues) and talked to some friends. It wasn’t a great birthday but I had just went to a concert the week before and would be on vacation the next so I had something to look forward to.

I’m going to have some friends over on Tuesday but I’ve been worrying about it so much. I live in the states so corona is still on the rise in many places. We aren’t one of those places, but that can change in days. I’m also terrified no one will show up. The little self confidence I have will be decimated if that happens. I’m worried it’ll be boring too. I wanted to do this for my mental health but it’s hurting more than helping right now. If I feel like this then it’s going to be absolutely torture.

So, I don’t know what to do. I want to do something fun but don’t have the energy. At this point, I’d be happy if I could muster up the strength to text a friend or do a family puzzle or watch a movie, but I can’t. Instead I’m crying for pretty much no reason except for exhaustion from stress, my anxiety, and it being that time of the month. I’m also sad over being sad... It sounds depressing (and a little pathetic) but I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. What should I do?"

I spend every day inside my room with the curtains closed in the dark and I’m either on my computer or lying in bed. It’s been like this for about a year now. I left my school because of bullying and harassment. I’m currently looking for an online school but I haven’t heard anything about it for months (I doubt I’ll be going back to school).

I started talking to a guy a while ago, sometime around February I mentioned to him that I used to smoke pot, because I did (it was a slight issue and Ive actively take action to help my self over the years). On April 23rd 2020 I stopped for good. Sometime a little later I felt like he was hinting stuff so in May I admitted to him that I stopped and the date. On June 21 he sends me a message saying he slept for 22 hours, to then stay silent until the 22 and at my 23:05 (His 1am) he sends me a voice message exactly 23 seconds long, where somewhere in the middle of it he seems to rush his words. June 23rd I just send him: ""23 is my facvorite number, Makes me happy to see it so many times on a single page. Happy June 23rd \[daisy emoji\]. He doesnt asnwer. The next day I send him a message at my 23:23 to ""make a wish"" just so that i can say that 23 is genuinely my favorite number and has been my entire life. 

Just yesterday i sent him a message around 9:15pm, which he answers about 10 mins later, then I ask if he has 10 mins to spare so we can talk, he doesnt answer until 23:23, under the pretext that he was on a business call from USA (so about 2pm USA time). I mean it might be true, but it might also be manipulative and calculated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand coincidences are a thing, but sometimes its too much. 

Another example: This one HR peer set me up with a HR manager from the company she interned at and it took this lady ages to give me the time and day for a call, then eventually approve my application for one of the several positions I applied for, and when at the end she finally sent me the offer for a position, I had to kindly decline as another company had been more efficient at the interview process and getting me an offer. About a week after I decline the offer, the peer who had initially put us in touch changes her Linked in Job status to the exact title I was hired for, but for a different company. 2 reasons why this doesnt make sense: 1. she has 2 on going ""jobs"" one is an internship while the other is this position, and although she just posted it, apparently she started it in March, while she started the intern position in February. 2. She is HR, she studied HR, she has interned as HR, how can she become an Account Manager at a different company all of a sudden? Like what are the odds? This just raises red flags to me and makes me feel targeted to a certain extent, I wont lie. It also makes me feel and think someone from the company I am going to join went ahead and told the company I declined. (Please note I was hried by HR and Hiring managers in the headquarters but my position is based in a different country, the position i declined is in this country, so its possible these people know each other. One of the people I interviewed with for the declined company has the exact same first and middle name as my new boss, which raises more red flags for me)

&amp;#x200B;

My point with these two slightly brief but not really examples is that I see a lot of these actions, and put several of these dots together. I understand that this comes across as paranoid, but in all honesty, I do think there is some validity to my ""consipiracy theories"". I feel like sometimes these ""indirect attacks"" and ""passive aggressive actions"" can be extremely obvious. The only thing that is missing is the proof, and the fact that they cover themselves up well with plausible deniability.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to deal with these thoughts I have? The way I put these things together. WHY am I even getting this kind of shit? I do believe sometimes I stand out to people, like I feel have a pretty particular life story. Like I think it makes so much more sense if I lay absolutely everything down, but that would be long. Do I come across like passive aggressive from the get go? Am I just too sensitive? I understand I overthink things but I do feel like there is a reason to.

&amp;#x200B;

Im so sorry for the long post and slight rambling. I dont know what to do about this, where or what to read. Anything is appreciated.

Thanks so much"
1016,Romantic live is a myth for me. I've(M 24) faced 8 rejections in the last 10 years and now I want to give up,"EDIT: Romantic LOVE**
There is nothing called ""love life"" for me. Everytime I try to open up to someone with my feelings, it all comes crashing down from there on ahead. All I've ever faced is rejection. I've tried various ways to express myself.. my feelings, my care.. but when they know that it's not just a friendly thing, almost all of them run away. One of them actually still stayed and was my best friend. She has a boyfriend so I cannot express anything which kills me inside. Seeing her pretty face reminds me of my feelings, which I need to hide and that destroys my mental state. I've gone into depression and she knew it. So, seeing me hiding my feelings and acting weird like this.. she got upset. I told her every single thing but she still wouldn't understand my pain. She has her own issues and expected me to ask her what's going on and help her. But how can I help build someone when I myself am broken?
So she left.. has the same boyfriend and a new bestfriend.
Well, I'm still the same empty person. Although, I've realised that I can't fill this void alone and I've accepted it. I can live my life like this as I'm coming to terms with the status quo. I have no hope left for my ""romantic future"" and I'm ready to give up now.
Conclusion: If there are other empty worthless folks like me.. don't worry.. you're not alone in this.. we all struggle in a similar way and lay down here beaten and numbed by the rampaging emotions of this life. Peace. Thanks for reading :)"
1017,I just took my medication again for the first time in 3 years and I feel awful,[deleted]
1018,I’m switching school this autumn and i’m terrified,"I (15F) think it’s normal to feel scared when everything is new but I’ve always had trouble getting friends. So I’m very scared that no one will like me... and due to problems with stress I stutter a lot which people like to make fun of. When I get stressed I need support and someone who tells me it’s okay. I’ve been through a lot but the stress is just something where I wish someone would hold my hand and tell me it’s okay. So it scary. Because I won’t know anyone and I won’t have anyone to help me if I were to become overly stressed. And the stuttering doesn’t quite make it easier...

I hope everyone has a great day tho &lt;3"
1019,My depression caused by a lack of wealth.,"I haven't dealt with serious depression in a while since I was about 18 and now being almost 21 I am falling back into it. It is not caused by drug abuse, anxiety, and guilt this time though. I have always had the fear that I will be poor my whole life and that I will have to work the classic 5 days a week. And pretty much im poor and I am struggling to change this and its making me severely depressed and making me see no point to life. I don't want to just live to work for awful pay and not be financially stable working 5 days a week still. I want financial freedom and I think I am going to feel this way until I am. I practice forex and stock trading constantly as currently not having a degree or anything of the alike this is the route I see to financial freedom. And I think this might be making it even worse because I have yet to see progress in my practice and research. I just down get the point of being alive if im just here to work eat and sleep. I don't know how much longer I will be able to take this."
1020,I feel unwanted in my family,"I have no other place to vent... I don't want to tell my friends about this. I've been feeling unwanted in my family for a long time. My parents are nice people but I never feel like they truly want me in their family. I often feel left out. My parents always praise my older brother but they never talk about me that way. I feel like every time we're talking about something my family gangs up on me to prove my point wrong and make me feel like an idiot (especially my brother). My brother often makes really rude comments about my weight, grammar errors, looks, grades, etc. And my parents don't care about it (I have talked to them a lot about this and they tell me to just ignore it) I have been locked up in my room attached to my phone trying to get distracted by anything. My parents came in to check on me a few times and asked me what my problem was but I don't want to tell them because I feel like they don't actually care even though they say they do. I have talked about this before but they didn't listen to me. I really don't know what to do and I have been crying for 4 days. I'm sorry if this is really long I just needed to get this off my chest"
1021,What do I do?,"Alright so here's what happened:  
I was playing the football/soccer video game FIFA and was in a match. It was all alright, score 2-2, but then he made it 4-2 and I snapped. I smashed my controller into my TV and the screen got damaged, the TV is now irreversibly destroyed.  I don't know what to do and how Ican  prevent this happening ever again and how to tell my parents that I did it."
1022,A mind as toneless as a new canvas,"For as long as I can remember, which is, given that I'm 19, not a far stretch back, I haven't liked coffee, alcohol, any of the drugs I tried, relationships, sex, theme parks or literally anything remotely similar to the usual thrill-givers. If I were to reflect, I couldn't say I ever had a real friend either. This whole situation worsened for quite some time and I'm currently in this no-friends self-isolation type of position, where it's hard to get motivation for anything, yet surprisingly comfortable. 

Now, as I've flaired this post as ""Need Support"", I'm doing so because I wanted to ask If this is normal behaviour. If its just my brain ticking a bit sideways as opposed to the people around me and perhaps If someone found themselves in a similar position. 

(I realize this isn't the urgest of cases, and If you think this is not in your league, do not worry and give your attention to those more in need.)

1024,Is it normal to feel like you have two sides of you(or more)that constantly switch?,"Sorry for my English

I know people behave differently among different people, they also different when they by themself but is it normal to feel like theres so many parts of you that alternate regularly?"
1025,Be Patient With Yourself,"We are all damaged. We have all been hurt. We have all had to learn painful lessons. We are all recovering from some mistake, loss, betrayal, abuse, injustice or misfortune. All of life is a process of recovery that never ends. We each must find ways to accept and move through the pain and to pick ourselves back up. For each pang of grief, depression, doubt or despair, there is an inverse toward renewal coming to you in time. Each tragedy is an announcement that some good will indeed come in time. Be patient with yourself. 

There was time when things were so good, and you were happy. You wonder how things got so bad, then you blame yourself. You hate yourself. You cannot control the pain, and you mark your body, with little slit tally marks. But, you desire to fix yourself. You want things to be better. You are trying, but remember, things take time. You must be patient. You must learn from your mistakes, before you can fix yourself. It is a process. 

Stay safe all! :)"
1026,"Why do I get suddenly overwhelmed when an occasion comes up in my schedule? (Plans, events, etc)","Hey, wondering if anyone else experiences this because I really don't get it. I have PTSD so I deal with a cocktail of depression, anxiety, OCD.... anyways, there was a time when my PTSD was so bad I couldn't leave my house or see anyone. 

Now that I am on a more functioning level, ANY commitment makes me very anxious. It doesnt have to be a serious, important event. For example, my dad called me this morning to ask if I was coming camping in 2 weeks.  I say it depends what my schedule looks like, how I'm feeling, and despite knowing I will have a good time and genuinely want to go, it freaks me out.

I have no idea, why whenever anyone suggests ""we do something"" i go into anxious hermit mode."
1027,My decline over the past 2 weeks,"I’ve been having a really rough time and engaging in a lot of self destructive decisions.

It all started when I chose to go to a bar and sit at a table and read one of my favourite books with a drink. I guess someone slipped something in, or just got me so drunk that I don’t even remember drinking, but my next memory was being in somebody’s living room and giving oral sex to two men. I also remember chunks on his couch and getting yelled at for throwing up even though I don’t remember throwing up. Then one of the men brought me to his apartment and this is where my memory is a lot less fogged. He told me he was in his late 30s (I’m only 20), he had two cats that I kept petting for comfort, and he kept giving me more and more cocaine and pressuring me to take it. I left at 5am and was super nauseous and couldn’t think straight and it was a 2 hour walk back to my place but I made it.

My roomate was awake and I wasn’t ready to tell her what just happened, I made up a lie and told her I had gone to a motel and consensually did cocaine with Matt (a guy I’ve been talking to.) 
I had never felt more used in my life but I wasn’t ready to tell anyone, I thought at least. That’s when I got a DM from somebody I was in love with for 3 years of my life. For background, I’ve been very toxic to this person and this person has also been very toxic to me. We bring out the worst in eachother. But I answered his DM and just told him everything. Surprisingly he was supportive and he said I need a break from the city, so that day he drove 8 hours to my city, slept over at my place, and drove me 8 hours to my hometown in the morning. The first day with him was OK but then we started fighting. I told him I wasn’t ready to have sex again but I changed my mind and Everytime I would stop and start crying and he comforted me. We bickered over everything from the music he was playing in the car to big political issues. I wanted to be back in the city. He said we would only spend 2 nights and then he’d bring me back but that was a big lie. He procrastinated bringing me back for 6 whole nights. But finally I made it back. My first night alone was really rough so I started drinking and that only made me feel worse because it was the first time I was drunk since the incident. At this point I had still lied to all my friends about what happened and my ex was the only one who knew, so I tried to call him and he wasn’t available. This is where I’m in the wrong; I got mad at him for not being there for me and started hurling hurtful things at him. I called him a pedophile because he dated a 17 year old (he’s 21) and he got so mad at me that now I’m blocked on everything. Honestly, understandable. But now I have nobody who knows. 

I’ve tried hinting further at my friends but either they don’t get the hint or assume I don’t wanna talk about it. But I feel like nobody’s here. I’m afraid to go to the sexual assault centre because they give you a STI test and if I test positive that means I gave it to my ex too. I’m not ready to handle that information it will just be too overwhelming. I feel so alone and I started self harming again and now I’m embarrassed to wear summer clothes because my thighs are covered with cuts. 

I’ve hurt people in the process and I’m coping terribly and I can’t get it off my mind and I feel like I have nobody."
1028,I no longer have friends,[deleted]
1029,All I can think about right now is dying,"It’s always in the back of my mind. I don’t want to die, but I just don’t want to be me. I feel like everyone I’m around gets hurt or gets fucked over by everything I do. I always hurt my friends feelings unintentionally and then get upset when they start drifting away and it’s toxic af. I feel so bad. I don’t want to be close to anyone because everyone fucking leaves. I feel so weird and stupid and sad. Everyone expects me to be happy.

I genuinely cannot stop thinking about suicide. Everything I do just contributed to it. Im driving down the road? Yank the steering wheel. Im walking down the traintracks? Jump off the bridge top. Playing jump rope with the kids I’m babysitting? Hang yourself. It just repeats over and over and I can’t get out of it. I don’t even feel like being with friends because I know they will just leave eventually because I’m annoying. I don’t know what to do.

I can’t get help, my family is very anti-mental illness. What do I do?"

i keep saying i wanna go home, they don’t seem to understand that it’s a feeling or a place where you feel safe or somewhere you feel you belong.

i constantly feel home sick even when at home. i still haven’t found my place in this world. i don’t know where to start. i feel like i have no one and anyone i did have is gone. or maybe they’re not and i just lost myself.

i fear i’ll forever be stuck with this numb feeling. and the feeling of just not fitting in. i feel lost in dark and it’s so dark that no one could ever find me. i’m hidden to well by this mask i continue to wear. even if they were to find me, i don’t think they could put me back together."

1037,Help? (Directed at people with MPD and Schizophrenia),"Edit: deleted the mpd part because it was way to complicated lol


How do you know if you have MPD and should get help? 

What are the signs. 

And how do you know if you are schizophrenic? 

Is it just a overactive imagination? 

I hear screaming that wont leave me alone, loud whispers that wont leave me alone, music that wont leave me alone. I see demons which cant be real. Its not real. I use to deny deny deny and say and think it was real but now I know it isnt. Even if at the time I dont know or think that. Its scary. I was awake one night and something was trying to get out of the closet. Lucky for me I always put things against it but it almost got out. But now I dont think its real.  I realize now that when I told my sister the reason she went back to sleep was because she didnt see it. I see dead pets. I see there shadows walk around the house.

Does this make sense? Its not my complete thoughts and im not sure I can ever explain it to the true extent this all goes to. This is maybe 2% of everything? Im not sure. I cant remember what I wrote but im sure its ok. I will post this and edit it because I didnt have time to re write it. Im sorry. I dont want to seem like a self diagnosed jerk but its all so confusing. Im not doing that im just wondering. And sorry for using “we” its the only way I knew how to explain it probably I cant really remember. Im sorry. Im not sure how to feel about all this and my minds about to go I cant think and im hearing “loud” thinking about all of this. I cant type anything more about this except this right now. Does this make sense? Im sorry thank you. I forgot I wanted to say more things but I cant remember. Thank you."
1038,What is wrong with me?,"I need help. Just by the way, this post is going to be long. 

My mom knew I was different from a very young age. I've always had very severe anxiety. Also an extremely overactive imagination. An example would be: in preschool we read a book about a girl who had stripes and polka dots on her skin. I freaked out and got scared I would break out with stripes and polka dots on MY skin after hearing that story. My parents pulled me out of preschool due to social anxiety and I was homeschooled for eight years after that. 

It all got really bad when I was about ten. My mom was pregnant and had to get off her epilepsy meds. She was having seizures very often and having to watch her go through that was really scary for me. My Dad took off so much time from work that he eventually had to go back to work. If my mom had a seizure, I would have to take care of her and my siblings since I'm the oldest. Sometimes she would lose her memory for a short while after a seizure and not remember me and that obviously made me anxious and sad. It was around this time I started to believe I was insane. I was extremely deppressed. The shapes of everything around me looked sad and pointless and strange. I had panic attacks whenever I did anything. I couldn't even ride in a car without panicking. I developed OCD. I couldn't scratch an itch down, only up, because down meant hell. If I had a bad thought, i had to say the word ""pop"" to pop my thought bubble. If i heard any word associated with death or dying, i had to jump up three times. I held my breath everytime we drove by a cemetary. Sometimes random thoughts would just hit me out of nowhere and freak me out. I was scared of numbers. 6:00PM was the scariest hour of the day. One time I sat on my bed and the number 20 just hit me out of nowhere and I thought it meant I would die at 20. I would have terrible thoughts about stabbing people around me, having sex with my family member. I hated myself and felt so guilty. I thought no one would ever love me if thet found out how I thought. 

I'm not sure how many mental illnesses I have. That I know of I have: OCD, Depression, anxiety, panic disorder. I also had an eating disorder for a while. I'm also a hypochondriac. I've been to the ER multiple times for things that were all in my head. It gets to the point where I cant tell the difference between real symptoms and ones I made up. Starting last summer, i was stuck in a binge-starve cycle. I'm out of that now. I eat normally now. But it used to make me feel pretty lightheaded. Then in September, I smoked a lot of weed. I used to be a stoner but after this one time, I've been cautious about smoking. I dont know if the weed was laced or what. But I panicked for four hours straight and ever since then, I've felt dizzy every single day. I convinced myself I had a brain tumor and panicked for two days straight. I ended up going to the ER. They gave me an ativan and sent me home. The dizziness never went away. I was on zoloft for a while. But I read that antidepressants can make people lose sexual pleasure and feel like a robot, and that sounds like a miserable life, so I stopped taking them after about a month. I felt pretty happy for a while after stopping them. But I did have a bit of a drinking problem and I'd get drunk multiple times a week. About three or so weeks ago, something happened. I dont know what. I just started panicking and it triggered more panic attacks and I couldn't stop. The next day I felt extremely deppressed and anxious. The depression and anxiety got worse and worse till I finally had a nervous breakdown. I was disassociating very badly. My whole body felt numb, everything around me felt like a dream, or like it wasn't real. I felt like I would break from reality. I cant even begin to explain how horrible I felt. I went to the ER. Again, they just gave me an ativan and sent me home. I dissociated for days and days after that. Constantly anxious and disassociating. I was starting to have mental breakdowns  everyday. Sleep was my only escape.  I would just sit on my bed, shaking and feeling physically numb and panicking all day long, till it got later in the evening and I could take an ativan and pass out, then wake up for a few hours and feel alright maybe. I have all these crazy thoughts. Like what if my vision just goes completely red? What if my vision goes black? White? What if I start hallucinating? What if I get angry and kill someone? What if i died and I'm in hell? What if I'm possessed? Am I dying? A while before this I had an issue where the walls looked like they were breathing. I'm scared because what if I have a brain tumor and I'm dying? For the past couple days I've been FREAKING out because I feel like im gonna die. Do you think I'm really going to? Do you think I'm just anxious and still having a breakdown? Or am I actually dying? Please help. I feel so miserable. I'm non-stop panicking and feeling hopeless and sad and I just want to feel alright again. Do you think I'm going to die? I'm dizzy and lightheaded all the time too. I'm very scared. I'm very illogical as well. And a bit delusional. I was playing crossy road and I died in the game and then thought ""that means I'm gonna die in real life!"" Or just now, if I post this, does it mean it will become real? If I just forget about it and not post this, will i he alright? NO. I have to stop. I have to understand that those things wont happen. It's just hard. I need help really badly."
1039,Bipolar? Depressed? Moody? I don‘t know.,"Before I begin rambling, let me first say that my mom has bipolar &amp; let’s be honest I think everyone’s family.. or at least someone in their family has or has had depression or anxiety of some sort. If you haven’t, I’m sure this pandemic  and all the hub blub has chaotically made its way into your life. 

Anyway, so I’ve noticed some pretty crappy stuff about myself. And I’ve tried to be more aware of things that I’m saying or doing because I see what it’s doing to my children and my family as a whole. 

I’ve had TERRIBLE mood swings. Happy one moment, sad and just downright miserable the next. I tend to get upset rather quickly over stupid things. Noises that the kids make drives me crazy. Yelling at the kids for no reason at all whatsoever. When I get mad, it’s like a switch has been flipped and bam, I’m SO angry. 

We were having a 4th of July party; getting ready for it my husband and friend were putting tiki torches around. I heard them talking but I didn’t know about what and silently freaked out because I didn’t hear what they were saying.. was it about me?? I didn’t know but it came out of nowhere and I was instantly mad that I didn’t know what they were saying? I almost flew off the handle and walked out there. I didn’t but it was so weird feeling that way. 

Today,we were on our way to drop off furniture for my brother, he’s moving to NC tomorrow, the entire way to his dad’s house and I felt like I couldn’t breathe, my chest was tight, my stomach was in knots. As soon as we dropped the furniture off I was fine. 


My husband has mentioned it a time or two.. or three how much my mood has changed from one minute to the next. My son has really started to not want to come home from his dads lately.. I’m wondering if I’m the reason. It’s all very strange. 

I have since made an appointment with my doctor to discuss it. But I just needed somewhere to put my thoughts."

1041,Help with compulsive behavior - ranting,"I have developed a severe compulsion with cleaning. I live in a 2900sq home. I have a 5yo, a cat, two dogs and a ferret and a useless husband.
I clean all day, every single day. I start when i wake up and end minutes before sleep. I must have everything company ready at all times. I cannot stop. If there is something out of place I will not stop thinking about it until it is done. I have no time to spend with my child. No time for my pets except basic necessities. 
My husband will not help clean. 
I admit I want it very clean but some help at least with shared tasks would be nice. The 5 yo does everything wrong. He does not thoroughly wipe things down, he can't fold correctly so I don't expect much from him. I clock over 10k steps just cleaning everyday, at least 11k sometimes 13k. I only get to sit when I take a pee. Please help me. I am so tired and I don't leave the house. My husband was laid off and just lays around on the couch all day. He goes to the gym at 7am then the rest of the day does nothing and refuses to help me with the pets of child. He says it is not his fault I like it clean. He then tells me he did not want pet responsibilities. I got my dog 8 years ago. I care for her alone. He got two ferrets in 2014.  I cared for both of them all this time (one passed in November.) The cat he suggested we get, it also was in an unsafe environment so he was aquired. The other dog was purchased last week as our son has been begging for onenover a year. My husband jointly purchased it but now won't help. She is 9wks I am potty training her alone.

1043,How to be there for someone with depression?,So I'm actually one of those lucky people who has struggled very little with mental health. But my boyfriend who I recently started dating struggles with ongoing depression (he is seeing a counselor and considering antidepressants). I care about him a lot and really want to be there for him but because it's not something I've experienced I have a hard time both understanding where he's at and knowing how to help. Any advice either from people with depression (what you would want your loved ones to know/do) or people who are in the same position as me? Thank you :)
1044,My older brother (M25) needs help and I don’t really really know how to give it to him.,"He ran away to Austin, TX to be homeless, this is not his first time. He ran away a few years ago and my older brothers (M30, M29) brought him back with his permission. He stayed with us for a year or two but then ran away after a confrontation with my eldest brother (M30). He talks to me (M18) and my mom (F57) a lot. I try to tell him to come home and give him advice but I’m not really suited for it. I just tell him what I would do if I were in his situation. He’s paranoid (thinks people are following him and out to get him), is really scared of going to a mental health facility or something. He also struggles with depression and self doubt. I help him out by sending him some money for food sometimes and tell him he should get a lot of sleep, clear his head by meditation, ask him if he’s doing well. I also face chat him sometimes over Snapchat to talk to him. I keep telling him to come home so we can take care of him but he avoids talking about that. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do."
1045,How can I bring up suspected BPD traits to therapist?,"I don't have a psychiatrist, but i have recently began seeing a therapist. I have been carefully documenting my mood, feelings, and activities three times per day for 10 months, in hopes of capturing the turbulence in my mood and what goes on in the moment. My therapist wouldn't even let me show her the data because she said it was bad for me to track my mood because it makes me more anxious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss. I tried bringing BPD up at my last therapist, and he shut that down. I understand self-diagnosis is bad, but i really think this is more than just social anxiety and depression. How can i bring this up to my therapist without it seeming like i'm self-diagnosing?"

1048,What to do and not to do before you're an adult,"I just wanted to note these thoughts down really. Basically I am now 24 and looking back on things there is so much that I didn't do or I've put off that has effected my current health, but didn't seem like much at the time.

It's so important to get yourself out there and push yourself to do things for your future. I always put things off waiting till 'I feel ready' but the truth is some things you'll never be ready for and will just have to face later on after who knows what number of horrible things has occurred.

Independence for example. It can be scary to do things alone or do things you find scary when someone else will do it for you. Well please, the more you put things off, the more scared you'll be and time won't fix it. I've put off driving for so long and now I could really have done with that freedom. I did everything with my twin and got my mum to do things like ringing the doctor etc and I thought oh well when I'm older I'll be able to but no, I still can't and it's made things worse. I've still had to learn to do things for myself and by myself, to be on my own, just now instead of when I was a teen - it cost me my relationship.

make friends! For the love of god, grab friends wherever you can. You need them! Having one good friend is OK, but one day in the future they might not be there. Get as many as you can and from anywhere you can (but safely ofc, don't like meet random people off the Internet in dark alleyways).

Lastly, if you need therapy or any help with mental health, get it ASAP. My depression has made therapy difficult from lack of motivation and having a couple failed attempts at therapy. But I know now, that I'm never going to get better without these things and altho I'm getting the help now, I just think about where I could have been if I'd have been happy.

Don't waste your life waiting for things to happen - your future self will thank you"
1049,i feel like there is something wrong with me like seriously wrong.,when people die. people ive known for most my live i dont feel anything. and a lot of the times i think about well hurting other people usually my self but a lot of times other people too. it nearly always happens if i see anything sharp. cut my guts out or something. it plays in my mind like a video.

1051,"I woke up happy for once, and it’s for a weird reason","So I [14F] have been going through a rough patch; lots of anxious thoughts and prolonged existential crises. Things have been slowly improving, although I am still self-harming regularly. That’s not what I wanna talk about though.

This morning I woke up, got dressed immediately, and went outside to take a few photos. I’ve never been the type to do such a thing and post on Instagram, but I wanted to and it made me feel happy. I guess the real reason I’m feeling happier is because I’m kind of aligning myself with an aesthetic? Which is giving me a weird reason to live, and while it’s kind of pathetic I’m gonna take it.

Last night I spent an hour changing all my Spotify playlist covers to a new theme, which also reflects on my Instagram. I know it’s small, and will probably fade away soon enough, but it’s making me happy for now and that’s all that matters.

Thanks for reading :D"
1052,Has anyone been feeling disconnected with their own emotions?,"I feel so disconnected with anything and everything. I feel like one second I start to get an emotion, another I would start spacing out from that emotion and start thinking if I ‘deserve’ or were supposed to feel that way, such as if I’m happy, I’ll think every time if I’m really deserved to feel happy or if I should feel this happy. For sadness, I would always think if I’m overreacting. It feels like I could not truly feel every emotion to its extent, to actually feel every emotion 100% without spacing out and questioning myself. I’m so mad and depressed at the same time about this, but I can’t change anything about it. I’m overall a depressed person on the inside but never really shows it in front of people. I’ve had this feeling since I was very young. I don’t know how to overcome it. Sorry my English is not very good, it’s not my native language."
1053,Is it bad that I feel uneasy BECAUSE I’m at peace?,So just as the title says weirdly enough right now most of my mental issues are taken care of at the moment for some weird reason I whenever feel at peace rather it for a seconds or a few minutes then I get this really uneasy feeling like something bad is going to happen Not anything horrible just something to inconvenience me in any way shape or form is this a big issue or just anxiety?
1054,In-person therapy?,"I (22F) have been going through an extremely difficult time and I feel like there’s a million things going through my head a minute. I feel so deeply and constantly and I can’t get it to stop. I don’t know how to process or understand any of the things I have been feeling and I don’t know who to talk to, but I’d like to get help because my head is going to dark places. 

My insurance provider is Kaiser and I’ve tried to get help with them before. Appointments were usually 6 weeks out, and I’m looking to find a therapist where I can see them on a weekly basis. I don’t have privacy in my current living situation, so I’m also interested in getting that help in person. A lot of therapists I’ve found are primarily offering phone or video calling services.

Are there any places that are covered by Kaiser for me to get weekly therapy, or should I pay out of pocket and go elsewhere? Are there any resources on how to find a therapist in my area that may fit my needs more appropriately? TIA"

1056,How do you tell when you need residential treatment?,I have been struggling for the last few months. I keep spending money. I keep going back to self harm. I have a hard time showering.

1060,Anxiety in a new relationship,"So a little background, I, like most people, have had a really tough year. I haven't had issues with my anxiety or depression for several years, but alot of crap has gone down for me, and my anxiety and depression has flared up pretty bad. I started the year by breaking up with my girlfriend of almost 4 years. I got rejected by grad school, which was my only long term plan. And I got a promotion at work, which while great, has been stressful and put me in a much more toxic work environment. And then COVID happened. Im very outgoing, and just generally a positive ball of extroversion. So quarantine has been really hard for me.

 But in the midst of all this, I met a girl online about three months ago, and we started seeing each other a month and a half ago. Things have been going great, we've had a great connection. It's a distance relationship, but we've managed to see each other weekly. And things moved fairly quickly. But this past week she's been saying she feels burnt out and introverted. Which is totally fine. But it's been almost like a lightswitch was flipped. She hasn't ghosted me or anything, but she's been super distant, and last minute bailed on our plans for this weekend. And im in a good enough place to truly understand that sometimes people just need time alone. But i still feel really bummed. And honestly, this is doing a number on my anxiety. I know I just need to wait it out, but I'm really struggling to not ruminate on it. Any suggestions guys? How would you healthily deal with this anxiety if you were in my shoes?"
1061,"this miiight be the hypomania talking, but ...","i've been really needing to get in touch with my creativity and maybe try to re-open my third eye or something, so there's this thought floating around in my head saying hmmm. maybe a way i can do that is by not taking my meds for a while and then going solo camping without telling anyone to do some meditation and self reflection and practice art, etc... just a lil thought i have haha"
1062,Just need to get this out of my system,"So i’m 17 this saturday and i’m really feeling quite down, i know this is not a problem in comparison to what everyone else is struggling with but i just need to let it out, ive recently been told by my “mates” that they don’t like me anymore and all i do now is work, i really want to be with someone who i enjoy and love but i don’t have the confidence to ever be able to talk to someone or even to be able to initiate a conversation with anyone, i just fell like i’m not enough for anyone and society now is all based on looks and popularity"
1063,I got prescribed medication and I don't agree with the choice,"I've been in therapy off/on for about 2-3 years now and just had an appointment with a psychiatrist a couple days ago. It all started when my mom basically told me that my therapist sucks and that I should talk to her psychiatrist. My oldest sister works for the same company as my therapist and my moms psychiatrist. Her and mom talk often and I guess as mom talked about me, my sister told her that my therapist has a bad record with patients and isn't typically effective and eventually, with multiple conversations, it eventually got down the pipeline to me. after hearing this, I canceled my next appointment with my therapist and scheduled an appointment with moms psychiatrist and had planned on not rescheduling with my therapist thinking that a psychiatrist was basically just a therapist with more authority and experience...not exactly the case obviously. I had an appointment with the psychiatrist and when the appointment was over, I got prescribed meds for depression and anxiety. It felt really strange because the appointment didn't feel very flushed out and I didn't even get a description of the meds I was prescribed. Especially given my mindset and the issues I deal with, having someone tell me to do something with minimal information given and to see them again in four weeks feels really bad. I'm probably not even making sense anymore, but I really just wanted to vent. Any comments would be great...I really need to talk about this more I think."
1064,Should I meet with my psychiatrist?,"So, I've been feeling quite weird mentally and I'm not sure whether I should speak with my psychiatrist or if there is no need to.

I've been zoning out a lot, which is something I have always done, and feeling extremely weird when doing it. I'm really struggling to put in to words how I feel when this happens so I apologise if this nonsense doesn't make much sense.
When I ""zone out"" my face just goes blank and my mind doesn't really register what I'm hearing or seeing. It's as if I'm taking a step back and not noticing what's happening around me. My entire body gets extremely heavy and difficult to move, and my brain seems to just slow down. I just feel extremely weird when this happens...  Again, I'm sorry for not giving much detail. I really don't know how to describe any of this.

This one time I was reading a book, and without realising I had completely zoned out and had no recollection of reading it. I only snapped out of it once I finished the book, and soon realised that I could only remember reading the first chapter or so of it. A lot of time had passed, considering I finished an entire book, but it didn't feel like any time had passed at all.

Another thing I have (which I'm not sure is a problem or not, but I just want to bring it up either way) is not being able to tell if I dreamt something or if it actually happened. Usually this only happens with conversations, but I had 2 memories that I mentioned to a family member and they said that there was no way that those two events had happened and that I had dreamt them.
(The first event being me seeing our cat (who was neutered) with her kittens, that she had seemingly just given birth to, surrounding her, and the other event being me in my bathroom at home and looking down and seeing a massive red crab/lobster on the floor)

I'm not sure if any of this is normal or not but I need to get someone's opinion on it, as I don't want to make a fool of myself in front of my psychiatrist by talking about things that aren't even abnormal or anything to worry about. Please help me.

(I posted this on my main account but I don't want my family members to see this so I'm posting this again on my spam/troll account)"
1065,Why do people describe the core feeling of being suicidal as not actually wanting to die?,"Because for me it’s been quite the opposite. Not actively or aggressively suicidal right now, just thinking about it. And if your experience with suicidal thoughts and ideation has been the opposite of what I’m describing, it’s not meant to invalidate you by any means. Your experience is your personal experience and no one has a right to argue with you about that. Just wanted to make that known! 

But my experience with being suicidal has only halfway been a means of escape. Sure that’s part of it but not the whole thing. I’ve had other, much more oddly specific “escape” plans in my life, but suicide to me has always just been about killing my self. There’s a lot of powerful emotions that come with it, and sure, escaping my current circumstances would be a bonus, but it’s never the whole thing. 

Like, my thought was never “I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to live like this”. It was always just “I want to die, I crave it” even when I feel good. I just want the consciousness and life and and memory and emotion to leave me entirely and never be resurrected again. It’s always a feeling of wanting to be completely gone from any type of physical, mental, or spiritual existence and to know that’s what is happening. I do not want to be remembered and the thought of dying forever and having no legacy brings be deep comfort. 

Maybe the difference is the source. Some people are suicidal because of their circumstances and I’m just suicidal because I hate myself and would rather be wiped from existence. Idk. Feel free to add onto or discuss this with me. Like I said I’m not actively suicidal just thinking about it all"

1068,Thoughts Too Real,"I have never been diagnosed with anything. The most I have been was testing gifted for creative thinking during an ADHD exam. 

My family is full of (verbal) fighters, with my sister being the most calm one, but can throw her weight around with words as well. My other sister was the one most like me, both in personality and looks. She constantly fought with my mom and dad.

Ever since she moved out, that fighting personality comes out rarer, but still appears, usually against me. I'm unfocused on real life and nearing moving away to college. Something my sister's both failed at.

During elementary school I developed thoughts and stories of hurting people who wronged me. To cope with bullying. I have been in and out of therapy, remarking that I have these thoughts, but would never act on them because I didn't want to ruin my future.

Until one day I finally acted on it. 

During the pandemic, no matter how many times I've tried, I couldn't schedule a phone visit with my psychologist. Leading to worsening thoughts. 

One day I was missing an important document and I told my mom I didn't make an appointment to turn it in. She immediately yelled at me, bringing up my failures of my sisters in college. 

I clenched my fist, trying to block it out. But I wanted to stop being compared. I thought of slapping her. Instead I ran up and punched her face. I was in shock of what I did and immediately followed her orders of sending me to my room. I ran and laid in my closet, clawing at my arms and neck while sobbing with a face mask on.

Eventually my mom came back and ignored my clawing and demanded I come down. I followed, dull fingernails still trying to break the skin.

I found the paper and demanded that no one come to the dog show I needed the paper for. I felt so sick and just wanted to tell my psychologist what happened. I didn't want to be locked away in a mental hospital, afraid that if my college knew it if I was too sick my future would be ruined.

Later my mom came and we sat together. Things seemed to have calm down until she told me ""don't hit me again. Can you promise that?""

And I teared up, because I was unpredictable now. I acted on a violent thought that was supposed to make me calm down and be distracted. Who knows when the next attack will be? 

I've tried contacting my psychologist after this, but there's been nothing available to me.

I'm unsure of what I'm sick with."
1069,Constantly paranoid of breaking things,"For 6 months now I am constantly worried about breaking expensive things I own (e.g pc, phone etc). This started small as I realised I was doing stupid things with them (like dropping phone on my hard floor before I went to bed) but gradually this has built up to the point where whenever I am using expensive things I'm constantly paranoid that something I am doing could damage it. 

The crazy part is the things I'm worried that I'm doing to damage my stuff is so stupid as its almost like I am going insane as it's stuff like worrying that breathing on charging ports etc could break them and I know this is incredibly stupid but it's gotten to the point where when I do it my brain instantly goes into shutdown and I have a huge cloud of dread in my brain constantly thinking that what I have done could break it.

 I tell myself that it's stupid to worry about but it's an uncontrollable force that can stay on my mind for hours but then the next day it is gone and all I can think of is how stupid my worrying was but then it just happens again and again, more worse every time

I am wondering if anyone has heard of this type of thing before and wether it can be fixed or I am going crazy (maybe it's cause of the lockdown I'm in but I'm not sure) 

Thank you"

1072,Possible manic episode/manic feelings for the first time and pretty freaked out by it,"Hi all, so I’ve been on 10mg daily of lexapro for anxiety and depression for about 2 1/2 months and in general it’s been really great. Yesterday I had a really scary experience where I was talking to my partner on the phone and over the course of an hour began talking really fast with different inflection and laughing too much. It was like I physically couldn’t stop talking. I felt extremely “up” at first but then that turned into panic and I started having trouble breathing. I felt completely out of control. I had to pull over and get off the phone. My hands were shaking and when I eventually got back on the road and to my destination I really didn’t remember the bulk of the conversation at all. 
Today I feel really down, a little paranoid, and anxious. I did talk to my doctor and we’re cutting my dose in half for 2 weeks and monitoring my symptoms. I also plan on cutting down on caffeine and sleeping more.

Could anyone help me figure out what it is?,"I have like anxiety or a fear of old places forgotten by society or being forgotten. Its kunda hard to explain. Like i feel like if im doing something that maybe not a single other person on the planet is doing or am in a place that feels lonely or excluded i feel just upset and anxious. As if im going to be forgotten by society or am wasting my life doing things not of the modern day and age. 

Examples of this. 
I watched an old film today that was around 25 years old maybe and remember feeling anxious or thinking ""wow i must be the only person on the planet watching this"". I just felt alone and agitated like i wasnt living a modern life style. I felt like i was on a deserted island and started to feel like life was just an endless cycle of new events but i feel like im missing these out and life is pointless and repetitive. 

I also got this when i was in a caravan site in a quite old style caravan with an old tv which made me feel alone and anxious again.

Please could someone help me identify this? And if so how to fix it.

1078,"Every friend I've had, either left me, bullied me, or simply drifted away. I'm the only common denominator, so I'm the issue?","Over my life so far, I've had 4 distinct groups of friends, and none of them have lasted very long.

In primary school (age 5-12) I had 2 of these groups, a small group of 2, who simply drifted away and stopped talking to me. And the other was a larger group (6-7) where 4 of them turned on me, and bullied me for 4 years relentlessly, causing me to be physically ill at, and before school.

One of my friends, I had for years and years. He was slightly older, and lived next door. From age 6-13 we were best friends, even going on holiday together multiple times. When I was around 13, he started to get 'too cool' for me, and this made me extremely upset. I absolutely thought we would be friends for years and years, but I guess it just wasn't going to be.

For the past 3 years, I've hung out with the largest of the 4 groups, (around 10). They have argued, shouted, harassed, and purposefully left me out of hundreds of meetups. They would hide behind walls if they saw me on the street, calling me a pussy and other demeaning things for wanting to set ""ground-rules"" for Truth or Dare, which is one thing I was allowed to attend. 

Now I feel like shit, because I'm the issue. 26 people have been my 'friends' and the only common denominator is me, therefore I'm the problem. I've began to isolate myself from others, I have great difficulty trusting anyone, and I find being a nihilistic, boring, apathetic asshole to be the only thing I am worth doing.

Most weekends nobody will talk or text me. The closest human interaction ill get in the weekends is my trainer and the other gym members for the hour im there, but most of them are older people with kids and im still in my mid 20s so there isnt alot in common there. 

Ive gone to a few therapists but i feel like none have helped. The last guy i went to would cut our meetings short, and when i got a copy of my file he would right that our sessions were 45 minutes or an hour when most went about 30 minutes. 

I want to try to go to therapy again but i feel like im just going to waste my money for the same results.

I guess sometimes I don’t know if he knew what he was doing was wrong, if he meant to even hurt me. 

He approached me on the street after I had been drinking. He was 30 and I was 19 and separated me from my friend. Once we got back to his place, he started violently kissing me. He forced me to undress, bit my breast, suffocated me with his body, pinned my leg down with his knee, and told me to perform sexual acts on him before vaginally penetrating me until I started bleeding. He didn’t stop when I was bleeding and kept going. I dissociated the entire time.

He made a lot of degrading comments and forced me to tell him what I wanted him to do to me. He tried to take pictures of me, yelled at me when I tried to leave, and forced me to sing for him knowing that I was studying voice in school at the time. 
He smirked at me and looked smug the whole time. 
I managed to escape after he’d fallen asleep and then dropped out of college.

I don’t know if he meant to hurt me or if he’s even really a rapist."

1092,Celebrating 365+ days of being alone and miserable,"Rookie numbers I know.
About one year and one month ago I broke up with my first and probably last girlfriend and that was the last time I came in contact with another human being, I've been confined to my room ever since, crying, nervous eating, lying in bed 10 hours a day (not including sleep of course) and playing an absolutely unhealthy amount of videogames. I can litterally feel my body decaying, my legs and arms are atrophied from doing nothing for so long, my vision has gone to shit and I have developed nerve pains due to the constant sitting/lying down.

My entire life has collapsed further than I could ever imagine and there is nobody to blame other than me, yet I still don't give a shit and continue to destroy any chance of my life ever going anywhere day by day.

I am the quintessential example of exactly what you should not do in your teens. I tried hanging myself two times but I pussied out, so now I'm just here, serving less purpose than a house plant. A litteral rotting corpse that still breathes.

I used to be an atheist but after all the torment and agony I've gone through I started believing in something greater, not because I want god to help me, but because I want to spite them, every day that I go through feels like a big fuck you to whoever higher power though that giving me life was a good idea, and despite all the shit they threw my way, I'm still here walking through the very flames of hell as the demons try to feast on my soul only to find that there is none left.

I'm having a manic episode so I'll probably delete this later when I realize how much of a fucking lunatic I am. Cya."
1093,Can you see a psychiatrist in the US without showing ID?,"My best friend needs therapy but is stuck in decades-old thinking. She feels ashamed (we're trying to help her see it differently). She has agreed to see a therapist, but only if she can do it anonymously. She wouldn't be using her insurance. My thinking is a psychiatrist is a medical doctor who swore ""to do not harm,"" not ""to check ID."" And it's going to be harmful if she doesn't have the ability to start therapy. I've searched for information on this, but cannot find anything definitive."
1094,Anyone else having nightmare caused by quetiapine?,"I’ve been taking 50mg of Kventiax for approximately 9 months now to treat my insomnia. In February a friend of mine passed and I started getting saddening dreams about her. Then it progressed to actual full blown nightmares about pretty much everything in my life. I thought that it was just the trauma from her passing. But I started noticing that if I don’t take my pills, or take half a dose, I don’t get nightmares or hardly any dreams at all. Yes, I fall asleep at 6am and wake up frequently, but I at least don’t have awful dreams. Has this happened to anyone else who took quetiapine?"
1095,How do I figure out my life without a therapist. I think i might be trans?,"I think i might be transgender, but i feel fucking terrified and i have no access to a therapist, for all i know i could be delusional and hate myself more for becoming a man and then kill myself. But I hate my body so much right now I want to kill myself anyways. If I keep living like this I'm gonna fucking kill myself eventually. Maybe I just have regular body dysmorphia and if I lose weight ill feel better about myself? I've desperately been trying to loose weight to get rid of my fat thighs, but also I've been lifting weights to get big arms. I feel like I'm fucking crazy. I dont want to be an ugly man who women think is creepy, I want to be a hot 20yo gay guy who dresses punk but u feel like with my luck I'm gonna turn out looking really fucking ugly and I'm gonna hate myself all the time. 
Idk I just wish I could get a therapist who could help me but its really not an option. Can someone please help me i dont know what to do anymore"
1096,U.K.- can therapists help or do you need to see a psychiatrist,[deleted]
1097,How do you get help for someone else?,"I have the feeling that a family member of mine is suffering from a mix of anxiety / depression / something else.

I can't, however, go with them to a psychiatrist / psychologist - both because of covid, and also because the psychologist / or my family member would probably be against that. 

Let's say the family member agrees to go. I have the feeling it would take a long time (probably 5-10 sessions) before the psychologist gets the full picture of what's going on with this family member. The reason for this is that the family member is very intelligent, and stubborn, and would probably come off reasonably well at first. He'd also deny strenuously that there was anything wrong with him, and probably try to blame his behavior on external factors / his living situation.

On the other hand, I know very well things I could point to that really get to the crux of his symptoms: how he's been interacting with his family, with friends, the general public, his emotional outbursts, etc.

Ideally, I could speak to the psychologist and let them know the deal beforehand, and get updates from them directly. I think this would be in violation of how they operate.

So... how are you supposed to get help for this family member? Just send them off alone and hope progress is being made? Wait for at least 5 sessions before the psychologist sees probably half of what you see?

It seems pretty darn inefficient this way. So, what's the right way?"

1101,I think I might have a drug problem and im scared,"So my country is out of lockdown for about 2-3 months now, this started when lockdown began. I couldn’t see my friends, I was  depressed and lonely so I began to drink, wasn’t wild at first, a glass of wine or one bier sometimes a nice glass of whisky. Well it Became a whole bottle of wine pretty soon. I drank every day pretty much and just vibe to music and cry. 
Then I was like, I don’t want to be sad, Let’s do mdma, so I did, and I felt great, so I did mdma and some lsd for about two weeks almost every day, and then my body gave up, I crashed because I wasn’t really sleeping or eating, I was basically high doing music all the time. I was sober for like most of lockdown after that. So like 3 weeks. And one of my friends got sick so we couldn’t do anything ( I live alone and work from home so I do social distance but I do occasionally meet my best friend) well the worry for her and my sadness came back together, and i started doing cocain. Well now I’m using cocain pretty much every day.. and drinking. I probably blew 1k up my nose by now. Which is stupid af, I feel so bad about it, and this feeling makes me want to use even more, I didn’t eat in 6 days because all my money goes on drugs, I look horrible, I’ve lost like 30 pounds, I look like a panda. Like my eyes are black. 
I don’t know I think I could stop but I’m afraid to try. I forgot how sober feels like. Fuck man. Sorry for rambling I hope you are doing ok"

1103,I can't talk to my counselor about this,"Hello I am new here,
I've been lying to my councillor.

She asks each week if I am okay and I always say yes.
I am not.
I strangle myself to punish myself when I do something wrong, not enough to become unconcious just so I can hear my heart beat and my vision starts to blur.
The three dog scars on my arm, not my dog, the first time I self harmed with blunt scissors.
I self harm a lot, too much not just cutting
I already mentioned stranglation
I never sleep, I can't not after some shit that happened, I'm scared of sleep, I'm scared of being late, I'm scared or running.
Nobody believed me about past stuff so why would they believe me now?
My counselor will think I'm lying anyway
Why are my arms so hairy? asks a girl at school, you won't believe me, 
What's with the dark circles, raccoon,? That you will never know.
Wanna know why I avoid people, I'm fucking scared of them, I don't do it because I'm Goth or whatever.
Wanna know why I clam up when walking past people, same reason.

I don't care about myself, I hate myself, why do I exist, this has been going on for over a year it all went wrong in February 2019 but that's another story.
Why do I watch too much TV and okay too many video games, to escape from life I guess.

Almost commited suicide multiple times, never done it though, I think about it a lot though,
Stop being edgy, I'm not 
Stop pretending grow up, I'm 16 stop
Stop being weird, no thanks easier said then done
Just be normal, what's normal?
Come and hang out with the family, no thanks I'd rather kill some computer generated Monsters
Stop staying in your room so much, well I don't feel safe downstairs
Stop being so paranoid nothing is going to happen, but stuff does happen????

I guess what I'm trying to say, is I can handle it myself, people have it way worse than me, they need help not me, I'm just being a little depressed and I'll get over it, I mean people are depressed for over 1 year and a half right?
I don't need to worry
But I need some advice, should I tell my counselor that I really don't need because everyone is depressed at some point, I'm probably not even depressed just sad or looking for an excuse to blame my ridiculous gaming habits on or something?

Please ignore I just needed to rant at 01:17am

1107,I'm so starved for love I don't feel like a legitimate person with a place in the world,"This void in me started young when my addict father left and my mother just couldn't take care of me. I went through my kid and teen years in survival mode caring and looking after myself. By some miracles I worked constantly and made my way through college, still without receiving the love I needed but taking comfort in a few close friendships and hope for the future. Some things along the way made me stumble majorly, a devastating first heartbreak, financial hardships, a violent assault that set me on an expensive and time consuming healing process. After that a string of romantic rejections that have me feeling disgusting despite people's reassurances and truly at a loss.

I try to fill this hole with self compassion, my passions, hope, god, non-romantic connections, all that stuff. But when I feel into it it's just as vast and empty as it's always been. I've poured myself into work, healing, therapy, finding positivity in bleak situations, trying to make a steady life for myself, being the best friend and kindest person I can be. And all that's been up to me and me only, to hold myself up and keep going. And I'm just sitting here at 22 looking at it all and seeing how no matter how hard I've tried, these things I accomplish and live for don't touch that void.

At times I've nearly been able to accept that I just might be a valuable person deserving of stability, love, and happiness but the reality of things makes that seem so illogical and silly. Being a kid was dark and scary but I still never anticipated that I'd be here as an adult just as unloved as I was then. I'd give anything to know what the love and stability other people feel from their families and partners is like, just for a day. What it's like to not think about if death would be better. I'm still in the fight, friends and coworkers etc don't fully know that this is what goes on in me because I seem like an optimist and peaceful person. I just get scared thinking about how many more years I can keep this up without getting a taste of what I've been missing all these years. I just needed to get this out in some form."

Its so bad I almost crashed the other day. Obviously that's the last thing I want. I haven't told my family yet. I'm terrified of what my father will think. (Yes I'm an adult) he's so judging with everything. I'm afraid he will never talk to me again. I know this is more of a rant but I trust this community and I had to get it out. Thanks."

1115,My mind violently rebels against my attempts at focusing on important things,"I'm 23 years old and i've been trying to teach myself skills so that I can get a white collar job and get out of my home state.

I have been learning Spanish and front-end web development for several months now, and for the first few I was so excited with the progress I was making. I learned new things every day. Now, it takes everything I have to FORCE myself to do the bare minimum in Spanish each day. I haven't done any web development in a month. 

Whenever I sit down and open Atom and start trying to think, my mind freaks out on me. It feels like it's constantly buzzing around, looking for anything, ANYTHING, else to do. If I press it, it becomes unbearable. I'll suddenly realize i've spent the past half hour staring at my ceiling, and hate myself for wasting so much time. But I just can  not  focus.

This kind of feeling extends to just about everything that isn't new to me. My most loved new video games will become completely dis-interesting after a week or two. Book series, tv, podcasts, hobbies, everything I like becomes boring and pointless and I start to hate the very idea of focusing on it.

Weekends off work are the worst times. I have the buzzing feeling almost nonstop, aware I need to be doing SOMETHING with my time but being sick at the very idea of trying to do anything. Staring at walls and fidgeting for hours is the easiest thing I can do.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to be a manual laborer stuck in a little podunk town in the southern states forever."

1118,Finally going to therapy!,"Sorry! On mobile. 

TW: suicide 

Three years ago I was at my lowest point, I attempted suicide and was put on a 5150 hold. For a really long time I was ashamed and boy, did my dad make me feel it. My family holds a huge stigma on mental health and some things they believed carried on to me for a time. I was scared to go to therapy and I didn’t wanna tell some stranger the deepest parts of me.  

Well three years have passed, and I have finally decided to go to therapy. Although it is long overdue, I am definitely proud of myself for making this decision. This year I left a toxic relationship and I’m finally taking the steps to take care of myself. I’m looking forward to understanding myself better and hopefully becoming the best version of myself :)"
1119,I've began looking up suicide methods and I dont really know what to do about that.,"I'll start off by saying I'm pretty sure I'm not suicidal. I've just felt the urge to know, if I ever DID want to, what i would do. 

My mental health has never been great. I dont remember a time in my life where I was mentally healthy, which tbh is expected for someone with my backround. I've always hated myself, I've always felt inadequate, I've never had anyone I felt I could talk to. Honestly I thought I'd gotten over it till quarinteen started. 

I havent so much as touched anyone, even like a pat on the shoulder, in months. Before, the thought of human contact made my skin crawl. I hadn't hugged my parents in 6 years and I'm still too young to move out. But now I feel like I'm missing something, even though i still cant stand the idea of touching someone. 

My anxiety has shot through the roof. I spend every waking moment thinking about the school work I'm missing out on. I want to get into a top university, and as someone with a learning disability- I know I wont be wanted there. It's all A* or it's not happening and I was on track before quarinteen but now??? I havent done work in a month, because every time I try it's like I cant breath.

My relatives are dropping like flies. I never thought my nans alcoholism would catch up to her for some reason- I didnt even really like her- but now she has weeks left and I dont know how to feel. 

I'm sick of listening to my mum screaming. She has PTSD, I know she cant help it. But I hate existing when it happens. 

I hate living with my brother. Hes acting nice now, but he's done that before. He still refuses to apologise for the times he'd trigger public panick attacks for his own amusement- so he and his friends, hell and my friends too, could watch and laugh. I hate that I have to play buddy buddy with him. I hate that I like his personality when he isnt trying to make me feel like shit. I hate that he used to threaten me and try to smash my door down and now I cant even leave the house to get away from him. How am I being hard on him? I hate living like this.

I tried to call my doctor. I hate those fucking vultures, all they've ever done is call me a liar and make my family suffer. I havent been in years. I wanted to put a name to what was going on with me so everyone would leave me alone about it. But I couldnt go through with it.

I can barely work up the energy to shower or brush my teeth anymore. I feel disgusting.

And then a couple days ago. I started researching painless methods of suicide. I researched where I could get the chemicals. I looked at prices and realised i had the money in my account. I fantasised about how people would react, if they'd be relieved or even notice, like suicide wasnt fucking serious. I feel sick knowing that I thought about it like it was some far off dream, when I know that suicide hurts people in the very distant way we know something is true despite never experiencing it.

But I keep thinking about it. 

I dont think i could go through with it. I've never had the balls to do big things like that- most days I cant even go near a spider. That's why I dont think I'm suicidal.

I dont think im suicidal, but I cant stop thinking about it. 

I think about it in the same compulsive way I think about school work. I cant get it out of my head.

I keep thinking about the time my dad called suicidal people selfish. Me and my mum had a go at him for it, but I cant stop thinking about it.

I dont even know why I researched it. But I did. I dont know what to do anymore. 

I cant trust my doctors. I cant talk to my family. I cant put this shit on my friends when they cant help me- that would be fucking cruel. I dont know what to do. 

I hate living like this. I hate this. I got sick before quarinteen started, but couldnt get tested for covid because of where I lived. I spent the whole time wondering what would happen if i never woke up.

I dont know what to do"

1124,Dependent on being in a relationship and falling in and out of a depression,"This is probably going to be a bunch of word vomit that'll make no sense. I just got broken up with for the second time in a year. The first break up fucked me up for months. Fell into a deep depression and cried every night and had panic attacks through out the day. Eventually I picked up the pieces, got a job, tried socializing and tried dating again. Every guy I would talk to was so sweet at first but as soon as they didn't get nudes or sex they showed their true colors. It was wearing me down and I was getting more desperate for a relationship. All that I wanted was someone who I could talk to and trust, who I could hangout with and be comfortable with. Eventually I found a guy, we started dating and it was perfect. I finally felt happy and at peace for the time we were together. It felt like a weight was off of my chest. And after only a month we broke up. Its a long story but essentially he has to move and both of us agreed that we can't do long distance. This happened last night and I feel like I'm already falling back into my depression. Everything feels gray. I have no real friends to talk to about this, only my mom who is getting tired of me talking about how I feel. Im dreading the thought of going to my room by myself because I know I'll only cry for hours. I feel so lonely and helpless. I just want to stop hurting so much"

1126,Does anyone else use tens units on their head?,"I started looking into electro-convulsive therapy  and the benefits from it. I’ve been burned by bipolar meds after being on them for over half of my life, I rather get shocked repeatedly than go through all the bizarre and scary side effects I’ve had on psych meds. ECT is expensive so I decided to experiment (it’s my funeral). I stick the tens pads on the corners of my forehead or target the Broca’s area, I noticed it to relieve anxiety, even to the point of me falling asleep. I did not feel dramatically different the next day but I realized I usually do have more clarity and less mental fatigue."
1127,Does this make sense or am I just distracting myself?,"Context: I've always had a pretty shitty relationship with my parents and that has caused me to struggle with my mental health (and some physical issues steaming from it) pretty much forever.
By 14 I knew that I wanted them out of my life (since I  knew they wouldn't change) and then I kinda made a life plan for myself.
I planned on studying a lot, getting into a good university, getting a job and financially independent (at the time I also wanted to move abroad after university but that doesn't seem to be a possibility as early as I thought), cutting ties with my parents and now that I, theoretically, would have the time, space and money, I would start therapy to fix my mental health.

I'm not 14 anymore.

I just turned 21 and so far, my plan has gone pretty good. I've worked my ass off and I still do to try to get a good job after university but the whole ""I would have the time, space and money"" thing doesn't seem as likely.
I now know what a time commitment is required to get any of the jobs I could/want to get and money won't be that great for awhile (unemployment rates are and have been high for awhile, so salaries aren't  great) and while working I would have to pursue and study for other professional certifications.

So do you think that my whole plan has a chance to somewhat work out or has this whole thing been an elaborate distraction that I created for myself?

My mental health has been pretty bad my entire life but I have always been ""high functioning"", in the sense that to the outside world I seem to be doing great in life and noone knows how bad it's been (depression,  anxiety, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts)."
1128,"I.... I need help. I am willing to admit that I have a problem. For the longest time, I've been reading erotica content where one of the subjects is...underage. majorly underage. I dont think I'm a pedophile. It's just lolita/o. The content is implausible. And I don't read violent stories but. .","Those are just excuses, rationalizations for aberrant self pleasure practices. I DO NOT SEEK VISUAL KIDDIE PORN. Mostly because im terrified I will be aroused. And because of the legal hazard. I KNOW raping a minor is wrong. I'm not even remotely attracted to any of the kids I see around me. They piss me off, they scare me, I practically loath kids because that is one of the ways I do to not develop my fetish/illness enjoyment of erotica with underage kids into a full on pedophilia. I feel so alone sometimes. I don't even want to have kids given this aberration. There were a few times where innocent touch contact with kids would turn me on. And that clued me in to this dangerous. It's just that alone, in my room at night. Every time without fail. I would try to masturbate to regular porn. And it just doesn't cut it. Unless I've not been doing for a while. So I search just just three words that are not that flaggable. Dirty sex stories. And I would land on a compendium of Spanish language erotica stories. Many adult themed. But a good number about minors.
How did this get started? I was, abused (sort of, it's a fuzzy memory) as a kid. And one day I found a story that was basically what I remembered happened to me. More or less. And I read the entire thing. It was from the childs POV so I was not that worried about it. It felt, empowering. A mixture of adult sexual lust, seizing an old memory of something that was painful. and sort of taking control of the memory in my imagination. I was no longer a hapless victim, but a person enjoying it. At the time I found it weird but what the hell you take the good with the bad. And it helped me unpack My sexual trauma just a bit better. The years went by, I was on a heavy cocktail of anti depressants and anti-anxiety pills. And My dad's suicide basically shut off my ability to enjoy masturbation. Weak orgasms. Inability to stay up. And so on made it difficult to find sexual pleasure. It was the dirty tabboo porn that made me orgasm. Brother on sister. Dad and daughter. Dad and son. Son and mother. You know weird shit like that. At one point the website where my favorite story was posted. The one where I related to the victim got taken down. When Incest porn became boring I looked for other taboo porn. A three year affair ended up making me more lenient with what I allowed myself to read. My 14 year old cousin moved to my city. And without realizing it I was hitting on him. I was attracted to his youthful body and so on. So I could be a pedo/ehebophile. The kid sort of got the vibe and thank God he put distance from me. So that is the background. It's horrible, illegal, wrong, disgusting. But it's the only thing that gets me off. On a intellectual level I want to stop, I know I should. I feel self loathing. Alone. Disgusted at myself. But I can't stop...on a primal level, the need to get aroused. To enjoy my orgasms make me continue reading this. I try to keep the damage to a minimum. Don't seek out kiddie porn. Don't encourage trade of erotica content. And maintain a safe distance from minors. 
I don't think I could ever do what I read in the stories. It's honestly not plausible. The stories bend reality in an a cruel stupid way.  The kids only feel pleasure. They act like grown sexually developed person's. The scenarios are stupid. Hence why I said Lolita/o on my title. It's a fantasy that I can never translate to reality and that is why I have a difficult time stopping myself from reading this. 
Are there any other former sexual abuse victims that have experienced something similar? Am I alone? Is there a way to stop?"

You  can’t just use the ER as a safe space, you know?”

1134,I dont know what to do anymore.,"So, first off. The last 6 years, I’ve been told that I’m quite stupid for feeling this way for my reasons, and I can see why people say that. So, I’ve been afraid to seek help because of it. 
But, I really don’t know what to do anymore. 
I’ve been in love for 6 years, and best friends with this person for that time. We dated in highschool and holy, I was over the moon. Happiest I’ve ever been. Then things fell apart and I moved away. Half a year ago, I returned to my hometown and continued being good friends with this person. 
They know how I feel, and told me they were attracted to me. We were affectionate for a bit and now it’s sort of fallen off. They have a lot of other things going on, so I get they’re a bit occupied. 
But I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I don’t want to take care of myself. Each day I am riddled with anxiety wondering about everything. 

I don’t know if I should forget it all and move on, or continue pursuing this person in hopes that one day I can feel happy again. 
I’ve tried many things. I went to college, started a career, and have been quite successful. But none of it matters to me. 

I’m sorry if this sounds ridiculous. But I’m lost. I have nobody but her. So when I need to talk about things pertaining to her, it gets a bit complicated.

1135,Have I Been Having Auditory Hallucinations?,"Very frequently, I will hear noises in my head.

A few that I've had before have been the clicking of a pen, sounds of cats meowing, and song lyrics. By far, the one I get the most is just screaming. The voices I hear screaming never say anything and I never feel like something is trying to communicate with me. It's just like on TV or in movies when they try to show what Hell is like; dozens of voices crying out in a horrible, tortured agony.  
It started in my earlier high school years, and I've always assumed it was just a product of having an overactive mind or a way of creating background noise when pure silence would make me too uncomfortable. Although, in retrospect, it may have been a stress response. I was being treated for cancer the years before high school, so I went almost straight from doing no work at all to full days of school with several honors and AP classes. In my Junior year, my course load was especially heavy and I decided to prioritize school over my health, depriving myself of sleep to have more time for studying and regularly dividing maybe 2 or 3 days of sleep across an entire week.  
Strange enough, I liked the noises. They filled the silence and when I was bored or understimulated, I would often find myself trying to start them on purpose. But it's been a few years now-- I turn 19 in a couple of weeks-- and sometimes the screaming will fill my whole head so loud that I can't focus or sleep. Often I can make it go away by trying to fill my consciousness with so many other distractions that I forget about it, but sometimes not. Do these sound like hallucinations? If I normally can control it well enough on my own, should I try and seek help?  
For context, I am already clinically diagnosed with GAD, OCD, chronic depression, and Tourette's Syndrome. No one in my family has any diagnoses, but I can't imagine any of them ever seeking treatment, and I suspect a great number of my relatives suffer from BPD."
1136,My OCD is paralyzing me.,"I am 18 years old now, and I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety when I was in middle school. I used to see a psychiatrist and was medicated, but my parents are not big believers in mental issues or therapy, so once my tics got better (or maybe just less noticeable), they stopped taking me and stopped paying for doctor visits and my prescription.

By now, most of the time, I've learned to work around my OCD. It does affect me on a daily basis and there are things I feel like I have to do, usually in certain numbers or a certain amount of times until it feels right (for example I felt like I had to title this post with 5 words, I have to touch / step on everything I touch / step on with both hands or both feet, etc.) Usually stupid, little stuff like that.

I have never been able to have sex with any of the guys I've dated, even in a multiple year long, very trusting relationship, because I have an intense fear or getting pregnant and ruining my life. Idk if that has to do with my OCD or not.

About 6 weeks ago, I got myself into a situation where there is a risk for pregnancy, although there was no intercourse. Of course, I immediately thought I was certainly going to get pregnant from this, especially because I was not on birth control. I took plan B a few days later and even booked a $1000 emergency IUD insertion as emergency contraception, but my mom convinced me it was not worth it for the small risk at hand, so I cancelled it and did not go (I had IMMEDIATE REGRET).

My period is now WEEKS late and I have been having sooo many pregnancy symptoms, which doc and everyone else suggest may be due to the insane amount of hormones I put into my body with the plan B, and I started on a hormonal birth control pill a few weeks after the incident. I cannot listen to reason, and everything going on with my body I take to be a sure sign of pregnancy.

I have had probably 20 home pregnancy tests in the past month, all negative. I had a negative blood test at the gynecologist. I even went to another doctor and had a high sensitivity urine test and an ultrasound that showed nothing in my uterus 5 weeks after the incident.

The guy isn't in the picture anymore because he thinks I'm crazy for thinking there's even a possibility after so many negative tests, and yeah that is honestly understandable. I have spent hundreds of dollars of both mine and my parents' money trying to reassure myself, and clearly, nothing works because I am still sure I am pregnant, and don't believe any of the tests. And I'm really not dumb, I realize how absolutely ridiculous I sound.

This is consuming my life. This is my last summer before I go to college, and I need to be getting ready to go, but I can't stop thinking about the potential of pregnancy for one second to think about preparing. All I do is work, and even when I'm not and do try to do something like hang out with friends, this is all I think about, and I always am doing tics, because if I don't, I will surely be pregnant.

Idk for sure what my purpose of posting this is. Can anyone give me some advice to stop overthinking and completely obsessing over this? Or maybe someone can relate to this in a way, idk. I just cannot take this feeling anymore. I want my life back."
1137,Coming out on the other side- I've forgotten what it was like,"Between the ages of 14-22, I went through a long long spell. I remember my life - very isolated, no social support, extremely lonely, pessimist, nihilist, outcast, insomniac, no appetite, lack of interest, waiting for the day to end and looking for life to be over. 
Then, life changed for the better. Sure i have other problems now. But the above mentioned problems just vanished. And now I'm left feeling like an imposter in the mental health community. I don't even remember what those days felt like. I remember what i went through, but I can't relate anymore. Almost felt cheated because they took away all of my youth and teenage years.

Anyone else? Can someone throw some light on this?"
1138,Medication,"If you have a mental illness and while you struggle to do so are capable of keeping a relatively normal life going without medication would you still seek medication, and for those that have how has it significantly affected you. I previously opted out of it but am now considering going back to therapy to get it. I’m capable of keeping a job and living on my own and keeping my very close relationships but it is not particularly easy."
1139,Why does talking about emotional memories make me cry?,"I've done a lot of mental and emotional work to heal from various traumas and painful events in my life. There are things that I consider healed or mostly so because they don't trigger me anymore. I can see mementos, hear certain songs, be in certain spaces, interact with certain people and feel okay, feel at peace with. But when I verbally tell someone the story I end up crying. It always makes me feel bad because I know that I've dealt with it, I've put it behind me, and I'm healed. It's only verbal, if I'm texting it or writing it out I don't have the same reaction.

What helps with this? I want to be able to talk about the hard stuff with some composure."
1140,TW// domestic violence &amp; abuse HELP ME,"I’m looking for help for my sister. She is 16 and I’m 21. Our parents are shitty so I am her legal guardian. We went through a lot as kids, moving constantly and having our parents beat on each other and us, and she was sexually assaulted by a family member. 

I recently convinced her to go to therapy. She’s been to 3 sessions so far and it seems as if it’s helping, but I want to know what I** can do. I hate just putting everything on the counselor. 

How can I support her? How can I make this easier for her? Everything is bottled up and she refuses to let it out until it gets to suicide threats. I don’t know what to do besides ask for advice on here. No one I know has experienced anything like this. Her attitude towards me is awful 90% of the time and I’m trying to be encouraging to her and positive, but it’s hard when she is coming at me constantly. What do I do? Let her take it out on me? I’ve suggested hobbies and sports when school starts back, but she just brushes everything off as if she doesn’t care."

I cry a lot, which gives me very very bad migraines, which ruins my mood because I can't do anything, and I cry and I get migraines........
I don't have anything that bad going on in my life, I'm just very stressed lately. Lots of little things piling up and I can't deal with that anymore. I'm becoming very very anxious and I feel helpless. I don't want to talk to my mom about that because my stepfather recovered from really bad depression lately, and it was extremely hard for her. I don't want to talk to my boyfriend about that either, because I feel like I've been complaining a lot to him lately. 
Today when I was on a bike ride with my sister I suddenly just wanted to close my eyes and do nothing. I'm not suicidal, at least I don't think I am. I really don't want to die. But not as much as before. 
Most of my thoughts are negative. Like what if my boyfriend doesn't love me anymore, or what if my puppy falls down the stairs while I'm gone and gets hurt. 
After today's bike ride I was anxious about not giving my sister enough attention because I was so occupied with my negative thoughts..........
I hate being in this state so fucking much"

1145,Almost-Relationship but Should i call it quit? (Bad mental health),"
Hello all,

Ive been talking to this girl for 6 months. Its not a relationship so far because we’re talking long distance and we both agreed to meet before deciding what to do. Unfortunately covid happened and I couldn’t travel. I can’t travel for sometime. Her moving here to be with me (immigration) or i going there isn’t really an issue.

The real issue is something I’ve been hiding from her and tbh from everyone (family, friends etc). I have been in a weird headspace for almost a year now. Im in the process of signing up for therapy and basically just get help because im tired. I almost feel suicidal (too scared to do anything) and ive kept this away from her, my family and friends. But im at a breaking point, where im just done. Until few months ago, i was pretty happy talking to her until i was just wasn’t. I’m not expressive anymore, I sometimes tend to ignore her texts and calls too.

She’s perfect and she’s just amazing. But something just doesn’t click in me anymore. I’m in constant fear of ruining everything for her, and for everyone i know. I just dont know what to do anymore.

Part of me wants to stay put, and just hope everything will be okay and I’ll fall in love again. But there is another part in me, who wants me to come clean, let her know of my mental health and basically to not take her on a journey where im just dealing with issues. Part of me wants to let go because she deserves someone who’s right in the head.

The only thing that makes sense in my life is my job. But i managed to somehow convinced myself to reach out for therapy and man it took a lot of strength. 

What should i do?"

1150,Coping mechanisms for self harm,"***TRIGGER WARNING***
Self harm, suicidal tendencies, rape, coercion

I have been having a tough time dealing with everything lately. 

Background: 19yo Female, diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ptsd. 

I’ve been showing signs of depression since I was seven years old. I am still living in my abusive parents household. I flunked out of college after being forced to  go back to school by my parents and manipulated when I was not ready. I came off of some medication (ability) last September due to a conflict of medication that I needed for wisdom teeth removal surgery, realized my friends all were manipulative assholes and I cut them off. I’ve been threatened, stalked, my room in my parents house has been broken into numerous times, and I’m scared for my life. I got a job to afford health insurance that is free as long as I make $13,000 this year and because of the global pandemic I’ve not even made half that. I got a 30% pay cut, was moved to another position that works night shift, and my mental state that was stable has come crashing down. I’m trying to find another job, trying to make enough money to leave my abusive household, all this stress is causing my ptsd to go crazy to the point I can’t tell who to trust or not, there’s times that I’ll be laying in bed with my extremely loving and supportive boyfriend and think that he is one of my past abusers and start having panic attacks. My job requires me to work from 11pm to 7am alone. I am the only employee here and I’m terrified every night. I was raped at work at a previous job and I cannot even leave the office without fearing for my life. Today I had a complete breakdown sobbing uncontrollably at my boyfriends house over something little that just happened to be the last straw for me holding it together. I started shaking uncontrollably and couldn’t reason at all while sobbing. When I get upset I am physically unable to speak and my throat completely tightens. I couldn’t stop thinking about burning myself and was barely able to ask my boyfriend to get any knives out of his room immediately before continuing to sob uncontrollably. I began cutting in the seventh grade and attempted to slit my wrists in 11th grade and was involuntarily admitted for 5 days in the ER waiting for a bed in the psychiatric facility and 9 days in facility after that. I feel so useless, I feel so scared and sad and lonely. The only support I have is my boyfriend and a friend that I have known forever it only started talking to regularly during the pandemic in a desperate attempt to make friends after I lost mine."
1151,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I feel like I am very sick and I don't know what to do.

Background: depression and anxiety from childhood (no trauma/trigger), PTSD (sexual trauma) diagnosed around 12 but didn't flare up until 20, Autism and ARFID diagnoses at 21 (now). Hospitalizations at 17 (in ward) and 19 (released without ward time) both from self inflicted wounds.

Severe history of escapist tendencies never acknowledged. Attempting to avoid becoming Selectively Mute. Never learned life skills normal adults should have and can't hold down a full time job.

Lately I sleep well into the afternoons just so I can dream longer about people and situations that I cherish but don't exist. I cry so much when I'm awake. I have one meal a day. I too often wish that if I can bring myself to die, I'd be able to start over.

My partner is aware of my medical history but I don't know how to talk about the ""new"" stuff."
1152,when would talking to yourself be considered concerning?,i was just curious about this bc of personal experiences
1153,TW/I really want to starve myself,"I hate how big I am. I'm tall and everything on me is big. I want clothes to be too big for me, I want my bones to stick out, I like feeling hungry and light, I like my stomach being small, I know that there are healthy ways to lose weight but I can't stop thinking about how if I stopped eating it'd be so much easier."
1154,My friend who used to be the chillest guy ever is suddenly very sad and says he is going insane,"My friend (18M) used to be a pretty chill guy and we would talk about things and nothing ever would have made me believe he would be in this condition. We have been in lockdown for about 4 months and he says he might have HOCD. He knows he is not homosexual but he is getting such thoughts. Maybe he just dont want to be homosexual but it's driving him insane and he gets sad af and thinks his future is ruined. And that his life is ruined because of it. 

I keep trying to assure him that it is because of the quarantine that we have been in but he keeps repeating that he is going mad. 

What should I say or do to try to help him? He knows I am always there for him but somehow nothing is helping me and I am witnessing my friend's mental health deterioating. 

Please suggest how I can help him or he can help himself."
1155,hello.,hi! I’m a 15 year old girl with a depression disorder and some anxiety. I didn’t know where to go so I came here. recently I’ve been having reoccurring thoughts about my ex. we used to have sex often but there was one or two instances where he didn’t stop and continued to have sex . I begged him and started crying but he still didn’t stop. I don’t know why he didn’t but maybe it was because he couldn’t see me ? I feel uncomfortable calling him my rapist because I think that’s a heavy word. but sometimes certain words trigger me. he was my first and I thought he really loved me. but he would show me his cuts and threaten to kill himself all the time and I would have to talk him down. though the point of this was to ask... I don’t know if I really have trauma or if I’m just being sensitive I mean a lot of people have it worst. I just can’t seem to stop crying whenever a few words are mentioned. I feel sick.
1156,Something that makes me feel a little more comfortable..,"Realized today.. I feel kinda behind.
You can turn off the green bubble for both facebook and messanger.. 

You wont be able to see other people online or not.. But then when in bouts of depression its possible to just scroll.

And sometimes others dont need to see whether you're on or not 💁"
1157,I get way too emotional at any kind of death,"Like even running over a ladybug with the lawnmower makes me way too sad. I love fishing but it’s really hard for me to kill anything I catch. I’m fine eating a piece of meat or fish, but actually killing an animal nearly brings me to tears. I really don’t want to be like this but I can’t control. Is there a name for this, and if so, how can I treat it?"
1158,Mom thought she saw a ghost last night,My mother last night while sleeping screamed. She didnt tell me why tho. She just told me now why. She said she saw a ghost in the mirror staring. She said she didnt know this person. I am really scared now to go to sleep. Especially since i sleep in the attic. Please help me sort this out and help calm me.
1159,"A girl in my social media posts some stuff that scream body disphoria and a possible eating disorder, what can I do to help?","She's already thin and she shares skinny girls or surgery stuff saying ""I would kill to have a body like this."" Repeatedly. 

And the people commenting ""so would I"" instead of just worrying about her make me sad. 

The answer is probably talking to her and recommending she sees a therapist, but I've never talked to her before."
1160,Throwing things makes me feel better and I don’t like it,"I’ve been uncontrollably angry since I got out of an abusive relationship. I would “ see red” and break shit and felt better after. It’s manifested worse now and I have two holes in the wall. I get angry at the slightest thing and rn things just aren’t going well for me so I am just breaking whatever. 
It’s not like I like it- I can’t seem to control being this angry . I just- get angry and just “see red” it’s like o black out.

I can’t keep going on like this and idk what to do. I’m co soldering turning myself in to the hospital or something but idk.

I’m tired I’m like this...

I guess if there’s a better way to explain this- whoever watched Steven universe- remember when he was basically going all insane due to his trauma? It’s basically like that and I feel like I’m going out of control. I hope that explains it sorry if it’s blunt but Im in a very limited headspace rn 

I’m just going out of control and it feels like more and more everyday as shit gets worse I am getting worse.

I need help"
1161,Please Help,0
1162,Having trouble not sure how to get help or if im over exaggerating,"Okay so I (23f) am kinda new to this whole thing so I’m really sorry if I make a mistake or something. 

Uhm so basically for the past couple years I e been really having a hard time like focusing or even like doing simple tasks like I’ll be doing something important and in the middle of me doing this action I’ll like end up either like drifting off in a day dream or just like drift off completely and when I come back I don’t remember anything I’ve been doing.

Like with driving for instance I’m so scared to get behind a wheel cause i end up day dreaming like a lot and sometimes I don’t even realize I’m day dreaming until it’s too late and I’m scared what if this like happens when I’m driving or something? And the past year or two I think? I’ve been forgetting like a lot even if it’s something I just talked about with someone I’ll forget and repeat myself, or even during the middle of a sentence I’ll forget my train a thought and will completely forget what I was even saying and this happens regularly. 

And then lately I’m not sure if it’s because everything that’s going on I’m just so paranoid, like scared of everything for no reason and it’s starting to get really overwhelming for me and honestly I want to get help. I’m just not sure if these are reasons to get help? Or is this just kinda what people just go through? And if I was to get help how would I go about it? 

Also sorry if everything is like jumbled but I was trying to type this out before I would forget what I was typing halfway through."

1164,I had to chose between my family and my current boyfriend which lead to breaking my ankle.,"I don’t have a reddit account, so I’m typing this out on my bf’s account. He recommended it to tell our story and to let me vent about it. I am 19F. He is 25M.

TLDR: my family gave me the choice of being with them or my current boyfriend and I chose him. Choosing him lead to me breaking my ankle on a chicken wire fence and a no contact order on them, as well as harassment charges and possible slander.

STORY: This all started when I was living with my boyfriend. My mom who is 39, started brainwashing me and manipulating me into moving back home for college. As to which I did, during the moving out process she talked shit on my boyfriends name along with a bunch of lies and bullshit about our relationship which she also told the rest of our family to make them not like him anymore. So a few days go by and she started inviting my ex over to hang out because she wanted him and I to get together. I told my boyfriend this so he was well aware of the situation along with wanting him to pick me up. He pulled up and parked in the road not even on property or even close to it. My ex yelled at my mom saying how he was here to get me. While I was trying to leave my mom kept putting her hands on me while not allowing me to leave the house until I finally broke free and ran outside to my boyfriends car. Where my mom followed screaming at us to get off her property and how we aren’t allowed on the street and all that. She then went and got my dad to come outside as to which he threatened to kill us both and for me to never come back. I went in the house to make sure he couldn’t get any weapons and my boyfriend drove off to the local police station to have them come out to “get his stuff”. My best friend then came over to get me and a bag of clothes for a week then took me over to his house. I then stayed there for the night because I felt unsafe at my parents. The next day I went home because my mom wanted to go to the beach and my ex wanted me to sign papers for a no contact order. As to which I refused to sign because I wanted to take him to court (abuse and rape when I moved back in, that my mom didn’t believe me about). Later that day my family and I went to the beach and my mom invited my ex to meet us there. Well right as we were leaving my mom started screaming at me which lead to my ex to offer me a ride back to their house so I wouldn’t be screamed at the whole hour ride home. Well I passed out in his car which lead to him going through my phone and him taking a video of me sleeping saying he fucked me and shit then sent it to my boyfriend. I woke up 40 min after being parked in the road at my parents. I walk in and my mom is going off on me so I went to my neighbors house and got changed there while texting my boyfriend to meet me down the street to pick me up to get me away from her. I eventually went back to my parents to eat and I went out back to leave but my ex wanted to fight him so I tried to stop him and he threw me to the ground and walked out front to get my dad. I ran after to make sure my mom wasn’t gonna go back there also. Well she tried to pull me back into the house along with hitting me and pulling my hair. I eventually broke free and ran for my life through the back yard. I went to jump her make shift chicken wire fence and when I landed over it I completely shattered my ankle and had to put it back in place until cops and EMS should up. My mother then continued to try to take my phone from me and accused me of lying and faking my injury. Police forced her away from me while EMS got me in a air cast and in the ambulance. I got transported to ER where I had a team of nurses and doctors come in to get a total of 34 xrays along with two numbing injections into my ankle before the reset. The numbing did not start working until after they reset my ankle. And mind y’all while this is all going on my family never came to visit me I had to do this all with my boyfriend. After the doctor reset my ankle I got a 15-20 pound splint on. Along with percs as my pain prescription, they do absolutely nothing for me. I had to go back to the ER yesterday due to pain and the splint being too tight. Which leads me to right now, back in the ER with the same issues but much worse and my family wants nothing to do with me and blocked me on everything and I cannot go get my stuff. After all of this happened, they tried to blame me and say it was my fault, then blame him with the same thing."

1166,"My mother does not believe in mental illness, but I suspect I may be bipolar","I live in Alberta Canada, I'm 23F and I've been suspecting for a while that I may be bipolar and displaying alot of the obvious symptoms. Last year I survived a car crash and was off work for 3 months recovering, and just last May I was diagnosed with cancer, chemo put me in remission, but I lost all of my hair and alot of my sanity. I never got counseling for either of these situations because I felt I was weak and pathetic if I did. I am now realizing that maybe I've been affected mentally more than I thought, but last time I got counseling for anything my mom freaked out and said she felt betrayed by me seeing a therapist. Bipolar disorder does run in my family which is why I suspect as well. I don't want to anger my mom, but I also don't want to feel like this anymore (I often feel like I don't belong with my family anymore, and I don't want to burden my friends with my presence, and it's affecting my relationship with my boyfriend when I'm constantly switching from depressed to over excited for no reason! I hate feeling like this!)
I guess I'm looking for advice, what would you do or suggest?

TL;dr: I am having symptoms of bipolar disorder and it's negatively affecting my life and relationships, but I don't want to upset my mother who won't take me seriously"

1168,Can't see a therapist. Need help for dealing with undiagnosed mental exhaustion.,"I'm 16F. I've been feeling really mentally exhausted the past week. I'm trying to find a therapist at the moment but it's been a little hard since everyone's unavailable and the hospital system is in complete shambles. I have zero clue if I might be suffering from anything with a name but it might be likely given my past. The issue is that I can't get and counseling or advice from anyone at the moment and it's not like I'm able to take medication so I'm just walking blindly and trying to deal with myself which isn't going well. The truth is I've been feeling incredibly unmotivated for the past couple of years and whatever I've been feeling just multiplied recently into a complete shutdown. I've been feeling depressed (I don't have depression I'm just feeling depressed). I'm not sure how to get myself to do things or be productive or make myself feel better so I wanted to ask anybody with experience with a doctor or just anybody who found things that made them feel better to let me know what might help until I can go see someone. I just feel trapped and I'm so clueless. I used to be able to just get by and do the minimum amount of work but now I can't do anything. The three conditions I'm most afraid of having would be ADHD, Depression, and Bipolar disorder but I won't know for sure if I have any one of these until I'm diagnosed. Even if I don't have anything these are what my symptoms sound the most similar to. Anything is appreciated thanks."

1172,My never ending mental health issues (17M). Any advice would mean the world to me.,"My issues began when I was a sophomore. Around the time I turned 16 years old. There were two things in my life at the time that were upsetting or difficult for me. The first being that I had been injured which prevented me from successfully playing soccer. The second being that I was having difficulties with the social aspects of high school at the time. I couldn’t make friends and I was having trouble keeping the ones I had. I think I blamed it on myself and this turned into depression.

I held my issues inside and my problems got worse. My only relief was video games. When I played I felt like I didn’t have to deal with all the shitty stuff going on. 

I went on like this all the way up until quarantine. I tried to “function” by exercising, socializing, and doing school work hoping that it would help me feel better. It didn’t. My problems continued to developer. 

Over this time I began to lose touch with myself and the world. I don’t really identify with my body any more. I’ve been told I’m “depersonalized.” It’s like I’m not real and nothing else is real it’s just “me” and my thoughts in the void. This has been a very long term problem and I began to notice it pretty quickly after my problems began as a 16 year old if I remember correctly.

I asked my parents for help and they got me to see a therapist and my doctor. The therapy hasn’t helped. My doctor has prescribed two antidepressants and an anti anxiety med and I have noticed no change. 

In my current state I’m not really “living” I’m more “existing.” I spend almost all of my days in my bed on my phone. It has been this way since quarantine began. I feel more connected to myself and overall better when I’m in my cacoon. When I leave and enter the real world I begin to feel an unpleasant emptiness followed by me disconnecting even more from myself and the world than I already am in my cacoon. It’s overall intolerable. It’s like nothing feels good or has any substance and on top of that it doesn’t feel real. There are some other things which I think I over analyze. In the past I’ve been convinced I had BPD which led me to suicidal thoughts. 

I’ve had thoughts of killing myself two times. The first time when I convince myself I had BPD. I fit some of the criteria and I’ve noticed that I’m overly empathetic and horny right now. I’m passed these thoughts, however in the recent few days the thoughts of death have returned because this cycle feels endless and I’m exhausted. I’m losing hope.

However, three days ago I began attending a partial hospitalization program. I hate the group therapy because it makes me feel really fucking disconnected and shitty. Also it’s hard for me to get any use out of it when I feel like I don’t exist. However I’ve been prescribed a new med I don’t remember what it is called but my psychiatrist said it helps bring you back to reality. Also she gave me a benzodiazepine I forget the specific name. She told me that if I keep going in my current state it could turn into psychosis. 

Anyways it’s extremely intolerable to leave my bedroom and I haven’t seen movement in a positive direction in terms of my mental health since my problems began. I’m losing hope and could really use some guidance. Thanks so much for reading if you made it this far. It means the world. :)"
1173,"i think im going insane, and i dont know how to stop it.","to start, im diagnosed with bipolar 2, panic disorder, ptsd, and ocd.

im starting to genuinely believe that nothing is real. my mind is drawing connections between random shit that im sure is supposed to just be a joke and that, or people trying to make an arg, or stuff like that. i partially convince myself theyre signs.

obviously i havent fully lost it. but im not sure at this point. i used to think of it just occasionally, as a ""what if"" scenario, but now i full on am freaking out over the concept of nothing being real. i think about it every day, and i can barely breathe when i do. i dont know what im expecting. comfort from my boyfriend, who is the only person ive really told in depth, helps kinda but in the end all i can think is ""if this isnt real, thats what hed say anyways.""

i dont know what i expect. honestly, it changed from a thought to an obsession when i did my first high dose of shrooms and had a god awful trip. i can go into more detail if itll help someone give advice, but basically i believed that i was a robot in a situation similar to westworld. i dont know what i believe anymore. i dont know how to heal. i dont want to be insane.

i really need advice on how i can fix this. im medicated, on 50 mg of lamictal and ativan. i have a therapist now, but ive only been to one session. i need a way to fix this outside of those, something i can do now. im terrified of everything.

edit: when i google stuff like ""am i real"" or ""is anything real"" all i get is responses like ""who cares, just enjoy life!"" i cant enjoy life, this is terrifying me in everything i do."

He was found In his barracks and has been transferred to a psychiatric ward where we are not allowed to have any contact with him bc of covid not any information or details bc of privacy policies.

I know his world must be different now and I know life must feel more difficult for him. I just want to be able to support and help him get better but I don’t know how I can approach him, or things I should say. I come from a very Mexican traditional family where mental health doesn’t “exist”. He has always been very detached since we were children, and never expressed his emotions so I do not want to overwhelm with emotions since I know it makes him uncomfortable. Today we found his suicide note. In one portion he stated “it feels surreal that I actually went through with this. I dunno, it’s nobody’s fault.... I’m just .... very tired I guess”. please if someone can help me I would appreciate it. I just want to be able to be there for my brother the best I can when he comes back.

1179,I am damaging my mental health by working too hard?,"So I am 25 yo IT professional who earns decent for his age. I always thought i m working too hard but things have gone worse Since lockdown started. I have been on working spree and would work for atleast 12 hours day sometimes it would go as much as 15 and still this wouldn't stop me going to Udemy or coursea to learn some new tech to keep up with everyone. This cut throttling corporate race has made me so reckless that i would work around 90+ hours a week and still try to go and learn new technologies. I am always on course to impress my managers so I can get more projects and could learn more.
I believe this has severely affected my mental and physical health as we all stuck home and working from home. 
I haven't done much in past 3-4 months other than working and learning and I don't wanna stop. I always have that fear in mind of falling behind of my collgues.

1181,I started to feel very little empathy and guilt since puberty. (Paranoid Schizophrenia),[deleted]
1182,i'm scared that i'm developing ocd (long post),"to preface this, i am a 20 year old girl with depression, half-diagnosed adhd, and an unspecified anxiety disorder that has never been properly treated or explained to me. i’m on wellbutrin, adderall, propranolol, and junel fe. 

so last year, my mom died, kind of unexpectedly. she had stage four lung cancer, but had literally JUST been told the day before she died that her condition was improving. she hemmoraged while i was at a dance rehearsal, and my grandpa and sister found her body in the driveway. 

immediately, i felt guilty and started blaming myself for her death. i began blaming it on me not saying i love you that day, or me rushing out of the house too quickly and barely speaking to her, or even the numerous times i had accidentally stepped on a crack (i avoided them because i convinced myself the superstition was real and i gave her bone cancer in her spine from stepping on one). 

anyways, my (already shitty) mental state worsened, i made bad decisions involving medication multiple times, gained weight, then lost weight and am now slightly underweight. to top it all off, my anxiety has gotten worse and i think ive started to develop some compulsions to deal with it. 

because of this, i have obsessively researched ocd and am now convinced that i have it or am developing it. 

for the longest time i can remember, ive had intense intrusive thoughts about my family dying, mainly focused on my mom. well, the intrusive thoughts actually happened, and now they have shifted onto my grandpa (and my little sister kinda). 

when i was younger, about three, i started to bang my head on the wall and avoided staying at my grandpas house (due to a dream about my mom dying while i slept there) to deal with these thoughts. then at nine, i slept on the couch near the front door to stop people from breaking in and killing my family. i also slept with at least seven thick blankets year round so no one could stab me. i then thought people were watching me and would check for hidden cameras and barely slept. 

i don’t remember if i had any of these behaviors during high school, besides nail biting and skin picking. i did begin to obsess over my mental and physical health in sixth grade, and constantly researched illnesses and convinced myself that i had them. this behavior has not stopped and i do it constantly. 

now, i obsess over my grandpa (and my sister) dying. at any moment, i am convinced he is dead or severely injured. about every 5-20 minutes, i text him and ping his phone on find my iphone. if he doesn’t immediately answer, i start to freak out and begin to spam him “hi” over and over, call him, ping him, and sometimes i will drive over there to make sure he’s alive. i do this almost all the time, during work, in the middle of the night, out in public. it never stops. 

i also reassurance seek constantly, and will ask him, my friends, and my sister questions to see if they think i have something wrong with me. sometimes i just tell them to tell me that i’m completely normal. that never helps but i cant stop doing it. 

in the past month, whenever i get anxious or stressed out, i repeatedly count to eight in my head, sometimes out loud if it’s really bad. i do this almost constantly since i’m never relaxed. the past week, i began counting my steps in multiples of eights and started coordinating my actions to fall on one of the numbers. 

even with all of this, there’s a part of me that believes i’m faking everything for attention, or that i don’t have ocd, or anything wrong and that i’m making myself have these thoughts and compulsions. logically, i know this isn’t true (i also know none of my intrusive thoughts are real), but there’s a part of me that is convinced. 

i’m working on finding a competent psychologist to see for these problems, but i’m having trouble (i’m extremely picky and can’t find one i’m 100% fine with). i just need to know that i’m not going crazy or faking anything, and that i actually do need to get help. 

tl;dr: my mothers death seems to have triggered some ocd-like behaviors and worsened anxiety. i’ve had intrusive thoughts my entire life, and have done various compulsions to deal with them. i am now convinced that i have ocd, but also think i am making it up. basically i’m confused and scared."

But she follows me, I’m  wanting to watch my cousin play basketball so I decide “ok, let’s do this then!” And attempt to knock the ball out of her hand thinking that she might stop. Then a bunch of kids start getting up in my face, not the kind that I would care about, the kind that are always in detention thinking, “Hey, Hey, look it me, I’m a rel gangsta aren’t I” if you know what I mean, but it just bothered me because for two days after that, people keep on giving me threats and crap like that.

1190,I made the first step,"I’ve struggled with repressing my emotions for a long time, and naturally they eventually started bubbling back up because of small things, causing me to snap at the slightest disturbance.

Earlier today I punched myself in the head because I lost at board game in a video game, and I was upset with the AI being “too” smart. I felt like breaking things, but didn’t want to, so I took it out on myself. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but for the first time, it really hurt.

Shortly after I went downstairs to say goodnight, and I felt like talking to them about what I did. That’s something I’ve never felt before, and I was scared. After saying goodnight, I went upstairs and thought about what to do. Almost on impulse I just sent a text to my dad, asking to have a serious, uncomfortable conversation, even though I feel like burden when I ask for things. Even help. We had a conversation about it, and it felt good despite the fact that more emotions poured from my face.

If you’re feeling like I did, wanting to talk but not wanting to be a burden, just send a text to someone you trust, once you can’t back out, you’ll be happy you made the step."
1191,Self awareness,"
       For the past month I have jumped some hurtles. I had to cut off my toxic abusive parents after they accused my boyfriend of two years of abusing me. He took me in after they kicked me out, after two months of living with them, after leaving an mentally abusive ex. The only reason I was living with the ex was because they kicked me out of my home with them, at twenty while I was going to college for my nursing degree; and the only reason she mentioned abuse was because I mentioned my younger sister who still lives at home with depression because my parents were being are still abusive. I could not the through to my mother at any respectful angle so I removed myself from that group of people that call themselves my family. I feel like I am finally free to pursue my dreams in the present instead of being stuck in the past with the pain and trauma of being isolated and stunted at every level of development. It wasn't until I had the mental help of my long time boyfriend who encourages me everyday to be better and demand more for myself in life. 


I am so ready to just be happy with not being beaten that I let everyone run all over me. I finally stood up for myself at work because I know I deserve basic respect in the workplace, and will no longer accept less than that. I bought myself a reasonable car that I can feel good driving and don't have to worry about it dying on me. Little by little I'm chipping away at the stresses that keep me from focusing on the future. 

None of this would have happened without the help of licenced mental health specialist that work hard everyday during this hard time. So thank you."
1192,I can't sleep because I feel like I will die if I fall asleep,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this. Basicly what the title said. I'm young and healthy so I don't have a specific reason to worry about dying. But for a couple of months now every time I go to sleep I feel an overwhelming panic that I will die if I fall asleep. Because of this it usually takes over an hour to fall asleep, and it's just a terrible feeling. I have talked to my theraphist about it, but she said that there isn't anything I can do about dying whether i'm asleep or awake. I know that logicly, but every time i go to bed logic goes into the trash, and only the fear is there."

1195,Help - Is this serious?,"(16M) I’ve been feeling very weird lately. I’ve been thinking of the my past and noticed that I used to have delusions, such as “Capgras Delusion” and “The Truman Show Delusion” when I was younger (like 8 or 9 years old). Ten months ago I had “Fregoli Delusion”. I didn’t know that they were delusions up until June (this year). Last year (in March) I experienced auditory hallucinations. I went to a psychologist and I eventually got better. The main reason I had these hallucinations was probably due to stress/anxiety (according to the psychologist). Then they went away. Still, I have a lot of symptoms and I don’t know if this is bad or not:
* I dissociate a lot. If I’m alone, I’m generally dissociating. I’ve had this since I was little (don’t know specifically when). If I’m having a meal with my friends and they’re not talking to me, I dissociate. (It’s like, I go back into my mind and everything gets blurry). I tend to do things without thinking/effort during this time. I don’t sense taste nor smell when I’m dissociating.
* I forget about things I’ve just said/heard. My parents might ask me “What do you want for dinner” and I’ll respond, but I immediately forget what I said and what the question was. 
* If I’m waking alone, or in the backseat of the car, I forget what happened during the journey. I sometimes remember the way I went, but I don’t remember what I was doing/thinking during that time.
* I talk to people that are not real. I imagine as if people were right next to me and my reactions are as if that was actually happen. I don’t see them, but I act as if they were there and as if they were reacting.
* I have a lot of Deja Vu. It’s weird... I do not even know if you can call it Deja Vu or not. It’s like, I got to a place I have never been. For the first minute or so, it seems unfamiliar. However, after that, it seems as I have already been there more than once. 
* Ambivalence. I generally have two or more contrasting ideas. E.g. free-will: one side of me agrees that we have free-will; however, the other doesn’t. 
Now, the part I guess it’s most difficult to explain. I have rapid mood swings. But it’s not just a “mood swing”; it’s like a personality shift. I feel like it’s three different states. It’s not different identities, but three different personalities. I gave them names. We have Mind, Heart and Soul. Mind is selfish, confident and a little bit more out-going. Heart is kinda the opposite: extremely selfless, low self-confidence, feels dependent on others and prefers staying in rather than going to a party. Soul is the mixture of both, the one I’m most of the time. Mind gets nervous with tests/exams and things related to my future career, while Heart gets stressed out in social events. Then we also have lack of empathy: Mind doesn’t have much empathy for others while Heart cares a little bit more. Mind doesn’t feel emotions such as sadness. (Btw, Mind Heart and Soul is like a gradient, and it’s not like “now I’m this, then I’m this”)
I’ve been having headaches and shortness of breath whenever I think of this. 

PS: sometimes when I look in the mirror I’m like “Is this really me?” while other times I’m like “I’m so beautiful!” It’s weird.

I’ve searched online and I show symptoms for schizophrenia (or some “schizo-“ disorder) and/or some sort of dissociative disorder.

If you have some knowledge on this, can you please help? I know I should go to a psychologist but before I do that, I would like to know what people think this is.

Thanks if you read everything!"
1196,No one to talk to,"Introduction to my self entitled vent post

Being a dude I guess, I don't talk about my issues. Hell, for a while I never really thought they were real, I thought they were just a product of my own weakness or whatever shitty excuse I used to keep from telling anyone. Last time I told anyone about my own problems online, it was met with that classic toxic internet who gives a shit attitude, and barely within a paragraph in I'm typing slower than a 120 year old senior citizen with rheumatoid arthritis. But honestly, I shouldn't give a shit, so I guess I won't. Read it or don't, god bless you if you do, don't blame you if you don't. It's my right to vent and your right to scroll right the fuck past and forget this post exists. So here's all the shit I should be complaining about to a therapist but can't because I'm too insecure to just fucking say something. All the shit that my pansy ass would much rather just complain about anonymously to a bunch of strangers who don't care. What the fuck ever dude

Family:

My parents divorced when I was 2. Don't remember it at all. By the time I was 3 my mom had gotten with who is now my stepdad. Barely talk to him and we live in the same house. My dad had a girlfriend and a daughter with her. As far as I understand, this girlfriend had her own issues. She said she was raped when she was young by her older brothers, from what I remember, and she would in one way or another take out her aggression on me, probably because I was a boy. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't abusive, but she seemed hostile, or at the very least resentful of me. She was always stricter towards me 'cause of my gender, and was vocal in her suspicion that since I was a boy, I would not be able to control my 'urges' (My age hadn't even hit double digits yet, Jesus woman..) and that I was a threat to my younger sibling. So it turns out she was really a lesbian. Used my dad for a child, left him, moved to Washington. She'd move back to my state a few years later but soon after I moved to a different state anyways. I got along well with my half sister, and interacted with her regularly up until I moved, I'd guess. I think she's 13 now. Barely spoken to her in 4 years. Last I talked to her she seemed to have picked up that gross weeb e-girl behavior, talking about cat ears and shit. Makes me shudder. I barely speak to my dad anymore either. I love my dad, but he works the railroad back in my old home state and I've only gotten to see him when I've gone to visit a few weeks every summer. Guess that's off this year though, considering the circumstances.

My family on my mom's side are mostly Mormon. Not sure if this contributed, but I'd self identified as an atheist and started acting like some sort of goddamn intellectually superior incel at a young age, and now I barely talk to the Mormon side of my family. These are Utah Mormons, mind you, not so keen on religious diversity. My grandma on my mom's side has some sort of Alzheimer's and barely remembers who I am. Now the old home my recently divorced aunt and uncle dumped her in won't let any of us see her, and we're having to consider having her move in with us two states over, despite us being the least well off household in the entire family.

My grandpa on my dad's side passed away when I was in the second grade. Only family member I'd lost, but his was a particularly traumatic memory for me, and probably the only one I'd defend as being so. My mom picked me up early from school. At first, naturally, I was happy, but my attitude soon changed when I heard my grandpa was about to 'pass'. By the time I got there he was already gone. I loved that guy, and the fact that I never had a chance to say goodbye still fucks me up to this day.

Me:

In elementary school I barely had any friends, still don't. I'd spend my time trying to garner attention by slamming my head on my desk or locker until a teacher intervened. I hit my 'edgy teen' phase 5 years too soon, super weird kid, wore all black, talked about hating my life, the good stuff. When I hit 6th grade I moved schools at least 4 times over the course of the year. Long story short I ended up in online school. This is where I'd hit my ultimate low, I'd guess. This online school was really easy to just pass by like a joke. All the tests were easy to guess multiple choice questions, I just muted my classes and did whatever the hell I wanted. The issue with this was that I stayed isolated inside, in my room, for 3 years. Barely left the house, never showered, basic gross kid stuff like that, but without the constant peer to peer bullying that keeps it in check.

When my mom had finally gotten sick of my shit, I finally gave in and agreed to go to the charter high school conveniently built right next to my house. This school was small. Lots of rejects, freaks and weirdos, the state I moved to is out west but there are rednecks and racists aplenty, you could say it wasn't a very pleasant environment. The only two things keeping me deciding on whether I should move schools for junior year or to stay at the one I'm at are that this school consistently gives college credits as if every class were an AP class, and it features a woodworking shop. My social life is left wanting though.

After 3 years of social isolation, as this weird, awkward, pasty skinny white kid who essentially gave up on himself, I struggled a lot at first. Couldn't find anything I had in common with anyone else at the school. With it being a small population, it didn't take long for me to know who basically everyone was before the end of the year. By then I was struggling with depression, though I didn't know it. Halfway through the year I did start to work on myself. Cut my hair, showered to a semi-acceptable level, etc... whatever. Had a few crushes, didn't realize I looked like a goddamn creep but I was and still am so pathetic that there's no way I could be viewed as a threat.

Got with the group of generic hipsters, closest in common to me anyway. I'm not sure if it was me, but I had this horrible, deep seated, uncomfortable feeling that they were conspiring against me, and that out of my sheer loneliness I had to act like a completely different person to 'win their favor', get 'social points' whatever the fuck I visualized in my own head. Every day I came home exhausted after a few hours spent hanging out with them, usually thinking about how they only kept me around out of pity. At the time I really was acting completely fake, usually making loud or compulsive jokes since I didn't know what else to do. I had huge insecurities about how skinny and pasty I was, still do to be honest. Didn't help that I got comments, a lot.

By sophomore year I became exhausted, spending break sitting alone towards the back of the courtyard sulking about myself and my social life. Around the time before school shut down I'd stopped talking to most of them at all, and I haven't spoken to all but two of the people from that group since. Not sure when it started, but I find myself obsessively staring at my reflection any chance I get. I think about how ugly I am, about how I'll probably be alone forever. For some reason, even though I'm obviously straight, I obsessively doubt my own sexuality and feel the need to start 'testing' it in any way I can. With the few people left in my social circle that I talk to, I hear about all the things they're doing, all the fun they're having, while I'm pretty much left to sit by myself day in and day out in this goddamn closet of a room and wallow in self pity like I always fucking do. I'm so fucking sick of dealing with this shit and I just want a way out. Someone genuine to spend my time with at least, something to do outside of my goddamn shithole room where everything I do is just some sort of escapism to distract myself from my petty mental health issues. I've just turned 16 but I spent my birthday alone thinking about how goddamn ugly I am, undermining my masculinity and doubling down on myself again and again looking for some sort of goddamn warmth and closure.

I try to distract myself, work on myself, seek warmth and sociability, fix my own problems so no one has to hear about them. But all I'm doing is weighing myself down, blaming it on circumstance, pushing others away from me. I want another chance at a social life already, I want a fucking job, I want the motivation to work on myself, I want to be the best person I can be, but here I fucking am writing a 20000 word post on a site I never use on an account that's probably followed by at least one person I know that'll probably see this shitty pity party I'm throwing myself about how I got all these fucking problems GOD LOOK AT ME

I guess I can't be self aware without looking like a hypocrite.

I should stop"
1197,help? how to stop hating myself?,"i hate myself inside and out. i know i have a distorted perception of how my body should look because of social media. but that doesn’t stop me from trying to get as close as i can to those proportions naturally. i can’t wear certain things, get naked, take pictures of myself, or even see pictures of other girls without getting sad and ashamed of how i am. i’m not confident as you might’ve guessed so my personality makes me insecure as well. i don’t stick up for myself well and i overthink everything from how i look to how i’m making the people around me feel. i constantly worry about making something go wrong. i feel like i need to be perfect. i know it’s not possible. and i know i need to not be so harsh on myself. i know i have good qualities. i know i can be nice to myself sometimes. when i’m having good times i am able to pat myself on the back and talk positively. sometimes i can pull myself out of the bad thoughts and then i pat myself for being strong. other times i can’t get it out of my head that i’m not as good as other girls. but i know i don’t want to be like everyone else. what the heck. please help"
1198,I can't validate my feelings,"I don't know how to validate my needs and feelings. What I mean is, I struggle to suppress my emotions because I feel like I am not supposed or allowed to feel this way. As if it's not enough that I am suffering, I always have to compare my experiences with others or seek reassurance and be told that it is ok for me to feel depressed, anxious or annoyed. But the thing is, even if they tell me, my mind distorts what I hear. For example, I thought that my psychologist said that I am fine and he was angry with me for even thinking that I had a mental illness, but upon discussing it with him, none of it was true. I had misinterpreted everything he said. Even when posting online, I feel judged. One downvote and I think that what I just wrote is utter bullshit and people think I am lying or I see this as proof that I shouldn't be feeling and complaining. If others have it worse, I also think I am not allowed to feel. Also, I will convince myself that people around me behave in specific ways because they are struggling (even if they repeatedly tell me that they don't), and I will go out of my way to do what they want. Even looking at demographics and seeing that people with my condition are somewhat different from me (their age, gender e.t.c) will cause me to feel guilty for feeling. It's almost like I have to be reassured all the time about what I have to allow myself to feel. And since there is no objective test (like blood tests) to tell you if you have a mental condition or not, I cannot find rest. I will always doubt how I feel and what I have. This guilt goes beyond feelings. If someone asks me to do something, I  have to do it even if I don't want to. If I refuse, or if I do it, but I am visibly annoyed, complain (even a little bit) or grimace, I will also feel guilty."
1199,4 weeks since I started cymbalta -- holy heck!,"I wish I had started it much earlier. It feels like my soul got wings. My anxiety disappeared from the first pill and it has not come back. Every morning I wake up, I notice how it's weird how relaxed I feel. I am more confident in myself. I have started exercising. I picked up my old projects again. Parents told me that they are relieved to see me happy again. I have not had a single skipped beat by my heart after having had heart palpitations for close to 5 years (!!!!!!). At my worst, a holter monitor even counted over 700 skipped beats per day and I felt most of them. Emotional setbacks were even able to make my heart stop beating for a few seconds. Even my acne problem drastically improved. Music feels so alive now.

I have been in therapy for over a year and tried so much but I kept reverting into a lethargic and anxious state. It was a looooonggg road from the point where I wanted to end it all. Went over abilify, guanfacine, benadryl, beta blockers, mirtazapine, trazadone, couple benzos, melatonin, tons of vitamin pills, fish oil, exercise, and other supplements. Cymbalta has, by far, made the most drastic positive effect in my life."
1200,Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.,"My Friends OCD is getting so bad that they won't park their car on their driveway because it leaves tread marks.   


What is going on in their mind? How are they feeling inside their head?"
1201,Is it me?,"I'd recently gotten out of a 3+ years relationship. I was even engaged to this person.
Prior to this relationship I'd seem to only get involved with men that never made me a priority.
My first was supposed to be my best friend, I later found out I was just a side piece. Also found out he lied almost through out the time we were together about his life.
The other guy made plans with me about the future and what our babies would look like.
Then he'd tell his friends that he doesn't understand where I got the notion that we were in a relationship because he never asked me to be his girlfriend.
Then the one after was a long distance relationship, he said the right things, made me feel like the sexiest woman in the world and then he just stopped.
He became nonchalant, uncaring and more distant.
He never gave me a reason, he just stopped.

But this recent one makes me wonder if I'm the problem or I attract these kind of men.

He was the only solid relationship I'd ever had. We even got engaged. He would boast on social media about how he was lucky to have me, tell his family and friends the same thing.

But he also made me question myself.
I tend to be clumsy and I've admitted that to myself and him. It's not intentional. It just happens.

One time I was at his place and I made a mess.
I broke a window louvre and pull out the window blinds by mistake. He didn't talk to me to 2 weeks because of it. He even went as far as saying he thinks my clumsiness will make drop our baby, he worried if I'd be a good mother.
He hated I was pro LGBTQ, he said I would probably encourage it with our kids (????).

I remember one time I talked about how we didn't have a social life because he also stayed indoors and his retort from nowhere was that he no longer found me sexually attractive. Then proceeded not to talk to me for weeks.

But because of my past relationships of not being a priority, I let these things slide. I insisted on loving him.

He stopped sleeping with me for 5 months, this was when moved back to his city.

I asked him, he said he was caught up with work problems.

I let it slide again.

Then I found out he was having an affair.

Oh, did I mention I had surgery to take out a mast in my ovary and throughout my stay at the hospital he only showed up once and was on the phone through out. He was there for just 1 hour.


I was at his place healing from that surgery, he didn't come home one day, he said he had a ton of work to do and would have to stay over at his friend's to avoid traffic.

Turns out he went to a hotel to be with however he was an affair with.

Sigh.

I said nothing about this discovery until a week or so after.

He said he couldn't trust me because I kept it to myself. Went on to say I was likely to harm him with this information.

That was when I'd had it.

He had no intention to apologise, no remorse. Just shame of not having the upper hand in the situation.

I packed my things (pain from surgery and all) and left very early in the morning.

What does he do next? He deletes all our pictures from social media and blocks me everywhere.
Tells his family that I never trusted him and he couldn't live with someone who doubted him 🙂.

There's so much I've left off.

I'm tired.

Am I bringing this to myself? Do I cause these things?

Tired."
1202,When is the right time to disclose mental health to someone?,"I've decided recently that I wanted to be more open with my struggles with some closer friends but im also looking to step back into the dating world. Being with somebody else definitely made less bad days happen and I think I'm ready to start taking those steps after getting my heart absolutely smashed over Christmas. 

I've had manic depression, PTSD from a near death experience and was abused as a child. I drink too fucking much. Never got help. Never went on pills. Never openly talked about my feelings ever because I always invalidated them and swept it under the rug.

How long into a relationship should I wait to drop this all on someone? How do I approach the subject with close friends? I don't want to be ashamed anymore."
1203,Need help,"I belong from a middle class family and currently I'm in my 3rd year. I've never achieved anything because things just never work out for me.  During my childhood and still I've been beaten by my father. He would exert his frustration by beating and scolding me. To him I'm not the ideal child, he's so full of ego that he tries to fulfill my wishes only beacuse to show that he's a good father but I'm a bad son. He used to scold me &amp; even beat me if I would speak while he was watching news headlines. Things have got better now I don't let him treat me the same way anymore. But that mental torture is still everlasting. He wants me to work for him(not with him, under him &amp; according to him) which I don't want to because of our past relationship. Main problem is that his taunts give me anxiety &amp; panic attacks. I get too conscious about my career, he even raises the point that others have achieved so much but you are here sleeping &amp; eating on my money. I have done my best to find some work but then he has already set some criteria there too. I wa ready to work at a cafe joint where I would have gotten 10000 rupees but he didn't allow me because his son can't work as a waiter. While writing this I'm suffering from immense anxiety and don't really know what should I do."
1204,My wife shared something that really touched me concerning suicide and mental health,"⚠️⚠️Trigger warning ⚠️ ⚠️

So, since I learned about the passing of the Japanese actor, Haruma Miura 三浦春馬 this morning, I’ve been thinking of mental heath crisis in Japan. People outside of Japan often ask me about the suicide forest as if it’s some kind of a fun tourist destination, which unfortunately, it’s turned into one in the recent years by the western media... 
Suicide in Japan is a serious problem we need to stop taking so lightly. (Trains in Tokyo stop every day because of people throwing themselves in them.)
This is going to be a long post, so bear with me if you’re interested.... having lived in both Japan and the US, I kind of have a lot to say about this. 

Mental health is almost non-existent in the Japanese culture. I’ve never shared this on social media, I’ve never felt like I need to... but I used to take medications for my anxiety. I’ve had horrible anxiety and OCD like behaviors since I was a child (I grew up in a very unstable, anxiety triggering household), yet nobody ever saw it as a problem even when it got pretty bad. I’ve dealt with eating disorders for 6 years, from the age of 13-19. Never once, did my family or anyone do anything about it even though they knew what I was going through. 
In my boarding school, we had a few girls who struggled with eating disorders and self harming behaviors. What did teachers do? They “punished” them for wasting food and causing distress among other students. Nobody asked them if they were okay. They were seen as rebellious children who were probably going through a phase. 

Read the official statement Haruma Miura’s agency issued regarding his suicide. You get the picture of what I’m talking about: 
""To fans and people concerned, we apologize for the worry and the inconvenience caused, but as to details we are still confirming and will inform you once again,""

How’s his death an inconvenience?

When I was officially diagnosed with anxiety, I told my family about it. They didn’t even know what the word, “anxiety” really meant. My aunt who is married to a doctor and does medical billing etc had no clue what it was. My family definitely took it like I was a crazy person who needed to be locked up when I mentioned I was on medication. 😅

This is how educated on mental health a lot of people are in Japan. I struggled internally with mannnnny things growing up, but I was kind of expected to just live with it. I’ve never received proper help for my childhood trauma (inflicted by my abusive father) either. I was again, expected to deal with it, and not talk about it because how is my whining going to help, right? 
Often times, talking about your problem (, especially to people in charge of you at work or in school etc) is almost considered nuisance in Japan. I was often told “There are millions of people out there who are going through the same stuff you are, but they’re doing just fine. Stop whining!!” Our culture pressures us into not standing out in any way, which includes having mental health issues or “inconvenient” problems.

Japanese people tend to think they’re at fault when something goes wrong (this is actually called something tribute or traits or something, I learned it in college 🤣). There is a saying in Japanese, “死んで罪を償う”, it’s loosely translated to “paying for your sin by suicide”. Sometimes some people still believe that they can’t live with the shame of their mistakes, so they feel better off just taking their own life. Also, (in the modern times) jokingly or not, I don’t know... but some people still seem to believe that people should die to pay for their mistakes. I remember watching quite a few news reports about CEOs and stuff who got caught doing some illegal stuff committing suicide when I was growing up. This is why I don’t really like it when westerners are overly fascinated with samurai and honor and this and that. Now you know, honor can be a toxic trait if you let it be about shame when you don’t live up to the honor. 

America still has a lot to work on when it comes to understanding mental health. I believe it should be treated as seriously as physical health. However, America is far more advanced than Japan in this aspect. I didn’t need to explain what “anxiety” was to anyone. Nobody thought I was cray cray. They just thought I needed extra medical help to boost my happiness for a while. 
Also, in America, people feel more free to talk about their feelings. I still don’t like talking about my feelings. I don’t really know how to. Apparently people thought I was still a very emotionally sensitive child, but I still felt like I wasn’t allowed to share everything I was feeling so as not to “inconvenience” people around me. 

This is a deep seated toxic idea.... your feelings are NOT inconvenient for anyone. 
I’m so heartbroken to imagine Haruma Miura was probably feeling this way too. 
I’m sharing my mental health struggles because I want it to be normalized. His death further confirmed that things have to change drastically in Japan to save people’s lives. I’ve lost a couple of other people to suicide in the past. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one, either in Japan or US who lost their loved ones to this demon. Suicide is a preventable death IF we have sufficient help and access to help. Let people talk about their feelings. Be more kind. If you’re struggling and need a listening and ear, I’m here. I feel this most strongly for my Japanese friends. Your feelings are valid, positive or negative. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 🙏🏻 It doesn’t matter what other people are doing, it’s their business. Your suffering matters. Seeking for help doesn’t make you a freak. There is no mistake so big you have to lose your life for it. You are valued, precious and important. There is only one of you and this world needs you. 💜"
1205,I need advice on how to get help,[deleted]
1206,Will anyone even want to date me - Embarrassed to be stuck at home (28/M) because I'm not making much money right now,"Hi all, I just wanted to ask a question and maybe get some opinions, support, or reassurance.    


After graduating college, I did a lot of touring with musical bands, but wasn't working a lot because I was letting my depression get the best of me.  I'm much more on top of my life right now but I've been stuck in a job that doesn't pay much for 2 years now, and I'm afraid to quit on my relative who I work for.  I'm the only one holding our office together in terms of understanding our systems and tech, and I love my coworkers.  I'm uncertain if our business will survive Covid19 so I've been waiting out that possibly happening so I can move to a different job.  


Anyways,  
I'm stuck at home right now because of those circumstances, and I'm embarrassed to be a failure/seen as a failure.  I want to try dipping my toes back into dating again, I've been single for 4 years, but I feel like who would want to date me if I live at home and don't make a whole lot right now. I do think I'm a pretty fun and kind person, and have a lot to offer otherwise as a partner.   


Am I just punishing myself by feeling like I bring nothing to the table? Should I try dating again? Should I be upfront right away with people about my situation or not until I know them better?   


Thanks anyone who reads this, I appreciate your time!"
1207,"Constantly dissociating unintentionally, how to stop?","Long story short I hate myself, have horrible depression and anxiety, and I’m constantly dissociating from myself unintentionally. It’s subtle but it effects me enough where it feels like I’m not actually living a real life. I think obviously the dissociation used to be an escape  from the depression and anxiety but now it just keeps me from dealing with what I’m going through and progressing in my life.

I’ve used grounding techniques which are helpful but the dissociation is still there. I can spend entire weeks, when my depression is really bad as long as months essentially, dissociative which is really scary and concerning. 

People that have severely long episodes of dissociation, how do you get out of it? Should I try an anti-psychotic medication? I’m already taking propranolol for my anxiety. Also exercising doesn’t seem to stop the dissociation weirdly, I feel healthier physically and mentally obviously but still very out of my body ironically."
1208,Discrimination against me by students at my university,"I guess I'm mostly posting this for support.

I'm a college student from India and I have a mental illness which when not properly treated led to me having panic attacks and waves of nausea in public. I felt very embarrassed about this. I developed these issues while studying abroad at a public university in Ohio in the Midwestern US called Miami University.

When I confided in other people at my university about these issues and that I was having uncontrolled outbursts in public, they began to distance themselves from me. I was told I didn't fit in at several club organizations. Despite winning my tryouts for the club tennis team, they told me I was too inconsistent and selected the player I beat comprehensively to join their team. 

Members of my fraternity told me that I didn't seem to be a good fit for them anymore. Several of them suggested I leave the fraternity to focus on my mental health. Keep in mind, I was living in the house at the time. I felt so ostracized I moved out. I had a panic attack during a spring break trip. Following this, an executive member of the group invited everyone except for me to join a planning event for the next semester's trip. I have received several airdrops in random places on campus on my iPhone suggesting I hurt or kill myself, so I had to change my visibility. Once, I was walking by myself to my dorm at night. A group of students yelled at me, calling me weird and brown and told me to go away. They said that they would shoot me with the guns in their bags. I told a police officer this, and the officer said they were probably drunk when this happened. He didn't even berate them for doing this.

I couldn't control my panic attacks because I was not prescribed the appropriate treatment for this. I was even prescribed stimulants that landed me in the ER when I took them. I went to the counseling center to get help for all this. My counselor and doctor at the school told me that I should cut down on my social activities and focus on me and in class. They suggested that these organizations were shunning me because of my behavioral issues. I eventually stopped going out to events with other people. I felt ostracized by a lot of different people and eventually left the university. 

 I have been receiving therapy for two years now to help me with my self-esteem. I started taking SSRIs to help with my anxiety, and they have helped a lot. I feel much more comfortable with my friends from school. I have to return to college once the COVID lockdown ends, and I have chosen a more diverse university with less history of discrimination and harassment against minorities that is closer to my family. I am worried that this will continue to happen in the workplace after I graduate and that this is something that is not exclusive to fraternities and club organizations. I feel that if this happens again and I lose control, people will begin to ostracize me once more. I don't want to invest my time in clubs that put me down with preppy and fratty privileged students. It was honestly the worst two and a half years of my life, and I can't go through that again."
1209,Issues with parents,"My father would masturbate in front of us in my home when I was young. When we asked him to stop, he would yell and say he had the right to touch himself in his own house. He would lay hands on my mother, and ask her why she wasn't letting him touch his own wife. When we tried to get him to stop, he would get very violent. He has a mental health issue and would enter into phases when he did this. This used to happen frequently while I was young.

Later on, I moved to the US to study. I told a ""friend"" in my university about this, and said it I would think about it and it worried me. He told his entire friend group. I had recently started taking medications for my own mental health issues that affected my sex life. These ""friends"" were of the impression that I was having issues with my sex life because of what my father had been doing while I was a child. They said that maybe I was actually gay and had a mental block because of what I had seen and did not want to admit to myself that I had feelings for men. I felt so embarrassed I had told my friend this. They completely invalidated my experience.

Recently my father has started doing this again, especially when my mother is sleeping. He would do it in the bed next to her with the door open. IDK what to do."

1212,Feeling pretty sad,"Hi, sorry for any spelling error or something like that, english is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm from Argentina and we are in quarentine since march 20th TO THIS DATE, and they are talking about prolong it to mid september, i wish i was joking but it is real. I'm really feeling depressed at this point not only for the financial stress but because i live with my mother and we are getting in shouting fights for even the pettiest things, i feel that it's my fault that she is angry. But i feel i need to give more context, (but please keep in mind i'm trying to vent/maybe get some advice and not in any way victimize myself i'm feeling preassure not the urge to blame everyone for my problems whinning) i'll try to keep the explanation brief.

I battled depression since my teens, i'm now 32, i have trichotillomania, i pull my hair out since i was 9 years old, i'm a trans man currently trying to keep my hormonal replacement therapy ongoing while waiting for all this shitstorm to end and get the gender reasignment surgeries. As it is i don't have a job in the present time, and it is getting to me hard that i can't help financially my mom who is retired. I struggled this last 7 years to get my Lic. as a superior radiology technician in the Red Cross, because i love my career but it's difficult thus i try to keep studying mealtdowns in between. Now the struggle is really hard, mom gets from the retirement the gov gives her the equivalent to less than u$d 150 per month, with me not having a job and the prolonged quarentine, all the business closing around my area and from what i hear in the whole country, with constant reminder of our corrupt president and his politician buddies, the repression to people that speaks in disagreement with them, the expropiations, the fact that they give governors and intendents a plus for every case (pressumed or factual) of covid-19 prompted a series of corrupt practices, ultimately making me feel there is no hope.

I'm tired of waiting for this to end, i'm tired of the lies they tell us, i'm tired of watching my mom struggle, i'm tired of keeping a good face when all goes to shit sround me. I really think maybe the hormones maybe the fact that mom and i are hot headed, maybe the cage we call home is getting too closed up for us to breath, i don't know anymore. I'm worried about mom, she is 64 and really tries, never was a great mom but at least she provided i guess and i want to return the favour. I feel sad, angry most of the time, i yell sometimes and others she yells. We try to help my godmother because she is senile and her sister is in Mar del Plata (we are in Buenos Aires) and can't (or won't) come to assist her sister that clearly can't take care of herself, she already tried to feed the cats litter box stones, and ate herself cat food causing her an infection, her dog is old and needs care too, and she has potty accidents almost always. I'm really tired of feeling useless, of watching the world go to hell, and of not having any idea what i can do to earn an income in a country that by decree can't fire any employee (and won't hire anybody) without giving the equivalent of 2 salaries, everything closing going for bankrupt, basically our president is turning us into Venezuela (no offense) and that loves the Chavist party. I'm so done. No one will hire annyone in already in flames country. My skill set limits itself to my studies that i have yet to finish, uni is closed too. I'm an avergae artist but without any means to share my art i see difficult to make comissions, also i don't have a credit card of any sort ergo i can't get paypal (at least in my country) See i explored many other routes to keep my head afloat, trying to find another solution, i refuse to give up mentally but alas as i said, i'm tired mostly because i developed isomnia and have the most erratic and short hours of sleep if at all, thanks quarentine.

I'm very sorry for venting all over the place, maybe it's because right now it feels too much to keep inside alone. I'll try to find some solutions, i can't let myself fall into the black spiral of depression anymore, i promised myself i wouldn't let anyone put me back in that whole, although it's getting really difficult to try and push forward. Just posting to keep myself away from a breaking point, i'm sorry i wrote too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your patience. 

Even if i currently feel that i can't do it myself, you remember to keep your chin high, helps to be relentless, but even if you are not just let out some steam and push. Again thanks for reading.

1213,"So my therapist is moving, when I asked for a recommendation of someone else he said ""I'll have to connect you with a PhD level candidate (it's through the college, grad students offer discount services)","Im sure it's nothing but I can't help but think that's a nice way of saying ""you're a complete nut job"".

I'm in therapy for depression, adhd, addictive tendencies and ptsd. Made a lot of progress especially on the ptsd front, but working on the rest. Shit is hard"
1214,Why are psychologists so unhelpful?,"Everyone kept telling me to ""get counselling"". After years of procrastinating, I finally did it.

I went there and I explained a bunch of my problems, and the psychologist told me some reasons why I might feel that way, but...

**The psychologist did not tell me the solution to my problem.**

In fact, the psychologist was reluctant to even diagnose me with anything at all. So I basically wasted $100 for nothing. I got no answers and I didn't even get a diagnosis for my problem.

Why are psychologists so unhelpful?"
1215,Im hurting inside but I don’t know who can help me,"I come from a conservative indo-carribean family. I am a 22 year old male who met my first ever girlfriend about 8 months ago. I’ve been seeing her since but due to outspoken racism by my parents, I chose to hide my relationship for about 5 months until it recently came to light. Ever since my mom does not allow me to leave the house without messaging me, when she knows I’m with my girlfriend especially during the night she calls and messages me non stop. She has threatened to harm herself and has even told me that I’ve been causing her major health issues which may or may not be true (I don’t know what is true at this point). She claims I ruined her family and that my siblings and dad also hate what I am doing as I will disgrace the family by bringing in someone who is black despite her being carribean too. Recently I told them about my mental health and what her words mean as she told me not to come to her funeral and threatens to disown me and things were better. However they started up again when she starts to ignore me and the rest of my family when I go out with my girlfriend and she knows about it. She continues to tell me that I don’t care about her and that I should tell her I don’t want her in my life anymore. Today I watched her hit herself repeatedly and slam the back of her head on the wall. I feel broken while choosing between two people I love and I can never understand how an ethnicity has this effect on my mom. My head hurts and I know harming oneself is not a healthy coping mechanism but I now understand why people do it. Frustration and anger are building up and although I love my mom and family I am starting to resent them which hurts me even more. I sometimes feel like isolating myself from everyone as I feel like a burden and a disappointment to everyone. Tbh I don’t know what I feel all I know is that I’m hurt and emotionally destroyed.

TL;DR - Family hates girlfriend because of colour my mom threatens and emotionally blackmail me but it feels so real. I’m emotionally destroyed and need help."
1216,Is there a possible reason for why I've stopped liking things at an extreme level?,"Maybe that sounds weird, but hear me out.

The way I like stuff has always worked in the way that I'll get REALLY into something, then obsess over it for usually months. It ends eventually. Not that I stop liking the thing, but I stop being so extremely interested in it.

I haven't been able to do that since after the last time.

Maybe it sounds like a good thing that I haven't been able to do it, but it really isn't. Trying to get into a bunch of different things all at once is a lot more tiring than just liking one thing for a long time. Not having something fun to always think about is weirdly upsetting for some reason. I don't think of particularly painful or harmful things when I don't have anything else to think about, it's more like I can't really think of anything. Like, I can't think of any specific thing. It feels sort of blank. Or foggy. Sometimes I get something, but it's mostly just a whole lot of nothing.

It isn't that I don't like anything at all or that I'm completely uninterested, I just can't like, think about it for months. Some of the stuff I try to get into is really cool but my brain apparently doesn't feel like working the same way it did last year and the years before that."
1217,Sleep issues?,Idk I woke up feeling upset and sick. Just mad at myself. Honestly this happens every single time I nap and has been a thing since I was a kid. Short periods of sleep tick me off. Is this odd? Feels odd..
1218,Should I tell my boss that I'm suffering from major depression and anxiety disorder?,"I have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety disorder for about a year now. I've been regularly going to therapy and taking my medicines. 
But the pandemic is getting really tough for me. I live alone in an apartment and have no friends or acquaintances around. That has been triggering my for quite some time now and it's getting insanely difficult for me to get up and barely brush or cook my own food. 
I have taken 1 leave or 2 in the last couple months but nothing major, but my productivity has gone way down.
My boss is an amazingly understanding and friendly person yet somehow I have always had my reservations to open up to him about anything (keeping professional and personal lightyears away from each other). 
Now I'm feeling burnt out and my condition is deteriorating so I need a couple days off, and although I know I love my job, so I'll come back after 2-3 days, I am scared I might again fall into a bad stretch. I'm trying to pull it together and manage everything but I just can't seem to do it, however hard I try. 

I have lost complete confidence in me and scared of my own depressive phases. Therapy, somehow, isn't working for me I feel. I've had some suicidal thoughts, I've thought about stopping therapy because it's been a year now and I still am at the same person. 

So at this juncture, should I inform my boss about my condition? He's friendly and understanding, I feel so. But I'm not sure this is something which can be shared openly ( mental health is still a stigma here) and I'm scared that he'll treat me differently and think of me as unreliable or incapable when it comes to consideration of further promotions or projects. Also, I'm scared of losing my job because of the same.  

TL;dr : Diagnosed with depression and anxiety, going through a really bad phase. Should I tell my boss about it? I'm starting to feel burnt out and scared of losing my job."
1219,Letting out too many of my problems?,"So I'm trying to open up more to my s/o but honestly really struggling. It's not that I don't want to but I feel like I've given them the worst of me already and I don't want to be a burden. I mean Im never made to feel that way but still I do cause I'm not used to opening up (irl) therefore making this so much more difficult for me. Like how to do you balance your mental health in a relationship whilst keeping peace with yourself and your s/o?  Doesn't it ever feel like not speaking up to anyone is so much easier to just save yourself from saying anything unintentional or just incorrectly? This doesn't have to be specifically towards a s/o, man this is like me with any of the few I hold close to me..."
1220,I want to hurt my ex,"She left me two weeks ago, after a five month relationship together, and ever since, I’ve been having tremendous thoughts of wanting to hurt/torture/kill her, her few friends, and several others attached to the situation. 
I’ve suffered from anger related issues since childhood (currently 18yrs old), along with anxiety and depression and insomnia. 

Essentially, I did so much for her, I cared for her so incredibly well, I tried for her to such far extents, and I loved her deeply. But now that she’s gone, after leaving me, due to in my opinion, complete bullshit reasons, I’m being serious when I say that I feel an immense urge to end her life. It pains me so much, this nightmare, and I just need it all to end."
1221,I'm not sure if I'm okay?,"I'm gonna start with some context, I'm a student living abroad for my 3rd year now, I share an apartment with a great friend of mine and have been on summer break for a couple weeks.

For the past 2 or 3 months it's been getting increasingly harder for me to find motivation to do ""productive"" stuff, like doing some online courses I have already bought or studying music (which is something I kinda had as a hobby for some time but am now trying to get more serious about) or even house chores. And then, because I can't do these things I want and/or have to, I feel guilty and get even less motivated to actually do something about it. I'm very interested in mental health and have had family and friends with severe depression, so I know a little bit about the topic even though I haven't experienced it myself and I try to take these matters very seriously. 

What bugs me though is that I don't feel particularly bad, I actually feel good most of the time (aside from the moments of guilt from thinking I'm wasting away my free time), have lots of close friends, an active social life (country has been opening up again for more than a month now), and don't really have any difficulties in my life since I'm in a very fortunate position of being able to study abroad, with parents that are supportive, doing a course I really like.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is if anyone has ever been in a similar situation of feeling kinda unmotivated despite having very little to complain about life in general and knows how stop this from getting any worse.

TL;DR: My life is great but it's getting increasingly harder to focus on ""productive"" things, has anyone been through something similar?"
1222,How do I convince my long-distance friend to seek help for a traumatic event?,[removed]
1223,I am genuinely worried,"A bit about me: I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. Still need to be tested further for OCD &amp; ADHD. To put it lightly, life hasn’t been rainbows and butterflies and suicide constantly lingers in my head. 

Now, I have a partner who is apparently also depressed and has very low self esteem. I understand I cannot fix anybody, but the pain of this person is affecting me deeply and my partner ends up hurting my feelings a lot even though it is not this person’s intention. Sometimes, it triggers my suicidal tendencies...but clearly I am worried for my partner as well and am wanting the best for this person’s health and life...

My partner is always pushing me away but I know help is really needed so I don’t want to just abandon ship. 

IDK what the point of me sharing this is but maybe I just need an outsider’s perspective. 

Our families have no idea about our mental illnesses by the way. I also managed to convince my partner to see a doctor/psychiatrist and it went well hut ever since the lockdown he just kept getting worse and is no longer taking prescription meds."
1224,I almost ended it,"I do martial arts, and as much as I love it, my mental state can’t handle it and I end up hating myself. I left class early to take a walk because I needed fresh air. I walked a loop around the building and there are train tracks across the street from it, and a train was passing. I crossed the street and stood in the grass near the train, and I wanted to jump into it. I really did. 

I have no clue what stopped me, but I don’t feel better at all. No one knew what had happened, when I walked back in I seemed normal too. Where do I go from here when I feel so useless?"
1225,How to know if one is bipolar?,"What is normal and where does bipolar start?
For extreme cases it is absolutely clear to me, but I don't see myself as bipolar but my closest friend does.

I know I am depressed, probably for 16 years now. Sometimes I have also normal phases but I wouldn't say I have mania.
E.g. I meet a cute girl that likes me, probably everyone would feel better and if stop seeing each other it will get worse again?
That should be a normal behavior and I never really was happy or sad without a reason?

I don't know how it is called but this rapid type of bipolar would fit me better or not I don't know.. What my friend describe as hypomania never lasts for more than some minutes or hours.

Sometimes after major depressions I have phases I am really motivated maybe from s video or person and I feel to need to change my whole life and fix all problems at once, but that ends usually after some minutes to hours.

E.g. some months ago I realized I need to get somehow 21 ECTS within 2 months (and I only did 9 the last 12 months) or I will lose money (about 8000$). When I realized that I was thinking about everything I could do to achieve this and was like ""I have to do that"", ""there must be a way"", since I didn't want to pay 8000$ back.
Obviously I failed. 21 ECTS in 2 months would be possible for some people without mental problems, but remember I did less than 1 in a month..
But I don't know? Isn't that some natural behavior or (hypo)mania?
If I get pushed into the corner I act like that, but bringing that to reality. If some guys push you into the corner, you FIGHT or DIE. Isn't that just some modern basic survival instinct how I act?"
1226,Question about the impact of psychical health on the mental health. (Please reply urgent),"( I ment physical) okay so for the questions sake, if there is an individual with existing deppresion and anxiety, but they have zero i mean no psychical activity/ exercise through out the day, with maximum daily intake of 500-600 calories or even less then that without consuming any proper vitamins or healthy food prolonged with no routine as in doing nothing all day, having nothing to do or nothing to look forward to doing as in no hobbys,just having little to nothing to do at all, I mean just trying passing the time everyday and say this person has an issue with overthinking in a negative irrational way at times, how would this impact one's mental health?, now I know that there's a Orgins or everyone's mental health but at the same time there's a loop, as if one wasn't depressed it would be easier to be optimistic and positive about all of this, but in a simple way how much of this would effect one's mental health wether they are mentally healthy or Deppreesed and if one would try correcting all of this (small steps) how much can it combat deppresion and anxiety? 


Note:I know these can be the symptoms of deppresion too ( im asking this behalf of my loved ones so I understand where it's coming from and how this conflicts with there mind and goals etc) and one with deppresion may find it hard to correct but at the same time the individual who's depressed and wants help and to change may not forsee that how much these changes could effect one's health and help them as even a small change would be a victory for them, and to what I see this may be on of the individuals origin which causes there deppresion/anxiety to be worsen."
1227,I always feel like I'm being picked on when my brother is around my friends and it's starting to effect me mentally,"So straight off the bat, I know this is mostly in my head and my brother / friends don't mean any harm. I guess I'm just venting and hope people could give me tips on how to deal with it.  I'm 31, my brother is 33. We both live apart and don't really talk that much. 

I've pretty bad self esteem issues and have trouble speaking up or saying much at all. I was the ""quiet kid"" in school. I've gotten past that now and have a small circle of friends I really enjoy being around. Once a month we get together and play an online game. We rotate games to get a wide variety which is a lot of fun. I'm not that good at most of the games but we have fun. The other guys I play with aren't great either but I'm clearly the worst.

Last month my brother asked if he could join and he is friends with all our friends so he was joined in. My brother is a very charasmatic guy and knows how to push my buttons. Whether intentionally or not, he'll make jokey comments at pretty much every opportunity that I speak up and by the end of our game, I noticed some other friends started to mention how I wasn't that good.

This isn't the first time I've felt like this, it seems whenever my brother joins us in any circumstance, the group turns me into the butt of their jokes. Like I'm the dumb one. In the past I've had friends slowly distance from me and although I know these friends won't, I keep having thoughts of them just deciding to play games without me because they want to win.

We're supposed to be playing tomorrow and my brother will be joining us. I'm getting anxiety just thinking about what they'll say if I don't play right or thoughts of them all deciding that they'll decide half-way through the game that I should stop playing."
1228,¿How are you coping with mental health issues during Covid19?,[removed]
1229,Does anyone else get mad at how loosely the word anxiety is used?,"I am so glad it's easier to talk about mental health. But so many people say they have anxiety like it's nothing. My boyfriend and best friend are both being treated for anxiety. I see how hard they have to work to deal with it in a healthy manner. Too many times my boyfriend has cried because he ""just wants to be normal"". It makes me so mad to see people say they have anxiety just because they don't want to go out or because they get stressed easily*. Most people don't go around claiming other illnesses, like cancer, when they don't have it. I feel like it will just get taken less seriously eventually. 

(Please note, in my two examples I am only referring to people I have known for years. If someone I don't know says they have anxiety, I 100% trust them and would never question it.)"
1230,How do you process anger/love/affection?,"So I'm working with my therapist on here and I have come here for some guidance. I'm getting over some emotional numbness and I shut down over these feelings specifically because I have no idea how to process them other than to cry because it's too much. I was like this with happiness and sadness as well. 
I am feeling anger and it is a very forceful emotion. I have come that working out gets rid of that physical sensation, but for mental processing it goes for 100 to 0 after working out. I have no idea how to process the thoughts there though

As for love and affection, I am very lost for these. 
I am awkward about getting compliments, but I am slowly able to accept them from strangers. I feel awkward with closer people though. It's strange, it feels good and it's a happy feeling is all I know so far and maybe some fear due to upbringing. Basically I have no idea how to cross the fear because its mixed with some happiness in it. With anger, it's easier. 

Maybe it's because these ones require some vulnerability? I have no idea how to open up to that nor process the thoughts because its quicker reaction to shut off before I process any of it. Do I have to think of why I am afraid of it or??? 

Asking because this place sounds good for pointers and guides."

1232,The irony of being gifted,"So I (15m) am unsure as to whether it’s just me, was thinking of consulting more experienced people.
Basically i come from a low to middle class background, great family.
I’ve been a gifted child, I’ve always got top grades in school and seem to be keeping my life together.
However this is part of the problem, i feel as though by being gifted, I wish for pain or trauma to justify my suffering. There’s day where I would welcome it just so I can speak to someone knowing that I have legitimate issues. I know this is wrong, but I was wondering if anyone else felt this way?"
1233,"Does counseling work? Is medication the only thing to fix mental health? I feel like I’m doing almost everything right, but my mental health isn’t getting better. Anxiety/BPD","I’ve (20F) been diagnosed with bi polar depression, anxiety, PTSD, and OCD. (OCD more recently, about 1 month ago, but everything else 5+ years).

(Backstory but trying to keep this post short): I’ve been avoiding drugs and haven’t taken any in 3+ months.. and I’ve been off psych medication for 7+ months because I can’t afford my medication and the psychiatrist visits. I had to get my medication through Canada for a while because it’s as cheaper but still too expensive for me.

With my anxiety I constantly wonder if people go through the same things throughout the day that I do. Feeling overwhelmed and very self conscious especially what people think about me. I’ve been having panic attacks more frequently than I ever have, sometime seemingly out of nowhere (there is usually a trigger). I can sense my mental health deteriorating but I feel like I’m doing everything I can to get better.

I’ve been really invested in my job, working on my sobriety, eating healthy, working out, meditating, going through counseling (2 months now) that I can afford, but he keeps telling me that I basically NEED medication. 

Is anyone in counseling and off medication? Is it possible to just be at peace? I just want some other point of views, because in my day to day life I don’t meet a lot of people who feel the same as I do.

Side note: I can’t sleep well either, and I have a feeling that I don’t want to be here but I don’t want to die, I feel literally hopeless. Also I live in the US."
1234,So lonely that I'm angry,[deleted]
1235,Loneliness,"I don't know how to start, and I might not end it properly either. But, being alone sucks. When your so called friends talk to you only when they have some work, it really hurts a lot. I try to talk to some people and they either don't reply or end the conversation with a sentence. I've a girlfriend but she's in her own world and believes that I don't need anyone since I've her and should be happy with that.
I hate people and I hate myself.
That's it."
1236,Talk to oneself,"What is ment by this?
Talking to oneself like others, i.e. full sentences/conversations like with another person?

I am talking to myself sometimes, but not like with another person, more like commenting what I am doing next for example while programming ""WTF is wrong here?"" or ""What have I done here?"" or when cleaning the flat
like what I have to do next so e.g. while walking to the kitchen ""Ok, let's clean the dishes and then clean the windows""

I think this is rather common?
I think everyone at least thinks like that and I am just speaking out my thoughts?
Maybe that is also because I am alone since 8 years?
If I am home at my familys house I am rarely doing that."
1237,Nobody in my life understands how hard it is to be mentally ill.,"I know how this sounds, like I’m playing the martyr, but sometimes it’s so hard. I suffer from BPD, OCD, PTSD and anxiety, and lots of days are a struggle for me - though mostly I don’t show it. 
I think that’s the crucial point - I don’t show it. My family and closest friends have had hints, but I don’t want to burden them, and anyway, I’m not sure how I’d express the gravity of my feelings to them. 
If I told them I was stressed and preoccupied every second of the day, they just wouldn’t be able to comprehend it. I know they want to understand, but they never will (I hope!) 
I just want to be taken seriously, but not seen as just a mentally ill person.
Sorry for the ramble, I just know I can’t be the only one who feels like this!"
1238,questions about STD for mental illness,"I (20F) have been working at my company for over a year now and even though at first I was doing great with my depression and anxiety, these past few months have been unbearable it seems like. I work the overnight shift and have stomach issues that prevent me from eating properly(currently working with doctors to see what it is). Before, although I was in constant pain I could pull through and pull my weight at work. I filed for FMLA because I was just in a really bad place 2 weeks ago, and work started becoming more stressful for me every day. However, because FMLA is unpaid and I'm at an all time low for PTO, I force myself to work because I need the money. I tried talking to my boss about switching over to a day time position as working the night shift is taking a toll on my body now. Due to COVID-19 there is not a lot that can be done right now.. 

I have lost hope in my stomach issues being resolved. I am on antidepressants and they are no longer enough for me. I have hit a dark place these past few days and am wondering if short term disability is right for me. I was diagnosed by my general practitioner and he supports any decision that seems to improve my mental health, he will be happy to fill out any forms. I'm terrified of being rejected for short term but even more terrified of going back to work and sitting there for 10.5 hours a day just to be yelled at by customers about how I cant do my job. 

Is there anyone who has had experience with this? Would my general doctor be enough or would they deny me for not having documents from a psychiatrist? I plan on seeking more help but I feel I cannot work any longer and want to get approved as soon as possible so I can start working on myself."
1239,podcast/meditation,"does anyone here have a favorite podcast episode or meditation you listen to when your mental health is just absolute shit?

1242,BPD or gaslighting?,"I hope this is ok to post here, I just can’t get this experience out of my head. Sorry in advance for the long post. About 6 months ago I requested my medical files from my former HMO. When I got them, I found a BPD diagnosis no one had told me about. It made a lot of things click, not about how I personally feel but about how I had been treated at the time and since. 

I’d been recently discharged from a residential program for anorexia, and I was arguing with my providers over the fact they wouldn’t authorize or recommend PHP as a step-down from res. I’d gone straight down to outpatient because I refused to go back to their IOP program since I felt it had been traumatic the last time I was there (Only serving then vegetarian food then not believing me about my migraine triggers when I told them I can’t eat cheese, telling me it was all in my head and they couldn’t provide any other food options that didn’t have cheese as the main protein, kicking me out of program daily because I couldn’t finish lunch in 30 minutes before the timer went off and then sending me out to drive the 2 hours home sobbing daily while telling me I just needed to try harder, telling me it was all in my head and I should just stop when I started first gagging and then involuntarily vomiting during meals, and then sending me home again because it’s really hard to finish a meal in under 30 minutes when you’re forced to leave the room because you started dry-heaving and weren’t allowed back in until 5 minutes before the timer went off.... I could go on) and they wouldn’t provide another option other than their IOP. 

I eventually had to go back to the IOP after I immediately relapsed in outpatient and was once again told it was the only available option. While there, apparently my therapist diagnosed me with BPD. Her reasoning was that I was paranoid that all the providers were out to get me and I was overreacting to small things and causing scenes. The thing is, I really do think the providers were out to get me! They wouldn’t medically recommend PHP even though it was covered by my plan because the HMO would have had to pay for it out-of-network and didn’t want to. The residential place I’d been at tried to tell them it was entirely medically necessary, as evidenced by the fact I relapsed without it, but they wouldn’t listen and I just got marked down as attention-seeking. My therapist said I was acting out on eating disorder behaviors purposefully to get to a higher level of care because I just liked being taken care of at residential. I felt more like I was terrified of relapse and wanted to get out of it/prevent it in the future, but ok. 

The thing is, now that I know about my BPD diagnosis I can’t help but wonder if they were right and it makes me feel so guilty and embarrassed that I was trying so hard to get support when I didn’t need it. My current psych NP says I don’t have BPD, but I worry that I’ve fooled her since she hasn’t known me long and maybe I’ve just kept it hidden. I originally felt like I’d been gaslit by my therapist at the IOP program, I ended up feeling completely ungrounded and like I didn’t know what was true or false. I was constantly being told how I felt even when I didn’t think it was how I felt, and I ended up feeling so floaty and disconnected from reality. 

This was 3 years ago now, and finding that BPD diagnosis brought it all back. Ever since, I don’t know what’s real or what’s fake, or if I’m manipulating everyone around me and then lying to myself about it. I don’t think I fit most of the BPD diagnostic criteria, I’ve only ever had two relationships, both long-term, and Ive never broken up with anyone or felt like my relationships were unstable. I spend too much sometimes, but otherwise I don’t think I have any reckless behaviors. I don’t really identify with the idea of splitting, but I do sometimes see concepts in black and white especially when it comes to my eating disorder. I don’t think I’ve ever done that with people though. I don’t have mood swings and I don’t get angry or irritable often. But I did start mildly self-harming around the time this was all happening, and I have started to realize I have symptoms of depersonalization. I don’t know what’s true or not, and I hate knowing that I could be hurting other people by not acknowledging the diagnosis and getting treatment for it. I feel like I have that therapist’s voice in my head, overanalyzing and asking if everything I do is just for attention, and I don’t know anymore! I don’t feel confident about anything I do. Maybe posting this is just looking for attention and manipulating people into feeling sorry for me! I don’t think it is, but can I really trust myself when the professionals said I was attention-seeking and overdramatic? Probably not. I don’t know anymore. I just want to stop feeling so disconnected from reality and I don’t want to feel so confused anymore. 

Thanks for reading, I hope no one is offended by this, I really don’t want to buy into the stigma around BPD but I am scared of it since I feel like I experienced it at this program and since (I kept getting bumped down to outpatient because they “didn’t want to validate my eating disorder” even after leaving the HMO and hitting a new low weight. I was really struggling and kept being told one therapy session a month was enough to handle it. I realize now I gave them access to my old files and that BPD diagnosis. Or maybe they decided the same thing and also didn’t tell me). Please let me know if I’ve offended anyone and I can delete my post. I don’t know what I’m even looking for from this. Thanks."
1243,To stop having self destructive thoughts,"I haven't done self destructive activities in a while and am trying to veer away from that habit. However I've realized that despite my efforts to try to prevent myself from having those thoughts, whenever a minor inconvenience happens or someone just wanted to talk about a topic that just slightly touches a sensitive area, I start forming these thoughts like crazy and I can't help them, ruining my mood for the entire day because I start overthinking on those, to an extent where I would scratch my arm really hard or dig my nails deep so it would fade faster and I wouldn't resort to the old ways of how I self destruct, which I realize is probably not helping my progress. Are there any ways to prevent those negative thoughts from taking over my rationale? Thanks in advance :)"

1245,Do I need professional help?,"I have been sabotaging myself gradually for a year in my college life now so this year I should have done my paper and get the damn degree. And with this pandemic I thought I could get my shit together because I could do my responsibilities without getting out of the room and meeting people from my college. But eh, I still distract myself from my real problems and somehow I couldn't care any less about the consequences I most likely would get. 

The only thing I know about this problem is that I'm afraid to start doing my paper. A few hours a go a acquaintance from there asked about it. I didn't answer them thinking what could they do about mine if they know where I am atm but then later I find myself irritated with anything people I'm living with did (speak, eat, their sound when walking) and thinking where, how should I start about my paper. After that I couldn't stop thinking about the hot water and a box cutter in the bathroom (idk why it's there), became conscious of my heavy breathing then proceeded to cry about how burdening I am not being able to finish one damn degree when most of my peers already done with them. 

I want help. But I don't know where because here in my town I couldn't get a decent mental health facility, I need to go big cities. I've tried to seek it online once and while I was copying notes I've prepared with some tears to the chat, the psychologist bluntly guessed that I'm a college student then gave me 'tips' to help myself. Like those you could find on internet; journaling,  exercise, just start doing, write down my good traits, etc. Hell with these notes, I deleted them and say thank you then end it there. 

I've read people's journeys about getting real professional help, they all have physical telling symptoms like hyperventilation, insomnia, weight gain or loss, couldn't get out of bed, etc. But I still have my family making sure I eat regularly, have a will to take a bath, anything to function a with healthy body. So am I overestimating my problems? Should I just try those tips harder? I've exercised, I couldn't keep writing journal daily and when I did write, it's all about my dog that passed away recently. I want to try seeking help again but if the same response I would get, I don't know anymore."

I was in shock and in. i laughed maybe it was a weird joke but he looked at me and said"" f you its not funny"".
 the pain turned into anger and i wanted to bash him but i kept quiet and under control, he didn't seem very stable(who am i to judge though) i got up and walked like 40 meters even more far from him and this guy gets up starts yelling to himself ""this f****ing guy why isn't he leaving!"" i got really uncomfortable so got up gave him a peace sighn with my hand and he replied of course with ""f you"" all this with tears of past pain falling down on my face all i wanted was a hug and got this left with tears and had to fight a breakdown for about a 15 min walk until i reached a safe spot.

1249,I think I truly am a pedophile,"Im a 16 male.It's currently 2PM where I live. At 2AM i went checking and I legit got hard to an 11 year old dancing on TikTok. I sexualized the little girl in my mind.
I guess it was just a matter of time for this to happen.
I remember that when this started I told my parents ""If I ever get hard to an 11 year old girl or younger I will kill myself"".
Today this happened, im not feeling anxiety, im not feeling anything. I was almost sure that I was a pedo, and now I have 0 doubts.
Maybe POCD just made me realize who my true self was. Heck, maybe it wasn't even POCD all the time, i was probably just using it as a form of denial.
I dont want to kill myself, but at the same time I do.
I dont want to make my family suffer because of me, but I also dont have any desire to live knowing that I am a pedophile.
Maybe I will commit suicide, maybe I won't. I just dont think I can make a decision right now. Im numb, I feel like im already dead.
I was supposed to go to a psychiatrist next week for an evaluation session, but now I dont know if I want to.
Check my post history, there are posts I made about all this that will give you more information on what im going through right now.

1252,Do you feel like you have physical things crashing chaotically against the inside of your head?,"
It's like my mind feels so unstable. There are always literal things flying around, trying to get out of my head and interfering with anything I try to think about. For example, I would be trying to think about a memory but I'll only be able to hold it for a short time before it gets chaotic and unstable and I start feeling like nothing's in control and I feel physical objects strongly flying around in my head, but I don't really see them in my imagination; just feel them. This also prevents me from enjoying things because it's so deeply, painfully infuriating that I feel like I have to make a very great and strenuous effort to get it all under control and stable and clam and peaceful or else I won't be able to properly enjoy things. Can't enjoy good music, can't enjoy hobbies, can't enjoy my favourite season, can't enjoy good movies, can't enjoy beautiful things because it just won't let me. It also prevents me from feeling what I'm supposed to feel at a given situation, like I don't feel relieved when I really should be, don't feel comfortable/angry/exctied/proud/etc when I should be feeling those feelings. And it makes me so depressed and sad. I can't even sleep with ease. Those physical objects are just constantly disturbing and distracting me so much. Is there a name for this condition, when you feel like (but don't always see) physical stuff is uncontrollably flying around in your head? Does anyone else suffer from this or something similar?"

1254,I need help on how to carry on,"Ok so I've had depression since the age of 13/14 and I've had times throughout my life where I feel like I'm either not here or nothing im seeing is real. I'm almost 27 now and recently ive been having episodes where I'm sure i don't exist and I don't know where I've gone. 
A few years ago I went through a rough time where I was unemployed living in a small bedroom not being able to leave my flat because I was terrified of what out there. I was in that room without any human contact for about a year and I started to create people to talk to and suddenly the voice I was imagining is now clearly talking into my ear. She's telling me the only way to stop her is to kill myself. I'm not entirely sure if she's somwone i created or if she just latchedon to me from somewhere else. She talks at me night and day and she laughs when I feel embarrassed and she shouts when I try to ignore her. I sometimes go into a 2D world if that makes sense to anyone. Like im looking at a big board with things either painted on or printed on, like a movie set. It feels like everyone has a script but me and sometimes im sure they're saying things to coax a reaction for the people watching me. 
I was emotionally and sexually abused by 3 different members of my family from a young age at different stages of my life and when I think about those times too much the voice gets so loud and ugly that I want to bash my own head in to make her stop. Its getting to the point where I'm convinced that she's right and the only way to stop feeling like this is to die. 
I dont want to die really, although I have tried a couple of times to end myself but I'm too scared to die and I just don't know what to do.
Thankfully im away from my dad who was a very evil man and im living with my mum and step dad who are always there for me but that just adds to the guilt I feel constantly. There's so many feeling and thoughts in my head that I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
Im on medication and I've got an elastic band round my wrist and I tried meditation and walking with my dog for miles and doing breathing exercises. I am really trying to talk through everything with my new family but its not enough and at night these things are getting worse. 

I guess im just wondering if anyone else feels like this is relevant to anything they've been through and what kinda coping mechanisms they used or have heard of to help me. Please, im at a complete stop in my life and I feel so lost in all this. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for anything to help x"
1255,Why do i have an overwhelming feeling of anxiety even though im not anxious about anything?,"About a month ago i started waking up to a horrible feeling that i can only compare to anxiety, but this feels different. I've been anxious before obviously as has everyone but this is nauseating and way worse. Its more like a physical pain rather than a feeling and i don't know why its happening because i'm very happy with my life right now. It only happens about once a week and its always right when i wake up. Very rarely does it happen throughout the day. A few times i threw up because of it and when it happens while i'm still asleep it wakes me up. Any  insight would be greatly appreciated!"
1256,Just realised I have been treated like shit,"Hi guys,

Not an English native, so words might be spelled wrong or sentences are not correct.

To set the record straight, my parents where lovely people so it isnt their fault.

My dad had a rough childhood due to his parents being divorced. He had some sort of depression.

He was a heavy smoket and passed away due to lung cancer when I was 27, I am 34 now.

I was bullied by a guy in my neighbourhood, he was always after me. Besides that I had some friends growing up.

It went wrong when I went to high school, I quickly hung out with types who where smoking weed.

I went to another High school and lost sight of the people who actually shoild have been my friends.

I was bullied by people who knew my neighbourhood bully at this new High School, got called all sorts names. Mostly about being wierd or something. Getting called misfit and such.

Not so much physical, but just awfull things.

Then I hung out with people who where drinking a lot and so forts. Got bullied by this group also.
Just humiliating things.

Now I am doing OK, but still have an inferior complex.
University was OK, mostly just working at accounting.

My first job at accounting was with people who where kind af back stabbing, having low confidence and self esteem doesnt help.

I am doing alright, but just thinking of the bad shit I have experienced, just puts this huge weight on my shoulders daily."

1258,Need encouragement?,"Hi everyone! My name is Lisa. I have OCD, trich, and anxiety. I recently started a project where I send letters to people who are struggling. Head over to (www.lettersfromlisa.org) to request a free, handwritten letter of encouragement and support."
1259,How often do you disassociate?,I often disassociate and end up in random places.
1260,I feel like I don't deserve love,"I have autism and there's a huge stigma surrounding autism, especially on the internet, there's a stereotype that having autism makes someone a bad person or violent or something and it makes me feel bad because I was bullied a lot growing up for being on the spectrum, and I've always been insecure about it. It sucks because I'm not a bad person or violent or anything, and these stereotypes are always making me feel bad about myself. I have plenty of friends who love me despite my differences, but I sometimes feel like I don't deserve the love. I just don't know what to do."
1261,what could i be dealing with?,"i’m 17 years old and just a normal kid. no family issues at home or stressful situations often. never used to be like this before but i’ve been having a lot of mood swings lately going on for a couple months now. a couple days a week or sometimes every day, i’m feeling normal but then i’ll be REALLY happy and excited for hours. energetic and racing thoughts. sometimes restless and can’t be still. then i’m back to normal or i’ll feel sad for a while and then i’m back to normal. or one day i’ll be sad first then really happy/excited for a while, and then back to normal. when i’m feeling happy, i feel really excited for no reason or my thoughts are racing and i’m thinking of fun/exciting things i feel like doing. i get up and feel like moving around, listening to music and sometimes to the point where i feel like getting up and dancing and that’s not really like me. when i feel sad i feel hopeless, short fused and easily irritated-small things will set me off, worthless, wanna be alone, and tearful. these feelings only last between 2-4 hours. i used to struggle with depression before but it doesn’t feel like that here. any thoughts would be much appreciated! bipolar disorder crossed my mind but i think by now i’d know and the highs aren’t super high and the lows arent that low, and these feelings don’t last too long before i feel normal again. it’s like i’m up then i’m down the normal and then the cycle starts again."
1262,Is it weird to feel nothing?,"I don't want to sound like those ""Edgy teens"" who are ""empty"" and their ""soul is in the void"". I'm just confused, and I don't know if it's normal to feel what I feel. I don't know what its called if its wrong. so yeah.

I don't think I feel emotions? like its not a numbness its not a void. its nothing, there's nothing to describe, I cant feel it. I cry, but I don't feel ""sadness"", I can laugh but I don't feel ""happiness"", y'know? I don't know, maybe I'm stuck in one emotion and so everything seems normal to me, but I don't know, I'm not depressed I'm not bipolar I'm not anything else, i feel nothing. Its not a numbness its not a empty hole which cannot be filled, it nothing. 

I know I don't feel it because happiness has the same feeing as sadness and anger, Maybe that is normal but with my friends it seems like they can point out what they feel whereas with me its like ""Oh I should feel this emotion, lets react to how that emotion would be displayed""

Maybe I'm complaining about something that isn't problem. Anyone got advice or anything?"
1263,what are these symptoms of?,"I'm not asking to be diagnosed obviously I just want to hear opinions of what this might be. I'm officially diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety disorder, ocd and anorexia. I haven't been to a psychiatrist with the intent of delving deeper into my behavior and diagnosing it in a very long time so I assume my record must be a little outdated.


Anyway for as long as I can remember I've been suffering from the following fuck ups and I don't really see how any of it could be related to what I'm diagnosed with so i need you guys to help me figure out what this could potentially be:


- my work desk has to be in the farthest, most inner corner of the room with my back against the wall, otherwise I don't feel safe at all, its almost like a deep primal feeling, if I face the entire room, windows and doors and my back is to the wall then I can't be attacked by surprised because I see it all.

- I sleep practically hugging the wall and with my back facing to my window because I believe that theres something or someone outside my window looking in and if I open my eyes facing the window I'll see them first thing.

- also when I sleep I try to never open my eyes because I believe theres, again, something or someone above me, like some monster bending down over my body to be inches away from me, and the only way to be safe is to never open my eyes and notice them.

- every single person in the world is dangerous and untrustworthy, no exceptions. This paranoia is so bad that its hard for me to walk down a safe public street in broad daylight because every person I walk past could potentially attack me so I just walk past people as fast as possible.

- in general whenever something is going wrong I have delusions that I know don't make any fucking sense but I still believe them. For example some time ago I was on a bus and one of the people on board got off after loudly arguing with the bus driver idek about what but the guy was screaming that this bus company sucks, they're frauds, blah blah. So as a result my head somehow conjured the idea that the guy put a bomb on the bus out of anger and it will detonate soon, and at the moment I was aware that this makes no sense but I was so fucking afraid, like there are two voices in my head one being the logical one thinking ""what the hell are you on about"" and the other is just pure animalistic going apeshit, it's very similar to what I experience with my anorexia. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown all the way to my stop.


What could these be a sign of?"
1264,what should i do???,"hello !
its been a very long time (almost 5 years)that i have started to have suicidal through since i got diagnotised with t1d (type one diabetes)and the more time goes by, the worse it gets : i have very big moods swings, i am violent toward others and myself and i can only sleep 4hours by nights (sometimes less) or 12... plus i have very big trust issues and trauma about bullying so sometimes i act like a rat bc i dont want to get hurt again :(( and it's unsupportable for me and idk what to do to stop this bc i dont want that ppl hate me :|
(sorry for my bad english too,,)"
1265,How can I enjoy my teenage years more? I feel like I'm wasting my time and that I take life too seriously,[deleted]
1266,Anyone else ashamed of their number of diagnoses?,"I (21F) have been diagnosed with BPD, OCD, bipolar disorder, and having OCPD traits. I've mostly conquered social anxiety and it turned out that an eating disorder I was diagnosed with was related to OCD. This is a fuck ton of things, more than anyone I know IRL. It doesn't help that I've been through 15 medications and have had electroconvulsive therapy 60+ times. I just feel like no one relates? I know I have so many amazing non mental health related qualities and my experiences have inspired me to become a social worker, but having this laundry list of mental illnesses is still discouraging. Does anyone relate? I just want to feel less alone."
1267,Has anyone else repressed everything so you can actually get on with life? (+imposter syndrome),"This is on mobile plus I'm probably rambling so sorry if this is a shitty reading experience!

I have something akin to a professional diagnosis for depression, but nothing for anxiety and adhd. (both of which I'm quite sure i have) But since my country barely recognizes mental health problems and my mom isn't too open about it and getting it treated (she mostly talks about how it's the 'mindset' of the person) I've ended up repressing everything from being shown outwardly in order to seem 'normal' or 'fine'. 

So even if I'm having an anxiety attack I've somehow managed(?) it to never be noticeable. If I'm depressed and shutting down I'll use a lot of mental effort to make my self at least look like I'm functioning. This involves disregarding my feelings entirely so it doesn't interfere with 'functioning like a normal person'. Even if I'm upset and extremely close to full on screaming I'll push it back. 

I think being so used and accustomed to repressing everything has fucked with my ability to work with my emotions. And repressing it so it doesn't show much has led me to question if I'm really just overreacting when I am normal and neurotypical. 

I'm so stressed. I want to know if there's someone who has a similar experience to mine. Even just one person would be nice."
1268,Anyone else incapable of crying?,"I cry maybe twice a year for maybe two minutes (if I’m lucky).
I was told that’s all I would do  when I was a baby, but for as long as I can remember I’ve had difficulty shedding tears.
I didn’t cry at my best friend’s wedding, nor my BIL/SIL, and was met with contempt about “not being happy for them” each time. I can specifically remember and count on one hand each time I’ve shed any tears within the last three years.

Today I got it out for maybe 30 seconds and it’s so frustrating. I want to feel that cathartic release. It just gets turned into anxiety and sits in my throat until I ultimately push it far enough down.

I’m working with a therapist atm but it’s still early in our relationship and nothing has been worked out, yet. When I google what my problem is, it’s just a bunch of suicidal/melancholic depression/sociopathy “studies”, and I really don’t feel like I’m any of that.

Anyone else have this issue? Is it an issue even?"
1269,Friend understands my struggles,"This morning just confirmed that I've found a friend that's worth building a prolonged friendship with.

We've been trying to go on a socially distanced friendship date for a few weeks now. The first time we had to cancel bc she was having some physical pains. Today was supposed to be our re-do.

Yesterday I felt my mood take a turn and I spent half the day in bed. I was hoping it would turn again by this morning but no such luck. I was worried she would dismiss me and insist we still meet up.

She was actually very understanding and didn't push for details. She's going to check on me later and we're going to make plans got later this week."

1271,Boxing saved my life,"Okay so, where do I begin? Well, I had a rough start to to this year. Went through a bad break up with a girl that I loved. I still live with my parents coz I choose to, since they need someone to take care of them. Which hurt me even more when they separated earlier this year and I had to choose who I had to be with. On top of this, someone who I always thought would be around until I was married fell terminally ill, soon after they kicked the bucket. At this point, I had little or no motivation to do anything at all. I stopped eating, showering as much, my sleep schedule got fucked and I just lost the will to live. I went to a psychiatrist and found that I had depression. In my moments of utter despair, I happened upon this video documentary by BT Sport on Tyson Fury(if you know you know). I heard his story and it really resonated with me, after he beat Klitschko, how he got addicted to drugs (which I had done for a while), lost the will the live and just didn't want to wake up anymore (what I was currently feeling). Then I watched more videos on him and just became obsessed with the sport of boxing. At that point I had an epiphany and I knew that I had to fight my inner demons. Prayer wasn't working either(trust me, I tried). I looked up Boxing training videos on YouTube, got the necesarry equipment and started training at home(at this point the Covid 19 pandemic had just gone global). I enlisted the help of my father who begrudgingly agreed to it and at first I was so god damn bad at it. I used to swing Wildly, like a frickin windmill. Eventually, I started to correct my form through experience and I can say that I have definitely improved since I began. And now at this point, what I do is, I train 4-5 times a week, sometimes even twice a day to just keep myself mentally and physically healthy. I can now say that after 5 months of absolute hell that I actually feel happy. Like,my depression does come back from time to time but it's normally because I'm being lazy with my training, then it just goes away after I get back into my routine."

1274,What should I do now?,"Hi, I’m 23 years old and I’ve been depressed since my early teenage years. Recently everything has gotten on top of me and I can’t cope with anything anymore. I look at myself every day and I think what a massive failure of a person I am. During my 23 years of life on this earth I haven’t achieved anything nor will I ever achieve anything at all. I really do wish that I was someone else, someone more likeable and successful, etc.. I’m so lost and lonely in this world and I just don’t know what to do or where to turn anymore. Life is nothing to me these days. I honestly don’t care what happens to me from now on. What should I do now?"
1275,How can I stop living in my fantasies?,"This may sound odd, but I have a problem where I sort of live in a fantasy world in my head. I go on all kinds of wild adventures that I would never go on at this point in my life.

I don't always live in this world, but I seem to whenever I have even a few minutes to let my mind wander. It's not interfering with my work, family and friends, or anything like that, but it is sort of getting on my nerves.

I think I do this as a way to try and keep depressive thoughts at bay, but I'm no expert. That being said, what sorts of things can I do to stop this, or at least lessen it?"
1276,How do I stop feeling insecure about my anxiety?,"I [M23] have always had mild anxiety issues but this past week I’ve had intense anxiety episodes that have left me feeling weak. I’ve started online dating after being single for 7 years and these episodes have made me feel unattractive and not good enough for women, although I’m confident in myself otherwise."
1277,Hearing thoughts (?),"So... what it says on the title, this just happen to me when I'm going to bed, I just hear thoughts, not voices, I hear them like if was one of my thoughts, but they're not because sometimes I can't control them. These thoughts are mostly like the voice of TV shows character or people I know saying things that doesn't make sense at all. So I wanted to know if it's something normal or something I'd should be worried about"

1279,I always want to be anywhere but where I am.,"I don't know what it is, I just can't stay in one place for too long. No matter where I go, after all a short while I just feel this overwhelming need to be somewhere else. I've moved house several times this year, as well as staying with family and friends a lot, because no matter where I go, it's only a matter of time until I just can't handle being there anymore. Sometimes just staying away for a few days works, but often it needs to be more permanent. I don't know how to stay settled anywhere or why I feel like this everywhere I go."
1280,Overthinkining,"Overthinking is the art of creating problems that weren’t even there. 

Overthinking is parasitic. It’s viral. It’s deadly. Letting yourself all victim to overthinking doesn’t just kill your happiness, your enjoyment... but it destroys who you are. The mind is a beautiful and complex thing, and the only person who can hurt it is yourself. 

You need to control it. Realise that you cannot control everything. Stop worrying and stressing yourself about what you should have or could have done differently in the past, and find peace in the present. 

It’s time to just be happy. Being sad, angry, and overthinking isn’t worth it anymore. Just let things flow. Be positive.

I haven't gone for 10 weeks, I've been visited by the school counselor, and a really nice teacher. They know my situation but have to expel me because that is far too much time taken off school.

My Mum and her big mouth will probably spread it around, my aunties and nan will be extremely dissapointed, and say I turned out like my sisters. My father will be devastated and probably shout and scream at me. My friends will be shocked but move on. My sisters will tell me how important school is and how they wish they could go back.

1285,What Happened to me Last Night?,"Hi everybody, I hope you're all doing well! Essentially what I'm asking about it a weird series of intrusive thoughts and hallucinations that I experienced last night and am confused about. It was terrifying both because of the thoughts and things I was seeing themselves but also because I didn't know what it was. I was aware that everything was figments of my imagination, but that didn't really stop me from believing what was happening was real in some cases. Now into the thoughts and hallucinations themselves,

So I started trying to fall asleep at 1am last night after a day at my cottage which I hate because there are so many bugs there and I think I may have a phobia of most bugs (there's some exceptions that I'm not scared of), especially spiders (which I know are technically arachnids but bare with me haha). As I started to fall asleep for the first 45 minutes or so my dreams (well not fully dreams because I wasn't quite asleep yet) would subconsciously shift over to images of bugs sometimes and i would get short-lasting images of bugs intruding in my dreams but for those 45 minutes I could do what I normally do and 'change the channel' of my dreams to make them go away. For the following 15 minutes it was much worse. At that point I began to feel very paranoid and scared because I couldn't remove the images from my mind, everything that happened in any thought or dream was related to these terrifying images of bugs. One specific scene that kept recurring was of this weird spider-ant hybrid (which are 2 of the things I'm most afraid of) walking around and twisting. By the end of the 15 minutes all I could see was a whole bunch of bugs lined up in neat rows, all moving their legs. I tried to open my eyes to make it stop but my room is pitch black so the thoughts could continue. At this point I was also convinced that even though I needed to pee, if I got up, the floor would be like the floor at the cottage and covered with bugs. I rolled over and went on TikTok for about 15 minutes which actually did help me distract myself so by the time I decided I needed to get up to pee I only half believed the whole thing about bugs on the floor. Obviously there weren't actually any but I did see things moving out of the corners of my eyes that I could have sworn were bugs but when I turned my head there was nothing there. I went back to bed and lied on my back with the sheets very tight around me which is how I feel safest and fell back asleep (though it took awhile because I was very shaken up) and this morning I was fine so I'm super weirded out. 

If something like this has ever happened to anyone else and knows what it was, or if anyone just has an idea, I'd love to hear it because it was quite scary"
1286,Need advice on where to start,"Tl;dr: self absorbed, niceguy, victim complexed, narcissist wants to grow up emotionally and not hurt friends or others anymore. 

(I don't know this sub well, so if this type of post is not allowed, and someone could direct me to a better place to post it, please just let me know.)

Hi all... I (35M) need to work on my mental health, and definitely will need help, but I don't know where or how to start.

I feel like I've been a ""nice guy"" in denial for a long time.  Just lost a girlfriend I thought I was going to propose to because I got drunk and was super mean to her pointing out the ways she was rude to me.  Not the first time with her or with previous girlfriends.  No way to fix it with her, so I've decided I need to try to work on fixing me.

I've done therapy before after having panic attacks to discuss anxiety.  It may have been just a poor fit, but mostly the guy was just like a buddy and tried to point out where I was in the right while I was trying to blame myself.  Obviously, it was nice to have someone not beat me up, but I think it more so just made enabled me to continue acting selfishly because someone condoned it.  Or we would talk about shitty things that happened in my past and how they affected me and are still affecting me now... but we would never get to a ""solution"" or how to change it.  The engineer in me does not like problems without solutions.  So I would usually just leave a session angry at someone for something they did 20 years ago that I just now realized was not cool.

Growing up, I was super shy and always worried about what people thought of me (still do).  I was good in school, good at lots of sports, but never good at making or having friends.  People always told me I was boring. I was good at following directions, never got in trouble, never drank, just tried to do what I was ""supposed to"" and be nice to everyone.  But I mostly just got picked on and made fun of for various things (too many freckles, too good of grades, too short, too whatever).  I feel like this made me always very observant of slights or what I perceived as slights against me - probably to the point that I invent them.  But I hold onto them and don't know how to let them go.  And if an argument comes up with that person or something that's enough to make me stop bottling them in, I let them all out in a very rude, blunt way. Alcohol definitely exacerbates this now.

To clarify, I definitely drink too much, and am trying to stop. And most of these instances of me being a jerk involve me having had enough alcohol for my emotional filter to be down.  But the alcohol isn't the root of my issues.  So I'm trying to concentrate internally rather than on that external accomplice - and I don't want to just blame the alcohol and move on like I'm without fault.

I want to try to figure out why I have these built up frustrations and resentments that I hold onto - why I even have it in me to turn into this asshole monster.  This will probably sound ""nice guy""-ey, but when I'm not drinking, I'm usually very selfless and kind to everyone.  I really like to make other people happy (back to the always worried what people think about me). But then at the same time I keep ""score"" of these nice things I do for others, and use this as a ""valid"" excuse to be upset about small perceived slights.  I don't know how to change a mindset.  But I truly want to help others just to be kind, without thinking that means they ""owe"" me something.

I know that it is ok to be upset with someone or something, but I want to be able to communicate that in a healthy, non hurtful way.  

Separately, I'm simultaneously completely lacking self-confidence and I'm completely full of myself in my head (think I'm so smart, so athletic, so great).  It's an odd thing to put into words, and to struggle with. But I also think this adds to my perceived ""victim complex"" where I think everyone is slighting me or thinking negatively about me, and makes me perceive/create even *more* false slights.

I know a lot of this was shaped by my past (childhood, parents, etc.).  Discussed a lot of that with my previous therapist.  But I don't want to just blame that or be a ""victim"" of my past.  I don't know how to grow or change.  But I want to.  I don't want to be bitter, old, and alone, and blaming everyone and everything else for my problems (like my dad).  I don't want to worry that my ""true"" (jaded by my perceived/made up slights) feelings for someone will come out if I get angry.  Mostly, I don't want to have lost this girl and this relationship and not tried to improve from it.  She deserves that much, at least.  I don't mean that in a ""maybe if I do all this, I can get her back"".  I mean that she was always trying to help me be better.  I owe it to her as a friend to actually try to be better.

Anyway, I say all that to ask if someone could point me in a direction.  I can find another therapist (although I'm in a country where English isn't the primary language, so there's a slight barrier), and I guess that's where I should start.  But I didn't feel like I got what I needed out of it before (e.g., yes, I know it's my fault, but what does truly taking responsibility *mean*? how do I improve my emotional maturity? yes, I understand that my dad saying that 20 years ago sucked and led to me feeling this way... but how do I *fix* it now?)

1294,What's happening?,"tl;dr: There is something wrong, or something is going to be wrong, and I don't know if I can stop it.

Over the past 18-24 months:

I am distraced more and more easily, but I don't even realize it.  This makes driving extremely difficult.  I am going to stop driving until I get this figured out.

I can't remember things like names.  I used to be reall, really good at that.  But now, they are just fleeting.  In the past four days I've met four people, three of which I live with (Just moved in), and a downstairs neighbor.  In a matter of hours I forgot her name.  She called me by name: ""Hello, [name].""  It took me several seconds to answer back because I tried to recall her name and just couldn't.  I settled on ""hello"".  This is disturbing to me.  Also, I can't remember 2 out of the 3 I live with, let alone their dogs. 

I have lost time.  Sometimes it was only a few minutes, then days, then weeks.  I mean, I just can't remember it.  I know this can happen, but it seems to be getting worse and more alarming.  I was talking with someone and they asked how old I was.  I said 36 and gave my birthday.  They gave me theirs, which was after mine, and said they were 37.  I questioned them, then myself.  I used a calendar calculator from google and it said 37 years old.  Guys: *I lost an entire YEAR of my life!!*  I legitimately thought I was 36.  Now I'm in fear.

I increasinly cannot remember what I am *about* to say.  I simply forget it.  If I have a thought, I have to voice it or just let it go if someone interjects because if I get distracted then my forthcoming thought is just gone.  That scares me.

There's more, but I think I've made the point.  Something is happening and it's getting worse.  I've had memory problems since I was 20, but it was little things, like ""where did I put my keys?"" and the like.  I can't pinpoint where or when things started getting worse.

Just for clarification, I don't use drugs.  I've tried a few, and of those, only a few times or even just once.  Wasn't my thing so I never did it again.  I have drank a lot of alcohol, but not overmuch.  I am not an alcoholic, I drink to take the edge off.  Rarely do I drink to get drunk. 

My creativity doesn't suffer.  I can play, write and study music (even if the studying escapes me at times and I need to refresh.)  I can write books; I'm working on several ideas.  Other things like that, I can come up with quickly and retain them really well.  I do this often.

I can remember conversations, from long ago and recently, with great acuity and I can even correct people about who said what.

I am confused and increasingly scared.  I don't have health insurance, but I need to be examined, somehow.

This took me more than 30 minutes to type because I have to think really hard about what I *wanted* to say, but those thoughts were elusive.

One thing that has always scared me from a very young age is the possibility of alzheimers or dementia or something like that, even though it doesn't run in my family.  Those are *terrible,* but I am beginning to wonder if I'm deveolping something.  I don't want to live my life in that kind of state.

I need to say that in my life I have experiened a lot of sleeplessness.  That began at a very young age, and it was, from my own research, due to an imbalance of good life quality. About 6 years ago, I went 4 days with only one hour of sleep a night.  That landed me in the hospital.  But the older I got, the better it got, until recently.  I've been going entire nights without sleep.

Also, I have experienced long periods (3-4 years) of extreme stress.  The kind that gives me (diagnosed) anxiety, loss of sleep, and physiological affects: muscles in my back hurting like they were gripped with a vice and twisted; elevated (and hard) heatbeats for up to 5 minutes; raised body temp; sweating; and dizziness so much that I have to sit down.  Not to mention all the issues previously stated.

I'm sure I've forgotten some things.

I'm afraid."

1298,Health Anxiety/hypochondria support.,"Hi everyone. I was told by a friend to reach out to speak to others who suffer from this. I was diagnosed in my early teens with hypochondria and severe anxiety disorder. Looking back, I was having these thoughts and feelings way before that. Even as a child. Doing some research most people get this due to a traumatic event (ex: death of a family member) but I can’t recall a single thing that could have possible triggered this. Can you be just born with it ? 
I recall my first ever major panic attack. I was in the 6th grade and our teacher passed us all around random newspaper clipping and told us to write a paragraph about what we learned. I picked up a random one and it was about lung cancer and second hand smoke. As I’m reading it I get really anxious and start the sweat. I get a lump in my throat and start crying. I couldn’t breath. It’s like as I was reading these symptoms , I started to actually FEEL them. I completely freaked. My teacher thought I was having an asthma attack. 
As I got older and obviously had access to the internet. It got so much worse. The darkest place I’ve ever been in mentally was age 15-17. I spend almost everyday in constant misery. Waking up and doing body checks. Every week it was something different. Everyday I was googling. I never wanted to seek help because one situation made me scared to do so. I was in the 9th grade and as I was sitting in class, I could feel myself being hyper focused on whatever body sensation was happening. I removed myself from class because I didn’t want to make a scene. I sobbed my way to the school counselor and explained to her what I was feeling. She looked me in the eyes and asked “are you making this up for attention?” 
I was speechless and just walked out. Ever since I’ve felt completely alone. I felt like I was insane. At some points it felt like I was going to seriously lose my mind. 
Obviously due to recent events, I can feel myself slipping back to that dark place again and I’m terrified. Sometimes I’m more scared of my mind at this point. I dread waking up and going through this cycle. I guess I don’t really know where this post is going. Maybe just to hear stories of others who have this. I just feel incredibly alone and I have Medicaid so finding mental health services are hard. I’ve been reaching out to those who accept my insurance but have been denied because I’m not suicidal. (Yes I was actually told that) 
Just feels like a lot of people take health anxiety as a joke. I feel like I’m stuck in my own misery and I literally can’t stop the thoughts. Feel free to share your stories. Thoughts. Opinions. 

I just don’t want this to last forever. But so far, it seems that it will."
1299,"Is it normal to feel like you're being spied on/watched and judged by people that doesn't actually exist around you? and if not, what illness that might be?","I feel like those people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities (like going to the toilet) what I do or how I do a certain thing, and I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to, I stopped taking pictures of myself because I think I look foolish if I do so (?), and I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications to them regarding what I’m doing. I know no one is watching me- I get that, really, but I just can’t help it."

Now that im done with school and vacation has started i think their burden(me) is finally gone. Like no one has tried to make contact its always me. The people i thought of as best friends doesnt even talk to me.

I have had a rant before about how im always paranoid about people hating me. I am starting to think thats true.

1307,Does anyone else ever doubt the legitimacy of their condition?,"I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple of weeks ago.

Since the diagnosis, I’ve been questioning whether or not it’s real, like my doctor possibly got it wrong and I’m actually fine. It’s difficult to explain and I haven’t been able to find anything else on here where people feel the same

On the days I’m really depressed I feel numb, hopeless and convinced that this has been how I’ve always felt, and that it’s permanent.

However I also have days where I feel slightly content. I almost forget I’ve ever felt depressed, and that I’m somehow fixed, and I’m silly for ever bothering the doctor. Then before I know it, in a few hours / the next day I’m back to feeling hopeless and anxious. 

Not really sure what I’m asking here, I guess I’m just trying to see if anyone can relate and maybe give some reassurance. 

I even got prescribed medication and therapy but still my mind convinces myself I’m faking it and don’t need these things - all because some days I feel okay and I’m not crying 24/7."

So here I am today after a lovely weekend with the guy i'm seeing, waiting to get the bus home and I just feel like i want to break down and cry. Even though things are good everything feels so uncertain. My life has been devoted to getting myself out of the situation I was in, now that has happened i feel lost. 

The guy i've started seeing may be leaving the country (for good). Although I like my job I know I don't want to do it forever. I feel like I don't really have a home or belong.

1317,I was Sober All Day Yesterday! (And I didn't have to be),"Edit: My current partner is awesome and they help me become better every day

I wanted to share with this subreddit something that I'm actually genuinely proud of. I don't have a good group of people around me to talk to about substance use or behavioural addiction- most people don't know I struggle. 

I recently got out of an abusive relationship (we were engaged) and ended up relapsing into substance abuse. I was smoking, vaping, and drinking non-stop from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed. Then I relapsed into SH and my Eating Disorder. That is to say, after living with my fiancé in Fl, coming home was unraveling. 

Yesterday I started watching my partner's cats while they went out of town, and they left me beer, wine, and weed. I was completely alone in the house, no repercussions would face me. The urges were higher than they've ever been and to top it all off my ex-fiancé decided to call me from an unblocked number. But still, I didn't drink. I didn't smoke. Didn't vape. 

I felt like I finally regained a part of myself I had lost in my previous relationship. For the first time in YEARS, I feel genuinely proud of myself. 

TL;DR: I didn't do drugs yesterday and I feel proud of myself for the first time in YEARS


Thank you guys! This sub has helped a lot and all of you mean the world to me!"

He is two days clean and currently staying with family, but the delusions won't stop. He definitely needs to get help but is convinced that doctors and psychiatrists want to harm and manipulate him and we all just trust them because we've already been manipulated 

What do you think is the best way to engage with him right now? It's no point telling him that he's delusional because we aren't to be trusted. I'm also afraid of engaging in his delusions for fear that it will make them worse

-I’m not allowed to live on campus in the fall after being cooped up at home for MONTHS all bc of COVID. Everyone has tried to make this easier for me, but it’s not. 

-i can’t go one day without being lectured about failing my first midterm in the same summer class. 


Like i feel that life would be easier if i was dead.

1327,Question about ADD and stimulants?,So most of my life since probably around 5-6th grade I’ve struggled with social anxiety and motivation problems. Back then I didn’t know it but I was soon diagnosed with GAD and a couple months later ADD. The first medication I was put on was a SSRI to see if that helped the anxiety. I went through about six different SSRI medications none of them worked. My doctor decided to try Adderall to see if it would help me focus more at school. I knew what adderall was and the risk of addiction it has but I ignored it and later didn’t seem to be a problem . The first pill I took was amazing it was like something clicked In my head and everything wrong with me was fixed. I could finally keep my grades up and talking to people witch was a huge struggle for me was incredibly easy. Long story short it stopped helping and I stopped taking it. Years later with no tolerance to stimulants or caffeine I decide to have a cup of tea. I don’t drink caffeine unless I work and I haven’t worked in a while. After i drank the tea I started to feel my focus increase and talking to people because easier. I’ve also suffered from mild depression the last month or so and I have noticed my mood increase dramatically. Could stimulants actually fix my neurotransmitter imbalance? Could my anxiety and other mental health issues be a result of my ADD?

1330,Desire to socially isolate myself (unrelated to covid),"Some background stuff: i have a diagnosis of psychosis and ocd. I have also considered whether i am somewhere on the autism spectrum. Temperamentally im an introvert, and also socially anxious.

For many years now, i feel a very deep instinct to fully isolate myself. I have even romanticised about the lifestyle of medieval religious hermits, walled into a tiny room that they never leave, so that they spend their whole lives in solitude, reflecting.

I actually feel an urge to pull away from current social relationships, including with friends, and romantic partner.

I fantasise about moving to a foreign country where i have no contacts, and living a very traditional lifestyle in full solitude.

What the hell is going on here?? I dont know if its what i genuinely want, and its just a part of my identity, or whether its linked to trauma and MI, and if i need to work on this impulse...

1332,Unable to connect with best friend since trauma?,"Lately I feel disconnected from one of my best friends and am wondering if it has to do with going through some traumatic stuff. I was in an abusive relationship for a year and isolated myself from most of my friends and family. After getting out, I reconnected with old friends but it has been difficult to relate to them/be myself around them now. I find it easier to get along with people I met more recently through work because they were in my life when I was going through the abusive relationship. Anyway, that experience changed me and I feel more emotionally guarded/have a weird and dark sense of humor because of it. Which makes me feel “different” and like an outsider around my best friend who didn’t really know me like that before. I feel more normal around friends who share that same cynicism, because it’s a way to cope and feel okay but I just feel like a negative and bad person when I express that part of myself because they don’t share the same sense of humor.

My mom has severe OCD though.

For the past 2 years, I feel like like some  people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way, haha. Practicing my religious beliefs? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 
I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost. And very recently I smelled a hideous smell twice in two different places. The first time was in my grandma’s house two weeks ago, I’ve smelled it the whole night for no reason. And the second time was two days ago in my house, again for no reason and it was the exact same smell.

But to those that haven't found that help yet, I'm sorry. Deeply sorry. I wouldn't wish mental illness on anyone. Not my worst enemies, not the worst of people. It is so exhausting and terrible to have to live like that.

No one, and I mean no one, should have to fight their own mind to stay alive and well. No one should have to spend years of their life so depressed they can't even get out of bed.

I strongly encourage all of you to keep moving forward and find your happiness or whatever it is you need to live a healthy and happy life. I know how hard it can be, but I promise, you've got this. 

It's a beautiful world out there, I know that's hard to see right now for some of you, but one day you'll see how truly amazing it is, and how amazing YOU are. 

Please, please, do not give up. If you ever need someone to talk to please message me. We are all one in the same, and we can all get through this, no matter how hard shit gets. But no matter what, just keep pushing.

1342,"For Every Minute You Are Angry, You Lose 60 Seconds Of Happiness","
I get it, I understand. You can always say “be happy”, “put a smile on your face” to someone, it is much easier said than done. But, my goal for each day is to ensure that at least ONE person can smile or change the negative aspects that they have. Of course, more the better. 

It will be an impossible task, but I want each member of this sub to be happy, to feel the need to be here, to be positive and happy when they are at the lowest of the low. Some people will laugh this off, while others will continue to read on and listen to what I have got to say.... I hope you are one of those. 

When it comes to being HAPPY, there are 7 key steps;

- Think Less, Feel More
- Frown Less, Smile More
- Talk Less, Listen More
- Judge Less, Accept Mor
- Watch Less, Do More
- Complain Less, Appreciate More
- Fear Less, Love More

As John Lennon once said.... 

**”When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down “happy”. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life”.**"
1343,Getting rid of the feeling that you have to do everything in your life in the next 5-10years.,I recently turned 19 and I have the feeling that I have to to everything in my life in the next couple of years and that my life will be over when I am like 30. This feeling especially weights on my because I do not know what I want to do in my future.(I have got 1 year of school left). How can I overcome or lessen this feeling?:)
1344,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, I'm a 20 year old guy and I'm generally quite an anxious person in every day life. My girlfriend of 3 years and I split up recently and since then my anxiety has gotten a lot worse to the point my heart is pounding and my hands are shaking while typing this, I enjoy working out but now afterwards I feel physically sick whereas I never did before. I also have a dry mouth constantly and have a sense of impending doom like something awful is going to happen.

If anyone has dealt with anything like this before or has any information or tips to help me control it I would be very grateful as it's starting to affect my social and work life."
1345,My mums just said some things that make me worried for her mental condition and I dont know what to do.,"Tldr: worried my mums developing paranoia.


I'm currently visiting my mother(55). Shes been seeing this new guy, Ill call him T from here on out. T seems like a decent enough guy and has always treated my mum nicely but from what I can tell he had a criminal past,  he hints at it but doesn't really talk about.


A couple months ago my mum started getting worried her facebook had been hacked, she thought memes were being targeted at her and was just generally worried about a lot of Internet stuff that she didn't understand and for some reason she thought T was behind it. She hadn't been hacked and T is also completely computer illiterate. Some of the things she was saying sounded a bit paranoid but I ended up chalking it up to someone new to technology and social media who didn't understand it.


Now to the present, we were just randomly having a conversation and I asked her some questions about T, and she started acting a bit funny, gesturing at me to be quiet as if someone was listening. We were the only ones in the house so I pressed a bit but she had walked away at this point, but every time I said Ts name she looked a bit worried, I straight up asked her ""do you think someones bugged the house?"" She just said ""I dont wanna talk about it"".


These are the only times ive seen behaviour that has worried me. Am I the one being paranoid or are these causes for concern? My mum is incredibly head strong and stubborn, shed be the last person to admit she had any mental issues which worries me even more. I dunno what to do."

1350,Becoming abusive,"Im becoming increasingly abusive twords my wife. Ive been having fits where I lose control. Its reached its peak last week when in the car when I screamed in my wifes face, called her names pulled her glasses off while she was driving and threatened to break them then ripped the rear view mirror right off the window. My daughter got scared and started crying and I yelled at her to shut up. I could have caused an accident and hurt us in my reckless anger. I am so scared and ashamed of what I have done. My wife has forgiven me and wants to move forward but I cant. It was the worst thing Ive ever done and I never thought I was capable of that level of abuse. Thinking about it and what could have happened brings me to tears and I have fallen into a depression over it. I have even contemplated suicide. Im becoming terrified of myself and dont know what to do. I know Im a piece of shit and dont need endless comments reminding me, Im just genuinely scared and looking for any kind of advice or help"
1351,What to think ?,[deleted]
1352,The worst afternoon of my life,"Today was going really well- I woke up around 9 and mowed the lawn, then swam in my pool with my mom and dad for a few hours. We then ate some brisket for dinner and I lay down for a nap.

I wake up hearing my mom screaming ""STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!!!"" a whole lot. I quickly get up and my first thought is that I need to hide because there's an intruder and I'm a 14 year old defenseless girl in a t-shirt and plaid sweatpants. And then I hear my brother and dad arguing, my brother going into his room, and my dad yelling some more as he stomped up the stairs. He started cursing at my older brother and trying to get in his room so he can beat his ass.

I move past my dad to see my mom on the stairs trying to make my dad stop while he's calling my brother names. She briefly tells me ""they were arguing, your dad pushed him, he swung at him (punch) and then they were fighting."" 

I don't know what to do. I knew my family wanted to kick my older brother out for being rude and never pulling his own weight but I never thought I would wake up to hear something so traumatic.

And now it gets worse. My mom tried talking to my brother while he packed. He had a meltdown, sobbing and punching his desktop saying he was ""so fucking tired of it"". When my mom asked what he was tired of he said ""he (My dad) is ABUSIVE! He's ABUSIVE and you fucking KNOW IT! BUT YOU'RE TOO SCARED TO SAY IT!"" My mom wasn't saying anything back. I ended up crying into her a bit before she left to pull up my brother's car and I told him the only reason she isn't talking is because she KNOWS he is correct. My dad has always had extreme anger issues but he had never hit a member of our family before.

I don't know how to feel or what to do. I'm scared and sobbing and shaking and everything just feels awful.


If you want more details please just ask. And PLEASE do not tell me to call 911. My mom was going to anyway but now the fight is over and my brother is packing up"
1353,My 11 y/o daughter told me she was sad and was going to kill herself but then she changed her mind. What do I do?,"My 11 year old daughter sent me a text message to come to her room. I walked in and she was sitting on the floor with a knife beside her. She had cut her hair off and was crying. I asked her why she cut her hair and she said because she was going to kill herself and wanted to cut her hair before she died because it’s something she always wanted to do but then she changed her mind and didn’t want to kill herself anymore but she is still sad and wants to die if she’s going to keep being sad but doesn’t actually want to die or kill herself. She said she isn’t sad all the time but she does feel sad every day. I am a SAHM, her dad works out of the house, and we also have an 8 year old son. What should I do? I have no idea what to do?"
1354,Im just ranting don't mind me,Ptsd from childhood. Gay. I crossdress and want 2 be a girl growing upl yea im weird whatever. Neglected whole life my dad was drunk and doing drugs and mum was pretty much the same. I had 2 teach myself right from wrong bullied for being myself at home and at school. Never had a real friend nor relationship I can't relate with anyone. Never had money growing up still don't not that I care for money that much anyway. Im like 2 people in my head I'm so insecrure about my interests im scared 2 open up feel like its impossible 2 be myself. I had a rough life and it shows people think Im a asshole but they don't even know me. All I know is this im not a bad person ive never started a fight never builled anyone except when i was like 4 and still feel bad about it im always nice 2 people m pretty sane considering my life i don't do drugs I drink sometimes I exercise dance play keyboard and yet im lossing my mind the older i get the more confused im am about myself i can't thinking about my problems everyone ik is depressed I can't do it anymore
1355,Am I a bad friend for being happy that my friend just quit there job,My best friend quit her job today because she didn’t like it. For context we are both 17 and she had 2 jobs and I don’t have one. She liked to tease me with the fact she had 2 jobs and I didn’t have one (I used to have a job but quit February this year to work on my mental health). Her teasing often made me feel bad because she could hold down 2 jobs and I couldn’t even manage one. However she just told me she quit one of her jobs because she didn’t like it. I’m happy she’s quit the job but not because she hated it I’m happy because now she can’t tease me about her having 2 jobs. Should I only be happy about her quitting because she didn’t like the job? Am I a bad friend for being happy about her quitting her job purely for the reason that she can’t tease me with it anymore?
1356,Auditory hallucinations...?,"Please note: I know the reputation personality disorders have in general psychiatry and also I am a mental health specialist 

I have a long-standing diagnosis of EUPD/BPD and depression. These are both clinically treated and generally stable aside the occasional relapse and need for treatment, for which I now respond really well to 50mg of Sertraline. I’m 24 and I’ve been within mental health services since I was 18, I’ve had these disanoses set in stone since I was around 20-21. I have been on numerous anti depressants with different mechanisms of action and also Quetiapine, an anti psychotic which also has anti depressant properties which worked well for slowing my thoughts down and helping me take control for my behaviours but it gave me the worst headache and I could not function. For the last 2-3 years I have been experiencing chronic but fleeting auditory hallucinations. It’s difficult to explain but I will use my knowledge to describe these episodes: 

-(when stressed) I hear birds chirping extremely loudly. I wear ear plugs to sleep with and I find myself taking them out and listening really really hard and looking out of the window despite the time because they are so convincing to me. This isn’t a regular occurrence which I’m grateful for but I do find it distressing when it occurs and usually have to stay awake until I just fall asleep regardless... 

-I hear crowds. I found an audio that is spot on from a Tiktok and found so much comfort I’m not alone. I can never quite make out what they are saying it’s general crowd chatter, mixed genders and voices but it’s not internal this is mostly external and becomes a little anxiety provoking to even think of internally as a thought now. 

- when walking I will often hear people behind me and be convinced that someone is behind me. They’re not. This makes me feel on edge all the time, I’m so convinced but no one is there. I actually end up feeling a little relief when someone is! I can often hear them like a rustling or a movement or something but they aren’t there. 

- when listening to music the words and speech begins to float outside my head and feels like I’m listening to a radio instead. This one really freaks me out and I check my headphone jack and take out my head phones. It’s happened a few times again when I’m on my own with my thoughts but fully conscious. 

Ironically music can sometimes help drown out really clear external noises that I know aren’t there or are proven are not there. 

In general I’m a really jumpy person, I see things in the corner of my eye and jump, I’m paranoid something will happen to me for no reason at all. The only thing that stops me feeling I need an anti psychotic is my insight, but then again do I need to treat this if it is distressing me? 

My heads a bit of a mess as I have just been on a walk (normal) but experienced most of these things, especially the voices in the music drifting outside the headphones and become outside and all around me and feeling distressed. Apologises for spelling errors I just want some reassurance as to what on Earth I should do. I still have a community psychiatrist and I don’t know whether to get in touch with her or not. 

EDIT: I should mention I have a strong family history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder on my mothers side, and my father has always been a paranoid person. He developed dementia and became extremely suspicious and paranoid, and now is treated on Risperidone. 

Thanks in advance!"
1357,Anyone else feel like a bad friend because of having mental illness?,For the past month and counting I’ve been having really bad dissociation episodes due to some recent (Albeit traumatic) life changes and it’s been causing me to be way more forgetful than usual. I’m pretty forgetful but it’s never this bad. I don’t remember half of anything my friends tell me and it’s leading them to think I don’t care. My family already thinks I don’t care about them because of this. I can’t remember for shit. I truly have to write everything down or else I won’t know. I’m forgetting faces as well. Everyone is just blending in one. I’m literally confused at this point. I’m such a bad friend because a friend could tell me that we’re supposed to do xyz and I’ll cancel at the last minute because I forgot again. I’ve completely lost sense of time. Anyone else struggling with this? Just being completely lost in the sauce and feeling bad because you fuck people over?

1359,How to help my bf better understand my depression,"I(21f) have clinical depression and I admit I let it control me more than I should most times. I just moved in with my bf(25m) and in these 3 months living together he’s noticed it a lot. I work part time so I usually have 3 days off a week and don’t go in to work till later in the day. I have no motivation or energy to do anything so those days I don’t work or work late, I will sleep all day. I know I have stuff to do like walk the dogs, eat, or even just clean the house and I lay there telling myself I have stuff to do. But I just lay there. So it’s a little upsetting for him to get home knowing that I’ve been home all day or only worked a few hours and see that the house is a mess still. We’ve talked about it a lot , And he’s trying to be understanding but it’s extremely frustrating for him. He says he wouldn’t even be mad about the house if I still did something with my day, like did a hobby or something. I used to love playing my video games, playing with my dog and coloring. He says if I was just doing something like that all day then he wouldn’t care that the house wasn’t clean, as long as I was doing something with my day. I get headaches a lot through the week, and sometimes they make me feel so sick that I feel like I can’t go in to work so I call out. This upsets him because he thinks I’m overreacting and being a crybaby and says that there are people every day I feel what I feel or worse I still manage to function and go to work. There’s also days where my anxiety acts up and I know that I’m going to have a panic attack at some point so I choose to play it safe and stay home, which is something else he thinks I can also just get over. I know he’s not trying to say it in a rude way but sometimes he gets upset and tells me to just stop being a crybaby and suck it up like an adult. He’s really trying to be understanding and help me through it all but I feel like he’s not able to do that because he doesn’t have an understanding of what I’m going through. He thinks it’s just me feeling sorry for myself all the time and being sad and lazy. Is there some sort of article or something that explains it’s not something people just get over, that it’s an actual imbalance in my brain? I tried medication to help but some days I just couldn’t bring myself to take my medicine even though I knew I had to, so I gave up on that. We are trying to just get me to do more activities with him to see if it helps motivate me, but I just want him to understand how hard it is for me and what I’m going through without thinking I’m being overdramatic."
1360,When ever I'm frustrated I want to self harm,"I've been clean since November and I'm trying, I don't want to relapse. I know I will be fine and I won't go back. But whenever I get really Annoyed or angry or I can't figure something out it just makes me want to go back...

I recently lost my switch and it's bringing back those urges. I know it's stupid to think about relapsing bc you can't find your video game. But it's has really helped me keep my mind off of things and pass time.

Anyways that was my vent. Kinda dumb but I just wanted to get it off my chest"

1362,A question about inner talk,"Just wanted to ask reddit and see how many other people do this: 

I very frequently have conversations with myself in my head. Sometimes with myself, just debating particular subjects or working out problems or trying to decide what to have for dinner. This i'm sure almost everyone does. But also often with other people, usually friends, family members or acquaintances that aren't actually present. I want to preface this by saying that I defintely don't think these conversations are real, or feel like those people are there when they aren't. Its not a delusion or hallucination, im fully aware that they aren't there and that it isn't a real conversation, and I dont have issues separating that from reality. Its also not out loud but just in my mind. 

But its just so frequent for me, basically anytime my mind isn't directly occupied with some task that requires my full attention, im day dreaming of hypothetical conversations. Perhaps im thinking of cooking a certain dish and discussing the steps and what i could add with a friend I know also likes to cook, or talking about what im doing differently with my budget with another friend I know has issues budgeting, and so on. Its been this way really as long as I can remember. I've never really thought about it until now, since ive been struggling with anxieties focused on my health, both physical and mental, and I get worried that maybe this is a sign of a mental disorder. Do lots of other redditors do this? Or am I slowly going crazy lol."

1368,Is there a mental block that stops numbers from making sense?,"I’m not sure if this is the right sub to ask this, so please point me to where I should go if I’m in the wrong place. 

I’ve always had a really hard time with numbers. I can’t seem to do simple division (apart from anything from the 2 and 5 times tables), I cannot wrap my head around fractions or percentages. I can add and subtract smaller numbers just fine, but larger numbers are often wrong. 

When someone starts talking to me about numbers I often feel like my brain gets overwhelmed and I get completely lost.

Whenever I pay for something, I simply cannot calculate how much I need to pay so I’m often given back extra notes/coins or asked for more.

These are just a few examples of many and I’ve often wondered if I was just really bad at math or if this was some sort of thing that exists. 

Last Friday, my partner spent over an hour trying to explain to me how long division works and how I could divide fractions, even though I learned all of it in school. I still don’t get the fractions. It just made me start wondering if there’s something going on here. I know that people have difficulties remembering faces and names and such, so it doesn’t seem too far off. 

Does such a thing exist and what do we know about it?

How do I know if I have this issue and how do I work on it?"

Recovered alcoholic (Sober since 02/17/2020) Started drinking at 16. Drank heavily (5-10 drinks per day) from about 21 years old to 25 years old. 

Diagnosed with ADHD, currently unmedicated as the IR stimulants made me feel like having a heart attack. Very hard to focus, very inefficient person. Triggered my anxiety. 

Suspicion of PTSD (sex related trauma from childhood) I have frequent flashbacks, BAD premature ejaculation, have no trust, phobia of intimacy and intercourse. I am tired of turning down people that I genuinely am attracted to. I run away from the situations while it’s the thing I want most in the world. Basically what happened is my first intimate partner pretended to be pregnant, then pretended to have miscarriaged said baby by smearing period blood all over the walls, then later pretended my best friend raped her. She then pretended to develop schizophrenia (or perhaps that part is real, I think it was but who the fuck knows) and would cry and say she saw visions of me as a small child walking behind me irl or lurking in shadows. She became incredibly promiscuous and vengeful when I broke up with her, telling the entire school I raped her and hit her. My mom even had to meet with the school’s admins about this. I was 14-16 years old during this experience. 

Suspicion of aspergers. Intense interests, low empathy. I feel like I use intellect instead of intuition during conversations. Easily overwhelmed especially when there’s a lot of sounds/people talking. I am burnt out more than I feel rested, seemingly much more than most people. It’s weird, I’m always lonely but I’m annoyed when I’m around anybody. I don’t know if I’ve actually felt love for anyone, except for the person who caused my traumatizing experience.  I HATE change and any deviation from my routines. 

Suspicion of GAD. I have a lot of anxiety. I’ve had 2-3 really really bad panic attacks where I’m positive I’m dying of a heart attack (and felt weirdly relieved at the thought of dying). I also have small panic attacks several days out of the week where it feels like my blood pressure plummets, my left arm and heart feel numb/light pressure and I get dizzy. But i can usually talk myself out of those panic attacks. Also sometimes I get panic attacks while thinking about panic attacks so let’s move on.


I can’t remember the last time I felt happy, or felt comfortable. Durning lockdown was the only time in my life, since I was a child, where the pace of being alive felt right. Otherwise everything moves way too quick.

Lastly, I feel displaced. Mom lives in Germany, dad lives in USA. I lived in both places, but don’t feel like either are home. I have zero close friends and dislike my family except my parents. 

I have a check up soon with a new GP. Last check up was over 4 years ago. Any tips on how to help him help me? I don’t want to overwhelm the guy xD Should I perhaps try an extended release adderall or a nonstimilant variant like strattera for adhd symptoms? 

Any tips on getting closer to people and becoming less afraid of sex? The premature ejaculation (and resulting fear of being judged harshly due to poor sexual performance) plays a big role in this. 

I guess the general big question is do I do therapy, medication, a mix of both?

My father says I shouldn’t seek any kind of medication and that I strictly have PTSD from being sexually abused. He doesn’t want me to mention adhd, aspergers or any other cognitive issue as he believes I am creating “false narratives in my head“ about those ailments. This is very hurtful, but I figured I’d mention it here in an objective manner."

1) Psychologist moved to a different province. Offboarding was exactly as expected but obviously wish it didn’t have to happen.
2) Struggling getting benefits to cooperate with my speech pathologist so that’s delayed for now. 
3) I struggle with the very political undertones of a very social movement that is happening and during a wellness recovery action plan (WRAP) skills group expressed my frustration of it and have been subsequently removed from the course because one individual felt offended and I’m “very good at self-learning anyway so it’s in the best interest for all.”
4) My best friend and I got in yet another heavy fight and pretty much said bye to each other.

Ugh I hope I at least still have a job tomorrow. Can’t imagine the next relationship to fail/leave/abandon.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while now, a couple of years. Now i find myself feeling nervous and like throwing up whenever i go to work. when im at home all i can think of is killing myself and cutting. Which i have done in the past couple of weeks. I dont want to get sent to a psych ward because i literally cant afford it nor do i really think it will help. I want to know what steps i should take. I called a place for help last week and i need to wait until Wednesday (three days from now). my best friend started a relationship and its making me sad, that I cant have something like that. I know i need to work on me, but i find it so hard to find the energy to do anything. there are days where brushing my teeth and showering are all i can do. My question is, when does this go from being ""normal"" to giving out red flags? When do i know that i have to get help? how do i even begin to talk about it outloud? I used to be shamed by my parents about it, how they treated me so nicely and so i couldnt be depressed because they didnt Ab\*se me. How do i know that this is something more than depression?

I have been thinking about this for a while, but I really made up my mind a few days ago when I was filling out a form for therapy on his phone and he got a notification from Tinder saying he got a new match. I’m broken. I have had breakdown over breakdown cause by this man, and I’m so tired of it. He’s made me relapse into self harm, and it’s just hell. He thinks he’s done nothing wrong and refuses to apologize, leave, or get a divorce from my mom. The least I can do is go by a different name then the one he named me and connects me so much to him.

I have been talking to a lot of people on Reddit recently because I was feeling lonely and I thought that would help me. Needless to say: that hasn’t helped. It has actually made everything worse. I’m constantly worried that these people might not like me or ghost me. Also, it makes me really tired responding to people all day, but I feel like u have no choice because I don’t want to hurt their feelings. 
I’ve turned on insta/reddit notifications so see if that helps me, but it hasn’t.
I just feel overwhelmed, extremely lonely, stressed and sad. 
I don’t want to call it anxiety because I haven’t been diagnosed but the stress is real and it never goes away so idk 

Also, I’ve been struggling with my self esteem and ed tendencies all my life, but this quarantine just made it worse, so that’s another thing I can’t seem to stop worrying about. I’m so obsessed with food and exercise. It never leaves my mind

I can’t though. She is triggering me so badly (2 years recovered self harmer) that I don’t even know if I should talk to her about how she feels in fear of hurting my own mental health. 
I’m just pissed off because I literally gave her all these resources to help her get professional help... and she keeps making excuses. So it’s making me upset because I’m recovering and she doesn’t even want to get better so feels like she should drag me down too!

She has previously suffered from mental health issues but it has gotten worse considering everything that is going on. Her therapist has even considered she see a psychiatrist because she thinks she might have BPD. I absolutely love her and want to be with her, and she says she feels the same but does not feel mentally well enough to be in a relationship right now and needs time.

With current events and such my mental health has managed to get even worse, and I could probably stand for some help right about now.

The people I love i love with true honesty, but when my emotions get the worst of me I could not even look at myself. I scream and rant for minutes on end until I calm down and realise I'm an asshole when I act like this.
Also if I dislike someone I usually make them feel horrible when they're close to me, because I want them to leave me be, but in all honesty I don't think it is the best solution.Sometimes I can look at people in a certain way that makes them feel uncomfortable or even scared. Countless people have said it to me,that they feel personally attacked just by the way I gaze into their eyes without breaking any eye contact. Sometimes I do this on purpose with people who have hurt me. I just go silent and gaze into there eyes like I was literally trying to look into his soul. I found this to be a way of quickly shutting down a person. But I really don't like that I do this without my knowledge, it makes people judge me super quick.

Edit: wtf guys im asking for advice not upvotes 

one of my good friends, we will call him J, has had a pretty tough life, his dad was very abusive and has since left, he is gay and has Conservative parents. he has attempted suicide once before and has anxiety and depression. im really worried for him and i want to help

here is a discord rant from him for context (language warning) also is a convo with other friend, we will call this friend A

""J: gotta love how my mums planning disconnecting *my* internet outside of school stuff for using too much data despite me using less than a quarter the amount that my sister has.

and while she tells me this she's sitting there, with netflix on the TV, youtube on her computer, and roblox on her phone

because ***i'm*** definitely the problem here yes

like this is total across all devices too

ive used less than a quarter of what she's using and somehow ***i'm*** using too much?

what the fuck?

to put it in perspective ive used 60 gigabytes in the last month, most of which being on my computer, while my sister has used 280 gigabytes of data

**two hundred and eighty fucking gigabytes**

ive used just over a tenth of our data allowance and she's used over half

and she's keeping her internet connection

A: corrupt system, I sense

J: and its like $10 more for the unlimited plan and mum's like **bUt muh mOnEY**

she spends like 300 bucks on cigarettes a fortnight

its not like she's using it on anything useful

A: you might be able to convince her buy saying you'll chip in

J: ***i fucking have***

A: oh

J: she's all like ""oh save up your money for something worthwhile"" and as soon as I offer to do that she's like ""no, you can't do that""

A: yea same

J: like i'll save up for something and she literally will not let me buy it

A: same here

Like what's the point of money if you can't use it?

J: cant fucking wait to get a bank account so i can actually spend some of the money ive had lying around for fucking ages

A: it's like owning a house that never gets used for no reason

J: yeah like I offer to help out with food ""no, save it for something you actually want to get""

I go to buy something I want to get and she stops me

the absolute mental gymnastics

and on top of this its like everyone in my life has this fucking aversion to punishing my sister too

first it was my dad who blamed me for every fucking thing in the world

then it was her teachers because they thought i was a bad influence despite keeping to myself at home

now its my mum as well

what the fuck?

A: yea it's stupid, how the big brother can always be assumed to be the problem. So even if you're the best you can be, and a smaller sibling starts being annoying or does something, it's your fault.

it's kinda like racism

just because someone did something, doesn't mean everybody else does as well

J: like i fucking try and be a good person but as soon as i do anything remotely wrong its treated like i shot the fucking archduke of serbia

not to mention that whenever she steals shit during online school its blamed on me

she finishes four hours before I do how am i supposed to monitor the kitchen from my bedroom?

i cant exactly up and leave in the middle of an interactive to go patrol the kitchen like a security guard ffs

A: tis not good

but life is life

comes in different shapes, colours, and sizes

and they change

for the good and for the bad

J: life is looking suspiciously like the giant pile of shit from jurassic park

A: so it would seem

J: i dont know how my mum thinks its healthy to have me as the sole reason for every issue in the house

because all it does it turn my sister into an entitled brat who thinks the world will just bend to her every whim and all it does to me is make me want to fucking kill myself

A: it's a lot of a certain generation

like some in the past/current one

J: it doesnt fucking help either that she doesnt take my problems seriously 90% of the time either

stress at school? put more effort in

breakup? get the fuck over it

injured? your fault

she yelled at me for burning myself and saying ""shit"" while my sister was in another room

she said more swear words when I did while telling me off for swearing

and her justification?

""i'm a fucking adult""

cause that makes it ***sooooo*** much better doesnt it

cause hearing her 15 year old brother say one swear word is sooo much worse than hearing her mum say fuck and shit like 4 or 5 times a sentence while yelling at me(edited)

its almost as if she has more of an influence on her than i do

what a fucking novel thought

its almost as if the problem isn't just me

and as soon as I come up with a valid point she screams at me for my ""attitude""

the last time she yelled at my sister was literally when she was such a brainlet that she decided it would be a good idea to steal 20 dollars out of mums purse when she was in the same room as her

i wouldnt be so mad if mum actually paid attention to all the problems herself and kaela cause

because I'm not perfect but neither are they

and there's no reason for me to be blamed for someone else's actions

I came back from the psychologist after they told me that it was quite likely that I was suffering from depression and anxiety and you know what she said?

YOU DONT HAEV A REASON TO BE SAD OR ANXIOUS YOURE NOT AN ADULT

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST

she really fucking said that to me

even after everything

she ***saw*** what happened to me when I was younger, she was there

she knows how i feel about my dad

she fucking knows that i have to put up with in school

but no, I don't have any reasons to have mental health issues because im not afuckig adult

A: that's not how it works

teens can also have depression

about everyone can really

but teens are quite common

J: not only that she also experienced similar stuff to me while she was still with my father

she reckons that because she got throught it i should be fine

the problem is i was a fucking **child**

like i understand that its a shitty experience for everyone but it fucked me up really badly

i was going full nights without sleep when i was four because i was fucking terrified

and i still have nightmares about that shit

she literally can not comprehend that I have problems

she's pretty fucking smart with people but when it comes to me she's about as dumb as it gets

she thinks that im like her and i can just go through that kind of emotional and physical trauma and not have issues

i literally have a fucking mental breakdown whenever my dad starts yelling that doesnt sound like im alright

im gonna go

i dont know if im going to be back

maybe i will be

i dont know though ""

this last part really scares me cause i know he isnt joking. hes a great person and i reallywant to help him

TL;DR im worried for my friend, how can i help him"
1397,A message to all who are lost," 

you are a great person, dont end it, fight, as sun tzu said, ''if fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight"" and we will help you fight, we are here for you. as a 15 year old with adhd and anxiety, i know how you feel, i have felt that way before, but not the same, i have felt sad, like i want to kill myself a few times, but my experiences are nothing compared to yours, i am still here for you. our experiences are what shape us, and if you dont like that shape, make new experiences, find an outlet. start painting, make music, play video games, read books, (i recommend the CHERUB series) write books. you are special and you are loved.

I used some resources from work and was able to talk to a therapist about how I felt, and how I coped. With his recommendation I'm going to my primary care provider Tuesday to get a prescription. I am honestly super excited. I'm well aware that it's not going to be a fix all, or that it's probably going to take a while to get it dialed into what I need.

1404,I can’t stand this anymore (OCD),"I’m really struggling with ERP (I’m doing ERP at rogers). I’ve posted about to a few times and I’m suffering so much. I basically feel like because I swapped the body sensations with how I felt towards girls and towards guys and focused on it and shit, that I turned myself gay over time and it started during an exposure. It’s never felt so real and it’s been 6 weeks and it still hasn’t gone back to normal. Anyway there’s a rabbit hole of posts I posted talking about it starting [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HOCD/comments/hcuglm/i_feel_like_i_turned_gay_please_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

I just wish someone related to me. I know many people have hocd but it’s just never felt so real and I wish at least one person related to completely losing that attraction to the originally desired sex to the point where even fantasizing about them gives you a weird feeling inside that makes it seem wrong. It feels like I don’t want to date the opposite sex at all anymore. I’d fantasize a bit and then I’d just suddenly have this weird “ewww gross” feeling easy over me and that’s never happened before all of this.

It was a slow process. It started with me being unable to masturbate to the opposite sex on day one, but I still was drawn to girls. Eventually I was unable to understand heterosexuality/not really wanting it anymore, to now even feeling weird when I fantasize about the opposite sex. I noticed it getting stronger every day. I hate myself for this because I know if I hadn’t thought about it so much it would’ve gone back to normal but now I just don’t know anymore.

Basically I’m worried that I’ve changed myself over time after kind of igniting a spark and I’m just really struggling and I wanna go back to normal. I want my treatment team to just tell me what’s going on in my brain. It just feels so real and it’s never felt so real :(. I actually feel like I’ve turned gay :(. I can’t even IMAGINE liking girls anymore. I’m forgetting what it was like. I feel towards guys how I used to towards girls and I just feel really really stuck.

I know I wasn’t born gay and because of that I’m freaking out because I don’t want to have turned gay :(. I miss being straight. I want it back :(. I wish I had never done ERP or went to Rogers. I wish none of this ever happened because then I’d have a chance at getting what I want but now it’s all been stolen from me. I feel like my ERP team ruined my life and I feel trapped and stuck and pushed into a corner and I want nothing more than my life back to how it was before all of this :(. I just had so many plans and hopes and dreams involving girls and now they’re all gone. I used to see pictures of a girl holding a guy close or if straight couples and think to myself “I want that”, and just today I saw a picture of a guy holding another guy (I wasn’t looking for it, it was on my insta feed) and I got this warm feeling inside. I know I didn’t have these feelings originally but now I do. I even had a girlfriend, I wanted to have sex with her, I was in love with her, everything. 

I’m just so on the verge of giving up. I went into this treatment thinking I was gonna come out happy and ok... I didn’t think I’d lose a major piece of my identity, if I even did. I want my identity back :(. It’s just that girls seem so bland to me all of a sudden when they used to seem interesting and exciting and cool. I can’t even imagine them being interesting and excited  and cool anymore :(. They sued to make me feel warm and happy and I used to have fantasies and really enjoy them, but now I don’t :(.

I posted about it a lot over the past 6.5 weeks and I just wanna go back in time. But seriously, it’s been 6.5 weeks since it happened and normally I would realize it’s fake after 2 or 3 weeks :(. I just feel really really stuck and I want my life back :(."

1407,28F Feeling drawbacks in progress from trauma when you least expect it.,"Hello everyone. I hope you are all staying safe and healthy out there!

So, quick thing about this post: I was in my first and last relationship about 4 years ago. Give or take, IDR anymore. That was a very bad one, abusive and lasted five years. I endured a lot growing up, so that was just more trauma on top of more trauma. 

I've made strides on my own. I have my own place. I work two jobs. I'm attending college, and aiming for psychology. I am slowly throwing out really old furniture tied to this terrible past and buying what I want because now I can afford it. This pandemic has reduced my income slightly and has made me address mental health issues more than ever. Regardless, I have made so much progress. I reflect on who I was then, and I am so different. I never thought I'd reach this place.

At times when I bask in this success, I suddenly begin to get haunted by him in dreams. He returns, full of regret and saying he's changed and made mistakes. I could not think of him for weeks, and weeks, and then this throws me off for a couple of weeks. It opens up old wounds and I just continue forward. I am so tired of this. I grieved, I cried an ocean and I've moved forward.

I just want to forget him. I want him out of my life, and head for good. I just want peace and quiet and just live my life, happy, my way. But these same dreams, every time the same thing, just get me really good. Yes, I've blocked any access to this individual when he went out of my life years ago. I know he tried to add a friend of mine a year or two ago. IDR how long ago. Nonetheless, I hate my brain for doing this to me. It makes me feel like I might lose all progress that I've worked blood, sweat and tears for. I often wonder if what he said, was true: that I'm crazy, psycho, and have no sense of reality."

She is almost non-functional at this point as a result of depression and anxiety that has manifested from it. She has had depression and anxiety for some time not but since that happened, she has declined to a point where she will sleep for days at a time. I luckily was able to keep my job as a firefighter paramedic due to it being considered essential. I would help pay for treatment, however both of our bills combined keeps finances way too tight as it is. I’m in desperate need of some way that I can help her or get her the help she needs. I don’t know how much more she can hang on, no matter what I try. Is there some resource, or some sort of program that we can use to get her the help she needs?

I come up with many ways to do it, what would be the easiest for myself to do it and like the cleaning process. I always feel alone and I always feel like no one cares either. I always care a lot more about other people than do me. I will go to the edge of the earth for the people I care about but none would do the same for. I can never put myself first in any situation with them  because I feel bad if I do. I have so much love to give out to people it’s just no one reciprocates even half of it. My life is filled with like 2 week depressive episodes and like 3 day happy highs of I’m around the ppl that I consider close but I don’t think they think that of me. Idk what’s wrong with me mentally or what’s wrong with me as a person but it’s just nonstop it feels like with every person it’s the same thing I just wanna be worth something to someone so I can stop having this feeling and thought that I am worthless.

1413,I don't know if I did something wrong but it’s eating away at me,"I’m diagnosed bipolar and underage, just letting you know for a little context as to why this makes me feel bad. So recently I’ve made plans to visit family out of state and it was between my oldest sister and my aunt to plan what was going on because I was staying with my oldest sister before leaving. My other sister, also older, lives with my aunt. Before I knew much my sister would mention things on FaceTime and I’d be confused because I didn’t have all the info. Basically my sister said when I went to stay with my oldest sister that my aunt wasn’t going to be able to pick me up anymore, which frankly freaked me out because I also have anxiety. So I’m panicking and worrying and she’s telling me to talk to my aunt about it but I have anxiety and was worried to confront it. So then she says my aunt also can’t pick me up from my oldest sisters house so I freaked out more. I talked to my oldest sister and brother in law about this and they said that wasn’t true. So anyways I later find out she was shortening the information she passed along and it wasn’t the whole truth and I worried for no reason. I confronted her and said that I want her to be better with communication, and things got really heated. She kept trying to tell me what she meant but that’d have been a lot more helpful if she told me it all at the beginning. Now she’s saying that everyone thinks I’m being ridiculous for being upset with her and trying to bring it up. I don’t think I’m in the wrong but I’ve been crying a lot and it’s literally cause my to pull my hair and freak out and I seriously just don’t know what to do. Like why couldn’t she have communicated better in the beginning? Why is she mad that I asked her to communicate better next time? I tried to be understanding but this feels really manipulative and toxic and I don’t really want it to affect me visiting her at my aunts."
1414,Complete drop off in motivation since quarantine,I’m sure A LOT of people feel the same I was just hoping to talk to some people that have been feeling the same way. I’ve always been motivated to be a hard worker as I take great pride in it but I was furloughed and still have not returned to work (keep in mine I’m only 18 so I’m fine) but I would work in self betterment and honing my skills but since everything’s changed I haven’t been doing any of that. I’m sure that’s what has been making me feel so dull lately
1415,I dont think I am meant to be.,"Got home Friday night. It’s Sunday afternoon. It feels like I’ve only been home for hours. I’m having terrible thoughts. At the same time, I’m having no thoughts. I’m so tired. I’ve done nothing. I feel nothing. Yet, I think all the pain. 

“I, I, I, I, I”. Sick of that. Sick of being the center of my own universe like I’m the only one who’s in pain. Sick of everything being about me because I’m submerged in pain. 20. Still can’t handle myself. Still am not resilient. Still have fits. Still have no plan. Still am stuck in a hole that was dug 20 years ago. Still don’t know how to do my taxes, or get insurance. Have unpaid bills and shitty credit. No friends. A family I love to death, who pities me. Still lay stuck in my room for days. Don’t see a day where I’ll get my shit together. Don’t see a day where I won’t call for death calling for alleviation peace and love. Where I’ll be okay. Don’t see a day where I get the help I need, I believe it doesn’t exist. I don’t think therapy or medicine can fix me, I’ll always have internal problems. I’ll always feel what I feel and always have felt. Anything that tries to help it, are just going to mask the inescapable. But it’ll never leave.

Everyone wafts through life and dies. Everyone struggles, hurts, and desires. Yet, these people do something at the very least. But they do something at all. Some do the most. Some tap out. Into a silent world with no glory. 
I don’t think that I am meant to be. We know of natural selection. Survival of the fittest. The ones who couldn’t survive, couldn’t survive and they had no greater purpose than to die off and let the ones with superior genes take the advantage. Elevating their species. I think I am one of those creatures who would die off. Were I to be in the wild, I’d have ceased to exist long ago. There is little to no willpower in me, no resilience, no purpose. I offer nothing except pain, and stress. I make you feel my sadness just by being around- involved with you. I take and I take take take. With nothing good enough to give back. Just in need of someone to care for me. Would you keep something that eats up all your resources and gives nothing back?

 I don’t think I will go very far, or achieve very much. I currently am not, have not. And you’d start to notice a pattern by now. 

A life that does not prosper will live to do so in the future, or is it dead on the scene? A product that continuously displays failure is launched or eliminated?
People try to tweak it, make it better. Fix the bugs. Replace parts. Still, it doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to. These fixes and alterations aren’t compatible with this product. If it does not work, it does not work. It is eliminated. Thus, a new product must be created. 
You see that constant malfunctions in the product that never advances show that in the future, it will never prosper. How should a broken good, with no timeline of functionality or progress, show it will ever work? It doesn’t. 
Some things simply aren’t meant to be. 

But I could never take the action that would send my loved ones agonizing over my dead body. Never. And I could never take the action that could throw me into eternal damnation if an afterlife should exist. So I stay stuck somewhere in between. Half way given up. Only breathing. When I know, I’m not meant to be."
1416,Is it ok to go to a psychologist and ask him/her if I have any mental health issues?,"I think something is wrong with me and I think it is somewhat of a relief to understand that I am going through something so I could at least focus on that and help myself that way, but I don't know if it would be ok for me to just approach a professional like that. I don't even know how to approach a professional at all.

I used to think that going to a professional would ba worthless since I am me, and whatever illness I have would just be stating who I am now, but as I grew up, I realized that knowing these things are essential for growth so I can face them, if do have them.

I thought this was a good place to ask about this, so help me?"
1417,Talked out my suicidal thoughts,"**TW suicide / thoughts of suicide.**

This is somewhat of an update for a venting post I made a couple of days ago on this sub about wanting to end my life. (New to Reddit, don't know how to link it, I'm sorry). 

*Some context though*: I have been struggling with thoughts of suicide for a couple of years now, but I had never felt close to actually doing it until two nights ago. I felt hopeless, unmotivated, and saw no reason for me to continue going. My mind made me believe that I was a burden to everyone, that no one would really care to help me if I talked about my feelings, and that the everyday pain of paranoia, stress, and anxiety would go away if I just ended it all. A part of me knew that it was untrue and I had many people who loved and cared for me but, as it is when you're in that dark place, it feels impossible to fight off the bad thoughts. Fortunately though, I only fell asleep in tears that night and didn't do anything. 

Fast forward to today, I just felt worse. I got an anxiety attack while working out at home and my mind was racing in and out with bad thoughts after bad thoughts. The anxiety went away in about 30 minutes, but I still felt so many emotions. And I was so focused on these emotions that I ended up working out for almost three hours without even noticing. It wasn't even a good workout because of that. I just wanted to crawl into bed and cry my eyes out. I only stopped because my dad called me for lunch.

So, my parents, my brother and I are at the table eating our lunch. And I don't know what pushed me to tell them how I felt in that moment, maybe it was their silence over lunch or I was just stuck with the feeling of unhappiness, but I did it. And I felt scared. Really scared because I had tried seeking help about two months ago with a 'friend' and she completely invalidated my feelings. I was scared that I would be shut down again. 

But I wasn't. I told them everything, from the anxiety attacks I forced myself to face alone, to all the dark thoughts and how close I felt to committing suicide (how I had planned to do it, how much fear I felt, and all the pain and lies that my mind was feeding me). Everything. And it was hard because I could barely get through a complete sentence without feeling that fear every second, but I did it and I'm really glad I did.

My parents gave me the reassurance and comfort that I didn't know desperately needed. They reassured me that those thoughts weren't real and that I have so many people who love me, who would listen to me, and who care for me and would help. We cried a lot and hugged as well.

I was incredibly surprised at their reaction too because they grew up old-fashioned, both in households where mental health wasn't something you acknowledged or even believed in, but despite their upbringings, they **never** made me believe that my feelings weren't important. And they're far from perfect, but to feel their love and support as I talked out my suicidal thoughts, helped so much. They, with my brother, reminded me that I have so much to live for and that I'm not a burden, I matter, and there are people - including some who I have yet to cross paths with - who love me. 

I still have a long journey with my mental health too, but this is an incredibly big first step because I broke free from that part of my mind that kept telling me, for months, *What's the point of telling anyone? Nobody cares*. I found my voice and sought help, which I once believed I could never do. And guess what? People listened and they helped.

I hope this post helps at least one person, suffering or not. Please realize that your life matters. You're not alone, you are loved, and you are important to the world. I know it's not easy at all to fight off the pain too; there are people who have been suffering with their mental health for all their lives, but just remember, there is always going to be light in the day. People care, people want to help you, and your feelings matter. Just don't give up. Please don't give up. There is help waiting and so many good things you've yet to experience. Please feel free to reach out if you need to vent or anything. Otherwise, I hope you all find love and support. You deserve that much and more, always."
1418,Feeling Hopeless,"I am just exhausted and I don't know how to cope anymore. I am a hypochondriac and a nurse during a pandemic, I'm struggling with complex PTSD and OCD as well, I live in Portland and I'm scared of all that's happening here, my family are on the wrong side of everything and I might have to cut contact, and my partner's mother got diagnosed with cancer and his stepdad just passed unexpectedly. My partner and I have both been on edge and getting into stupid arguments. Work has been getting more and more hostile and I panic every morning before having to go into work. I feel like my rest isn't restful and I've stopped looking forward to anything other than sleep. I have been trying to find a new therapist for months, but no one has responded to any of my emails, phone calls, or messages. I can't afford to pay out of pocket for therapy, so I just have to wait for someone who takes my insurance to get back to me. I don't know what I want out of this, maybe just to vent."
1419,"Question about being ""pink slipped""","So I know that when someone is pink slipped, it's a 72 hour hold, based on ""court days"" and weekends don't count toward the time.

Is that a *guaranteed* 72 hours, or can they release you sooner?

I'm not dealing with this, just curious. I tried googling and just get vague answers."
1420,Stuck in a cycle of emotional abuse and tired of it.,[deleted]
1421,I actively avoid being in a relationship,"I don’t know what it is stopping me but the idea of having a girlfriend is just, how do I put it, “scary” or “frightening”. 

I have had one in the past but that didn’t last very long, maybe a few weeks or so. After a while I started to worry about how she felt about it and if she still wanted to be in the relationship, so I inevitably broke up with her, thinking it was the best thing to do.

I would describe myself as a shy, semi-antisocial guy that likes his free time, and for some reason in the back of my head I associate being in a relationship with giving up that free time. I don’t know if it’s because my last girlfriend would text me every second of the day and would start fights if I didn’t respond or what but if a girl approaches me about love then I turn them down.

Sorry to drag this on but I don’t know what else to do, it might just be the fact that I’m shy but I don’t know anymore. I don’t even know if this is considered a mental health problem so if this is the wrong place to vent this then I apologise"
1422,How does diagnosis work?,"Hey all, I have my first therapy appointment on thursday with a psychologist and I'm wondering what the timeline is for a diagnosis. Does diagnosis happen in therapy (after the intake appointment ofc) or do you make a separate type of appointment? Personal experience and general information are both welcome!! 

If it makes a difference I suspect I have anxiety and maybe ADHD (though the focus issues could stem from anxiety) plus I have some symptoms that don't fit anything that I know of. 

Lots of love and thanks in advance &lt;3"
1423,My wife’s brother and mom,"They are so immature and insensitive. I’m 32, and losing my hair. My daughter is 3 months old and still bald. So naturally they mock me by saying how much she looks like me bc of her hair.

This drives me fucking crazy’s considering my brother in law is 150lbs overweight. 

I told my wife, I’ll start making fun of his fatass then. He can change his fat weight, I can’t change my hairline. 

My wife thinks I take things too personal and that would be mean if I did that, but I think she doesn’t get where I’m coming from. I’m tired of this shit. It’s making me insecure even more than I am, it’s making me not appreciate my life anymore. There is a ton more to it than this instance, but my mental health has taken a beating and I’m over it."

1428,What to include into my therapy notes?,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this kind of question, but I do need a little help.
I have finally decided to seek therapy, but I am nervous about telling the therapist about everything I have gone through. So my plan is to go into my first appointment with detailed notes of my past traumas, my relationships with others, and my struggles in day to day life. What other categories should I include in my notes, and what other questions will a therapist ask me? Therapy is a big step for me and I don't want to mess it up. I want to be prepared as much as possibly can. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
1429,Realizing how bad my anxiety is (24/F),"I always had bad anxiety as a kid, I'd cry and shake before the first day of school every year, I had enormous anxiety about presenting in classes, and I found myself crying a lot as a teen over things that most teenagers would get over really quickly. As I grew older I learned how to shove my anxiety  to the side and mark it as a character flaw. Tonight I have realized that it is not a flaw, but something that i need to take care of as soon as possible. I recently got into my first serious relationship, started birth control for the first time, and am really falling in love. And i feel very overwhelmed and a lot of pressure, because I want this to workout more than anything. This person is important to me and I care about them a lot. My anxiety doesnt come from how he treats me but from my overthinking and how i think about the future. My foreign parents are always prying and unknowingly provoking me by asking me a lot of questions about us, and restricting me from doing certain things because I live in their home. I feel very trapped and there is this barrier that is beginning to form between my parents and I. The more I want to see him and feel close to him, the more I shut out my parents and subconsciously fear that they have some control from whether or not this relationship is going to work out. This makes my anxiety even worse and I find myself lashing out every-time I interact with them. I want to be able to feel comfortable when I bring my boyfriend over (he has met my parents before and they love him) but its my own relationship that I have with them and the anxiety i get from it that is making things bad for myself. I figured the only way to cope with this is to just completely shut them out, and just not interact with them altogether. I am beginning to resent them a lot. I just want to be with my boyfriend and be independent and on my own. I love my parents, but lately it's just so hard to communicate with them and have them understand me without them being stubborn or labeling me as a disrespectful and ungrateful brat. I just dont want to feel this resistance anymore. I am so upset even writing about them. I wish more than anything to just live on my own and away from them. I feel like our relationship would be so much better if i didnt live with them. I'm also looking into psychiatrists and therapists to begin taking care of myself."
1430,Almost full body lock up during panic,"Last night, for certain reasons, I started to panic and hyperventilate. As my breath got faster my body started to tingle which I'm familiar with, but as I got worse the tingle started to cause my legs and hands to tense up. I was sitting on the edge of the bed so I let my body bend back a little for my legs to go straight more. It quickly just kept getting worse and more tense. Soon, my legs were totally tense all the way down and I couldnt relax them, and the same for my arms and hands, especially my left arm, It was hurting alot but also I kinda couldn't feel it. My left hand had all my fingers pinching together relatively straight and was 100% numb. My right hand had the fingers similarly but more straight and less touching, I had more feeling in that hand and arm (I think because I was partially leaning on the left elbow at a point). Even my face was a little tense but mostly my left cheek. I could bend my waist slightly to lean more or less, and I might have been able to move my neck but I don't remember trying. It was scary and unfamiliar but it didn't really make me panic too much more than I already was. Been about 24 hours and my legs are sore as frick, stairs are rough lmao

But hey, does anyone know about this more than I do?"
1431,I'm having anxiety attacks and I feel scared all time,"A while ago I started losing weight, also ate in small amounts and satisfied me instantly. On a par with my weight loss, at night I felt the symptoms of an anxiety attack (at that time I didn't know I could suffer from those attacks) and blamed myself, saying that for eating a lot (which was a lie) I suffered from the symptoms of the anxiety attack. My question is, how can I overcome the desperation I have when I have an anxiety attack? I was thinking about taking herbal infusions, but if you know of any pills that can keep me relaxed, I'd appreciate it the same way. Thanks for reading."
1432,My family sucks,"My families got it all, from funding drug addiction to just being assholes, any ideas besides stealing a car and living in it until I can legally get a job and rent an apartment?"
1433,i think my mom is depressed and idk how to help... help me help her please!,"
hey yall! im a teenager and ig you could say im a bit familiar with mental health issues, i have anxiety (not too bad) and have gone to therapy because i was starting to feel depressed at a time, but im now way better and happier. however i live with my mom, dad and sister and I think my mom is depressed and i want to help her but i just dont know how and i get way too angry to be helpful sometimes, because shes straight up rude and disrespects me. my mom has had depression in the past (either before i was born or when i was very young) so her having depression right now wouldnt be too far fetched. shes also gone to therapy before but i dont think shes going now and hasnt for a while. she fights often with my dad and is often mad at me and my sister for not helping around the house and she has told us that shes tired of being the one who cleans and cooks and does everything for all of us and thst her life is miserable. she doesnt say it always but when shes mad she does, however now that my didter and I are in quarantine and summer we help around the house a lot more and sometimes we have a good relationship. but every once in a while she gets really mad and even sad and just cries and screams at us and tells us rude and miserable things (which ik she doesn’t always mean so i try to look past it sometimes) but it sometimes hurts me and scares me that she’ll leave us (shes a great mom and i doubt she would but sometimes i can help but think that) and it makes me mad and i dont wanna be nice so i become more of a b***ch (and lets be honest, im a teenager and have a smart mouth and im pretty manipulative so i can be rude on my part too) but i just wanna help her now and make her feel better because im scared for her. Im sorry this is do long and all over the place but i could really use some  help and advice.  thank u to everyone and i hope yall are doing well!!! :)"
1434,I can’t sleep and also feel like sleeping is a waste of time but I think I’m tired,"I want to order pizza and get drunk and not go to work tomorrow, which would be stupid of me.
But it’s only to get out of my head, I wanted to be a musician and an artist for a living but I have always been dealing with depression, anxiety, fatigue, eating disorders, and now I’m waiting for a doctors appointment. I’m always waiting yet never have enough time in the day, and always tired but I don’t think I do much on a daily basis.
I had a day off today but didn’t do enough work or enjoy it a ton either. Just anxious and depressed for the most part. 

If I get up and eat something I’ll feel guilty, if I get up and do anything I’ll feel tired. But I can’t sleep. Keep thinking of random things.

I always sleep on the couch now because I havent gotten around to cleaning my room or laundry off my bed, since like March or April.
Almost 2 weeks sober because my drinking was becoming a problem."
1435,The carriage before the horse.,"About 2 years ago I got a new job with good health insurance making it affordable to seek medical and mental health care. I had always known that I had depression as a teen, but had just ignored and pretended I didn't. It wasn't working great but could not afford treatment with high deductible plan. So with this new insurance plan I started seeking out treatment and clarification. I began by self referring to neuropsychologist for evaluation as an adult for ASD. He came back and said yes level 1 ASD no ADHD, and MDD. He told me to go to primary to ask about antidepressant, and to look into therapy. I'm kinda picky about providers so I had to wait 6 weeks to get into the therapist I wanted to see. I went to primary and initially tried Prozac, but switched to Wellbutrin after 30 days. About a week or so before I was supposed to start with the therapist they called to inform me that he would be leaving the practice in 8 weeks so I could start with an expected end date. I went and met with him and he with his experience with ASD and ADHD thought yes to ADHD and no to ASD. I then went to an online psychiatrist who said yes to ADHD and did not comment on ASD. He was unable to prescribe stimulants virtually so referred me back to primary to discuss. Primary sent for more testing. PsyD performing testing said depression only. Possible borderline personality disorder. Suggested dialectic behavior therapy. That was not a possibility due to scheduling and network issues. Quit Wellbutrin. A month later went to Effexor. Effexor had no effect after slow titration up and then back down was on four 4 months or so. Primary referred to psychiatrist, now it's been about 6 months after last testing. Psychiatrist said PsyD testing clearly showed ADHD and he prescribed Adderall. 

Now it's been about 6 weeks on Adderall and I just emailed psychiatrist with requested med follow up. Plan after last appointment was at time of this email the dose was likely going to 20 mg twice a day compared to 15mg where at currently. I am thinking we will discontinue Adderall when he replies tomorrow. 

I go to primary on Tuesday and it will be my last time this seeing this doctor who I have become very appreciative of. 

By Wednesday I expect I will be back to white knuckling my depression and entire mental health rats nest. I am grateful for this as trying to treat has only led to more questions and deeper felt depression. My ending is written, I just need to accept it."
1436,"I am curious to opinions on my mental health, highs and lows, abnormal thought patterns, occasional hallucinating on a low level, personality issue and always assuming worst in situations","I used to dabble in psilocybin mushrooms and was a very active weed smoker, smoked every day 4-6 blunts a day for 2-3 years. I say this because I feel like it could play on abnormal thought patterns here is a example of what my mind can generate 

“I wonder if I will run into someone I do not like today or I will have to hurt them” or in more extreme cases “I hope that I don’t have cancer or am dying”

I occasionally hallucinate in stressful situations 
(Breathing in textures / enhanced vision)

I have highs and lows and I am not the same person in morning by night my personalities slowly shift and so does my thought patterns.

I occasionally feel like a blanket over my brain and my thoughts try to escape but keep bouncing back causing tension. 

I get stuck in routine unknowingly 

Used to have a phobia for a year Of police officers (was on the up and narrow) 

Feel arrogant in a sense but then another part of my mind feels like I have a right too be 

Even thought I get social interaction and in a relationship I feel alone no matter how many people I’m with 

I feel like sometimes I want to escape my mind so the thoughts don’t consume me

I usually assume the worst even if the situation does not call for it. 

It’s hard for me to draw long attention spans on certain things I want too pay attention to 

I have compulsive habits and was taken by sex, greed, and drugs. 

I have euphoric senses of calmness and at other times a sinker feeling that leads into personal destruction.

Cause fights that I do not want too cause because I can’t control my mood or my thought patterns. 

Somehow I have strong attachment to my girlfriend but it’s in strong or weak waves 

I feel like life has made me slightly sociopathic because of environment and situations / trauma

Sometimes I feel so much empathy I can’t hurt a thing and would even save a mosquito if I could Other times I would fuck anyone over who came across my path if they test me. 

Feel like I know everyone’s thoughts. 

Can someone give me input too what they believe it could be ? I’m planning on visiting a psychologist but I wanted opinions instead of going in blind I’m not the type of guy who will jump too conclusions, and just because I rarely hallucinate in stressful conditions does not mean I’m schizophrenic"
1437,I’m just scared,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but here goes.

I’ve been worried. More than usual and about things I shouldn’t be thinking about. Like I feel like I’m wasting my life. But there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m scared of the fact that in the end I’ll be forgotten and never thought of again. It’s happened to millions of people. Why should I be worried? There’s nothing I can do about it. I want to believe in Christianity because that means there will be an afterlife but it’s not enough to make me feel good. There’s no certain evidence that heaven is real so although I try to believe, I can’t get past that I’m not sure. I want to feel fulfilled. Everyone dies eventually. The days just tick by. The days past faster and faster. It scares me. I want to talk to people but I just can’t. I don’t know why. Every time I feel happy I’m ok but not a single day goes by without me thinking about it."
1438,Do some people just attract people with mental illness?,"My mother and brother were schizophrenic.  I have had numerous exposures to people with quite serious levels of schizophrenia.  I have had my life affected by other peoples' schizophrenia...no one else I know has had as much exposure to schizophrenics as I have.  I've never been in a working field or social situation that would normally expose me to people like that, but there you go."
1439,Update to a post I made yesterday; Thank You! Y'all are amazing,"Hi again. I have zero clue if anybody from that thread will see this here. But I want to thank this subreddit for the impact it's made on me in such a little time. My issue was that I was having trouble finding therapists and just motivating myself in the meantime without a professional's help. Obviously things aren't going to change in less than 24 hours buttt, 

First off I was able to find two potential psychologists I'm hopeful to see soon to help me out with my potential ADD/ADHD, family trauma, and school life.

Secondly, I've been scrolling through this subreddit and it's so touching to see everyone share the deepest parts of themselves with strangers while others give them advice and push them to keep going. The users who helped me and gave me some much needed advice and resources proved to me that the world is still a good place.

Even though it's been a really short time, I've felt a lot better after coming into this subreddit. I didn't really do much today, I just sat at home. But unlike most other days I actually smiled and joked some with my mom which I haven't done in a fat minute. It's not much but it's progress from the days past. And who knows if I'll feel better or worse tomorrow. All I know is that this subreddit has had a direct impact on how I feel for this moment and helped provide resources.

Please don't stop doing what you're doing guys. Your words are invaluable. Whether you're giving advice, sharing your troubles or both. I can say for certain. This forum saves lives. 

You all are so valuable and you all make this world a better place. If you feel you contribute nothing to society, your fucking wrong. You just might not notice it, because you're touching people you can't directly see with your words. I know what I'm saying sounds stunted and perhaps cliched but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YOU ARE IMPORTANT AND YOU ARE ABSO FUCKING LUTLEY NEEDED. You helped me and others can help you. 

So again thanks. :))"

1441,I feel like I need some mental health help but I have no idea how to get it,"For some context I'm 16f and I've had not great mental health for pretty much as long as I can remember. I'm starting grade 12 in the fall and I can't recall being decently happy since middle school or earlier. My mom thinks I have anxiety and so do my friends and even some of their parents. The issue is that my mom claims that ""everyone"" has some form of anxiety and therefore it isn't a big deal, hence the fact that I haven't seen any professionals about this or even been diagnosed with anything. I really want either a diagnosis or just to see a therapist because I've felt like something is wrong with me for a long time now. But when I say I want to go to therapy my mom treats it as a joke. Also for some reason I feel really intimidated by hotlines and stuff because I haven't been diagnosed with anything so idk it almost feels like there's nothing wrong and I'm being overdramatic? And most digital therapy stuff costs money and I can't afford it on my own... Obviously if my mom would pay for an online therapist she would pay for me to see one irl. Basically I just didn't know where else to turn because I really want to seek help but I just can't seeing as my mom doesn't take it seriously at all."

I’m not trying to take responsibility for his issues onto myself or anything like that, I just want to be able to support him the best I can. Any ways to do this?

For example, I've tried singing, picking up an instrument, drawing, and learning another language over the years, and recently because of quarantine... But I keep quitting once I realize that I'm not ""good"" at it. 

I'll buy supplies, set aside time...and then try for a few days and get the feeling that I'm just wasting my time. 

Recently, unfortunately, I've been quitting things that I thought I was okay at, and losing motivation for things that are necessary. Like, I used to think I was an okayish writer (just for fun), but I've recently been unable to write anything because I think I'm not good enough anymore, and there's no point. 

I was also let go from a dead-end job as a teacher last year...which I was initially thankful for, but now I can't figure out how to re-enter the workforce again. I feel lost in so many ways, and unmotivated...

The refrain in my mind for hobbies and necessities is, ""What's the point? Why waste time doing something you're no good at?""

I'm worried that soon...I might lose motivation for even living, and quit that too. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts before in the past (well, the present too. I am 32 and living at home, ha), but I also desperately want to live, out of love for family and the things I find so much fun in life!  


So yeah...I don't know what's wrong with me. I know that I should probably speak to a therapist...but I can't find the motivation to pursue that either! I'm stuck!

I don't even know what my question is; but if you read this far, thanks for hearing me out."
1444,I wish I could stop shaking and I wish I could just breathe.,"I really wish it would stop.

I really wish that whenever I attempt to do something outside of my comfort zone, my breathing wouldn't turn erratic and my body wouldn't start trembling. I wish when I practiced breathing properly I could see benefits from it. I wish when I took breaks from the things I like doing but cause me anxiety when I'm challenged in them like my therapist told me to do I would see benefits from it. I wish that this didn't turn into self hatred and inward anger driving me to self harm.

I just wish I wasn't so god damn reactive to everything and that my mind and body would just stop all of this bullshit especially after the work I've been putting in to ease it with medication management and CBT.

I really wish I wasn't who I was sometimes so I could deal with something else, even if it was terrible. At least it wouldn't be this tedious shit."
1445,I stopped to help a rollover and lost two patients today,"Hi y'all

to start this may be a little graphic so heads up

I am not an emergency responder, I'm a coal miner. I am on the mine rescue team and hold my EMR cert in my state,  anyways

I was on my way back from a mini vacation today and pulled up to an suv that had flipped. I stopped to help not really expecting what happened. i figured I have the training and saw no emergency personnel

I walked up and saw two people lying on the ground about 30 yards from the flipped vehicle. I want to know why I couldn't see that they had been ejected at first. like, I was confused as to why they were so far from the vehicle. Any ideas? i didn't realize that they had been until I went up to the closer of the two and checked for a pulse. When I found none all of my training and awareness came rushing to me suddenly and I went over to the still alive patient to try to save him. I wont go into the specifics of the injuries, but they were in a bad way. I did all I could for him until the EMS teams arrived. They spent about 10 minutes or so working on him and finally called it.

I guess id like to talk to someone about it, I have had other situations I've helped with that saved the patient, this is the first loss I've had. And its eating at me a bit. I know I did everything I could, I followed all my training, and the injuries were to severe. but the loss along with watching the family come to terms with it all has stuck. Id stop and help again anytime, that's why I joined my works rescue team, but if I could get a pointer or two on how to cope, that'd be really helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

thanks

tl:dr

need help coping with not being able to save a patient?"
1446,How to handle anxiety and panic attacks,"&amp;#x200B;

[How to handle panic attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp2Zzu9D5IA&amp;t=9s).

About three months back, I was at home, working on a blog post, when suddenly, I felt this disturbing sensation in my lower back. Honestly speaking, I couldn’t quite figure out what it was and had no real words to describe it to my girlfriend, who happened to be there at that moment

Now, I do have a ruptured disc issue in my life, but I just knew, that it wasn’t because of that and was a completely different thing altogether.

I couldn’t keep sitting on the chair, found myself breathing hard. Heart beating fast and feeling restless; over nothing! I tried to walk if off and rubbed my back profusely but to no avail. I talked to her and kept my mind busy for a while and in about 7-8 minutes, started feeling normal.

Dazed a bit, I searched online for the symptoms and figure that I had just experienced my first-ever Anxiety Attack. Yes- [**Anxiety Attack**](http://www.anxietycoach.com/anxietytrick.html)!

For those who do not know about it- anxiety attack is a state of body and mind, wherein, your heart starts pounding, your palms sweat for no reason, you find it hard to breathe and certain portions of your body give you some irritating, yet unidentifiable, sensations!

All of it, I have felt two more times, since my first. And trust me when I say this, not only it is a horrible physical trauma, but more than that. It takes a toll mentally, which you should never ignore.

After my second time though I tried to figure out ways to counter it and overcome the fear of being in the flux, and here are some points, which helped me, that I want to share with you guys!"

1448,Sister told me to see a psychiatrist for health check,"A few months ago, I finally told my older sister (who is a normal and logical human being) about my mood problems. She told me to see a psychiatrist, but I said I was not sure if I need it. Then she told me to just take it as a health check.

I think it makes sense, since we do body checks regularly even when we don't feel anything wrong with our bodies. So I think, why not do mental health checks too? :0"
1449,Objectively i'm doing better than i ever have before. And for awhile my mental health reflected that. But i feel like i'm nosediving now and i can't explain it.,"Tw self harm reference

I've dealt with mild depression for god, 15 yrs? I'm 27 now and it started in middle school. 

I don't know why but i think it's gotten worse recently.    

And anger and irritability is a strong strong newish symptom. And it's turning slightly violent. 

I was just doing dishes and the dishes weren't sitting in the drainer like i wanted them to. The bowls kept falling over and wouldn't stay balanced. And i didn't want to lay them flat so i could fit more. Which like would have been the most rational thing instead of trying to continue doing the thing that was making me angry. But you know

And when they fell over again i just had the urge to vent my frustrations, so i took the blender cup in my hand and smashed it against the counter. 

Now i'm so mad at myself. I make myself smoothies probably 15 days out of the month for breakfast. I love them, and i feel better on days i drink them. And now i fucking can't because i threw a toddler fit over fucking dishes? What the fuck is wrong with me? 

I'm not someone who self harms but i felt the urge to  use the blender blade to cut myself. I didn't. I've only ever cut myself purposefully one time in my life, long ago. But i was closer tonight than i ever have been since. 

I screamed into my pillow and sobbed instead. 

And i start a new job that i'm super excited for and have been working towards for the past few months now tomorrow. Like my life is going well, at least it feels like i'm really finally on a path i like. I moved to a place i love two years ago. I could be doing better socially but i get my people fix. I cut my dad who abused me out of my life. 

I fucking hate this.

I'm sorry, the dishes thing just happened like 30 minutes ago. I'm in distress. I needed to shout into the void. Even if my thoughts are jumbled. Ok, goodbye"

1452,Ways to support a friend after psychiatric hospitalization?,"My best friend (f23) of 8 years was recently hospitalized after a near suicide attempt last week. She’s been going through a ton in her personal life on top of the general state of the world and hit a breaking point. She suffers from bipolar disorder and chronic depression and hasn’t been properly medicated for years, so I’m glad to hear they switched her medication since she was admitted.

I want to be as supportive as possible when she is discharged (It’s been 4 days now, she is supposed to be discharged tomorrow). She’s only been allowed a 10 minute phone call once a day with no visitors due to COVID, so everything I’ve heard from her has come from her mom.

The lease on her apartment ended yesterday, so myself and two friends packed up and moved her stuff out of the apartment for her so she didn’t have to worry about that when she comes home (to her new place).

Does anyone who has been in her situation have advice on what to do/say (or what NOT to do/say) when I get to talk to her again? I miss her like crazy but I don’t want to overwhelm her when she gets home.

Thank you guys in advance."
1453,It's only gotten worse,"I (15f) have struggled with anxiety since early childhood and was only recently diagnosed. I had a bit of a tough childhood because of my abusive father and the messy divorce my parents went through when I was very young. 

Anyway, after being diagnosed with anxiety I was prescribed antidepressants which I have struggled to take consistently (I'm forgetful) but while the meds helped my anxiety, I've also developed depression. Over the months my grades fell and I had no motivation for school which was very alarming because I've always done well in school and I am very ambitious regarding education. 

Recently because of Covid I've had a really hard time being myself. I'm typically bubbly and personable with lots of energy but for months now I've been fatigued and irritated. It's so so hard to feel so different from who I am. It's frustrating that I'm hurting the ones I love so dearly when I'm like this but I don't know how to be myself again. I don't want to feel like this anymore. My relationship with my boyfriend has definitely suffered because of this. My boyfriend was very supportive in the beginning but that has declined over the months. At this point I have no one to turn to for support. My family situation is complicated but I have one friend I usually talk to but that hasn't been an option recently. 

I'm fighting this all on my own and I don't know how much longer I can do it."

Background: no preexisting health problems at all other than she recently started taking birth control about 2 months ago and has slightly elevated blood pressure and frequent headaches since I’ve known her. 

Symptoms: Crying, dizziness, headaches, tiredness

Other: so Wednesday night she couldn’t go to sleep and said she was anxious and that the room was spinning. The next day she would randomly just cry uncontrollably. She also said she had a headache and that she doesn’t want to do anything at all. The doctors office is closed and the next appointment is next week. I’m just wanting someone to make sense of this. I honestly have no clue what’s going on, she doesn’t either. She will just randomly start crying and she says she doesn’t know why and that she feels dumb for crying because nothing has happened to cause her to cry.

1457,Pebbles And Boulders,"

The best way for me to describe my mental health is with pebbles and boulders. Every day (like everyone) I wake up with a certain amount of tasks. Whether it’s as easy as going for a walk, going to the bank or making some phone calls. These are the pebbles. When  I complete whatever task it is I can toss a pebble. The bigger the task the bigger the pebble.  If I delay the task the pebble grows. 

Meanwhile I also carry boulders, debt collectors, worrying about my job, health, life etc.  If I can get rid of a boulder it’s a big weight off of me. 

The third group is other people’s pebbles. 
Sometimes I’ll sit there expecting a phone call from a doctor, a text from a friend, or a form of interaction that depends on the other person to initiate some sort of contact. This would be their pebbles. However, this is where my mind starts messing with me. If for whatever reason someone forgets or cancels or is late my mind races. What may be a pebble to them turns into a boulder for me,  I wonder what I’ve done wrong, why didn’t they call, why did they cancel. Most people just go on with their day. I start carrying this boulder. I start to dwell on it til the boulder gets bigger and bigger. Almost an unbearable weight. An obsession. 

I believe I was good at my job because of this... I would obsess to finish whatever task it was at hand   I wouldn’t quit   This obsessing is also what probably is killing me. 

At night when it feels like I have too many boulders I cannot sleep. Anxiety...obsessing and worrying. When I finally do fall asleep I cannot wake up. Except for the many nightmares, but that’s a whole other topic. I can’t get out of bed as I’m stuck under this mountain on top of me. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this right now. I guess it’s my attempt to get rid of one of my boulders. I hope this makes sense to someone. (Kicks pebble)

Is there any hope at all for the future? I'm inconsolable, this past week I've been abjectly miserable. My writing doesn't bring me happiness, my projects are maddeningly incomplete, and though I work on them I worry this world will never let me see them through.

It’s all just them making fun of me its even real and i keep getting upset and lashing out at my mom who is here in quarantine with me and then she gets upset which ruins the day and nothing gets sone and then I’m upset more and then I’m basically throwing myself a pity party which isn’t ok because “you just want attention” “your really crying over imaginary shit? There are people dyeing“ sometimes its not even people i know just a random person will just come in my room and be like “wow pathetic”  And I’ll yell at them and I’ll have full on outloud conversations to NO ONE am i going insane?

1467,Late Night Thoughts,"Today, 2:24 AM, I'm really thinking about suicide. I've thought about it before, but more as a fantasy, I guess. Im not sure how to explain,  but this time feels different. I feel like I could actually take my life in an impulsive moment. For 3 years I've always said to myself ""I don't think I have what it takes to take myself off this planet. After all, life is short"" but right now...I really don't know what happeend.

For the past 4 days I've been doing good. 3 weeks before that, not so much. But I got a job, which has kept me occupied, and the negative thoughts have gone away for the most part. But they're back.. Ugh, I can't even formulate words. 

So, im 16f. I want to go to therapy, but there is no way in hell I'm telling my parents that I want to see a shrink, so therapy isn't a option (which I think is another reason for the state that im in). 

Right now my thoughts are: can I wait 2 more years till I get help? Could I be sad for two more years? Could I be alone for two more years? Could I cry myself to sleep every night for two more years? Could I fake being happy for two more years? Could I survive the suicidal thoughts and attempts that may come in two more years? 

I swear if there was proof of that hell was non existant, I would off myself right now. I dont want to be here. I really don't. I have nothing to look forward to. No one to talk to.. i just want help. That's it."

First in 6th grade I randomly thought “am I racist?”. I told myself no because I knew I wasn’t, but it just got in my head for so long. Then in 8th grade I started being worried about being a pedophile even though I knew I wasn’t. Now I’m having thoughts about myself as a person. I want to escape it so badly but whenever I get happy, I instantly start thinking I need to be sad, because I’ve been sad for so long that it’s become my comfort zone.

It killed me because it reminded of all the issues I've chosen to ignore all these years. I've always suffered from low esteem. I flinch when I get compliments. I get awkward when people say they missed me because I sub consciously can't believe that someone can miss me. I just have a very poor relationship with myself if that makes any sense. I'm hurt because it made me realize that I haven't grown emotionally at all. Everyone around me is going to get busy with their lives pretty soon.

My parents have this habit of favoring my sister over me. Its been going on for ages. I used to think it was my misunderstanding because they convinced me that it was. When i got older i realised they just decided to ignore and disrespect me always.

When i was a child, i got beaten up a lot for getting above average grades in school. Had instances of my body being burned too. Beaten mercilessly just for above average grades. I used to think it was because of grades. Later realised they wanted to make me miserable always. 

I did well in college. Was beaten up at that time too. And humiliated, accused of being a loser and that i will never succeed. I graduated. They never congratulated me. 

I start working. And they bring up new problems, wanting part of my salary. And stuff like that. O lost my job a few times. Wherein they even made fun of me for eating at home.

I left home at 24. Unable to handle their shit. Traveled. Worked.. But because of corona had to come back.

Now they r back to basics. Treating me like a business deal. Always wanting something in return. While they write over their property to my sister and her abusive loser husband who keeps asking them for money, even though he is rich. And they have no problem giving him more an more while they shamelessly try ti extort my savings.

I hate the injustice I have been dealt with all my life. I want to fight back and put them in their place. I know nothing will change them. Because i have tried dialogue and it didn't work, because for them all they do, including favoring one child unjustly, is the right thing and its their wish. And i am a loser who god hates.

How can i deal and kill their pride and put them in their place. Now i am stuck here so i gotta deal with it. If it was another scenario without corona i would have just left and be on my way. But now since i am here, i feel they need to face the music, however i can give it.

I got the help I needed and ever since I haven’t had a bad thought in my head. I got my help and now I’m trying to make my mom see she needs help. She’s lied to police, stolen money and everything but she won’t notice she needs help. She has severe medical issues and is saying she’s gonna go get help states away, when all her doctors are here. My mom has said this before but they’re empty threats. She tells me if I call 911 they’re just gonna throw me back in because it’s my fault when I show no symptoms of mental health issues. She does. So everything she says contradicts herself. She makes threats all the time. Today I was suppose to have 3 doctor appointments but I had to cancel my follow up with my psychologist. I have that and a therapist. I have an appointment with my family doctor and my surgeon today. My surgeon appointment is more important cause I have a surgery coming up and haven’t seen my surgeon in months. I’ll have a therapy appointment Thursday and Friday. I’m gonna speak to my family doctor about my moms issues. My dad keeps telling me to leave it alone because she won’t get help. I can’t watch my mom self destruct so I’m at least trying to point her in the right direction. I just don’t know what to do rn. I’m gonna try talking to my doctors about it. Any suggestions if that doesn’t work? Because Ik I won’t end up back inpatient because they won’t keep me because I don’t have anymore problems. When I was in there all my doctors told me the underlying issue is my mom. We just got a new cat and she’s starting to shift the blame on the new cat as to why she can’t sleep. But he sleeps nearly all the time. I keep telling her. Mom I’m good now and I believe I’ll be good, but there’s an off chance I could harm myself again and have another suicide attempt. She says good and to do it. So at this point I’m concerned for me. I don’t know what to do. I need help."
1475,F/26 Can't really find any sense in life anymore.. (LGBTQIA+),"I'm really unhappy and uncertain about life after the love of my life isn't there.. anymore..I don't really have anything to look forward to anymore and i'm constantly dealing with panic attacks.. I'm trans and i've been living very lonely so far, this person was everything that got me through and believe in life and i was actually happy to live through it.. I know you should live life for yourself and have to be okay on your own and everything, but idk.. if society still marginalizes you and can't prodive you a life to a normal standard, then it's really hard to be all motivated about being on your own..

I've been in therapy for a very long time, it started to be about the transition first, but then i realised there's actually a lot more going on with my mental health, that i kept suppressing and avoiding, i actually had ptsd and couldn't leave the house for a years or two, because of social anxiety and agoraphobia i dealt with, over the years i've overcome the phobia, i still have social anxieties but not as severe and i've been continuously trying to get my life together and help myself.. I've still been in therapy until recently.. where i have to wait for my new therapist to contact me, as my old one was done with her apprenticeship and couldn't keep going with me anymore..

But losing the one person, who kept me going in life and see a real purpose to fight.. it's devastating.. Especially when all your life you ever only made negative experiences and felt rejection only, unloved, marginalized, bullied from a young age, almost killed by a stranger, struggling and trying to cope with mental health issues, anxieties etc. I haven't gotten to live life at all, i never made any significant experiences.. And my 20's are almost over.. The place i live in isn't super great, there's not much to do, there is very little to do for lgbt ppl, i could never find a group for trans ppl for example, because it's still such a taboo topic here and that makes meeting ppl irl very hard.. Most of the time i can't connect with anyone.. on a deeper level especially.. i feel very misplaced here and that i don't belong.. My mentality is just so different and i could only ever find connections online..

I could actually see a chance in life with him, it was everything that gave me the strength to just keep on and holding on.. and staying stable.. I am so unhappy to live life on my own and i don't really like the construct of life tbh.. I feel that many rules and advice given doesn't apply to my situation.. because it feels much more severe and from my own experiences.. the only thing that helped me in life was him.. I had a panic attack yesterday that felt like nothing else i experienced before, i was in state of being so scared, that i actually thought of suicide multiple times, cause i was that scared.. I actually really loved that person and we have such a history.. i enjoyed their presence, it was good for me.. It's not an obsession thing, i'm way over that tbh.. it was real pure joy, happiness, love and good vibes i felt..

Tbh there's so much more i could write here.. that i have on my chest.. but i feel like ppl won't read this if it's too long.. and it's already very long.."

Since then I don't know whether I need to seek some help or I'm being dramatic/overreacting. When I was in 8th grade I felt very alone, I didn't have much friends and I wasn't very social. I lost many friends and I am not good at making new ones. That continued in 9th grade aswell, I only had 3 friends the whole year and I felt like I depened on people to make me happy. I feel as if I shouldn't be feeling like this since I'm only going to be a sophmore and I haven't experienced life long enough. Earlier this month my doctor told me that I had depression, not severe. My mother just told me to not feel that way. I don't open up to her because she provides so much for me and I don't want her thinking that my feelings are caused because of her. I've opened up to my dad once but I didn't tell him that I don't have much friends and that I feel alone. I don't want to tell my parents my deeper feeling because I don't want to hurt them. I have self harmed multiple times and I have though about ways I would end it all. I don't want to though because it scares me, but somehow I'm always thinking about it. I don't know whether I'm just feeling this because I don't have a phone and I can't talk to anyone or because I'm just going through a phase. I've felt this before in 7th grade but it didn't last as long as this. I try to tell my mom but I feel like she will just tell me to stop feeling this way and she'll want to end the conversation. I've told my sister and all she says is ""same"". I don't know whether this is actually depression or if I'm just a teenager craving attention."
1483,My friend (30M) thinks he's been framed by his therapist into conviction,"It's about my friend from college (which I passed in 2014, he passed in 2017 because of year backlogs). He's a different guy than others with big dreams to pursue film making and music. He never wanted to get married. From 2016 his parents forced him to see a therapist because in my country carrying a lineage is a big thing (he is the only son). 

First year of therapy went good, his therapist suggested him to pursue a course in photography from a particular institute. He says that he faced abuse from his faculty and other students so he quit. Later he tried to apply for big colleges for photography but didn't get an admission.   
He says his therapist tried to indulge him into going to prostitutes thinking that it'll change his perspective about sex and then later about marriage.

Getting pissed by constant force he one day intentionally hit his therapist's car (in front of a police station which was captured in CCTV), thinking that it would deter her from his further sessions and nagging. 

The therapist then filed an police complaint leading to a trial in which he was found guilty and sentenced to jail for few months. He had his life ruined.  
In jail, he says, he got an infection from the fellow cellmate by a shaving blade which he suspects had role of therapist in it. He's recovering from it now.

Now when the case was closed, he's out of the jail and could lead a normal life but later this year he was tested positive with Epstein Barr virus, which he also claims to be therapist's work. (He or anybody can't prove it conclusively)

When any of his relatives try to help him asking to stay away from the matter or not aggravate the matter he simply cuts them of. 

He says that the therapist is some kind of mastermind who has connections with the police, doctors and even with his relatives. He also says that the therapist is running a sex racket in the city. Now he claims the therapist is using her connections to extort money from him, in which his relatives also have some cut.

Few days ago, he was thinking to challenge the court case which he lost earlier, but he doesn't have any evidence for any of his claim. We know that he'll definitely lose the case in court.

We are trying to help but he doesn't listen anymore, cuts off anyone who doesn't agree with what he says.   


What can we do here?"
1484,I think most of my mental health problems stem from living the „wrong“ values (for me) related to the modern/capitalist lifestyle.,"
This is a very complex topic but I try to explain it. I think I am very sensitive to adapting to values which are different of what I grew up with. I think value conflicts or living the „wrong“ values caused me stress, anxiety, depression and sensivity in general.

I grew up in a small town with medium conservative (liberal Christian) values and had a very protected childhood with a lot of nature and freetime. 

I feel like a lot of my anxiety, depression and stress in general comes from not coping with a modern capitalist lifestyle and very liberal values. 

I had a strong and very loving relationship until went to college and started to question my values. I tried to live very liberal values including following individualistic/hedonistic goals and the matching lifestyle. I am talking about partying, drinking, being ambitious, prioritizing my appearance, trying to be popular, trying to be better than others, meeting new people, dating, trying drugs, traveling, going on adventures, questioning politics, etc. 

So basically for me that was quite different of the secure, Christian values I grew up with. Instead of being a better person in terms of being „good“, sharing, community oriented, moderate, graceful I oriented more towards being successful, better than others, thriving for goals as attractiveness, popularity, money, admiration. 

But I am also talking about the shift from being in nature and doing basic things to living in a big city, having a capitalist lifestyle and spending free time mostly in front of screens and on social media.

With this lifestyle change all my mental health problems arised. I got body issues, insecurities, health problems, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, etc. 
Furthermore, my personality changed. And not for the better. I became more aggressive, less empathic but more self centered, more ambitious but less balanced. 

Only since I moved back to my home town and spending time with my family, living the conservative/basic lifestyle again my mental health betters. 

But it is not just my lifestyle, it is also about my values. I ruined my relationship because I was drawn more to hedonistic/individual values. 
Now I feel bad for doing that. I feel ashamed for sharing intimacy without love, for not holding tight on the relationship I had, for not being a supportive girlfriend/friend/sister/child, for partying and taking drugs, for being self centered in various areas. 
It hurt me. It wrecked me. It left scars.

I always wanted to change my values. But maybe I need to admit to myself that I just feel better with the values and lifestyle I grew up with. 

And the thing is, everyone is telling me that I learned from it and that I am smarter now. But to be honest, I rather not learned any of that. It wrecked me too much. 
To be honest, I wished I never got out of my protected conservative bubble which let me feel sane and calm and content instead of insecure, lonely and broken. 

Anyone else with similar experiences?"
1485,I keep feeling blank,"Hey all. I’ve been dealing with anxiety. I have no idea what’s going on with my brain, but there something I never put much thought in, something I’ve had for as long as I can remember. I always, ALWAYS, have this lingering feeling not kinda not giving a shit. I’m not tying to sound cool, but that’s kinda what it feels like. It’s a lingering feeling for most of the day, unless I’m in a cold place like a chill pool. It has to be cold. I drink cold water by trying to pour it in my mouth without swallowing because it makes the feeling go away. Sometimes the feeling grows and I become blank. I can’t feel or fathom too much emotion, and I take things very straightforward. I don’t like to repeat myself during this blank moment, and I don’t feel remorse of empathy. I am not hostile though. I’m just there. If my mother tells me to do something I’ll do it. I do get angry if I have to repeat myself, but in a weird way. I just don’t say anything for a short period of time, even if someone talks to me. I become mute until I feel like I can talk again. I don’t care about anything during these moments. They don’t last long, maybe 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Things have been getting worse for me, but this post is related to this problem."
1486,I would like to know how to act upon this,"My mental health has been deteriorating for the past few months, awhile back I had been feeling like I wasn’t really in control, like I was watching my life through a movie, the feeling would come and go but eventually it just never really went, it’s been 9 months since I’ve felt normal, and other things have been appearing, a lot of the time I feel like I’m going insane, I feel paranoid a lot, and a good amount of the time I feel very trapped in my own head, a lot of nights when I feel like this I truly do wish to end it, because I feel like ending this pain and being gone would feel way better than being stuck like this any longer, and Idk if I should really be concerned about this, but I feel like in my head there are slight distant whispers sometimes, it is not understandable, but it just makes me head feel so loud inside I feel insane, it’s hard to imagine my future continuing like this, I’m only 15 and I don’t know what to do, I truly feel like things are continuously getting worse, please help me"

1490,I made an app to help those struggling with Antidepressant withdrawal and could use your feedback!,"Hi all,

Hope this is a good place to post this.

I have struggled with anxiety for most of my life and after a particularly bad period was put on Sertraline and then Venlafaxine. Unfortunately, I did not react much to the Sertraline aside from side effects like night terrors, and when switched to Venlafaxine, I then experienced a huge increase in anxiety, bodily symptoms and then developed panic disorder and agoraphobia. So I decided with my doctor's help that it was time to stop.

Withdrawal from Venlafaxine was a really horrible time, I could barely move, I had brain zaps whenever I moved my eyes, etc. and this lasted for a very long time and even the GP's did not seem to understand what I was going through. Through research, I found that this is far too common, and I may have been tapered off too quickly, but I was lucky as I tapered in about a month, and the withdrawal lasted about 2 or 3 to finish,  although unfortunately I still get brain zaps when tired. For others, this often isn't the case, and the effects of withdrawal are much worse and they can feel very alone, as well as the tapering process itself in these cases is needed to be much slower, and can even take years.

After going through this and after finding out how common the issue was I decided to get started on creating an application to help.

The app is simple and just allows you to keep track of your symptoms as they come, so you can identify any patterns or triggers, and it allows you to enter your tapering schedule and view it on a calendar, with new features coming soon.

It's still in early stages so there is a long way to go but with your feedback, I am really excited about where this project can go.

I work on this in my spare time and by myself, so any support or feedback is greatly appreciated. It's available only on iOS for now. More information is available at [http://tapertracer.com](http://tapertracer.com/), or just search the app store for TaperTracer.

PS. I totally am not saying that Antidepressants are terrible or not to try them if you need help, definitely go to the doctor and do what's right for you. I am just saying they weren't right for me, and want to give something for people in similar situations who may have to stop taking their antidepressants for medical reasons, or if they are not working for them or in some cases having negative effects, that they have a tool to help if they end up in this situation!

Thanks!"

1494,Will smoking weed affect my mental illness?,"Hi all,

My friends have been talking about trying weed for the first time at a birthday party coming up and I don't know if it will affect my mental health issues - anxiety, bipolar type 2 with psychotic features and dissociation. I'm on meds and was in hospital earlier this year.

I want to make this decision before the party so I can't change my mind when I'm there - I do want to be responsible with this. Maybe I should post this on an actual medical reddit thread instead?

Does anyone know if it will affect any of my mental health issues? Is it okay if I only smoke a tiny bit? Just gonna feel left out as I would be the only one not doing it...

Any answers appreciated :)"

1497,Hi! I’m wondering how I should go about asking for help.,"Hello. I am a 17 year old female, never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, never had a counselor and never been medicated. For the past few years I’ve had anxiety and it seems to be getting worse, It’s starting to seriously affect my day to day life, as well as my ability to sleep well if at all. 

I would like to receive help and medication for my anxiety but I don’t know how to ask. I’m not very open with my parents about anything, I’ve talked to them before but they just seemed to put it off in hopes it just went away. So, it’s very hard to talk to my parents about mental health problems without them putting it off.

Along with denying my anxiety they also say hurtful things about me. Stuff like “you don’t do anything except play video games, you need to get off your ass and do something else” but I use video games as a distraction from myself. 
If I sleep in too late, they blame it on me staying up all night on my phone and say that they’re going to take it away which only makes me more anxious because It’s really my only way of contacting anyone else for help. 

To make a long story short I just would like to see a professional and even maybe be put on medication for my very bad anxiety but I don’t know how to ask or go about it. 

Thank you."
1498,i (22 year old male) have had enough and am raising my dose tomorrow.,"I'm going all in, and by that i mean i am upping my dose.

i was on a lower dose for 9 months but unfortunately my body has finally succumbed to the illness consuming me, tomorrow i will raise my dose from one tablet antipsychotic to two tablets. this means weight gain all over again.

I have Autism and OCD, i can't cope with these bodily sensations and excessive fixations with natural processes. My head is SO FUCKING CONSUMED IN ONE THING!!! IT CAN'T AND WON'T STOP!!!! i want to fucking kill myself. The only thing that will stop this feeling is Alcohol or Valium, or a raise in dose, iv'e talked to psychologists, CBT fucking sucks for my brain because i am so specially unique no one can understand me.

I hate being SO CONSUMED in my interest to the point all i feel is intense restlessness/hyperactivity on top of weird bodily sensations that feel as if something isn't just ''right'' or if something ''hasn't clicked'', it's almost like a tick. I'm also preoccupied with my obsession and this is only at night."
1499,My autistic friend made me feel like shit and forgot i have mental health problems too,"I was with my autistic friend the  last couple of days and I know her long enough to know when we are going to argue. It's mostly about stupid stuff, but the thing is that she always feels like she is right. Even when I know for a fact that i am right I have to be the idiot again so we don't fight. Now  that i am home again we fought again over smth stupid and this time I wanted to stand up for myself and when i did she started making me feel bad and in the end ignored this completely by deleting whatsapp. After that she started writing about the argument in our discord and when i wanted to tell her to keep it between just us she (the mod) kicked me. Maybe this whol thing sounds childish but it hurts me greatly to know someone I have defended multiple times and thought of as a good friend would treat me like i am a dumb child you don't have to respect. This has now triggered me to the point i am considering going to the hospital so i don't hurt myself. I don't know what to do"

1501,Parent talk gone bad.,"I got drunk while visiting my parent's house. My mom stayed up late with me, and I started talking to her about some things I didn't really understand about being human. Like accidental philosophy, which is something you don't want to do with any parent as I've come to realize. I told her that I felt we've reached a technological peak and that automation could provide for most people. And that ""jobs"" where no longer necessary. I kind of ranted and moved into the idea that currency is an advanced form of slavery... etc.. My mom told me that everyone ""needs"" to work and that I must be mentally ill, and that I probably need medication. Am I crazy? What did I do? Also, I feel really good physically and emotionally since I started seeing things as constructs and not really ""real"" in the classic sense."

1503,"Don't want to sleep, not that forcing it would work, either.","[Bipolar 2 with psychotic features]
Yeah, it's 4:17am, and I have zero interest in sleep. As far as I'm concerned, I will be fine with staying up until tomorrow night, or later. 

If I tried to force sleep right now, I will toss around, itch, and become even more wakeful. Possibly irritable, too. 

All I could possibly take for it is Tylenol PM (Tylenol with Benadryl in it), or neurontin that's not even my prescription. Not really interested in either of them, especially since it would probably make me sleep too long. 

I like it that I don't have to spend as much time caring about sleep. If I can't sleep, at least it's cool that I don't care. I'm not miserable, because being awake feels like a superpower, and an adventure. 

I have cartoons. May this wakeful period live long and prosper. Maybe I can even clean the basement. Don't emulate me. I'm not quite right."

1506,I don't know how to respond to something I witnessed,"I witnessed a suicide of a man in the mountains. It has been a week and a half and I don’t know how to respond. 

My friends who were with me have been able to move on. I feel like my own mental health issues are making it hard for me to process. 

My friends have moved on with their lives. I’m still debating in my head whether I sympathise with the man or I am angry at his actions. I’m still debating if I have a right to grieve in this circumstance. 

I am struggling to find any information online on how to respond. Does anyone have any ideas?"
1507,“Junk” hours are really getting to me recently.,"I’m in a weird transitional period. Got out of rehab a month ago and staying at a sober house because well I was a wreck and nearly destroyed my relationship but that’s a long story. 

So my days have been consisting of working on myself as much as I can. Like, tons. I’ve made more progress in the last 3 months than I have in over a decade of trying to get my mental health under control. It’s fucking insane how far I’ve come, now is the phase of nailing down all of the little stuff and learning how to maintain everything I’ve learned and gained. So that’s a lot of what I’m doing. 

Also working hard on finding a job. I have really tight requirements because of what I was use to making and I’m getting into an IOP that effects my availability. Very stressful but I have some promising leads finally. 

On top of all of that, I am of course doing all my daily responsibilities, chores, going to AA meeting daily, trying to meet new people (haven’t in 10 years) exercising or doing side work every day. 

And of course, I need some time to relax. But right now it’s so super hard to relax. Not only do I want to keep being productive, but I’m having bad anhedonia on and off. So I am doing my very best to relax with mixed results. 

So that leads me to a few junk hours every night. I’ve done everything productive I can for the day. Had a good day, time to relax right? Well I can’t a lot of the time. I just can’t find anything to do that is relaxing. I could read, and I love to, but that isn’t relaxing for me the way it is for some, it’s enjoyable work. I go for a lot of walks during this time, and I enjoy it, but I don’t feel it’s relaxing at all. Tried playing my switch and it just does nothing for me right now. I surf reddit but that is not exactly relaxing. I journal, or read self help articles, and that’s productive but again not relaxing. So all these things, all this time, I feel like I’m in a really wasteful place in between productive and relaxing. Relaxing or productive is healthy and necessary. But these junk hours just seem like wasted time. I take solace in the fact I am trying to relax usually in these hours. And it’s better than nothing, taking the time to do this stuff slows me down, and otherwise I’d be burning out faster (think I still am a bit). 

Anyone feel they experience this? Any suggestions? Thanks, hope you’re great."
1508,Feeling extremely down and I don’t know why,"I can barely remember anything anymore. The days feel distorted. What happened only a few days ago feels like months ago. I feel empty, and the past few days have been a roller coaster from feeling sick, sad, hopeless, and empty. I'm getting super irritated super quickly. I can barely focus. I'm tired for no reason. I can’t be damned to do anything anymore. People are such an effort. My heads clouded. I don’t know what this is. I don’t like it. I’ve felt empty for a while, among other things, but this is just so so different. It’s like I’ve just been plunged into the ocean and I can’t get out, and I’m slowly freezing and losing consciousness. I can barely think rationally. I’ve had periods like this before that’ve lasted weeks at a time, but idk what triggered this. It’s just come out of the blue. And I can never recall how bad it is or even what happened afterwards. It’s like it’s a fever dream or something.

Idk what this is. Idk what’s caused it. I don’t know much about diagnosis’s or official conditions but I KNOW this isn’t normal. Does anyone else know what this is?"

Long story short. I met this girl online a few years ago. I fell for her and we had great moments (in terms of friendship) for some time. After that she cut off communication, without giving me any explanation. Months later, we started talking again, but the situation had cooled down. Recently she confessed to me that I had scared her with my actions, something I did not realize and at least did not do voluntarily.

I understand concepts like sudden ""emotional attacks"" or lack of energy. But I still don't understand what it means for these people to be close to others. Honestly, I feel bad. I feel like I've failed her.

Some told me I'd go to hell. Some told me that they know someone who has it much worse and it's just something that'll pass. Some even said I was doing it for attention. Professional help wasn't much better. CBT has never really helped me - in fact I kind of think it's made me worse - and none of the doctors I went to took me seriously because of my age except one, who said nobody took me seriously because I hadn't tried to kill myself (I was severely suicidal at the time, who am I kdding, I still am) then ignored everything I told her about my symptoms and gave me pills which made me feel like shit. I've come to the realization that every time I reach out for help it makes things worse and the only person I can rely on is myself. I thought I could manage my mental health all alone, but I can't, and I really don't know what to do. I'm not asking for help because help is kind of impossible in my situation, I just want someone to hear what I'm saying for once, yknow?"

1513,Studies Show Link Between Sugar And Cognitive Decline," Studies show link between sugar and cognitive decline. Sugar is often referred to as “White poison” by medical practitioner. It is the sweetest way to get to your eternal abode and developing all the ailments known to humankind. Sugar or carbohydrates are known to cause inflammation in the body as well and it also cause life-threatening disease such as diabetes.  


 We also know that sugar or glucose is the fuel for cancer cells, bacterias, viruses and several other antigens. The list of devastating effect of sugar on the human body keeps growing every other day. Now, many studies have been conducted that endorse the fact that sugar causes cognitive decline.  


[**Alzheimer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease), more commonly known as old age disease or senility or dementia is now referred to as Type 3 diabetes. Because, now researchers are discovering that Alzheimer is also caused by the high sugar intake.  


Study conducted by journal *Diabetologia* over 10 year period found that people with higher blood sugar level are more likely to suffer cognitive decline.  


Melissa Schilling, a professor at New York University, also done her own research regarding the connection between high blood sugar level and **Alzheimer**, also validated the theory that elevated insulin levels leads to Alzheimer, she discovered that [**hyperinsulinemia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinsulinemia) increases the risk of developing Alzheimer disease, which is a cognitive disorder. Interestingly though, she also discovered that even people who don’t make insulin are more likely to suffer from Alzheimer.

1516,My mental health story so far,"I am a 29 year old single dad to a 10 year old. For as far back as I can remember I've always felt not part of the crowd, not what the masses would regard as 'normal.' In my local area I'm a very popular lad but I haven't got many friends at all and not one that I can call a close friend. I've always put off getting my mental health checked because where I use to drink and smoke weed a lot throughout my teenage years and early to mid 20's and what with all the stresses that come with being a single parent I always put my 'not normalness' down to that. Some days I'm hyper as anything and will talk to everybody I see but then some other days I stay hidden from the world, curtains drawn, hiding under a blanket with my anxiety hitting a peak and feeling like the whole world is watching me, scrutinizing me that sort of.thing. Then last year after talking to someone in November I decided to get in contact with a group of therapists to try and treat this cuz it just seems to get more and more intense as I get older. I originally  got in contact with therapist just to try and treat anxiety, social anxiety and had around 10 CBT sessions over the phone before I got a little paranoid thinking people were coming to my home to kill me, I wouldn't leave the house cuz I thought there were people out to get me but when I would go out I told the therapist I intended to carry a knife out for protection and as soon as I told him that he referred me to mental health specialists in my area with care co-ordinator and all sorts. What they then done was prescribe me some medication and put me on CBT for psychosis which I'm still yet to find out when that is due to start. The meds they had me on at first was just setraline but all these done was make me lose sleep. After bringing this up with them and with me not wanting to go near any kind of benzos (as I know for sure I'd end up addicted to them) they prescribed some zopiclone. These tho, I was practically doing the whole box on the first day of getting them, I can't remember a thing when I was taking them but I know for sure they didn't help me sleep at all. Just got me out of my head lol so I told them that these weren't working either so they chucked me on an anti-psychotic called levomapromzine but these don't make me feel any different mentally. I'm due to see a psychiatrist in August and it certainly looks as tho I'll be getting a formal diagnosis that is broader than anxiety...."

I was and still am friends with a dude that was in my grade. He had an older brother, who also had a friend. Well that friend grew up in a similar way I did, so he took me in like I was his own brother. Whenever my mom was drinking and popping pills I would go over there and he would basically give me the big brother treatment. Cooked me dinner and played video games with me and stuff like that. When I was around 12 me and my mom moved in with my bow step dad on his ranch 45 miles out of town, but I lost that escape that I used to have when shit when shit got rough at home.

When I was 14 I was getting bullied at school, on top of my memories of my childhood, and always thought I was never good enough to change my mom, anyway, I was having thoughts of of ending it all, so I called him telling him that I can’t think straight and that I can’t go on anymore, so he drove an hour to pick me up and drove all the way to the closest city ( the town he lived in is a small ranch and farm town so there isn’t much to do there) which was another hour out of his way, just to take me out to lunch and Dave and Busters and basically gave me the talk of “don’t be afraid to call me when your feeling like this” kind of thing. Anyway he saved my life that day. Back to today. I found out yesterday that he passed in a car accident at around 2 pm. I’ve never had a death hit me this hard ever besides my best friend who committed suicide on august 1st, 2016. Im only 20 l. I’ve gone through so much shit in my life already and it’s only getting worse, and I’ve lost the one person that helped me get out of my head. He saved my life and now HES gone. The worst part about it, he has a kid and he just got engaged the day before his passing. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so stuck in my head right now. I didn’t want to wake up this morning, and now I’m 30 minutes late to work and I can’t tell my boss what I’m going through because I don’t want to feel like a putty party. Anyways, thanks for reading and listening."

1519,Youthdale Group Homes,"Hey,

I was wondering if anyone spent their teens in the group homes/psych wards that are owned and managed by Youthdale. The head office and most of the group homes are in Toronto, but there is a summer camp and three group homes up in Northern Ontario. 
I went through some fucked up shit while under their care and was even reached out to by journalists about my experiences. If anyone else has been there feel free to dm me too."
1520,I'm really struggling,"My anxiety &amp; OCD have been really bad lately. I feel like something terrible (I go into more specifics in my head, but don't want to trigger anyone) is going to happen and there's nothing I can do to protect myself. The demand for compulsions is so high, it's not something I can physically (or mentally) keep up with. I am debilitated. So much of my life has been ""I can't do this because XYZ will happen"" and conditioning and limiting everything around me. It's severely affected my quality of life. I can't do the compulsions anymore, and I want to stop giving into them and just live my life, but I am so so scared.  


Has anyone been in a similar situation? I need some hope and reassurance

I don’t really know what to say. I know we’re all good at wearing a mask, we’ve been trained to do so because of the stigma that comes with mental health and not wanting to make people “uncomfortable”..we cater to them even though we are hurting.

Quarantine has been hard. I lost my best friend and therapist of ten years to Covid. I’m tired of going “uhm fine” because the truth is pretty harsh and yeah. You know what I’m saying: it’s like, “you really want to know how I am?”

I get that this can be seen as Whitney. And that’s fine. I want to ask if the community, what is the easiest thing to say back? Yes there’s the truth and I support and prefer speaking my authentic truth, but when I have been more honest, things get heavy quickly.

I am in between on the idea of making friends I do and don't want them. I think that is also because of the outcast/reject mindset.

1535,Should I seek counseling for this issue that doesn't affect my everyday life but may affect future relationships?,"I'm sorry, I know this is really mild compared to what other people come here about, but I figured I'll probably be taken seriously here, at least. Almost two years ago, there was... An incident. I was a Job Corps student and I was stuck living in the dorms because I had nowhere else to go. It was a really toxic environment and people were always bullying me and stealing my clothes and refusing to let me get enough sleep to function. I was in a My Little Pony meetup group, and I told my friends there about my situation. One man offered to let me stay at his place on weekends so I could catch up on sleep and do my laundry without having to worry about it being stolen if I look away for a minute. (No joke. I looked away from the dryer for a minute, and when I looked back, someone had opened it and stolen my clothes. Security insisted that the security footage didn't show anyone stealing my clothes, but that's BS.) Let's call him M. I hadn't known him very long. In fact, that was only my second time meeting him. He'd joined and been made an organizer while I was away for several months. The other organizers trusted him, and I trusted them, so I accepted. Plus some of the Job Corps staff remembered him from when he was at Job Corps eight years earlier (he's seven years older than me) and spoke highly of him. He was president of the honors dorm, apparently, though he was also responsible for the rumor that the honors dorm was haunted. He was obviously attracted to me, but I was attracted to him, too, so I didn't see that as an issue. I didn't think that there would be an issue with him expecting sex or anything because he said he was celibate. 

I felt like things were going well the first two weekends, but looking back, I realize there were red flags from the beginning. I'd never been in a romantic relationship before, though (even though I was 21), so I didn't really know what was normal and what wasn't. He frequently talked about how big his penis was and how pants were really uncomfortable because of it. I met his mom when we went over to her house so he could work on his stepfather's car, and she told me that some teenage girl once accused M of sexually assaulting her. Nothing came of it because there was no evidence, and M's mom firmly believes that M didn't do it. She says that the girl wasn't his type at all anyway. She weighed 300 pounds and M likes small girls, according to his mom.

The third weekend, we were cuddling (something I'd never done before) while he told me about an anime convention the next weekend. I had to go to the bathroom and he needed to go to work soon, so I got up. He got up, too, and said that he had an erection because we'd been cuddling and he couldn't go to work until it went down. He asked if I wanted to see because I'd never seen a penis irl before (except for an infant having his diaper changed and a toddler running around naked on a houseboat). He said it was ""for educational purposes"" and it was ""just a body part."" I didn't really want to see, so I answered, ""I don't know."" He kept asking and I continued to say ""I don't know."" Then he said that he thought that I wanted to see it but that I was just afraid of sounding like a creep, so he showed me. I think I went numb with shock at that point. I didn't know what to think or what to feel. I think he talked some more about how big it was. Then he asked if I wanted to touch it. At first I said ""I don't know"" (though I'm not sure why I said that because the answer was DEFINITELY no to that). He kept asking, and eventually I said no and reminded him that I needed to go to the bathroom and he was late for work. He was gone by the time I got out of the bathroom. 

The next few days, I felt...off. I couldn't stop thinking about what had happened. I eventually texted my aunt about it. She said that viewing of private parts is sexual activity and sexual activity requires consent, and ""I don't know"" isn't consent. She said that what he did was absolutely NOT okay and I needed to tell him that. So I did. He apologized and said it wouldn't happen again, but he still tried to justify it by saying that he doesn't see it as sexual and neither do nudists or exhibitionists. I told my favorite teacher about what happened and she strongly recommended that I not go to his apartment again. (The other Job Corps staff I told weren't so kind, even the ones who had known M. They said it was my fault for going to a man's apartment.) I told a close friend, J, about what happened. He was another organizer in the My Little Pony me group. He was horrified by what M had done. He said that M was grooming me and probably planned to rape me eventually. Needless to say, M was kicked out of the group for being a sexual predator. 

I know this is nothing compared to what a lot of other women have been through. At least I wasn't raped. But it seems it's still affecting me. I never used to have any issues with normal, non-sexual touching from men. But now, unless I know him really well, being touched by a man (other than handshakes) makes me really uncomfortable. When I went rock climbing (before coronavirus, of course), a male employee helped me put on the harness because I hadn't been rock climbing in years and didn't remember how to put it on, and when he happened to touch my thighs and my sides in the process, I stiffened and felt very uncomfortable. He noticed, too, and asked if I was okay. When I was visiting a synagogue for the first time (also before the coronavirus), an old man who had helped me understand what was going on during the service (which was mostly in Hebrew) put his hands on my shoulders to guide me to the table where he would be sitting while eating the lunch provided after the service, and this also made me uncomfortable. He didn't seem to notice, but that may just have been because he didn't see my face. I'm worried about how this will affect romantic relationships. I dream of falling in love with a nice Jewish man, getting married under a chuppah, and having many Jewish babies (after I've converted, of course). But if normal, non-sexual touching makes me really uncomfortable with men who I don't know very well, maybe I'll be psychologically incapable of having sex even with a man who I DO know and trust. Who will have me if it may take weeks, months, or even years for me to work my way up to being able to have sex? I don't usually think about what M did to me, but earlier I was fantasizing about having a family and it hit me that I might not be able to have sex with a man without experiencing distress because of what happened. (To be clear, I'm a virgin and I plan to stay a virgin until I'm married.) This is basically the only issue I have other than some low self-esteem. I used to have severe mental health issues, but I've mostly been fine since I was taken off the medication I was prescribed when I was 15. (I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when really I just had severe depression and some symptoms of borderline personality disorder. I was prescribed mood stabilizers, which greatly reduced my ability to see patterns and possibilities. That's an essential part of my personality and my primary method of taking in information. Without it, I was forced to rely on my secondary method of taking in information, which is noticing details and comparing them to the way things were in the past. Unfortunately, when you combine that with my primary method of making decisions, which is making decisions based on my personal feelings and values, it results in extremely unhealthy thought patterns if it continues for very long. Basically I was in a constant state of hating myself for everything I've ever done wrong. In case you know about MBTI, I'm an INFP and I just described a Fi-Si loop. I had already been in that state before I started taking those medications, but the medications prolonged it. I also couldn't concentrate and I became confused easily because the meds made me unable to think quickly enough to understand things. I barely graduated from high school because those medications messed up my executive functioning so badly, and I wouldn't have graduated if I hadn't been home schooled. Eventually I went to a psychiatrist who recognized that I'm NOT bipolar and took me off of those medications. First day without my meds, I felt great and my mind was finally working properly and I no longer was stuck in that terrible state I described a bit ago. Then I became severely sleep deprived because my brain forgot how to fall asleep without the meds, so I was a wreck for a week because I don't do well with severe sleep deprivation. Then my brain remembered how to fall asleep and I was fine again.) I ended up having issues for a while when I was at Job Corps because of M and the bullies and the staff who told me that I can't handle life if I can't handle being harassed every day, but nothing too severe. Prozac helped with that and I no longer need it now that I'm out of that hellhole. Should I seek counseling for this issue I have with physical contact with men, even though I'm completely fine otherwise?"
1536,A big vent of my life,"(Messy english here sorry my first language isnt english)

&amp;#x200B;

Uhm Hi,

i just wanted to vent some stuff about me and my mental health over the years and i thought this was the best place for that. I been struggling with my mental health probably for 11 years now (im 19 right now) it started with me always being the one that got picked on very early on i dont remeber most of it now but i still remeber how i wanted to just jump off a building and have it done. Over the years i didnt really had a lot of friends but the ones i had were really great except for one that i shouldnt even consider one anymore he abused me mentaly and physicly he stole from me, he lied to me and even sexually used me (i was like 10 at that time and he was like 1-2 years older) i didnt knew what i was doing at that moment but looking back at it its really messing with me. As i hit puberty depression hit me hard and the picking on didnt stop even when i was in class with my best friend. I still remeber the feeling of it this empty feeling making everything not matter. I really hope i never go back to it its something you wish on nobody. In that time i also started to try to shut down my emotions so that i insted of feeling bad atleast feel nothing. It wasnt very succesfull but it probably has done something i still cant put my finger on. After my school years i got into a programm to help me find a job and stuff but i cant im not ready for a job or even an internship im scared of strangers and places i normaly wouldnt be. I dont know how i can explain it with strangers i just feel in danger and something else but places im normaly not in i feel unwelcomed i feel like i shouldnt be there its so strong that i already get too scared when i approch the place/building its like a wall preventing me from going and pushing me away.  Some other things that might be intresting are that i did had therapy once when i was in that depression but the only thing i remeber from it are the word ""if nothing is wrong go away there are others with worse problems"" maybe i didnt open up but saying that shouldnt be right for a therapist. My Parents also werent a big help on all of this. My father died early in 2010 and my mom is sick since birth and cant even go outside. Also i have my Grandma which isnt really great as she seems mentaly also unstable she gets angry over a fork missing and im always the one to blame when something is wrong and when im angry and maybe shouting im just get shut down like i dont have the right to be angry. Luckly im getting help soon i already have an appointment for that in the hospital and plan to take off a year to start healing even tho i planned to countine school but another therapist in that programm i mentiont earlier told me it would be a better idea to take that year off at first i didnt even think of that possiblity but it seems right. But right now i feel like screaming i had an internship today but i just couldnt go i was scared this wall came up ealier than ever it came up on the way (i knew both places tho) i just wanna stop now the possiblity of a break took something off of me but it also made everything im still having on my back heavier than ever. I wanna scream cry punch something and even hurt myself just something to not go and let everything out. Sorry i forgot to mentiont that Suicide ideas and the thought of hurting myself has been following me for a long time now i never went throught with it i only got to the point where i hold the knife againt my arm but i just coulndt but now i dont know when the time comes my self control colapses i feel like hurting myself is easier than needed to go somewhere i dont wanna go. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a huge text thank you if you read until here i really appreciate your intrested. I didnt told everything because its a lot and i would need to sort my mind for that you probably noticed what a mess that text was i struggelt to include everything i was ok with sharing with people on the internet."

I have anxiety so I get kind of uncomfortable. Says nothing will happen between them, long time ago dated kind of thing, etc.

recently, he just got a new job that conflicts with our schedules so I hadn’t really spent a lot of time with him lately and I have felt we have gotten a little distant. Last night, he finally gets home and I am actually awake and so happy to finally see him. As soon as we start to cuddle, the phone rings, it’s her. She needed someone to talk to. I just start to cry because I just wanted to spend some time with him.

The next morning, he is cold shouldered toward me. Said she jumped off of a balcony last night after he ended the phone call. He then said this: “I talked to her for a little bit so I could spend some time with you. I should have been on the phone longer with her.” She is going to be okay as far as I know, but I feel like I am to blame."

1555,Why do I feel like I don’t deserve nice things?,"Why do I feel like I don’t deserve nice things?

I’ve been wondering this for a while and I was wondering if anyone could help shed some light on my  issue.


For one, I no longer like my birthday. I used to love my birthday and looked forward to it.
However I had some crap birthdays several years in a row due to some poor behaviour from my then friends and ex girlfriend and I just decided to not bother anymore. I never ask for gifts, don’t want to go out to celebrate and prefer to ignore the whole thing. This unfortunately really upsets my wife who would love to make a big fuss, but I no longer think it’s necessary.


I make sure no one at work knows it’s my birthday and have taken it off of social media for this reason.
This way, I miss out on the “birthday drinks night”, the cake, present and usual monetary collection that my work kindly does whenever it’s someone’s birthday.
I happily pay in for everyone else’s birthday, but I never let on when it’s mine.


Strangely, although I’ve been there for almost 4 years, no one has ever noticed that I’ve never once had a birthday in all that time 😅 


Also, I don’t buy myself anything. And I mean anything. If I rarely do then it takes me weeks to talk myself into it and think of hundreds of ways to justify it before finally doing it. And even then, I’m not talking about grand purchaces: I’m talking £23 for a PS4 game (which I’ve waited years to be released) that then took me weeks of talking myself into.


I really struggle to buy myself new clothes. I just hate it. I used to love it in my 20’s and owned sneakers and shoes, jeans, hoodies, shirts etc.

I love to look good, but now I feel like it’s a waste of money. I’m more than happy for my wife to buy herself new clothes and for our daughter though. She has nice shoes, clothes and my wife has nice make up etc, but for me I see new clothes for myself as an extravagance that I can live without. Some of my t-shirts and all of my jeans I’ve had for 6 years minimum. 


She wants me to have a whole new wardrobe for our first family holiday abroad, but I just can’t do it. She went out and bought me a pair of shorts and a shirt. They’re beautiful and I was very grateful, but that’s enough - even though we both know that’s definitely not a full holiday wardrobe, I’m happy to make do with my old clothes so perhaps my wife and daughter could have more or we could save that money for something we could all benefit from.

Some years ago, my wife talked me into buying a £200 leather jacket that I really loved, but refused to buy. She made me buy it. I love it, but I never wear it 😔


I don’t mind spending money on my wife and daughter however.
What little spare money I have I’ll gladly spend on them without second thought.



Recently, my wife made a very grand gesture. She offered to buy me a motorbike for my upcoming birthday (a milestone). I was stunned.
I adore motorbikes and I’ve wanted one since I was 3, but I sold my previous bike so I could afford to go to uni. However even though I’ve had enough money to buy one since, I always put it off and spend the money on “sensible things”. Ie, things we could all use/benefit from.


Initially I was very pleased by her offer, but two days later I find I’m talking myself out of it and I’m now trying to find ways to get out of it.


I don’t know why 😔


Any advice?



Edit: I’d also like to clarify that I do deserve to be happy. I love my family I deserve them, we work hard for each other and I wouldn’t be without them. I am happy and deserve that. I deserve happiness and success in my career, but I just can’t justify treating myself to literally anything.

1559,I dont trust my brain anymore,"I feel like when it comes to friendships and relationships I don’t trust my own opinions anymore. Throughout my life I have been in multiple abusive relationships that have left me feeling completely useless. I have had almost every friendship crumble after a year. I give it my all and show support, and feel I’m a good friend and girlfriend. One of my boyfriends left me for his ex and another cheated on me in our own apartment. I’ve had to restart my life quite a few times. I’m currently in a new friend group talking to a new guy but I feel like my brain is trying to sabotage it all. If a friend doesn’t respond I assume the worst. If anyone acts even a little off I start to want to distance myself. I am still in communication with one of my ex’s because he had been a good friend previously and neither of us have any romantic feelings anymore. The new guy still texts his ex as well and while I know I’m doing the same thing and shouldn’t think too far into it, I find myself obsessing. I’m afraid I’m going to be left for an ex again. A part of me wants to end the relationship but another part is aware he is a gentleman that has treated me with more kindness and affection than anyone has previously. I have brought it up and he is incredibly reassuring and sweet but I still obsess. I don’t want to make any decisions because I feel like I don’t trust myself anymore. I think my brain is trying to push me away from everyone so I don’t get hurt again. But I don’t want to leave and end up missing out on something that could be amazing for me. Has anyone ever experienced this dilema? How do I make a decision when I don’t trust myself with anything?"

1561,Motivation advice,"Hello,

So I'm not sure if this fits under mental health but let me tell you a little bit about myself.

I graduated university this year with a social work degree. I got my dream job, counselling, right out of university but I had to move 12 hours away from my family to a small town in northwestern Ontario. I am loving my job, the work I do and the people I work with are amazing and I know taking this job is the best thing for my career. What I struggle with is outside of work. 

Lately, I have been feeling more tired and reluctant of doing things outside of my apartment. I find that I am not doing chores and not being active outside. I find myself on YouTube, Facebook, Netflix or gaming more than I am taking care of myself. I am letting my living space get more and more messy, like not doing dishes, laundry, sweeping, and not eating properly. 

And it's not like I don't want to do these things. Like last week after work, I made a plan of what I needed to do last weekend. I wanted to clean my apartment, sweep, mop, clean dishes and go outside and do something. But when the weekend came, I did nothing but laze around feeling so tired.

I have been speaking to a counsellor and while it does help when I speak with her but after awhile, the effects of our talk wear off. Like there are so many things I want to do with my life and I find I am kicking my own ass cause I'm not doing it.

Like I moved to this beautiful area and I want to see what it has to offer but I just stay inside all day. I am getting back to my heaviest weight I have ever been and I want to be healthier and lose weight, but I find myself eating junk food and just lying around all day. I want to keep my living space clean and organized but I just let it go and say ""I will do it tomorrow"". And my sleep schedule is poor to say the least. I find myself getting to bed at like 2 in the morning and I have to wake up for work at 7 during the week for work. I want to fix my sleep schedule so I'm not constantly in this state of feeling tired and lacking energy.

So I ask you, what are some things I can do to keep myself motivated to keep working towards my personal goals?"
1562,Covid Lockdown,"Since the covid lockdown started in March, I’ve been struggling with my mental health. I have anxiety, depression, bipolar symptoms and the cherry on top, you guessed it! I’m introverted. I take my medicine, do my steps, have tried to being more active but I can’t anymore being in a bubble for 5 months has done nothing but want me to kill myself or cut myself just to feel anything. It feels like since being furloughed from my job, classes getting switched to remote for the semester, I feel a crushing numbness that makes me want to kill myself. I try not to  but I don’t know how much longer I can take this pandemic and lockdown."
1563,This has been coming for some time... I'm finally listening.,"Anxiety, depression, ADHD... labels stuck on me cause I don't feel right in this... monotony. I'm done ignoring the little voice in my head screaming at me, ""yo, we dying are you gonna try living while we here?""         

I ain't crazy. Everyone else. They are laughing at me. Fucking mocking me. They think they have power or authority over me, but you don't. I'm in charge. I'm the only authority I trust from this point on.         

I'm done. Deleting my therapist's number. Blocking most of my friends and family. I'm taking control. I'm gonna wipe the slate. No food or sleep. No nothing. I'll see what I really need. What fulfils me. What makes me right. Cause it ain't this. It ain't this."
1564,Advice for friend who has mental health issues.,[removed]
1565,Is there anyone who relates?,"Hi. I have been diagnosed and dealing with bipolar disorder for over 3 years now. I had battled depression for a long time before that and had tried to commit suicide around the time i was diagnosed, but luckily survived. I have come a long way since then and i am in a good state of mind. I handle my episodes much better than i used to do before. I generally am living a better life and currently i am not suffering from any major depression state or any hypomanic episodes. I have nothing to complain about except usual work and family related stress, and i am happy with how my life is. The thing is there are specific moments that i dissociate with my self and have suicidal thoughts even though i am not depressed. For example, recently i had a big fight with a person very dear to me over a very silly issue, and after the fight instead of cooling my self down, my mind immediately started thinking ""i want to die, i want to end it all right here, right now"". After i calmed down, I was really ashamed of my self for thinking this way and promised my self i would do better. This scenario has happened 5 times in the past six months. I really want to stop it, but in those moments i just lose control of my mental and emotional state. My psychiatrist told me its normal to feel this way sometimes and didn't prescribe me antidepressants as he observed i am not in a depressive state. Has anyone here experienced this type of problems? If so, how did you handle it?"
1566,I feel like I just need a place to get my thoughts out.,"Im so tired of stress and anxiety it makes me want to just quit everything and lay down and curl up into a ball

Hi guys my names Kuba, I’m almost 20 and I feel like I just need to lay my thoughts out. These past few months have gotten so much more difficult in my life. I have a steady job that pays well in the labor field but it’s so time and energy demanding. Since COVID I’ve been stressing a shit ton as I have to pay for my schooling. I’ve picked up side jobs as I can put my skills to use but I’ve even managed to fuck that up. I made a mistake for a customer who is super pissed and I’ve been trying to fix my mistake but everytime I do it feels like I fuck up more or the customer becomes more unhappy. It just feels like I’m losing control over my life. I can tell I’m not nearly as happy as I was or have been. There’s a constant feeling in my stomach like I wanna throw up and I can’t tell if it’s from stress or anxiety or both. My friends and GF are very good people and can tell somethings up with me but I’m very bad at opening up to people as I feel I put a bourbon on them if I talk about my feelings. I’ve lost interest in things that used to be so fun for me like gaming or even hanging out with my friends. When I hang out and we drink i just get quite because I’m in my head thinking about stuff that makes me stressed which just results in more stress. I don’t even feel enthusiastic about going back to school as everytime I think about it it results in stressing about money. I just feel like I want to quit everything and lay in my bed as that’s where I feel most comfortable. I know this is all over the place but I’m really not good at getting my thoughts out. I just needed somewhere to rant and try and get it out to see if other people have felt the same. Thanks"

I’ve talked to someone with bpd and we go through the same things and that’s how she was diagnosed. Can someone help with planning what to say and how to talk about my problems and get a test"
1569,Title...,"You get tired of being alone... Having nobody... But at the same time it's what your used to.. being put into a corner by yourself for years without relief... Social anxiety that you never had 5-6 years ago... Now you are just a mess. A walking, talking, mess. And there is no end in sight. No end to the misery. No reason or drive to get up and meet people... You've done it all before. And look where it gets you... Everyone you thought would be there. Is gone. Everything you thought would come true... Never happened... And all the while the world steps on your fucking face stamping whatever light you had out... Like a dirty fucking cigarette butt. What is the point of trying... To make an excuse and say ""atleast I don't have downsyndrome, atleast im not paralyzed"" is fucking wrong. When you want to be nothing you want to be nothing. Regardless of your physical health or mental health. To say that shit to people who have chronic depression is a slap in the fucking face. Idk where I'm going with this... I just have no friends... Nobody to listen to me... So i come here... Fuck if I know why. Have a great day... Everyone who read this far in my post..."
1570,Stress is about to make me lose the woman I love...help?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 1/2 years and I thought our relationship was good. She felt differently and has been unhappy for a year or two. We had a long talk and I ended up breaking down in tears. A lot of issues in the relationship appear to be due to stress I have with work and life that I don’t think I was fully aware of. I am quick to get upset over small issues and disagreements, or get upset over things like breaking a cup. I also am very defensive any time I am accused of anything negative. I’m not paying attention to my health like I should, such as her having to convince me for several years to go to the dentist. I rarely take initiative to do housework and my office at home is full of clutter and dirty coffee cups and plates.

So we had a talk last night, because I could tell she has been upset recently. She broke down all the things that have been making her miserable and we think a lot of it is stemming from stress at work, that is making me irritable and depressed at home. I’m a detective at a police department and I’m constantly griping about work. I never feel all that stressed, but I can’t figure out any other cause for the way I’ve been the past two years. It’s only gotten worse recently with the protests.

She wants to stay with her mom for a while. I’m devastated by this and I want to do anything to fix this. She wants me to seek help but I don’t know where to start. I wrote down a huge list of stress in my life. I expected maybe five or six things. I wrote down close to thirty. Big things, small things.


How do I get control of my stress?"
1571,I’m concerned for my cognitive function.,"Anxiety and depression sufferer for past 15 years. Starting college this semester. I’m afraid it’ll affect my ability to concentrate, perform, and pay attention."
1572,I need help. I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I am very new to reddit, as I am desperate to find an anonymous outlet to find help. 
I have always somewhat struggled with mental health. I have had suicidal thoughts since i can remember as a child. In my adult life, I am now struggling more than ever. I have been married for over 2 years now, and I think anyone would be able to tell you that marriage is a struggle on its own whether you have mental health issues or not. 
December 12th, 2019 was the day that I lost everything, and it was the worst day of my life. My husband wanted a divorce. I won’t go into detail, but my husband wanted nothing to do with me or to see me ever again. This was the day that I attempted to end my life. This horrific day replays in my mind every single day. 
Flash forward to now, July 20th 2020. My husband and I moved back in together 2 months ago and agreed to work on our marriage. We see a counselor every other week. I thought we were great, other than a few arguments here and there. Last night he came to me and said that he has been thinking about divorce since 2 weeks of us living together again. After repeating those words I completely collapsed and started crying uncontrollably. I couldn’t breathe, my face felt like it went numb, I couldn’t stop screaming, and I felt like I lost all control and was losing everything once again. I didn’t know if i was going to pass out, throw up, or both. I laid in the bathroom floor for about an hour until I could start to come back to some sense of “normal”. I took 3 Advil PM just so I could pass out and not have to deal with what I was feeling.

I woke up this morning and I’m still not right. I can’t breathe normally, my chest hurts, my hands are still shaking, and I have an incredible feeling of uneasiness and inability to focus.

I guess I’m just wondering if there’s a name for what I’m going through. Like PTSD? I feel like I’m going insane and cannot keep it together.

Thanks for reading this far, if you did, or if anyone even cares."

""What?""


""You heard me.""


""Ok. I'll bite. What are you talking about?""


""My purpose. The whole, 'why I'm here', thing.""


""Okaaaay... go on.""


""If I can love myself, then I'll be free...""


""You are free. Look where you live...""


""No, no, no! I'm bound! Bound quite tightly. Bound by fear. It informs every decision I ever make. And not in a positive or constructive way.""


""So, what are you afraid of? There's nothing to be afraid of. You know that.""


""Do I? Nothing to be afraid of, huh? Yeah. Right. 
Good question anyway. 
For the longest time, I didn't know what I was afraid of. Fear seemed to be an ever present stow away that I just couldn't get rid of. A general awareness of an ever present, and frequently powerful, influence. But, now I do know what I'm afraid of...
...well..., actually, I really did know back then, but was willfully denying it. I,... don't know... maybe I wasn't ready,..I guess... scared... it's so complicated, seemingly...
Anyway, ummm... where was I?""


""You were going to continue telling me why you're a coward?""


""A coward? What the heck? No.
Not a coward. 
The fear represents,... it...uh... Ugh.
Truth is? 
...I'm still a little boy....""

 
""Whaaat?! What the hell are you talking about?""


I, uh..., kinda never grew up... 
I mean, I've got a body and intellect that's nearly 50, yet, my conscience, my 'me',... it is still innocent, tender, naive...
Part of me got stuck in time. 
I look in the mirror, it's someone else's face.  Some old guy. And this stuck 'me' is repelled by a lot of what I've become. 'Me' has passed judgement, and I don't pass."" 


""This is getting wonky.""


""Quiet! Damnit!
This, 'me', is terribly burdened, and afraid. It wants to be free of the shackles of adulthood and pretend that awful shit isn't literally happening everywhere. It just wants to explore, and play and have fun, and marvel at the beauty and mystery of the world, and flip over rocks to study bugs and pretend to be a super hero. It wants to find stick guns and pow, pow, pow away to glory. It wants to be the damsel in distress that frees Herself and slays the freakin dragon.  It wants to cuddle and daydream. It wants to laugh and roll down a grassy hill. It wants to draw and  paint and sculpt and sing and dance. It wants to please mom and dad. 
Still. 
It still wants to please mom and dad, even after all these years.
And, it wants it to be ok to be sad that it's all over.  
There is a powerful sense of irretrievable loss. A sense that it's too late. The time was squandered,  and my one chance is gone. Just,... gone. And it's fucking pissed about the whole sour fucking deal. 
Just. 
Fucking. 
Pissed... 


""Touching. Sweet. Like little girls with kittens... What is this bullshit?""


""...this is an old story. A tired one. It has all been true since I was 10, to varying degrees.  
The week of my 10th birthday, I began truly cultivating hopelessness. I mean, my depression was there from years before, you remember? Of course you remember.""


""...of course,... I remember...""


""So, the earliest memory of depression is from when I was around 4. It then influenced everything I experienced from at least that point onward.  At 10, I..., well, I willfully left my childhood behind. I kinda,... well,... I gave up. I felt alone. In a very real sense,  emotionally abandoned from long before. I had little guidance and  I had crossed from single digits to double, and there was no going back. No redo. In my 10 year old brain, this was bigger than the discovery of water. 
It was already too late for me.
It was already too late."" 


""It's getting thick in here. Reeeeeal thick reeeeal quick...""


""Hmpph... quiet!
However, I am a fighter, with a strong instinct for self-preservation.  A great inner battle began and has been raging, with little reprieve and to varying degrees of intensity, until today. This battle has been fought by me,  against me, within me for all of this time. And, damnit,... I'm getting really tired.""


""You don't know what you're talking about. You are so completely full of shit,... Coward."" 


""Coward. Yeagh. Sometimes... fear... The fear... 
The fear is that little kids response to shame.""


 ""Here we go again...""


""Shame. Weaponized, it is incredibly destructive. It is the weapon that I choose  to continuously assault myself with. 
 I have an adversary, and my adversary is cunning, ruthless and deceitful.  My adversary is a shifty thief in the darkness and champion of subterfuge in the light. My adversary craftily weaves webs of shame into the fabric of my perception of reality, distorting and obscuring what's true. Making the irrational appear rational, masquerading light as shadow, shadow as light. It taunts and tortures and never stops.  My adversary is, paradoxically,  shameless in its pursuits. 
My adversary is 'me'""


""Nonsense. Nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Bizaaarre nonsense!"" 


""Is it, though?""


""...""


""Yeah, thought so.  Anyway, ...
I truly am my own worst enemy. Shame has dictated that it be so. I see that there is nothing I can do, be or say that makes me worthy. Shame is an integral part of the framework of my identity. There is no facet of my character that has not been shaped, in some way, by shame.  Shame was learned as I was constructing what would ultimately be my adult brain. Woven during my formative years. 
Shame. 
It's a part of me.""


""That's terrible! And useless! And you should kick someone's ass about it! Coward... idiot...your Dad shoulda set your ass straight!""


""Very insightful... and clever. Stop it, .. please...
My parents? They didn't do this to me. Did they?""


""Yup! They sure did! Moron! You know it's aaall their fault. You know it! You'll never get out from under Dad's eye! He is always watching and you will never, ever, ever be enough. Ever...""


""You're wrong, damn it! They just, ...well... they just let it happen. It wasn't intentional. They were busy chasing their white picket fence.  Doing what they were supposed to do. ...they just forgot to raise us, me and my little sister... 
I have to tell myself that they didn't know any better. The alternative is too painful to contemplate.


""They did know better. You weren't good enough.""


""You are fucking wrong! They were just working. Working to make our lives better, as they saw it... and,...I guess,...
'Me,' is really, really pissed about that. 
 Babysitters and daycares and then 1970's/1980's daytime television raised me. I was raised by what I identified with on TV.  I was mad at my parents for it then,  and still, I am mad today. So, for nearly 5 decades, I've been pissed at my parents for blowing it for me, which only perpetuates my being stuck in this position, but...
Correction.  Actually, the first ten years I wasn't mad. Was I?""


""No...not mad...""


""I was confused. And sad. And scared.""


""...alone...""


""And disappointed that I didn't make the cut. And I was waiting. Waiting for worthiness. Like it would just come to me some day. I would just wake up shameless. Free. A 'Man'. Like magic. 
I've been waiting,  and pissed about it, ever since.""


""Wait! Wait! What makes you worthy? Huh? What? There is something. There's gotta be! I know it! You just haven't found it yet. There's tons more things to try... what about fire fighting? You're totally awesome with chainsaws. That's manly! Or, maybe you could do  pornos? Huh? You're totally manly! You're just unhappy. Ungrateful. And a coward. Who says you have to be happy? You're weak. I believe in you...""


""I've found nothing makes me worthy... pornos?""


""Yeah, pornos. Why not? I mean... they are suuuuper manly. Right?
Why won't anything make you worthy? Huh?... I know why... Cause you're not!""


""Worth isn't even real, damnit! Ugh! Just stop!""


""Dude, you're just unlucky. That's all... ""


""Pornos...maybe,... I,... uh... I... No, no, no! Whatever...
Stop! Damnit... just stop...
Worthiness. It's not real. 
It's just not real. It's an imaginary construct humans came up with to try and make sense of their conflicting intellects and emotions. And for whatever reason, I'm sure it's tied to shame somehow, we will fight tooth and nail to not be proven wrong. I share that stubborn trait... and I think I know all this, however, I just can't seem to let shame go. It's learned? Can I unlearn it?  Even though it's a part of me..Haven't yet... Workin on it, you know that though...I don't think it'll ever go away...""


""You're afraid you're not worthy. Maybe you're just weak? Maybe not smart enough. Stupid?""


""Weak, huh? Stupid?... no, quite clever, actually... Wtf. Whatever... 
To confirm your statement, yes, I'm afraid I'm not worthy. But it's more than that, I'm afraid I'm right that I'm not worthy.""


""Huh? Sounds crazy.""


""Took you long enough.""


""What?""


""Throwing in that word. Nice. 
...fuck off... 
Back to what I was saying,
I'm afraid I'm correct in my assessment that I'm not worthy. If I'm correct, then I must stubbornly fight to prove so. It's the shame web. It ties everything together in such a way that I must forever stand accused, before myself, and serve as my own prosecution and defense. It is an entirely untenable situation. And, as I stated earlier, I am getting tired."" 


""Soooo, ya gonna start thinking about the ultimate solution again then? Huh?  Maybe it'll work this time. 4th strike, I bet yeeeer outa heeere! ...Seems kinda like mercy to me..., for eeeveryone... right?...just sayinnnn... you'll stop huuurtiiiing...""


""Wow. Pulling out all the stops, huh? You piece of... damnit... knock it off! I'm fucking telling you...""


""Threats!? ooooo! Ya gettin mad? Poor thing. Truth hurts, don't it? Go on! Hit me! It'll stop hurting if you hit me. I promise! One good one right in the jaw. Bam! Stars! Blessed relief! At least while you're cradling your pounding head. Fool! Coward! Crazy! Go on! Do it! Crazy! Do it! Crazy! Do it! Do it!""


""Not this time... not... this... time...
...Actually, ...for perhaps the first time ever..., I'm kinda,... glad?... to be having this discussion?...yes...
Truth does sometimes hurt. Indeed. But, I'm telling you, trying to tell you,... I've figured it out... 


""Unlikely.""


What you've presented to me throughout the years has mostly been carefully manipulated versions of what had been truth. Always leaving enough of what is real to make me question my own questions and believe in the fanciful reality I percieved. Sowing tiny, sometimes huge, seeds of doubt. Ceaselessly. 
Sometimes, even allowing the truth to shine,  if it would serve your purpose. I've figured out your game.""


""Oh ho ho ho! Figured out my game,  have you? My purpose? Really? Look at you! You are fucking nuts! Are you listening to yourself? I mean, c'mon man, wtf? ""


""Stop being dramatic. Not gonna work this time.""


""Dramatic! You are the queen of fucking drama queens! You don't even know what you' are talking about. Loser, Loser, Loser ,Loser, loser, loser, loo...""


""It stings. Each one. Every time. Every single time. It stings.""


""Stings? Who the fuck cares!?""


""You do... Clearly.""


""Well, and... and so what if I do? Wtf! It was supposed to sting, you dumb fuck.""


""Why?""


""Fuck! Why fucking what?""


""Why would you want to hurt me?""


""I..., I..., ..., I ... because... you... deserve it...
Who cares!
You are fighting a battle that you will always eventually lose. It will never end. I will never, ever, ever stop. I will spin and spin and spin in a carefully choreographed dance and you will never always see me coming. I will never, ever stop. Ever.""


""I know.""


""What? You know? What's that supposed to mean?""


""I know I can't beat you. You'll never, ever stop.""


""Soooo...""


""You'll not win.""


""Wait ... What? W-Why?""


""There is no winning, and you'd pay the ultimate price trying to get there  and you're too stubborn to allow that to happen again. Plus, you've seen a glimpse of the truth. So we are, perhaps, not stuck in a perpetual battle, after all.""


""Wrong. I'd let it ALL go in a heartbeat. History proves I'm right. And this fight? This fight is all you know. ""


""That was then. It's different now. You don't have the same influence you once had. You've  seen the truth and it will not be denied.  After all this work over the past 5 years, I've finally managed to show it to you. 
You are confused and trying to protect yourself. That's all. You're a little kid, in a grown up world, with little kid tools.""


""Oh yeah? Well, maybe you're delusional again... or still... How do you even know what's real? What's true?""


""Honestly? I really don't. But, as I said, I'm getting really tired. I'm tired of being mad, tired of feeling powerless, tired of being my own victim, lashing and lashing and lashing myself. Really, what I'm most exhausted with, is trying to be who you think you want me to be. Cause I'm not him.

1579,Suggestions for Psychiatrist,"Ok, so really putting myself out there... I've been seeing the same psychiatrist for years but really need to find a new one. My current psychiatrist has been mentally declining for the past couple of years (old age). I have terrible anxiety and insomnia; I had quit taking my medication recently thinking changes in my diet and a better job would help. Bad idea, haven't slept in a couple of days and my memory is greatly getting affected.  I am going to lose my job soon if I don't get myself together, the anxiety has taken over to the point I can't leave the house again (called in sick to work). I'm looking for a psychiatrist that will help me with medication management and more involved in my well being not just a doctor that I show up get my scripts and go. Thank you for any suggestions"
1580,Gotta take those tiny wins,"I’ve not been good for a while. Had a massive meltdown in May that shelved me for a month a and even since I’ve been kind of a step from the edge at any given time.
I can’t sleep, nor do I do anything productive while I’m up all night (it’s 2:30 AM now), and the drugs that do let me sleep also mean I’m useless in the morning.

The things I want to do get in the way of what I need to do and what I need to do gets in the way of what I want to do, so I compromise and do nothing at all.

I know when it comes on too. Everything just feels like it drops off a cliff for little to no reason and I’m left sat there.

Anyway, sorry, plus side;

1581,I've Lost all Motivation,"Some backstory;

I(M,30) have lost all motivation since this pandemic began. At the early stages of the virus, when there was only 19 confirmed cases in my country, I was identified as a close contact of 6 confirmed cases. 

Somehow I didn't get the virus but during my two weeks of self isolation I managed to realise that life is too short to be unhappy. Since then I've started a new job, I'm 3 months in and can't find motivation anywhere. It's a relatively high pressure job with responsibility but I can't help but procrastinate and wait until the day is over. It's important to note than I'm now working from home in a new City and it's completely new to me. My previous positions were much more hands on.

This lack of motivation and satisfaction is seeping into every aspect of my life and generally bringing me down to the point where I'm unhappy and can't really enjoy anything. I feel like a loser and failure for staring a good opportunity in the face but not being mentally able to grasp it because I'm in a mental fog all the time.

Does anybody else feel this way? Does anybody have any advice?

Thanks for listening and apologies for the rant"
1582,I need to remind myself that I deserve love,"I hate that I need to remind myself that I deserved to be loved. I will start to fabricate things that are wrong with me to justify my feelings that no one could ever really want to be with me in a relationship. My mind tells me that I'm just a place holder until someone better comes along and that my girlfriend, even though she tells me daily that she is in love with me and wants to marry me, is just settling with me because who could possibly want to be with me? It's exhausting sometimes and I know that I haven't been to therapy in a while due to scheduling conflicts. Most days I don't think this way, but when I do it just brings me into a black hole where I over analyze everything about me and I just brutally critique myself. Worst part is that when I do feel this way and I need reassurance I get nervous asking for it because in my head I think that she is annoyed by me for needing it even when again I know it's not true. I hyper focus on the bad, but I never hyper focus on the good."
1583,I need some comforting because I'm scared.,"I found out I most likely will get one of my wisdom teeth pulled. I'm super scared of dentists because I had experience where I had a tooth pulled while awake as a kid. I learned to overcome that fear for fillings and stuff but never wisdom teeth.

1585,Covid impairing my work ethic,"I consider myself a hard working college student. Always going the extra mile and doing as much as I can despite my issues with anxiety and “perfectionism”. However, with covid coming along my work ethic has plummeted. I’m supposed to be writing a white paper for my undergrad research along with taking the GRE and many other requirements to get into grad school. But with everything going on, covid, parents losing jobs, social justice issues, economy, possibility of many schools not accepting new students.....I feel like there’s no point anymore. I know there IS a point...but I’m having a hard time “putting things in to drive” so to speak. It’s like the wind has been taken out of my sails and it’s a battle everyday just to get a couple hundred words written if any at all. I have never in my life felt so unmotivated. Of course, this has taken a massive toll on my mental well being and I am not sure what to do anymore to better my situation. I have started to work out more and try to do things to boost my mental health and relieve stress. This is mostly a vent, but can anyone else relate? Has covid effected you in this way? Have you been in similar positions in your life? What has brought you out of it? 

Thanks

1586,My mom’s affected my mental health in a way..,"Recently I made this list about how my mom makes me feel... it’s really shocking everything I’ve put together because it shows how scared I am of her and how my behaviors have changed since maybe my first year in middle school.. 

This is what I came up with:

- anxiety 
- feeling the need to cry 
- irritated/frustrated/angered 
- immediate change of emotion 
- don’t know how to appear with my facial expressions (try to look normal, but I look sad or disgusted or pissed off)
- scared to ask for some things or hang out with friends, etc 
- scared of her getting mad at me 
- defensive/get attitude when she’s around me sometimes
- i don’t like her around me 
- i don’t like her touching me 
- protective over my phone/fear she’ll check it 
- getting easily startled sometimes even when I’m not doing anything wrong 
- occasional nightmares that cause me to wake up with extremely bad anxiety 
- headaches/chest pain 
- i don’t feel safe when my sister’s gone, more afraid of her
- i’ve developed a low tolerance level when it comes to her 
- i don’t trust her with my issues or my problems 
- i feel safe when i’m away from her 
- i don’t like going places alone with her (shopping, being picked up from school, etc)
- i don’t want a relationship with her in the future

I can’t explain every instance that has brought all this up, but I know my mom gives me some bad anxiety and has made me feel terrible shit. She has for a while.. she’s gotten mad at me for dumb things before, she’s denied my anxiety before, and other things I can’t recall. I wish I didn’t feel like this around my own parent, I wish I didn’t lowkey hate her but I don’t see my feelings changing. Not after everything."
1587,"Therapy isn't helping, and I'm a wreck. Not sure where to turn for help.","I am an extremely emotional person. I cry if I hear anything sad, and since I'm highly sensitive, it means I respond much more strongly to my emotions than most people. I also struggle with depression and negative thoughts about myself.

I turned to therapy about half a year ago, and I don't feel like it's really helpful. We just talk about my problems, but my therapist hardly ever remembers things I tell her so I have to remind her every meeting. Plus, I just don't find her advice very helpful. She tells me to practice positive thinking. I try, but it's hard. She also is a good advice giver when something is going on so that is helpful.

However, I just feel crazy with my emotions, and I don't feel like all this talking and mental positivity is working for me.

What do I do? I'm hesitant to have to relive my story with someone else and then only be given the same advice. Just don't think negatively. Be positive. Yeah, okay, but it's really hard. Especially when it's hard to shut out things. I read a sad news article and I'm crying. It's very hard to calm down from crying to hey, it's okay that this tragic thing happened. That's life. 

Does anyone have any advice or have a similar story to mine? What did you find helped you? I'm so tired of crying and having to try to shield myself from everything."

And if not, what illness that might be?","I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom has severe OCD though.

For the past 2 years, I feel like like some  people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way, haha. Practicing my religious beliefs? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 
I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost. And very recently I smelled a hideous smell twice in two different places. The first time was in my grandma’s house two weeks ago, I’ve smelled it the whole night for no reason. And the second time was two days ago in my house, again for no reason and it was the exact same smell.

Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird or embarrassed around actual people. Only people my brain imagines."
1593,I'm suffering and I really need help because I see no way out.,"Hey,

I may say some offensive stuff in this, so if you get offended easily please feel free to hop right out the door and look at other posts that are not offensive. This is just because this post is going to be fully honest, so whatever I say here is going to come right out my brain unfiltered. I'm not going to tweak or edit anything to make it sound worse than it is, I'm not trying to put on a face here is what I'm saying.

I'll start off by saying that I've never been suicidal and that I have no intentions to harm myself. If you want, you could skip through this post since nothing is urgent, but I still am suffering. I can't say how much I am suffering, but to me it is ruining my daily experience in life. All responses are greatly appreciated.

The first thing that I think when I wake up in the morning is death. Throughout the day, I am always thinking about death. I can never really enjoy an experience truly because I always relate it back to death. I used to be on the path to nihilism because I used to have a death anxiety where I would have sometimes two anxiety attacks a day for about a week on and off throughout the year. I have become depressed in the past for a month or two because of this. I just didn't see any meaning in life, but I was still fearful of death. It becomes a situation where I thought that life would have meaning if I found the meaning. Although, that was the problem. I couldn't and possibly wouldn't find any meaning for my whole entire life. This was about a year ago and I suppose things have gotten better and worse at the same time.

I left Christianity, not being able to live with myself in that religion because there was no proof. From there on out, I still had some reoccurring anxiety but I usually just tried to ignore it. A month ago, I was exploring into some other religions and the one that appealed to me was Buddhism. Several things ended with my experience with Buddhism, and the same amount of things started. I honestly think that I could've stuck with Buddhism, but I gave into many things and was out of it as if it was a diet.

Before that small spiritual boost, I was in a really weird state. At this time, all I could think about was death and similar to now I kept on relating all experiencing of death from anything. This was bad for me because whenever I came to that realization, I felt a large flood of anxiety, barely able to hold it in. The whole Buddhism thing could've just been amplified since I was under a lot of emotion at the time. I was able to get out of that hole though for some time.

Back to the timeline, one day I just felt a small drop of anxiety. I don't know how to explain it, but the old ways were coming back and they were coming back worse. For a few weeks, I was in this cycle of just fear. I could barely eat any food because I always felt nauseated and uneasy. No food seemed appealing to me because I convinced myself that any food could make me more unhealthy. I was constantly paranoid about my health and also anxious about death. I had the exact same things before but more than that. I stayed up till five AM just worrying all the time. It felt terrible, I was extremely tired, but I didn't want to go to sleep.

Someone told me that I had to just eat more food and drink lots of water. I did that and it did help a lot. For what was probably a week, I was living without any fear or anxiety. I was eating healthy, not out of fear, and exercising, once again not out of fear. I was working on my sleep schedule and was developing a routine. This felt absolutely amazing. I was just living life without any worry at all. Of course, all good things come to an end, so this amazing experience ended once I began to feel like I was wasting my time. It truly was a great experience for me that I wish I could be like that today.

Now we're here now and a little bit after then. Things aren't as bad, but more things have appeared to me. I still feel uneasy throughout the day if I am not involving all of my mental energy into something. I'm relating every single experience back to death and that makes me feel anxious and sometimes nauseous. Now I'm imagining other people dying. It really seems unnerving to me to be able to imagine my friends and family dying and realizing that their whole life is over along with all of their memories. Then, it comes back to me and I feel anxiety.

I used to think of life in a healthy way but now I don't. It's difficult for me to feel like I'm living again. I want to get a counselor (and I've tried), but there's no way I'm going to be able to tell my Christian parents about this stuff, plus they always keep on forgetting to even make appointments like this.

Now here's the offensive part. Some might say ""EXTREMELY offensive"", but there's no point in labeling something as offensive since that won't help anyone. Please don't make any judgements that bring in things I never said. I wish I was depressed sometimes instead of anxious. When I felt like that, I didn't give a fuck about death. To be clear, people with depression aren't happy with death, I never said that they are. I was going through shit then... sure, but I still wish that I could be like that instead of this.

I still exercise and eat decently healthy, but it is this constant uneasiness, worry, and anxiety that is killing me. Right now, I am distracting myself with this and it feels nice but when I post this post I don't know what I'm going to even do because everything else I do just feels like a waste of time.

Like I said, all responses are greatly appreciated and all of them are useful. Don't take anything in this seriously if you are feeling offended. I'm not here to have a debate, I am here to get help."

1604,Need advise,"A little background first of all. I am currently 16M and I grew up in a very catholic household. We were forced to go to church every Sunday, went to study groups, I've gone to a catholic school my entire life, etc. Very catholic family. Recently, (past year or so) I've been having super bad depressive thoughts. When I went through a breakup that came out of no where and I found out some things, the only reason I didn't end up in the hospital with cuts on my wrist was because I had hidden my knife from myself(still don't know where it is) and someone was texting me the entire night. My sister is suicidal and my family knows this. She recently tried to od on Herione(she's OK we caught her before she got it) and she's bi polar. My sisters ex fiancee apparently has been abusing her for the past couple years they had been together. He was narcissistic apparently and lied constantly to her. I genuinely liked the dude and thought he was my friend. Now I found out he's a douche bag and now they are broken up and the wedding canceled. Sorry for the venting but here's where I need help. My sister and I were recently talking(the one with the ex fiancee) and she said I may grow up narcisstic because of my home life. (there is a ton of other shit that would make this an essay but that was mostly the big stuff affecting me the most) I'm 90% sure I suffer from depression or at least some form of mental illness as I have Ben having suicidal thoughts and don't enjoy literally anything nowadays. I spend most of my days asleep and trying to interact with people online. But I just don't enjoy anything and am stressed all the time now. I was talking with my mom and she said if I ever felt like I needed therapy for what's going on with our family then to tell her. However I know for a fact we don't have the money to pay for therapy right now. We are paying for hospital bills and a bunch of other stuff. I know therapy is relatively cheap but we can't even afford that(my sisters confirmed we were tight on money) I want to get therapy and talk to someone and be happy for once but my dad doesn't believe in therapy. I tried talking to a  ""friend"" but he told me depression isn't real and I just need to try harder to be happy. My dad is the same way mostly and the only time he has ever asked if I needed therapy was when I said I don't wanna have children when I'm older(he's super catholic) I don't wanna worry my mother by telling her I'm depressed like my sisters and telling her she has anotber suicidal child to worry about but I just want help. Everyone I know is leaving me. Someone I used to know blocked me on everything recently and no one will answer me. I either want to die or get help somewhere but I don't know where. I don't wanna worry my sisters and mother, and my dad doesn't help with his beliefs and always shoving things down my throat. I wanna die but I think my anxiety of where I will go after I die is the only thing keeping me alive. Only thing my upbringing was good for. I can explain more about shit that's going on in  comments but I'm shaking rn. Help me. I don't know what to do.

1605,I feel chronically empty,"There was a time in my life when I used to feel really depressed, unhappy, lacking propose, motivation, suicidal. I blamed all of that on my really ambitious and goal oriented nature in a combination with low self esteem and general apathy. I thought that once I experience success in the areas I want, all problems would be solved.

I got an amazing, lucrative dream job few months ago and I'm good at it.  It's creative, individualistic, I can work with art and artists and all sorts of different information, people. It's just really exciting. And I felt really excited about it and all grateful for the opportunity. But what really got me wondering about myself was... 

For the first time in my life, I put myself out-there creatively, in a different project. Project that was just my pure expression of emotions and artistic abilities. And I got a great review from professional critics and money to develop my abilities and my work. 

At first, I felt so happy to the point the that I shook. But it lasted just for a few minutes. I really believed that getting professionally recognized would help me, well...with me. But it didn't. I've always felt this HUGE scary big black cloud of emptiness hanging just above me, and I thought that success would  make it go away. 

When I was a teen, I felt the emptiness just within and it was sad, depressive, but familiar and sort of warm. Now, when I'm an adult, the emptiness has overgrown me and it's everywhere in the universe. The very core of existing feels empty now and it's not sad anymore, it's scary, terrifying.  Years ago, I used to have panic attacks from it but I've learnt to manage that. Now it just overgrows me and it feels almost claustrophobic. 

I thought that finding meaning in my work would make it go away, because that's what I've always wanted. I have life outside work too, I have an amazing boyfriend of 4 years, we live together, we have a dog together, I have friends, family that like me a support me. I have literally everything one could ask for and yet, this feeling of emptiness is still killing me.

1608,Financial struggles are making me depressed,"
I’m 17 and I currently live with my mom. I’m still in school so I dont really earn any money, sometimes i work part time though. We’ve been always struggling financially, we even ended up moving to a different country to make it better but its still so difficult. My mom doesnt earn much and now that were moving to a different city, we will have to spend much more money on electricity/rent etc. Ever since I can remember Ive been my moms support and I love her but all the things we have to deal with make me so stressed. I feel like I have to deal with a lot of stuff because she doesnt know how to do it. Sometimes shes also being so naive and reckless with money, always buying expensive food, wanting to go on trips etc. I always felt as if I was the actual adult in the family and Im so tired. For example recently we got into an accident and she refused to talk to the policemen or to anyone at all, which I can understand, since she was in shock but in the end I had to deal with everything- with the police, the other person, who was in the accident, with the insurance company. All my friends and my boyfriend come from rather rich families and I feel like they cant relate to anything Im going through right now. I just want things to be finally better. I always wanted to study but now I think Ill have to go to work to help my mom out. I dont know how to deal with all that. I wanted to go to a therapist but... obviously I dont have money for that.

1609,Any else tried TMS treatment for medication-resistant depression? Coping strategies to withstand treatment?,"I just started [Transcranial magnetic stimulation](https://mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/about/pac-20384625) treatment a week ago based on my psychiatrist's recommendation for my medication-resistant depression. While I'm diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 and GAD, it's been the debilitating depression that has led to my inability to function in almost all realms of my life.    
    
    
My feelings are mixed. It's a big commitment (5 x week- 20 minute sessions for 6 weeks) and it will hurt me financially ($30/co-pays for each session). I'm grateful I have health insurance, because it would be $12,000 without it. I've done a ridiculous amount of research, and studies show it's effective in reducing symptoms of depression for ~70% of individuals. Some  studies showed patients were successfully able to stop taking their meds!   It's also less invasive than side effects of anti-depressants and of course, ECT (which scares the shit outta me!), but I'm struggling to get through sessions. The sessions are not horrible, but it's definitely unpleasant. It feels like a woodpecker is pecking at my brain and there's a slight localized squashing pressure and sometimes it feels like the top of my skull and roof of my mouth is vibrating. However, it's tolerable for now if it means relief from my depression.    
    
  
     
     
So far, I've been getting through the sessions by watching relaxing music with peaceful imagery YouTube videos, while doing deep breathing exercises. I'm at the full dose now and I haven't had any side-effects besides a headache on the 1st day. I have been feeling better- but I think it's tied to the new feeling of hope that this will make a difference. I'm also proud of myself that I actually made my daily appointments (albeit I had to reschedule for latest appointment time and showed up late 1x). That's a HUGE deal for me considering I was barely leaving my home 1xweek (to see my therapist) and that was before the pandemic.

2. Was it effective? If so, for how long?       
3. Was it worth it financially?    
4. What techniques did you use to withstand the treatments and does it get better?    
5. Would you recommend it for treatment-resistant depression?"
1610,Sharp decline.,"I keep starting and discarding this post. Life is unbearable. I've been severely depressed for literally as long as I can remember and suicidal/self harm feelings and actions since I was 9. Severe mental illness runs in my family and I was badly physically, verbally, and emotionally abused my entire childhood (up until my mid teens when I managed to get out with the help of different family, who weren't exactly supportive or helpful but at least weren't outright abusive) and have a long history of self harm, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalization, and have many multiple times confirmed diagnoses of depression (severe, recurrent, treatment resistant, yadda yadda) and PTSD. I don't have any friends or supportive family, people only ""care"" when I express suicidal feelings but all other times it's just ""you're just lazy and make excuses, mental illness isn't real it's just an excuse, you just need to work harder"" and ""oh well, i dunno what to tell you, just figure it out haha""... I dropped out of college because I couldn't handle it, I can barely keep a job because of depression and stress and PTSD (always end up having severe panic attacks around people), I get turned away from jobs at fucking grocery stores let alone anything better, I'm grossly poor and can barely afford my very measly rent and huge student loan payments every month so I obviously don't have health insurance and can't afford any sort of treatment, I'm really just exhausted. I feel like I've never gotten any real help and have never seen any real recovery. I have brief periods where I can kinda just numb myself enough to keep rotting and withering away and crying myself to sleep every night with all my struggles but all other times I'm hysterically suicidal and miserable and lost and terrified and in pain. I've been deeply unstable and miserable for the entirety of my 23 years of life and I truly see no way out and don't know what having a will to live feels like. The only reason I don't attempt suicide more is the fear that I'll fail because I can't afford to be hospitalized again. No amount of positivity or ""motivational"" content can take my mind off of how badly I want to exit this horrible miserable painful existence. There is no hope of getting better, I've been desperately struggling to do so for over a decade and nothing has budged, my only desire is to get out."
1611,How to tell if the voices in your head should be there?,"I have ""another voice"" in my head that I can't control. It doesn't quite sound like my voice, but not drastically different either. Most of the time it just says random words and phrases and sentences that have no real meaning to anything else at the time. Other times it is like a commentary to what I am doing. This is the most common voice. I also hear the voices of people I know, and they're always criticising me. They usually do so when I'm cleaning, doing the laundry, or the dishes, but at other times too. 

I always thought this was normal, because I thought that's just what thoughts are (sorry for word repetition). Like how people will say ""oh, a thought just popped into my head!"". But thinking about it, I don't think they are really thoughts. And they definitely don't feel like they're coming from me (the first voice mentioned moreso, the others I actually argue with). 

I think this has been going on for as long as I can remember, otherwise I would've been aware of it before I suppose?

They don't really bother me, but I wanted to know if they're supposed to be there"
1612,"Lonely, anxious, and tired of it","I just need to vent cause I’m at the point where I’m tired of keeping this to myself. Feel free to scroll past this because this is long. 

This pandemic has made me realize how lonely I am. Since starting university, I have slowly lost all of my high school friends and haven’t been able to make any new friends. I started feeling extremely anxious in social situations and have been consumed by thoughts that everyone hates me or that I’m always doing something wrong. I just feel so anxious and guilty all the time. My life was pretty much wake up, go to school, come home, go to sleep, and repeat. 

I managed to get a retail job and it was the best thing to ever happen to me. My coworkers were great, the customers were great, and I really enjoyed getting to meet and talk to new people every day. I was also doing some volunteer work so my life was really busy and for the first time in a while I wasn’t feeling as lonely and useless. 

However now that the pandemic happened I feel like I’m spiraling. I had to quit my job/volunteer work and all my classes went online, which means I’m no longer able to work on socializing. I saw a counselor to cope with this and the only thing she did was give me the crisis number and recommended doing meditation to relieve anxiety. None of it has worked. 

So now I just sit at home and spend my days worrying about every little thing. There’s only one person outside of my family who calls/texts me semi-regularly and all she ever does is ask me for help with school/to rant about boys that she likes. I know I’m being used, I hate that I’m being used, but at the same time it’s the only time someone ever talks to me without me having to message them first. 

I’m just so tired of feeling this way and I feel like I’m slowly breaking down. I can’t see a therapist because I can’t afford it. I don’t know how to cope with this anymore."

(my moms a terrible individual so I wasn't bothered by that. But my little sister was and is unfit to be in mine and my kids life because she has a past of mental illness and being institutionalized) last year we separated because we were both being toxic.. hes a narcissist, manipulative and mentally abusive individual.. i ended up finding affection elsewhere and it ended up being entirely my fault.. (what I did was WRONG. and i feel guilt everyday.. but he was wrong too and will never own his) and we both started seeing other people.. he has both of our kids. 3 and 4 years old. He has the money and the resources and nothing I have available is suitable for them.. i see them once a week for an hour. And i call them nightly for about 10 minutes. Sometimes more if im lucky.. the guy im seeing turned out to have an alcohol problem and physically beat me twice.. and i DID leave.. he admitted that he had a problem and begged me to help him seek out help professionally. He hasn't touched or mentioned alcohol.. and i personally am starting to see genuine progress. He has followed through with therapy and AA classes. I believe people CAN change with the right resources. My ex husband does not. He believes people will always be what they are. Which has caused an even greater complication with me even taking the girls on a car ride to get ice cream. I can never be alone with my kids.. and he expects me to leave him just so I can see them. Any and every place I have suggested has been a no go because a ""male lives there"".. i work for grubhub as in independent contractor which makes it difficult for me to find a place to rent.. and i definitely can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court.. im a door mat and I dont have the strength to pull the babies back and forth when I know i can barely even make things work for myself.. im broken.. guilt ridden.. and have aggressive suicidal thoughts that I KNOW i could never carry through with because I refuse to give up.. i have no family.. no way to take out loans.. im literally stuck.. and i no longer have the will to convince myself that I even have a reason to get up and work because the girls have him.. and his gf.. his gf adores them.. she buys for them.. does crafts with them and helps teach them.. i feel so hurt and im honestly starting to blame this on only myself.. i want to give up.. but i cant..

1625,What's with the obsession over religion from family members who are not dealing with bad mental health?,"
I’m soooo sick of this family. My fucking god. Today I had to take one of the big exams we have for school and I was already feeling depressed as hell when I was going to do it. My mother decided it would be a good idea to get her sister, which I generally like more than my mother but dear lord she is annoying. We somehow got to a conversation about her son which is my age and also takes exams and she shit talks him because he decided to not continue with his very good school because it was extremely stressful which honestly I support my cousin on this, his last school is one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult school in this country. I said that a lot of teens are depressed because of stress from school then she has the fucking audacity to tell me “it’s those who do not believe in god who are stressed and depressed and suicidal” or something along the lines. And she said it with such a bitchy tone, just like how my mother loves talking when she completely ignores every thing she had done to purposely make me depressed over the years. That made me lose all the last bits of faith I had in my religion, which I used to love a lot up until a few months ago by the way, and would never dare to speak badly of. I’ve had depression and a bunch of other stupid shit going on in my head since the moment I came out the womb, and not a single time in those terrible 17 years of existence I got any sort of help from this shit show of a family. Dealing with shame, guilt, traumatic life events and so on is already difficult enough on its own without having a dumbass family. I want to kill myself soon, but in my religion people who commit suicide are buried outside of the cemetery to show them disrespect since suicide is forbidden. I’m seriously thinking of getting someone to kill me just that I’d be shown the tiniest bit of respect at least after I’m dead. 
Oh and I bet those fucking idiots will be crying their asses off, and for what? This is your fault. Years of ignoring obvious signs, even me telling them directly. What the hell did they think? That I’m gonna stay like that forever? Without proper care or even someone that validated how I feel? Get lost. What a bunch of idiots. I have come to hate every single person in this family. Such an ignorant point of view on things they have not even experienced in their lives. I really hate them. I have come to hate my own origins that I used to be so proud of. 

Sorry for this ugly vent I just needed to let it out"
1626,Is it unhealthy that my car is like my safe space?,"I’ve recently realized after I was diagnosed with PTSD that my car is like my safe space for me. When I take a smoke break at work, I sit in my car. When my dad gets under my skin, I either simply sit in my car and listen to my podcasts or go for a short drive. If I start to feel panicky while at a friends house or even while home I like to sit in my car and do a Headspace session.

The only downside for me is my car gets messy quickly and I often have to clean it out. Empty water bottles and snack wrappers, nothing gross. Does anyone else do anything similar? Is this unhealthy?"

My grandfather’s death now carries more weight, and I feel like I failed him because I never got to say goodbye. The words I don’t want to go ring throughout my brain constantly.

1631,Psychosis ?,"I’m not looking for a diagnosis just some form of help. I’m try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. Last September I started taking psychedelics heavily, had revelations I can’t put into words and everything in my life just all pieced together and made sense. Then on one of my trips I got introduced to “the conspiracy” and it all went downhill from there. I really can’t describe it but basically there was this room of people and I had to think my way into the room to get in, but I kinda just gave up and couldn’t do it. Anyway I kept trying to do it on weed and smoked a LOT of weed. Weed + LSD weed + shrooms and weed alone. Still couldn’t do it. It’s something Devine but I can’t put my finger on it. I became obsessed with figuring it out but I never got anywhere it was always on my mind. It just made too much sense to be real and after about 4 months I just dropped it. And I stopped doing drugs. Now around a month ago it started coming back up after being clean for months. For example I run a small business and I got a call about some service this company is providing and they said they were going to put together a slideshow about their service. And my brain convinced me they’re gonna show me the conspiracy because I couldn’t get it the first time. Anyway this window opens up for like half a second and I get a glimpse of the conspiracy and it all makes sense then it’s gone and I can’t even think about the complexity of it anymore. Basically it’s infinitely complex and impossible to understand. I just feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t want to hurt myself or anyone else. Should I check myself in? I just don’t know what to do. I’m lost and honestly kind of scared."

1633,Want to Cancel Testing Appointment I just made..," I've been through the works. I have been sexually abused, emotionally abused, bullied, I have mental health issues in my family history.. I have been diagnosed with depression which I ignored because it was just a quick diagnosis I got from mandated counseling after a suicide attempt at 14. My sister is actually a counselor and I guess has been talking to her professors and clinicians at work about me on a pretty regular basis. 

  They all agree I need to see someone about possibly being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I have pretty bad mood swings, really bad anger issues, an all or nothing attitude, I have low self esteem but also have a god complex, horrible nightmares, issues sep. reality and fantasy, depression, anxiety, paranoia. 

  Basically I meet every symptom to some degree. I emotionally abuse my boyfriend and I don't want to lose him, or relationships with my family so I know I HAVE to go get help - but I still want to cancel the appointment. 

  I am just not wanting to talk to someone. I feel like if I go to the appointment and I give my list of symptoms etc. they're just going to say it's depression or anxiety and I'm going to waste my time. Or I will be diagnosed but I won't end up going back to fix it."

1635,scared my mental health is destroying my relationship,"Title is self explanatory. I have a tendency to close myself off from people or get incredibly defensive when I'm upset or anxious, and if people push my boundaries I lash out at them and then immediately feel guilty. I've gotten better at learning when I need to just be alone but I'm so scared that my boyfriend is going to resent me for this. He struggles with depression too and I've been told by close friends that I tend to ""drag people down with me"" so I am very afraid of making things worse for him. He says he supports me and I believe him and I'm grateful for it but every time I get in a ""mood"" I feel like anything I say will ruin things. He uses reddit a lot so maybe a part of me is hoping he'll see this and it'll be some form of reassurance (he'd know it's me from my username 100%) but I don't really know what good that'll do. I just feel like I mess up everything. I've finally found something worth living for and I'm going to rip it to shreds."
1636,Finished my Intake for Drug and Alcohol...,"I went for Probation and tested hot for alcohol, then tested again at D&amp;A Services hot for alcohol, and all this time I was wondering how that could be since I DO NOT DRINK. I stopped on 9-11-16 and I haven't fallen off the wagon since then...

Then I remembered. I had to go to the ER because my anemia was acting up (I got really sick) and they gave me an albuterol inhaler to use because I have asthma, exacerbated by the anemia. Well, I looked on the little bottle and in teeny tiny print (yeah...my eyesight sucks bags of dicks lately lol), I noticed that it also contains ethanol. That is alcohol. I will call my primary doc tomorrow to confirm or deny the possibility that my inhaler (which I use several times a day) is causing the positive test. The amount was .23-something milligrams or however they measure it...it was REALLY low. I really am excited about going to the D&amp;A Program along with the Mental Health Partial Program because the more tools I have to stay away from alcohol, the BETTER. I start tomorrow after I go to Probation!!!

While I was in prison, I really really liked going to the AA meetings on Wednesday evenings, so this is just continuing what I had already started. So this is not a bitching post at all. I am excited to start this again because everyone needs help now and then, and even though it has been nearly 4 years sober, I still want to maintain the drive to NOT drink. I don't want it. I don't need it. I am alcohol free and damn proud of it.

I'm not sure how to start this. I'm upset a lot and when I'm not upset I'm numb. I feel like nothing I'm doing matters. Honestly I know it doesn't. I'm stuck at home and can't find work so I just waste all my time watching YouTube videos or movies which is about the only enjoyment I have.

I'd like to consider myself an ""artist"" but I've yet to find anything to stick with. I've painted, done minor photography, made some shitty music, made some shitty experimental noise stuff. The latest thing I've done was trying collage art and I'd like to do more but I can't bring myself to do it. Last week, I started a YouTube channel which I had been wanting to do since last year and I think that's where my interests lie now but I'm not sure how long that will last. I guess what I'm trying to say is I have a lot of hobbies but I don't stick to them in any meaningful way. The only ones I stick with are the ones that don't involve much effort which has a lot to do with buying things, like vinyl records, cassettes, or video games.

This brings me to another point that I desperately need advice on: why do I want something so bad and it can often stick around in my head for a long time but as soon as I get it, it doesn't satisfy me or if it does, only temporarily? Am I just ungrateful or what?

Anyway, I just want my life to have meaning. I want to feel good about myself and I want to create things that I'm proud of because I think that that might make me happy. If not, I just want to figure out how to be happy or satisfied and stop being so upset or numb to what goes on around me.

Tldr: I'm sad/numb in my current life and have trouble finding things to bring me joy. Things I think will make me happy only do so temporarily and I'm right back to wanting again. All I want is my life to have value to me and not feel like such a waste."

My GF once gets mad over the fact that I didnt want to workout one particular day because I just didnt feel like it. She starts this ""put down"" show where she just keeps going on and on saying ""Look at you, your tummy is so big"" ""Look at me, I have a good body, so many guys are after me just go check my Instagram DM request"" ""Has even a single girl approached you"". Very non contextual but very very insulting.

After half an hour or tirade she starts to cry saying ""oh my god why has god given me such a boyfriend"" shut the door and starts to cry.

Hearing her cry I go to her and say ""It's ok , just leave it. I'll come workout . I just dont feel like it today"". She suddenly starts to hit me and goes ""You came to the room to hit me right? of course you did"". I was shocked and for a second even I thought ""Wait did I?"" .

I leave the room . She shuts the door and I hear voices ""Hello 911, there has been domestic abuse. The address is xxxx"" . I am like what? I didnt even do anything. I kept calm and didnt enter her room thinking ""I'll handle the cops since I know I haven't laid my hands on her""

Fast forward one hour later, no cops show up. I ask her ""Didnt you call the cops?"" . She goes ""No , I didn't. I just wanted to grab your attention. I thought when you hear it, you would come running saying sorry baby please dont"".

I dont understand this sort of behavior. Looks like its time to get a move on. Is this some personality disorder?"

In session 2, therapist was saying something and said ""when you said .... in session one, I thought that was the f$cking stupidest thing I have heard anyone say"". The therapist apologized later and said they only wanted to emphasize that I was thinking wrong. 

The thing that bothered me important to me. It is not a small thing for me. I wonder if the therapist was trying ""tough love"". but now I feel whatever I am saying is being judged. Everything else is okay, but I am not sure if I should continue? Is there any such thing as a non-judgemental therapist? One of my problems that we identified during therapy was ""that I want everything to be 100% perfect"". Now if I leave my therapist for this, would I be fueling my 'problem behavior'?

1655,"I have 3 people in my head that talk to me, read/help pls","So, I suffer quite bad with my mental health and have been feeling like I'm not in control of myself, about 5 months ago I had my first intense experience with this. I picked up a cup and walked a few steps before I shook myself out of it, I stood confused and walked off in a daze. Since then I've been hearing a voice, not with my ears, it's in my head, but the voice is not my own ""inner voice"". Usually if I'm stressed or hear something hurtful, this voice will tell me the hurtful things are true and will reiterate it again and again. But sometimes there isn't a trigger and it still happens. There is another one which is my grandma - she was my safety from the problems at both my mums house and my fathers. She passed away when I was 8 and even a decade later it still hurts, but she comes to comfort me. Sometimes I feel like she hugs me when I ask her too even though I can't see her. And there is one more. This one is a girl I think, called Chloe. She's the most recent one. She has visited me in my dreams and told me her name is Chloe, and she is more like a good friend that I can have casual conversations with or speak about personal things with. I feel their presence even if they're not talking, sometimes they're quiet for days, rarely but occasionally they go mute &amp; I feel like they were never there. I feel like most of me goes when they go so I end up a little lost &amp; empty, because of this I think it's normal, also because I've experienced it for so long. 

Since it is in my head and not being heard from my ears, I don't believe it is worth mentioning to my therapist, psychiatrist or psychologist because I think they'd say I'm lying. To me, what I've said makes sense, but i worry they will misinterpret it still.

1658,PLEASE READ THIS. I NEED YOUR HELP,"Hello Reddit.
I am making this post because the situation is dire. Please listen to my situation and suggest a course of action.

On Lewis Capaldi 's Before you Go Official Video, many people had posted their sad stories and I felt particularly sympathetic for this one girl who sounded very down and I suggested if she ever wanted to talk I could lend an ear because she sounded so lonely in her comments.
So that's what she did and she reached out on Insta we started to talk a lot and became good friends too. She seemed a little down and so I asked if she wanted to share why she felt so bad.

Here is the story.
She was a medical student and studied in an university. Her elder sister was getting married and if you know the concept of dowry then you will know that the groom was good but the marriage was very difficult to plan due to dowry demands. On the night of the groom's bachelor party, she had taken a few glasses of wine and was partially drunk. In such a condition, the brother of the groom raped her along with 3 of his friends. She was traumatized but couldn't complaint as she knew that the groom was a good guy and she couldn't risk her sisters marriage. She kept quiet but her grades gradually fell. Also her story was leaked in her college and she was bullied so she had to drop out and take an independent course and went to another party of the country.
She used to help opodartho with depression herself. On the rise to the new town she found a guy chilling near the train door which was open and she thought he was gonna jump off and decided to stop him. He was not going to jump btw he was just smoking. Long story short she started to date this guy and actually felt comfy around him. She was native and the guy was clingy and demanded some writers things in their relationships. He had her tattoo his name on her waist in Urdu. He was aggressive during sex and also got very violent when drunk or angry and beat her at times. She got afraid and got an internship in a differed place.
Sadly she got sick and had to be hospitalized for 3 nights. On night 2 r sister had to go to work and there was no one to look after her and that guy came for the night as her sister still thought they were dating.
When she was in a semi sedated state, the guy tried to force himself into her and tried to rape her but she actually started to make some noise with the nurse bell and drove the guy away before anything could happen.
At this point she has lost faith in the works when after 2 years of staying single she stared to kinda see a guy who drove her to work in the morning. They went along pretty well for half an year and she started to feel better again. But...
She had a roome idol why was spiteful of her and was the ex girlfriend of her current boyfriend (she did not know this). Just to door her she kept in touch with the aggressive one and kid him about her.
Well one day he showed up and found her boyfriend and had a word with him. He showed him some of her intimate pictures and claimed she was cheating on him and had had sec with him recently. Well unfortunately the trick worked and what ensured was a messy breakup.

Today she is suicidal and is hanging on for her younger sisters sake. She plans to kill herself on xyz date. She has flashbacks and she is difficult when she remembers her past. She as of now is too afraid to even talk much. I tried my level best to convince her to live and have kinda managed to give her reason to live already fr now. She h herself doesn't want to live. She says every day is painful no matter how much u try tk distract her. But trust me, deep down she is a very sweet girl. I'm sorry for sharing her story which she prefers not to be shared but I need to know how can i even help her.

Any help will be appreciated. Will keep posted."

I'm just wondering if the best course of action is to find a professional through the NHS or do I pay someone that's working privately?

I asked him Saturday why does he do that, he told me cause he wants to see himself bleed. I asked why, he said because he wants to die.

1668,"On feeling like shit, and sending a message to that special someone","I have a very specific problem in that I often find myself 'waiting' until I feel good in order to message people that I'm interested in, most notably on dating apps. I understand that as a general principle it's good to try and work on your mental health 'prior' to putting yourself out there romantically, even though the process of putting yourself out there (at least in the physical world) can put your mood to a better place than it was before.

The issue is that it's so hard to keep yourself feeling 100% 100% of the time, especially right now with so much shit going down in the world. And on things like Tinder, there's often an optimal window of opportunity with things like messages - you've got to send the first message within the first day or so after matching; any time after that and you're decreasing your chances of a reply dramatically, and then the pressure builds to be entertaining and exciting for the other person. I get terrified of being more open and honest on these apps; it feels like there's a narrow range of acceptable emotions from which good messages emerge (from me). 

I think that right now, I've not got a good support structure around me. I feel very alone a lot of the time, because I'm practically living alone (read: with a flatmate who rarely comes out of his room), and I know as a fact that when I'm surrounded by wonderful people I'm generally a lot happier. Before lockdown I had it all figured out, or so I thought; now I'm working from my flat and it's quite painful. So I'm thinking of moving back in with my parents and family so that I have more company throughout the week.

I just wonder whether I need to be doing more to keep my mood above a certain level, and finding new ways to keep myself satisfied so that I feel more in a place to talk to the people I wanna talk to. In reality I just wanna see people again; I'm sick of all this 'text-game bullshit' where you can't have a proper conversation with people (in the real world, you don't wait 20 minutes in between 'messages', you just talk to them and they respond immediately). But I also wonder whether I just am setting the bar too high for how good I have to feel in order to message someone; whether I should just embrace the bad emotions and put myself out there anyway, because life will pass me by if I don't. It's just you're constantly bombarded with how important it is to 'not be boring' on these apps, but the reality is that finding interesting shit to say, especially when you've got a headache and are down in the dumps, is exhausting and not very worthwhile."

Basically, I’m going through a major self-hate phase. I feel like all of my friends are replacing and getting sick of me, and that I’m just bland and don’t shine as much as the other people, so it makes me feel really depressed, suicidal and not functional. 
Also, I can’t talk about it to my friends because it would just be me bugging them with my mental illnesses, and even if they never said something like that I’m scared they’ll get fed up and cut ties with me.
Idk, I feel like my friends will never love me as much as I do, and that the void of loneliness that has carved a hole in my chest will never be filled.

1674,I think I'm ready to give in,"First and foremost I'd like to apologize if my post is rather extensive or doesn't align well with others, this is the first time I've ever posted anything to reddit and arguably the last. 

I'm a 23 year old whose currently a tertiary level student at an private institution, I'm in the midst of online exams and I just think it's time to bid farewell... 

I have an history of inflicting harm onto myself and have overdosed previously. I know I probably sound like a entitled man child and I suppose that assertion is justified.  I promised myself I would be candid in this post but find it difficult to articulate myself in a befitting manner. 

Social integration has always been an insurmountable obstacle to overcome for me, I could never fully assimilate with others, a lot  of my peers have previously alluded to me possessing an low tolerance for others and I was convinced of that for some time. 

Trying to be intimate or openly express or disclose anything to anyone is similar to experiencing a stroke for me(I don't mean to trivialize any medical conditions) I quite literally impede myself and I've alienated a lot of friendships in this regard. I feel numb almost... I can't be emotional anymore or initiate conversation or a relationship. 

I know it's unhealthy to invalidate one's existence but mine has felt futile for almost a decade now. I could never truly overcome losing my pets or my home... And I've undoubtedly become a source of pity and ire for those around me. 

Objectively I don't know what I hope to gain from this post and I don't think I fully achieved what I had envisioned. I suppose subconsciously I'm still apprehensive to unpack... Much to my own irritation. I've genuinely given up on functioning normally. 

It's difficult to see how I objectively  add any value to anyone's life anymore."

1677,I’m starting to fear falling asleep,"Hi!
I don’t know if this is the appropriate group to ask this but I hope I will find support and resources to investigate the problem I’ve been having lately.

So the problem is I’ve recently am having real vivid nightmares and today I noticed that before going to bed I feel a bit anxious about falling asleep because I’m scared having nightmares. For example last night I had a nightmare that I was developing a mental illness(I could clasify it as paranoidal schizophrenia) in the nightmare I was starting to see a person who negatively effected my behaviour and it ended in me losing control over my actions and started to murder people I met in the dream/nightmare. I’ve woke up scared that is my reality, had my heart racing and overall scared. Such nightmare was the first time and have a different nightmares before but all of them usually have this main motive of me having altered mental state(usually drugs or alcohol, sometimes mental illness as mentioned above, sometimes just feeling of being under some kind of influence).

I don’t know if this makes any sense to you but I’m worried that I could develop insomnia because of the fear of falling asleep and having nightmares.

1678,"I know things will get better, but damn do they really suck right now.","It's mostly work-related stuff.

Turns out yeah, he's an asshole. I lost all ambition and interest in this job a year and a half ago but I'm contractually obligated to stay almost another 2 years. This new guy definitely doesn't help. He actually ridicules and belittles me in front of everyone, and has to micromanage everything to the point where he stops my presentation to say he doesn't like the font/ font size I choose for the power point.  

Look, if the worst thing this guy can tell me about my work ethic/ the work I produce is that the font is ugly. I guess I'm doing a good job, but that's not the point. I'm so sick of working here and the attitude of that guy has already flushed whatever silver lining I had of this place.

1683,I probably shouldn't be here but y'know I gotta say this,"Finssbnrst things first: i have a disassociation disorder, borderlccine personality disorder, general anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder 
My main two triggers are being called a l!ar and when someone says they can ""relate to"" what someone else is going through. Selfish, yes, but I can't help it.

So here's something I vented about earlier to a certain person on discord, word for word:

""I've noticed that very little things can push me over edge, and sometimes it'll be nothing at all. Sometimes a small sound, or a slight movement in the corner of my eye- a small piece of dust flying around, or something lightly touching my arm. Or perhaps loud unwanted music, being talked to too much, someone doing  something annoying... At times, even just nothingness. It give me a headache, almost like a migraine, and it swallows my entire head. My eyes will hurt, strain, have a yearning feeling in them- they'll want to dart around, restless, trying to see something to fix the problem. My nails- they scratch scratch scratch, scratch scratch scratch- used to be on my arms, but I noticed that didn't calm my feeling- I go for soft, lifeless objects now. My legs will shake, my feet with tap. This lustful feeling of anxiety and dread will raise in my chest, restricting my breathing- i'll nearly cry, wanting to snap oh so horribly! I wish to scream, to hit, to break- but I know better, so I don't let myself. It hurts, it really does, but there's some sort of thrill within it all.... During these moments, I always get pictures popping up in my head- people suffering,  mass groups getting attacked- bombs, shootings, arson, thefts- all organized and carried out by none other than me. It's the worst when I see glass.... I get... such dark yet beautiful imagery to flash in my mind.... as my fists tighten and secure myself where i am, trying to close my eyes......... i look at my fishtank- i imagine it broken, spilled, with the dresser it sits on being destroyed and toppled over...... I see my phone, and I imagine how much evidence could be easier shattered on such a device........... my display case with easily be seen burnt and smoking and charred.... car windows and building windows make me think of the bigger things- death, destruction, chaos. I always feel oh so inclined to act upon impulse, but i know i shouldnt, so i dont
ive only attacked glass once- i was fed up, and my fish tank's filter was making a light noise- it makes the noise often and it always gives me that feeling..... i couldnt listen to music at that time, so i had no way of blocking out the sound. So i attack it. I got pissed off- sweating, crying, scared even. I punched the tank. I hurt my hand, and I slightly cracked the glass. The crack is still there, too. I wish I didn't have to see it.
I can't say I hate the feeling, really, because.... I dunno, it sorta feels nice in a gross, twisted way..? No, I don't wanna hurt anyone- in those thoughts, I never see the details of anyone- they're silhouettes, so they dont count as human. I only see specific people when I'm mad at a specific person. I'll  target that person- imagining them, their family, their friends, their work/school, their home- all in a fit of agony and terror. It makes me almost feel better.
Honestly, I'm just scared. Do I want to hurt anyone?  No. Do I want to get in trouble? No.
Sadly, there have been times in the past where I was.... unnecessarily violent. I'd punch, kick, slap, hit, chase, scream at, and threaten my friends... [friend name] told me that I started punching everyone in her house once- I never even remembered that. She also told me once that she expected me to stab her. It got to the point where I wasn't trusted around slightly sharp object during school- i remember picking up a thumbtack once, and it genuinely ended up scaring a fair amount of people,  just me holding it- it was fun, i enjoyed the feeling.
I sometimes like people being scared of me... it's weird- being trusted and loved by some, because feared by others, and both from a few people. It's not boring, it's  genuinely entertaining!!
But I know it isn't right.... I shouldn't hurt people,  no matter who they are or what they do or say... Unless someone tries attacking me, of course. I have no intent on doing anything illegal. There's just.... that urge..... that strong, strong urge.......
Oh, sorry, I said a lot. I'll stop now.""

1691,Bros im stuck,i havent been duagnosed with any mental illness not yet at least but im rlly stuck everyday when i talk act even buttering fricking bread my sister hangs over me like a dark aura i just shrug it of everytime but it keeps eating away at me constantly.the frustration just seeps out and i keep snapping at my friends and family more and more and i dont know how to vent this anger. most people will say to do a hobbie but my passion is engineering a creating mechanisms and machines with purposes no matter how dumb but im never allowed to get parts or just make anything to begin with so pls how can i vent this cause i hate getting angry with my family pls
1692,Probably at my wit's end,"To be short, I'm not sure where I'm going mentally but it's not a good place. My mom has cancer, and is constantly throwing tantrums about the smallest inconveniences. It's impacting literally everything, my dad, me and the rest of my family. I was already depressed as it was and this isn't helping.

The alarm is no longer going off. I am safe, I am calm, everything is going to be alright, that is, until the pill wears off."
1694,"Mental health is deteriorating since quarantine and realized Ive always had body image issues ever since middle school and maybe its not so normal to feel like this 24/7. Im just a sad person in general, asides from that.","My insurance doesnt cover therapy and it still costs too much to maintain “affordable” ones. I also grew up in an household that never talks about mental health and therapy. Im convinced I have some sort of body dysmorphia. I am almost never comfortable in tight fitting clothes and Im always guilty for eating food that arent considered healthy, and I still do it anyway. I know its an irrational feeling especially when I can fit a size 4, but the self hate and criticism is hard to stop. Ive also started to realize in the past year or so why Im such an angry person. I was raised experiencing and witnessing displays of anger and violence between my parents and never learned how to properly communicate with them. They are good, genuine people that love me (as I love them), but I never became emotionally connected to my parents and I have a huge problem with intimacy (with them and in romantic relationships). My first response to most things that are stressful and frustrating is anger. I just graduated college and the fact that Im not confident in my next plans for PA school is making me depressed. My relationship at the moment is also stressing me out in major ways. I wish I could feel great and confident about myself and feel a sense of normalcy again - I miss seeing my friends and having a schedule to go by.

Edit: Also I have a terrible memory and cant recall a good portion of my childhood, highschool years, or college. Just bits and pieces, and just events that stick out majorly. Its easy when I have a photo or a conversation to remind me of other things but I wouldnt be able to recall the event otherwise. Is this normal?"
1695,Asking For Help,"I don't even know where to start right now, I just feel so weird and this is my first time asking for any sort of help. So background info, I'm 15 from the US, and I guess I grew up in rough conditions. My father was pretty tough and hard one me, and my mom was kind of like that too. I'm kind of a perfectionist and I have a pretty shitty self esteem and life. I'd always be told I wasn't good enough by others and myself, that what I did was never enough, that I'm worthless and useless, and it really gets to me. Now, I have these moments during stress and other stuff where I feel like I'm splitting into different people, like there are two people in my body fighting for control. This started maybe 3 years back. I can't get my head straight and made up of who I am, what I am, what I think and things like that. It feels like I'm out of control with myself, and my mind is rebelling against me. Now, I hear voices and things in my head that aren't really there. I started talking to the voice in my head and fighting with myself, and it's tearing me apart. I hate myself that I go through this. After all, I have so many things here for me in life. I have a bed, food, water, all that. Still, this happens especially after I argue with someone. I start ""splitting"" and my mind just starts thinking on it's own. It starts putting up a shield to say it's everyone else's fault and not mine, even though I Know it's my fault for getting angry and Strat acting impulsive for some reason. Then, there's the constant cycle of going through depressive swings to feeling really good. These typically last a few days to a week, but there's so much conflict inside of me wether to get help or not. I don't want to burden people by asking for help again. I don't want to drag people into my shit, but I also want to. It's so weird. I almost commit suicide again because I wanted to end the pain of this. Even in everyday life, suicide seems to be in the back of my mind, and some days I just want to submit to it. The pain of having these splits, these cycles, just existing. I want relief. What do I do to get help? My uncle, who's a doctor, says I can't have bipolar disorder because I'm a teen. I've never discussed the ""splitting."" I don't think I have BPD. My parents are somewhat against me seeing a therapist or psychiatrist to talk, and I don't want to cost them money because I can't take care of my own problems. But I think I need it, because it's starting to interfere with my relationships and social life, and my productivity in everyday life."
1696,My mom refuses to get help.,"Hi. So my mother is probably one of the most damaged people I have ever met in my life.. she’s had a tough life which was mostly self inflicted but not all. Every relationship she’s been in has been overly toxic and abusive, towards her and to us from being subjected to it. She also has an accident when I was 7 resulting in her losing a leg.. so the trauma from the accident, recovery, and dealing with being permanently disabled has done a wonder on her mental health. She also recently lost her mother, which was her closest and only friend, and hasn’t been able to properly deal with it. 

My mom drives trucks for a living so her life is already super isolating... she does nothing but sit in her own thoughts, she’s kind of a terror to be around... nothing makes her happy.. she hates the human race and has no interest in having friends or lovers. She detests everything. I could go on and on about it honestly.. this whole post is barely touching the surface. 


I recently suggested her trying online session therapy since she could do it from her truck and no worry about going out in public etc because she hates that to, but she’s said she’s tried talking to people before at it’s never worked and she has no interest. Truth is my mom really hasn’t tried tho, she can’t stand to be told wrong or feel like someone’s passing judgement or has different opinions with her so going to a therapist who will literally help you pick apart your life and view it is her worst nightmare. She thinks everyone’s out to get her... I’ve told her not every therapist is the same and you need to find the right person to speak with because they don’t all do things the same. 


My mom is past the point of repair on her own. SHE NEEDS to have someone help her navigate all the trauma she’s experienced with her life... she’s alone and hates everyone.. I don’t want her to die like this but she has no want to seek help, she almost doesn’t think she needs it. I’m afraid she might off herself one day, she’s already spoken of it. 


Tl;dr my moms mental health sucks and she won’t get help."
1697,Lonely and Hopeless,"I didn’t really know who to go to about this. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while now, and all the posts have made me feel less alone about my thoughts and feelings. I’m 20F and I recently just moved out of my parent’s house because it was an incredibly toxic environment (yelling, gaslighting, dismissing my mental health issues). I’ve wanted to move out ever since I started to realize that they were instilling so much anxiety in my head, thanks to 2 years of counselling. 

Now that I’m all moved out, I feel lonelier than ever. It never really struck me that I only had 4 friends, including my boyfriend. I smoke weed for my anxiety but recently I’ve been having extremely bad trips, suicidal thoughts, wondering why I should even bother to go on because everything is pointless anyways. The world is so grim, full of assholes, and corrupt people that the thought of me ridding myself from such a dark place sounded like a good idea. I believe that the relationships you make in your life is what makes life so great. But I have severe social anxiety and I just can’t seem to connect with anybody. I recently came back to work and I try so hard to strike up conversations with new people and it just ends up so awkwardly that I immediately regret even opening up my mouth. 

I seem to be damaging my relationship with my boyfriend too because I’m aware enough to know that I do project my insecurities on to my partner and it’s not fair on him. I’ve thought about breaking up with him because I know I’ve been toxic but at the same time I’m going to be losing another important person in my life.

Everything just seems so bleak and hopeless. I’ve been crying everyday for the past week because it feels like I don’t know who I am anymore. It feels like my personality is gone and I can’t connect with other people anymore.

What’s the point? What do I do?"

1702,To the Pharmacy Tech,"To the pharmacy tech who was just doing her job,

I'm sorry for breaking down in tears when you tried to teach me how to take my depression/anxiety medication correctly. I had a terrible few days and the irrational shame at having to be prescribed medication to fix my brain chemistry for the first time in my life was too real. You apologized and were concerned that you may have done something wrong but you were so kind and professional. I couldn't explain why I reacted the way I did but I gave you the thumbs up that I understood the dosage and ran off with this little bottle that's supposed to help me and yet, feels like a physical reminder of my failures as an adult. I drove home mid panic attack and hid in a dark closet until I could get my hysterical sobbing in check, embarrassed as hell.

I'm going to start my treatment today and maybe the next time I see you, I won't cry because I'm drowning in the depths of my own emotions and thoughts. Instead, I hope that I can smile, look you in the eyes and thank you for your help."
1703,Lockdown having a severe effect on my mental health,[removed]
1704,Should I seek help?,"I don’t know what to do. (Hopefully somebody can give me a piece of advice?)I have a very introverted personality I don’t like revealing my feelings especially when they’re toxic and ugly like feelings of insecurity, self hate or self worthlessness and anxiety. Whenever my bf’s and I’s friends want to hangout I get a huge wave anxiety and dread, but I can play online with friends just fine. They’re fun and all, but for me having people over is draining at least for me. My bf is the opposite and loves having his friends over, and I spiral in my own head during or after hangouts in my own head about thoughts of how everyone is better than me or how I’m annoying or my bf likes talking or looking at them rather than me because I’m so shitty or ugly etc. My bf says he’s always going to want to have people over and I said I’ll just deal with it and be apart of group. My bf is very loving and supportive and it sucks that I can’t just be built that way, to love having people over all the time and not feel drained or have negative feelings/thoughts. I wish I was brave enough to end it and not be a burden, but I’m a coward and I’d probably be causing more pain. It’s hard accepting the fact that I might need to talk to a therapist and on personal biases I don’t think it would work for me, but if anyone has had therapy for similar reasons I would love to hear if it worked for you, it would give me some courage or hope to talk to someone. I just feel ashamed to think that something’s wrong with me and others will know that and realize I’m just a black hole with nothing to offer."

1709,idk if i should call the mental health emergency services at my uni,"my uni offers a therapist free of charge for mental health services. and I had a therapist for a while but just recently he’s been on leave. Like he hasn’t been able to talk to me for four weeks and I really want to talk to him bc i usually do weekly sessions with him. 

some lady called me this morning telling my appointment was canceled for the fourth time and said that I could either refer to emergency services or wait until my therapist comes back. And I asked her what it means for something to be a “emergency quote and she was like if you just need to talk someone after hours they’ll be that person for you. But I feel kind of weird using an emergency hotline if it’s just for me to talk about my feelings. Like I feel like an emergency hotline would be like for suicide word something severe.

I just really want to talk to someone and I really have no one to talk to you when I feel alone a lot and I get a lot of anxiety from just overthinking everything. I don’t know if I should call the emergency hotline tonight in case I overthink too much."

Things like I’m not sure what I wanna do, I’m not sure why I feel certain ways, etc. I’ve started to reach a point where I’m not even sure “who I am”. In the sense of, I’m not sure what I’d define my personality as, I’m not sure what my goals and values are anymore, I’m not sure what I want to do in life. I don’t know what’s happening anymore, and every time I think about it I tend to freak out. Any time I have any sort of memory that triggers me emotionally (sad memories), I immediately disassociate and space out, often staring blankly just lost in thought till I remember that I’m doing sometime, which could be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. What should I do? Where should I start? And what could this be?"

Its not perfect, and I've been struggling a lot lately. Now that my kid is older he wants to know about my scars. How magically 2 bright pink lines (scars not fresh cuts) appeared on mom's arm during the span of a 2 week period? I tried to hide it, but its too hot for long sleeves forever...

What the hell am I supposed to say? I am neurotically concerned that if I tell the truth it will somehow influence him and steer him towards cutting as a coping skill as he gets older.

1717,"Trouble Sleeping, (I don't know if I'm breathing for a period of time shortly after dozing off)","Recently I've been having trouble sleeping, I often find it hard to relax and drift of to sleep but every time I do so I violently wake up in a state of gasping for air, I believe I'm breathing fine when I'm dozing, however I sudden wake up it feels like I haven't took a breath in a solid minute. 

As of from two days ago it has effected me more than usual I don't  know if it's stress due to what's happening in my life, (not related to COVID-19) but I often find myself aggressively waking up and sitting up, first time this happened I was very confused and I just shock it off like it was nothing, but now it's happening at least 3-5 times a night and I haven't gotten a good nights rest in god knows how long.

When this tends to happen I feel like my body just refuses to breath but I'm not sure if I'm breathing or not it's starting to scare me now, 

last time it happened I scared the shit out my dog when I rose up from the same type of incident but the sound I made... it terrified me the most, it's as if I've been underwater for a solid 3 mins without a breathing tank... 

I haven't talked to my dad about this but my relationship isn't so good rn, considering how much shit has gone down I'm not sure how I should explain this to him nor do I know if he's understand, knowing him he'll prob just tell me to shake it off.

Please if anyone understands where I'm coming from, I would very much like to hear your opinion."
1718,I can’t stop hyper-focusing.,"  

When something negative happens, I am unable to stop hyper-focusing on the issue until I can resolve it. It is starting to impede my life and has caused me to fall behind in schoolwork and has led me to question friendships or be disgusted by them. I feel so overwhelmed because for the most part I am a happy person but the last month I have been experiencing intense mood swings. 

I experienced emotional and some physical abuse growing up from a narcissistic mother. I also experienced emotional abuse and gaslighting in a previous relationship with an ex. Both were/are compulsive liars. Recently I moved out of the country and since going no-contact with my family, I am the happiest I have been. I really have tried to focus on building a close community of friends who are positive and it has really helped my mental health. My current boyfriend, who has been supportive and patient with my trust issues lied to be about something small about a friend( context-wise it had nothing to do with our relationship, I was upset because when I asked him about the situation he directly lied to me). I am disgusted by him because of the lie. This is the first small lie I’ve caught him, but when we first started speaking he had lied about his body count (by a fuck ton ayee). This was something I eventually got over because we did talk it out and he explained to me that he was in a poor mental place in his life and I am not exaggerating when I say that he goes out of his way for me to be happy. 

I feel guilty that I am so angry and revolted by him for a white lie. I also feel angry enough to still want to leave the relationship. This isn’t the first time I have reacted in this way, I felt like I had a few new friends try to manipulate and use me and I ended up just cutting off the relationship, granted I don’t feel completely bad or off base regarding one. But I do know this isn’t a normal response. I need help letting things go so I can focus and keep my life on track."
1719,A feeling that I AM my mental Illness,"Sometimes I feel like i don't have bipolar, I AM bipolar. Often times I feel like I let it wreck havok on my life. My paranoia causes my to act aloof and mean  to people around me. I always have this low level paranoia, where although I love my friends, there's this feeling of ""everyone is out to get you"" and level of paranoia. Sometimes I'll catch myself being a little rude/aggressive for no reason, to strangers as well. No matter what I try, what medicine I take, the paranoia is always there.
I have an aunt that has paranoid schizophrenia, and I saw what she become. She one hurt my grandmother after not taking her meds and an episode of paranoia. I always feel rather on edge with her she's always borderline hostile with everyone. Sometimes I recognize myself in her. I'm so afraid that one day, I'll be so angry and paranoid that I won't have anyone left to love me. And I wouldn't blame them or get mad. No matter how much I need friends, their health comes first.
I hope someday this parsnoia will go away. Until then, I always ask my little brother form a scale of 1-10 how much of a dick I'm acting, because I can't tell if I'm being mean anymore. I feel like instead of saying I have bipolar, I am bipolar. And my mental health had wrecked havok on my life. I don't want to push a victim mentality, but I really can't control it. I'm angry that it seems like an unmovable rock that I will never, ever push over. I'm scared for myself. I'm scared to go to college because I'm afraid I might be aggressive or irritated to people around me. I won't be able to have group projects, or be in a work like setting or anything.

I'm so scared for myself and my future. That's why I have low esteem and I'm constantly over apologizing because I feel like I'm a burden to others. I feel as life I'm a ticking time bomb. That's why I don't even consider going to college, because what's the point of I'm not going to live that long anyway. I don't have to plan for retirement, since my death age will probably be less than 50.
I just feels s if it's a death sentence for me. I'm either feeling drugged and my mind is empty, of manic and severely angry at everything. I just want to have a ""normal"" mind for just a few minutes. Some type of normalcy. 
I'm moving in with a couple of friends in about 2 months and I'm afraid to love it because what if I showed that aggression to my friends? After about maybe month of living together, my other side will show and they'll keep me at arm's length.

I just really wish there was a quick solution to all this. I don't just have regular manic/depressive symptoms. I have a heap of paranoia, aggression, and minor rage all in one.

I haven't hurt anyone close to me, but I feel like one day I just will. I've been started medicine about a year ago, and I feel as if my paranoia has only gotten worse from here. I can feel it every single day, and I'm afraid it's just going to become worse.

I can't even feel joy or passion about things I sued to do. Call it ""flat effect"" or whatever, but I'm not able to look at things and feel warmth. When I look at my dog I've raised for a year, I don't feel any type of fondness. Not when I look at my boyfriend, or my friends. I can just feel a lack of giving a fuck about everything what's the purpose to life if you can't even feel pleasure?

I have an appointment in a couple of days, so I hope we'll start on some kind of treatment, but it just seems like there isn't any. 
 That's why I feel as if I am bipolar, and that's my only redeeming trait. I try to remind myself that I'm a good person, but I just feel the opposite. As if I have this facade of being a good person, but I'm just a paranoid bitch underneath. And it's going to take a while for it to come out.
If you made it to the end of this rant, congratulations. In conclusion, I'm a hot mess."

1725,Psychosis after LSD,"I have a partner who I love so much and has been in my life for 3 years. They took LSD last month (we have both taken LSD before but they did this alone) and tripped by themselves off a gel tab, which he later found out was equal to about 3 tabs of acid. 
He had a really bad trip, and described being possessed at one point and even thinking he was dying outside in the woods. 
Anyway about 2-3 weeks later we smoked some weed together, and things got weird... before this he was pretty fine. But I think the weed triggered something. He started doing really weird hand gestures and claiming he has a spirit in him and knows so much universal knowledge. He asks himself questions and gets strange answers.. he said he feels a *magnetic* pull in his body to do certain things. Sometimes he speaks in a Jamaican accent to himself and says that’s the spirit he’s channeling who’s his soul grandfather.. i don’t know.. anyway. He came back to reality for a little last night and we talked about psychosis/schizophrenia and he listened openly about it and agreed. And he wants help. Anyway... coming in the morning now is the worst I’ve seen him. I rarely slept last night because he was beginning for me to listen to his rambling because he really felt like if I didn’t listen he was going to die. so I listened. Every time I would try and close my eyes he would cringe in pain so hard and beg me to listen more, and ask for me to heal him and say that I just need to keep telling him good things... whenever I left the bedroom last night he wanted to follow me everywhere because he said it made him feel safer. 
Anyway now 6AM I have work he was begging me to not to go, he’s told me that there’s so much chatter in his head and it’s just so negative. Then he expressed the voices want him to die, and want him to kill himself, and he believes he’s gonna die. And I told him it’s not true and he’s gonna be okay. He also told me that the spirits were telling him I will never understand and that he really is possessed and I will never know.. I tried to walk him to the hospital this morning but he was really delusional this morning and was running down the streets yelling and dancing and singing. 
I had to call the police so they could help transport him, by the time they came he calmed down and he agreed to let me help him and said thank you..
So now he’s at the hospital. Which I’m so worried about the treatment he’ll be getting there since I live in the city and it has such bad reviews.. anyway my heart is in so much pain right now. This person is so important to me... and I’m so heartbroken not knowing what’s going to happen. He doesn’t have any family or anywhere to really go and I really do want to take care of him when he gets out but also I know that’s a huge responsibility that I may not be equipped enough to handle. 
Anyway... I guess I’m just asking for any kind words, advice, insight on this situation... and maybe to know if there’s a possibility that he will recover and come back to earth.... :/"

I just tried to tell a friend about it and no one seems to take me seriously because I look healthy. I'm not depressed and I'm not the type of person to give up, but after years of hoping to find out what's wrong with me and not getting any answers, I'm just tired of trying to find someone to understand and take me seriously. Everyone in my life seems to think I'm just lazy because I haven't had a job ever. If I would wake up tomorrow and feel somewhat fucking normal, I'd go out and get a job and fucking get my life together, but everyday I wake up and I feel tired as shit.

I don't know if I have chronic fatigue, some undiagnosed illness or maybe I'm just mentally unstable. I really don't fucking know what's wrong with me.

Most of the people I used to hang out with probably think I'm a loser because I spend 95% of my time sitting at home doing nothing because I physically feel like shit everyday. not once did anyone take me seriously and tried to understand. 

""Just go the gym bro"" ""just try harder bro"" IVE BEEN TRYING EVERY FUCKING DAY FOR YEARS AND I WILL NEVER FUCKING GIVE UP

but after years and years I'm scared i'm reaching a breaking point, I really don't know what to do.

If my teenage self could see how I'd end up maybe I would have offed myself.

I’m 25F, currently on Wellbutrin 300mg and have been for 2 years. Depression/anxiety/CPTSD- all professionally diagnosed. 

The last 2 weeks I have been in a downward spiral. What started as some increased anxiety and some minor panic attacks, has spiraled into some kind of nightmare anxiety episode. 

As of this moment, I haven’t slept in 40 hours, and sleep in days before was restless and full of nightmares. I can’t fall asleep because I’m too anxious about it (for no reason). I have TMJ and my jaw is so tight, I literally can’t chew and i have headaches that won’t go away. I keep periodically vomiting and having dizzy spells. These are all typical manifestations of my anxiety, just not this bad or all at once. 

I sob nearly constantly, sometimes because of something sad, sometimes because of something cute, sometimes for no reason at all. My negative thoughts are out of control, all I can think about is how much I hate myself and my life, to the point where I find it hard to listen to other people when they are speaking. I also keep disassociating and losing hours of my day. 

I do have a therapist (not a psychiatrist) I have talked to her about this but she doesn’t seem that concerned. My medication was prescribed by my PCP. 

At this moment, it could be a lack of sleep but I feel like something is horribly, horribly wrong with me. I feel like I’m dying. I’m so scared that something bad is happening to me and that it won’t go away or that I will hurt myself or even others, unintentionally, like I will enter some state where I’m unaware of my actions. But also, even typing that seems like a crazy idea! 

If anyone has any tips or suggestions for how to make this stop, what I should do, support or encouragement, I will take anything. I don’t know how to make this stop."

---------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Let me start off by saying the first years of all this happening are vague memories. I don't remember everything as clearly as I used to.

I have never really done this before but I would like to share my story. It all started approximately 12 years ago. First class of high school is when all of the ""trouble"" started, I remember I had a very good and fun time. I did good in school, had a lot of friends, friends that I hung out with outside of school. So basically the entirety of my first year in high school was great. But then, at around the end of the first class. I all of a sudden started hearing voices in my head. I was 12, it was scary, weird and it felt very unreal yet also VERY real. I didn't know what to do with it, I was scared to tell my friends and my parents. It was 4 different voices, all male voices. They told me to do stuff. Thing as, don't pay attention in class, don't do your homework, be mean to your sister, ignore your friends etc. I'd say they were basically just bullying me the whole time. I was very young and I didn't know what to do with it so I listened. There were times where I tried not to listen and just ignore what the voices said to me or told me to do. When I did that, they would scream and bother me all day long. Imagine being at a party with 10 people and you're all talking to each other, they would scream, insult me, talk gibberish for hours and hours. Eventually I started doing worse in school because I wasn't paying attention (it was also hard because the voice would bother me every single day in school) I think my friends from back then started noticing things too and they eventually told my parents about it. I think I've said some weird shit to them that made them even more worried. I don't remember much about what happened after that, it's all very vague.

Next year high school, things just got worse and worse. Contact with my previous friends was gone because I never showed up to anything. Always said no, undoubtedly said weird shit that probably scared them off. Now I think about it I think it was maybe some kind of coping way. I never did my homework, I never learned for tests nor did I pay attention in lessons. Half a year in second year, the people at school told me it wasn't looking so good, that I wouldn't pass it to the next year if I didn't start putting in some work. Well, there was no way that was happening so I went to a different school. Lower level is the best way I can word it I think. It was a shame but there wasn't anything I could do about it. I spend the next 3 years there, things kept getting worse and worse. I missed A LOT in school because of the voices. I also missed a lot because I had awful stomach ache, now I think about it, it most likely is all because of the voices, stress and anxiety. After the first year of high school I basically lost all of the friends I had. The next 3 years I just went to school, not having friends and not talking to anyone really. When I went home I hopped on the PC and just played games until I went to sleep. I got kinda addicted to gaming because that's all I really did, just sitting in my room 24/7 and going to school every now and then. Voices in my head kept getting worse day by day, they started telling me different stuff. Told me to not go to school, to hurt myself, to kill myself, jump in front of a train. I tried to ignore most of it by playing games all day and listening to music, it helped a lot but later on voices just kept getting stronger and they managed to get through everything I did. I eventually started to self-harm, that just started off small and not very often. Took a razor blade apart and start self-harming on my upper arm. It was just a way of coping with all the stuff in my head. It helped, temporarily.. it was also very addicting.. 

Last year of high school, showed up even less in school. I'm still flabbergasted that I managed to pass all the exams. Self-harming got worse, happened at least once a week. I had a lot of anxiety, social anxiety also. I barely slept because of the anxiety, I had awful nightmares so I just played games until I was too tired I just passed out. I still had zero friends, the people I used to be in class with all chose different directions than me. 

After high school I went the study Desktop Publishing (end of 2014). None of the people from my last class did that so I had to go alone with no one I knew. It was also in a different city which scared the fuck out of me, my anxiety was off the roof every time I had to go with the bus. It always felt like people were looking weirdly at me, but that's just because the voices told me that. They just drilled stuff into my head and eventually you're just going to start believing everything they say. I actually had a really good time there, made some friends in the same class as me whom I played games with in the evening. But the voices, the anxiety, the self-harm. One day at home my sister saw my wounds on my arm and told my parents about it, I don't really remember what we talked about exactly but I had to talk to someone at school about it, she was working in the mental health industry. So that's what I did the next day at school, after that things moved FAST. I had to go to a mental health clinic because I was a danger to myself, it made sense because I had a lot of suicidal thoughts. I still have them to this day. I was 15 or 16 I think, I didn't want to because it would mean moving away from my parents and my sister, it would mean I could not play games anymore which was an escape for me but I guess I had to face it if I wanted to get better. So yeah, I moved to a clinic. There were different groups in the clinic, one of them was a closed group with children that were a harm to themselves. So that's where I had to go the first 2 weeks, it was kinda awful and very boring because well you can guess it. There wasn't anything to do, you weren't allowed to do anything except just sitting there in the living room or your own room which only had a bed and a desk. Now I've seen some stupid fucking shit over there, children getting thrown in a isolation room because they weren't listening or they were hitting the people that worked there. Now in now way do I think that was ever right to just throw them in an isolation room, like what the fuck is that going to do to them. NOTHING. It made me mad, sad and there wasn't anything I could do about it. It happened to me a few times, still don't know why. Anyway, I moved to a different group 2/3 weeks later, there were only girls there which was kinda awkward but it was nice. Everyone there was there for a reason so it was very nice to talk to some of them about our problems, I made friends there which was nice. All of us had to do stuff, we all had different schedules. We went in pairs to get groceries and then another pair had to cook, dishes etc. I was nice but it also was scary because I hated doing groceries but I didn't have to do it alone which helped a lot. We had different group therapy sessions and honestly, they didn't do shit. 

I've talked to a lot of different psychiatrists and psychologists the time I was there, about the voices, about what they said, about my nightmares. Now I'm gonna be really honest, I still have help to this day. And honestly, nothing in the past 7 years has helped me. Anyway, they mentioned schizophrenia quite often. So eventually the started prescribing me medication, that just started off with anti-depressants. And god just medication overall is fucking awful, first 2 weeks on being on you're just feeling worse because of the side effects, then you have to build it up. With anti-depressants it usually took between 4-6 weeks before you could even notice anything. Then you have to take that shit for a while and if you don't notice anything you gotta cut it down slowly and all of that just takes a long time. I don't really feel like talking more about the clinic because it hasn't really done much for me. I was there for about 6 months and then I went home again, to be honest. Nothing really changed, I just went back to gaming. I did have a lot of online friends that I would talk to everyday, I would also skype with them very often. When I was back home I started doing some voluntary work which was nice in a way but it didn't really do anything with the voices nor the anxiety or nightmares, I guess the social anxiety got a bit better because I wasn't that scared to go outside anymore. I still had appointments every week over at the clinic with psychiatrists and psychologists, tried a lot of different medication and different therapies. Eventually they discharged me there and redirected me to a different team that specialized in people with psychiatric disorders. In a way I was glad because it meant they maybe knew a bit more of what was going on with me. Again I had appointments every week, usually just about medication. I started with anti-psychotic medication, which was honestly way way worse then just anti-depressants. Side effects where worse, it was basically the same old story just worse. But I had hope, I had hope there would be one that would MAYBE help me a tiny bit in dealing with the voices. But no, there wasn't. I've tried almost all of them and ended up using the one they prescribe when all of the others don't do anything. And boy, that one was the worst of them all. The side effects didn't go away until I stopped using it, they had to test my blood every week because things could happen if I didn't. No idea what, couldn't really care at that point. Well eventually they also discharged ( mid 2013 ) me there because they said the problems I was showing and talking about were not a psychiatric-disorder. I was relieved in a way? But I also lost all of the hope that I had, I had tried so many different medication, talked to tons of different people and nothing helped. 

In 2015 my parents decided it was better for me, and for them for me to move out. Which initially I didn't agree with but it was indeed the right choice. It was too hard on my mom because she would hear me at night very often and she would know I wasn't doing good. So I went to live in an assisted facility, which sucked a lot because I didn't need any of the help. But it was the only thing available in my hometown. This was around mid 2015, I also went to a different team again back then, to get more help. I still have appointments every week. I did try some new medication that I hadn't tried yet just to see if it would change anything, it had been a few years since a had medication. Unfortunately nothing really helped until I stumbled across alprazolam, most of you guys will know it as Xanax. It's absolute garbage, but it helped me. I took it every now and then when I was feeling really scared or had bad nightmares. In a way I was glad I had new help again because it gave me a tiny bit of hope to hopefully get better, or how to deal with the voices and all the things that came with it.
I had a lot of different therapies once again, on how to deal with the voices, how to get more confidence, how to deal with anxiety etc. None of it really did anything. I'll talk more about this in a little bit. I had a friend from primary school that I saw every now and then, besides that I really didn't see anyone. I still did the voluntary work at a cat shelter which was a lot of fun. But all those years of medication, talking to people, trying different therapies. Did not do anything. It made me lose more hope each and every day. I just played games, talked to my online friends and eventually I fell in love with a girl all the way in Germany. It was weird because I never thought I could fall in love with someone over the internet, someone that I had not seen in real life ever. Only via skype. But I guess it is possible, and it was great. I felt great, there were times where I even felt happy ( I think ? ) She visited me 2 times a month and I visited her too. Visiting here was probably the scariest thing I had ever done, I had never been on a train and I had to go all the way to Germany, boy was I proud of myself when I got there. All in all, I had a good time but it just wasn't it for me so after about a year I ended things. And that was it, back the being alone in my room. I did move to a different apartment which was nice, more privacy, bigger, just everything you need really. 

The friend I talked about sometimes asked me if I wanted to come with him to the pub in the weekends, I wasn't really a big fan of seeing people let alone a bunch of people in the same place. But I did say yes almost every time. One time I saw a friend from primary school that I had not seen in about 5 years. We started talking to catch up with each other, we started become good friends again and hung out with each other very often. Fast forward, mid 2016 I think. Pokémon GO got released, him and me were always big fans of Pokémon, we used to always play it on the gameboy when we were little kids. We started playing it, this was the first time in years that I went outside every single day just to play this game with him and a ton of other guys that were his friends. They all knew my name, they all knew who I was but they had never really seen me. All because they know my sister. Mid 2016 was the first time in fucking years I had friends, like actual friends that cared about me even though half of the time I didn't believe it because of what the voices are always saying to me. I still kept in touch with the people I gamed with but things did change, I gamed less and was more outside. I went to the pub almost every weekend with a bunch of them. I had one other friend that lived in Sweden, honestly, my best friend. He knew everything and was always there for me. We talked almost every day and played games together. One saturday in the pub I got a follow request on instagram from a random girl all the way from Canada, we started talking and eventually skyping and once again I fell in love with someone over the internet, to me that shit is still fucking stupid but I guess you can't stop feelings, if they're even real feelings. It was also probably the biggest mistake, because the entire time we talked (about a year) she emotionally abused me. I was in love so I didn't really see it, I did everything she asked and shut out a lot of people for her, for some random girl over the internet. She destroyed my self-confidence and my trust in people too. I eventually realized it was very toxic and that she was destroying me so I blocked her and deleted her off of every single social media. But there I was, back in a hole. Being depressed once again. My friend had a girlfriend at the same time, that relationship stopped earlier. I was always interested in her when I saw her at parties or when we were at the pub. He didn't treat her well and that was something I noticed every time. Then one time in the pub ( mid 2017 ) I saw her sitting there, and god was she looking beautiful. I instantly fell in love and started talking to her, and she felt the exact same way. I think that was actually the first time in my life that I felt real happiness. We started dating, it made me so fucking happy. It motivated me to get better. We had an amazing time together, when I was her I was feeling good. When I was not with her, it was just the same as always, depressed, voices making me sad, scared. It was very hard for her because I wasn't always doing good when were were together, there were times where I just felt like shit and I didn't really want talk or to get touched. I never liked it either when my mom or dad tried to give me a hug. They always suspected something happened when I was younger, I never really thought about it that way. But one day I had therapy, my therapist started talking about stuff that can happen to anyone, like being in in accident, earthquakes, fights, and sexual abuse/rape. When she said that last thing, I froze, and all of a sudden I saw and remembered stuff. That was the trigger, people had asked me about that stuff before, very often. But somehow this time it was different, it triggered something. It was buried so deep that I just forget about it, so it turns out that when I was 11/12 I don't know the exact year, I got raped. Which explained so much, it explained why I often at times didn't want to get touched by my girlfriend at the time, or be intimate. 

It all didn't even bother me that much, mostly because I only saw small parts of what happened. And it wasn't like I thought about it very often after that, so my therapist told me we could try EMDR, which I had tried before for nightmares. But it wasn't really necessary because I didn't really think about it at all to be honest. But what happened when I was younger, is the cause of everything that has happened. I was too afraid to tell anyone about it, and that makes sense because when you're 11/12 you don't even know what the fuck just happened to you, whether it is even wrong or right. So I guess I buried it away. My girlfriend was very supportive, I mean she has always been there for me and has done everything me. Literally the sweetest girl I have ever met. But it's weird because I didn't think about what happened, I didn't have any flashbacks, nothing triggered it anymore. So I guess unknowingly it was still bothering me a lot. A few months after I found what happened, there was a night where I just felt really really bad, it happened often and I usually just took a xanax and hurt myself. That was my way of coping. But it was different that time, the voices they were different. It hit me more, I got scared, I panicked. I took all the xanax and cut myself way deeper than I usually did. I ended up in the hospital because I took too many medication. It wasn't even to kill myself though I've had suicidal thoughts for years, it was just to get the voices away so I could feel calm in my head. That happened a few more times after that with months in between. And I still can't imagine how hard that must have been for my close friends, my girlfriend and my family. I didn't really talk about stuff with my friends or my girlfriend, I usually just pushed it away because I always think I bother people with it. I think deep inside I know I don't bother them with it, but it's the voices that have buried that inside of me. We've dated for about 2 and a half year. This year in February she broke up with me, not necessarily because the feelings were gone. It was just too hard for her, and I completely understand that. I can't deal with it because I need someone with me, it keeps me motivated, it keeps me thriving to get better. Right now it feels like I'm doing it for no one, I always did it more for her than for myself. That's just who I am. I still had hope that we could work it out one way or another. I just had to work on myself and show it, show that I could do this alone. I tried to not contact her, but that was too hard so I kept messaging her. She didn't really reply because she needed time to process it all and she also just wanted to work on herself. It's hard, really hard. Eventually I managed to not really message her, just every now and then a message. But I was very depressed, very sad and very suicidal. All of that I had before, but not like this ever. I talked about it with friends, I talked about it with her girlfriends which helped me more because they knew her really good as well and it is just different talking to a girl about that stuff than a guy. After a while they didn't really like talking about it anymore because they were close to her and close to me, which I understood so I stopped doing that. March 2020, the only person I really talked about it with was Viktor, my best from Sweden. He came to visit me last year and met some of my IRL friends we usually played games with. He always has been the one I went to with my problems, he had known me the longest. There were lots of times where we didn't talk for weeks and then there were times where we talked every single day. 

March 20 at around 9:58 PM I get a message on discord, Viktor wanted me to call him. It was a message I only saw the next day. He told me he was panicking, I told him I was sorry I didn't see the message and asked him what was up. He didn't reply the entire week, at first I didn't really think much about it because we didn't always speak you know, there were weeks where we didn't spoke at all. But the on Sunday I started worrying, I thought something bad has happened. So I messaged some of his IRL friends asking them if they had hear from Viktor. One of them told me he died the night of March 20. He took LSD and had a bad trip and eventually killed himself, I was the last person he sent a message to, in fact the last person he even spoke to. And I missed the message he sent me. I know I shouldn't think like this but I fucking wish I saw it so I could've called him and maybe, just maybe talk to him and try to calm him down. I lost my best friend, and I lost the girl that I wanted to be with for the rest of my life (how corny huh). All of this in a period of 3 months. I don't know how to cope, I still have not dealt with the death of my best friends since the only fucking thing I can think about is my ex. I still can't sleep because of it, I still barely eat. A few weeks after I got the news there was one night where things just broke, I broke, I went full on panic mode. This was it for me, I was planning on killing myself, so I took all my xanax, all my anti-depressants and a fuck ton of paracetamol and lots of alcohol. After that I started to hurt myself, tried to slice my throat. When I did all of that, I panicked which I guess means I might want to live after all? Called my friend, had to go to the hospital and had to stay there overnight. After all of that had happened, I thought about just messaging my ex if she wanted to smoke and just talk about random stuff. We did that quite a few times, obviously it felt very different for me than it did for her. But I was happy, I'm still so in love, it motivated me to work on myself. Like really motivated me, to get her back BUT also for myself. For the first time I also did it for myself. So I did voluntary work again the past weeks, it felt good, it felt good to work on myself. I had a lot hope that me and her could maybe work it out. Last week I told her how I felt, I mean she still knew that but I just wanted to let her know that nothing had changed. The week after that I just couldn't sleep, eat, think properly so I decided to ask her to come over again. I just had to ask her if there was any chance she wanted to try it again with me. She told me not right now, she said she didn't feel the same anymore. I think deep inside I probably knew that, but I had hope. And somehow I still have hope, and I still want to wait. But knowing this now, I just don't know what to do anymore. Everything I ever did the last few years were for her and not really for me. I need someone in my life, I want it to be her but that's not possible right now. But I don't know if I can handle waiting. To be honest, I don't really want to anymore. I don't really want to live anymore because I'm sure as hell not going to do it for myself, I'm not motivated at all to work on myself. My suicidal thoughts are more present than they have ever been. Not sure if I could go through with that but I don't know."

1742,I want to be tortured,"I just wanna start by saying I’m good at a lot of things that I do and I have a very type A personality. My husband is very emotional and sensitive whereas I am very analytical. I have a lot of feelings but I just do not show them. Ive have depression and anxiety for a long time (medicated) and I grew up in a situation where there was a lot of addiction and mild abuse.I recently worked very hard for a promotion and did not get it. I felt nothing about not getting it-felt that it was simply a stepping stone towards a future position which I may possess.
My husband however has cried for an hour and a half. I am so tired of not having somebody to allow me to be weak I feel that I am always having to be dominant and strong. 
I recently realized that I have a desire to be domineered and abused. I’m starting to look for an opportunity to be abused. But I do not know where to begin to find such an opportunity. One thing that I do is contact one of my exes who is verbally abusive and emotionally destructive. But I feel like it’s the only way to FEEL. My doctor recommended that I see a psychiatrist but at this point I just wanna find someone who will domineer me. What is wrong with me?"

1744,Probably why I'm messed up,"Why I'm I just now fully registering that maybe one of the reasons I'm depressed Is because I live in a house with a cat that piss and shits on the carpet multiple times a day and now have dried shit and piss dried into the carpet and have to walk on pee pads for like a year. The owner won't tear out the carpet cause he's bad with money and cheap. Also no working washer, dishwasher, or oven. Oh and let's not forget the black mold and the horder hell of a garage."

1746,I feel at my limit,"I don't know what to do. 
I am almost unemployed. And my job is a dead end one.
I barely have any money. I am surviving with the goverment's allowance.
Years of sugar and fast food have damaged my brain. I stopped one week ago. Completely.
I need to study something to reorder my life. But i am not sure i have the necessary qualifications either to enter into the university, or even get into an apprenticeship.
The truth is i would like to dedicate myself to art, but i sort of need to do something else too. I think.
I have no friends in my daily life. I am living abroad. Most of the people i care about are far away from me. 
I live in a hostel. No privacy. No confort.
My sleeping patterns are completely dislocated.
And i had opportunities to make many of these things easily....but i could not. I was in a very bad place. And i could not take the opportunities.

Please i really need some advice i feel at my limit."
1747,Why would a friend only want me to design a book cover? Why can’t he accept I can’t as an answer &amp; why can’t I directly say no? I feel so guilty.,"I recommended a website where artists would do it for $40-50 but he keeps asking if I could &amp; I keep saying that I can’t. Why me? Is it because he’s hoping I’ll do it for free? He then said that he’ll maybe do it himself. So then I feel awful because I know he doesn’t know how. I just don’t get it. 

I keep saying I can’t instead of no but I’m scared to hurt him if I say no. Is it wrong that I keep saying no? Then I actually said to email me more info and I’ll let you know after he kept asking. This has been going on for 2 months now. He still wants me to do it &amp; I keep saying I can’t. Then I say maybe and consider once you email me more info. Feel so sick over this. I think I need to stop talking to this friend. I think he triggers stuff for me cause he reminds me of my brother who abused me. 

He says as jokes too “I bet you wish you took the job now”after saying something like I’d pay you a billion. I guess I’m the type of girl that has a hard time saying no, but I did say I can’t many times. I am trying in a nice way to say I can’t... I’m not a specialized artist for this stuff. Whatever I just don’t get it. 

I mean it is a lot of money for him idk I feel so bad and at the same time idk why I’m not feeling comfortable about this. 

Why me? Why does he only want me? It makes me feel so guilty when he says “he’ll do it himself then”. 

What do I do? 😔"
1748,I'm hurt and alone but no one even notices,"I doubt anyone will even see this but I could really use someone telling me no, telling me to stop, giving me any reason to want the sun to rise tomorrow, I feel alone, it's so hard for me to reach out but today I needy someone to help so I tried and no one noticed so here I am talking to no one just hoping someone sees."
1749,I feel like I didn’t have a great start at life,"I don’t know, I just start thinking about about all the things that happened to me in my youth that in some way have to have some toll on me now. I was a geriatric pregnancy, meaning my mom was over 35 when she had me, she had no amniotic fluid on the day I was born (no idea how long for) so she had an emergency C section. I fell flat on cement when I was just a few months old after a car seat mishap, I had an extremely bad allergic reaction to bubble bath soap to the point it gave me a UTI that caused a lot of pain and nonstop doctor visits. I was maybe around 4 when that happened, around the same time my slightly older male neighbor exposed himself to me and would kiss me. I feel like maybe this is why I may be sexually anorexic. idk why i’m writing this tbh or what response i’m looking for. I guess this is just something on my mind that I needed to write. sorry for being a bummer."

And more annoying is after he was yelling to my grandpa to call the cops as I was crying my ass off trying to break free from his arms. So much just keep happening that keeps weighing me down, it's too overwhelming, I've tried a lot, to make me feel better but I just can't, and counseling has never helped.

1753,Gay man with a lot to unpack!,"This is a lot to unpack but I need it off my chest and heart and could really use some sort of guidance as I feel completely overwhelmed:

Let me start of by saying I come from what would be known as a “white trash” lower-income family with mental health issues so if that makes you uncomfortable please move past this. 

I’m an early 30s gay man and I’ve been in a monogamous relationship for close to a decade. I come from a deeply dysfunctional home with a meth addict, abusive father who only became “clean” my junior year of high school after being arrested with an 8-ball of meth in his pocket and an enabling mother who has martyred her life and happiness to keep her family together while refusing to recognize the dysfunction or pain anyone may have felt at the hands of another. I am the only person in my family to attend college and one of two siblings who moved FAR away. After my father became clean it took years to trust him but I started developing a relationship with him until 8 years ago he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given 5 years to live.  Somehow he has beaten the odds and is still alive today.  But then 3 years ago we found out he’d been having a multiple year affair with another woman. My enabling mother still won’t leave him so I put a boundary in place that i will no longer talk to him or visit until he passes to protect my own mental health. I haven’t been home since 2014 or seen my family since 2016. Needless to say, my connection to my own family is very limited.

That said, I recognize similarities/traits of both of my parents in myself and I fear I am becoming them in my own relationship despite my best efforts.  At the beginning of my relationship my boyfriend was more passive/docile. He didn’t ever fight and didn’t communicate well when there were issues.  I honestly and regrettably walked all over him. I didn’t share my feelings/concerns/vulnerabilities because I was taught (unfortunately) that they are weak. So the first few years of our relationship were blissfully wonderful to me as I was unaware of any issues while belittling his feelings and being a bit controlling (a characteristic I NOW recognize in myself due to having so much chaos in my life as child.) At some point he started to stand up for himself, there were issues because of it and because I didn’t yet recognize my own unhealthy learned behaviors.  It started to feel like he always had one foot out the door and we discussed it regularly because he self-admittedly did but said he wanted the relationship to work.  I thought things were improving, we moved on. Issues would arise again: one foot out the door.  The cycle repeats.  

When my family visited me just before we found out about dads affair, issues were brought up and ultimately a repressed memory of sexual abuse toward me was brought to light. I went into a deep downward spiral of depression that I was unable to pull myself out of or work through. My boyfriend has never been able to wrap his head around my family’s dysfunction.  I can’t blame him, it is a lot.  When I share issues with him about my family he listens quietly but has never been able to connect with me or understand it.  So when the sexual abuse/depression came about he started to go numb because I was numb.  We honestly lost what connection we had, but I felt (due to being raised by an enabling co-dependent mother) I couldn’t live without him and he felt because we had a foundation and time together, we should still give us a chance. I gained 30 pounds, my self-esteem was out the door, and I felt completely disconnected from myself. 

I found out on my own a couple years ago that my boyfriend had an affair during that time with someone I thought was a mutual friend.  He lied about it continuously before finally admitting it happened and admitted he had fallen in love with the man. He claimed it only happened once but he is unaware that I found out more.  I do know it ended.  I know it’s over.  But I know they maintain a friendship still and it hurts me deeply and he knows that.  In the last two years I have been working on me and my mental health. I started working out, I was losing a good amount of weight until quarantine hit, I started to feel like me again and I recognized the learned behaviors that had been detrimental to myself and my relationship and have been unlearning them. We communicate better than we ever have and have felt closer than we have ever felt! He tells me when he has issues with my actions/words, I do the same, we talk it out respectfully and come to resolutions and actually put those resolutions into actions.

But during quarantine he started to recognize his own mental health issues and admitted to me that he is depressed and needs a therapist. (We both do, but funds are tight.) He told me he is not sure if he is in love with me but also didn’t know if it’s because of his depression issues or otherwise.  And yet I stay.  And i feel my self esteem slipping because I made so many positive changes in myself and it feels like I am still not enough for him. That he still has that foot out the door.  

I am scared because in some ways I have been my father in this relationship, in some ways he has had been my father, and in a lot of ways I have been my mother. 

It’s easy to say “this relationship is toxic, break up!” It’s harder to be committed and put in the work. I want to put in the work. But I don’t know if that’s the enabling, martyr mother in me talking or if it’s healthy anymore.

***I recognize there is a lot of weighty emotional stuff in this post.  But there are also incredible things about our relationship too. It’s just so much to put in a post"
1754,Anger issues are ruining my happiness.,"I have been trying pretty hard to pinpoint what exactly triggers my waves of anger, and I feel like I can’t boil it down. Just out of the blue I feel a wave of irritation, and a mild form of anger take over. I’ll self isolate (i feel like its best for me to avoid interaction with my husband/ friends/ other family when it starts), and I just completely lose all motivation do anything but be angry. Just today, I had thought about cheating on my diet, ordered the food for my husband and I, and I ended up not cheating at all. fast forward a half hour and a wave comes on and I toss out all the food I ordered myself and took four sleeping pills so I’d pass out instead of staring at the ceiling being upset. I feel like the most random things ever ever bring on these episodes and none of them seem to relate to one another. why would not cheating on my diet make me pissed? or only working a half day at my job? none of it correlates and not being able to figure out what’s wrong with me is only making me more angry."

I once was in a relationship &amp; when I told her about my condition, she gave me a pure look of disguist and disappointment &amp; broke up with me. I just don't feel comfortable around girls anymore, I have stopped going to parties.

1759,Im in a fucking hard spot,"My stupid therapist says that since I’m under 18 all “dangerous” things I say to her, she has to say to my mom who I don’t want in my private life because as lost African mothers she gossips a lot. I remember when I was 9, she took me to this shady ass doctor somewhere in Somalia to get me FORCEFULLY circumcised and then FUCKING goes around talking about it like it’s her achievement. Do you know how much that hurt? I tried escaping but they FUCKING BEAT ME UP. 5 ADULTS. AND SHE HAS THE FUCKING AUDACITY TO ASK WHY I DONT TRUST HER. And if I tell my therapist that and all the things I might do, she will call CPS and most important destroy my chances at school. Do you know how hard I tried with my depression? So I just don’t go to my therapist. I have trust issues with my therapist because the one before snaked me out to my whole school about MY challenges. No one looked at me the same the whole last year at that school. And when I turn 18 I have to pay? Hell no. They best belive i’m going to put them in my suicide note."

1765,"TW: PTSD, workplace harassment, suicidal ideation","Last year, I was verbally and emotionally harassed by a coworker. He has since left, but over the past twelve months since he was fired I’ve developed PTSD and was formally diagnosed by a therapist last week. It’s getting more and more challenging for me to complete my job (which I’m currently working remote due to COVID). Even opening my email gives me extreme anxiety, and I have to work up to doing even the smallest tasks like messaging a coworker. It is getting bad enough at this point that I’m not able to complete my job. My therapist suggested I find a new job (while we work through the PTSD), but because of everything going on I imagine it could take me a few months to find something. I honestly don’t know if I can keep doing this another week, let alone another month. The last five months or so, all I can do is imagine escaping and I’ve started having suicidal thoughts (my circle is in the loop on this and I am safe). Doing some research last night, I realized I could potentially take FMLA for this situation. However, I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame in doing this (I worry about letting down my team, and what they might think). I just need some words of encouragement, and validation of whether or not FMLA is a good option for me."

1767,I am in complete darkness and can’t see anything anymore.,"I have never felt this bad before. I broke up with the girl I am Inlove with 10 months ago. We were talking and hanging out a bit but in the past 2 months it’s been getting worse. I used to wake up to her texts, now nothing. She would invite me over to see her and our dog now when I ask she says no. It seems like she just wants the power. She always been a bit controlling but this is something else entirely. I said “idk why I’m trying, it’s not like we will ever get back together” and she said “ofcourse there is a chance” which I think was just her getting in my head because I’m doing everything and she keeps withdrawing and remembering our relationship in ways that it wasn’t. I don’t know who she’s talking to but she always denies it when I ask if there is anyone else. The point is I can’t really see myself feeling this pain anymore. I’ve came to the realization that I do want to take my own life. I’m 34, she had been my everything for every single day since I met her 4 years ago. We always texted and talked every single day since we met, we made love 2 days after meeting and I moved in with her a few days later. She has cheated on me and lied about me and blamed me for things she had done yet as long as she is here and I can hold her and she says she loves me then I don’t care about anything else. But she is slipping away no matter what I do. I cannot go on like this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I mean how can she go from saying “ I love you “ to me after 2 days, she called off her engagement to someone she had known for 8 years for me after knowing me for 2 days, and she proposed to me after 3 months to what she does now? It makes no sense..

Ps I’m almost certain she has a B type cluster personality disorder and possibly a sociopath and I have depression."

1769,"Mom depressed and has been for some time, not sure how to help","I suspect my mom has been depressed for many, many years. After both Grandparents died in the early 2000's she was overcome with grief and quit her job as a nurse and stayed home while my dad worked. My dad was pretty angry and emotionally abusive and continues to be so to this day (not as bad). 

She is nearing 60 years old and has no friends, no hobbies, never leaves the house, does not really take care of herself. She just cooks and cleans for me and my dad (we both work) and watches youtube and TV for hours all day, everyday, late into the night. She tells me she wants desperately to go back to work but keeps putting it off month after month because she is terrified about of her ability to keep up with Technology in nursing. She broke down to me several times about how she doesn't love my Dad and hates where we live and is very unhappy. 

I've suggested counseling but she is very against it as there is an old school stigma about only crazy people get counseling. I'm not sure what to do or how to help her and would appreciate any input."

1773,I've ruined a relationship and I don't know what to do.,"Me (16M) her(17F). 

Recently I have ruined a relationship with the person I love. We have been on and off for 6 months now with what I thought was an okay relationship. It's my first time ever being in love with someone and I wouldn't say I love anyone else even parents or siblings, all of which I've had shaky relationships with mainly due to me messing them up as well. 

She feels as though I do not care about her issues of which she has many and that I have been in the relationship only for sexual and physical reasons. She feels underappreciated both physically and emotionally and says that she hasn't once felt that I've truly appreciated her in these areas. She had an amazing personality that I love very dearly and is a beautiful person. I've fucked up more than once but each time we've gotten back together. I've never been great at apologizing and this time she has told me basically that she feels I do not care about her. I can see why she would think that. I'm bad at expressing myself especially in expressing affection towards others as it's not something I normally due and I'm also shitty at apologizing. I've hurt her and I feel as though I can't repair the relationship that I have had with her. The things that I tried to help her with didn't work and they didn't help her. I feel defeated and like I've ruined the last good relationship I have. I know that I'm at fault for what's happening but it is making me feel horrible as well. I've been having thoughts that I just ruin every relationship I ever have so why bother living anymore. I keep on repeating one solution in my thoughts but at the same time I've always thought that suicide is never the answer. This is probably an incoherent mess made by someone who deserves none of your sympathy. I really do love her and im dissapointed in myself that I couldn't show that to her proper."

1776,The story of my jerk @$$ school and my declining mental health (Legit a story lol I'm doing better now tho.),"Soooo yea here it goes, before I start this sorry for any spelling mistakes.

Cast:

Cat: The HSP 5th grader with depression and low self esteem GF: My adorable ""girlfriend"" at the time BFF: My main emotional crutch due to being the only friend I can relate to (My girlfriend and I are like oppisites attract) Ms. B: My jerk @$$ math teacher Principal/P:My idiot principal Mom: My amazing mom Ms. Y: My teacher whos obsessed with yelling and EK: A girl who bullies me and BFF but adores GF and tries to steal her from us constantly

Okay this whole ordeal started with Cat and her passion for art, oneday Cat brought her sketchbook to school she LOVED to draw but her teachers didn't like her passion. One day P madea new rule that NO ONE could bring ANYTHING anywhere! This made Cat VERRRY angry, she had two times per day to draw traditional art, at home she slaved away and animations for her YT channel! The two times we're at aftercare and recess, and occasionally after she finished her work now two of those times had been taken from her.

Cat brought her sketchbook to school and was scolded for it. Cat used a small bag due to her school not requiring her to bring anything so her sketchbook poked out. Cat also brought mechanical pencils in her purse but the school put a ban on her purse aswell. Now Cat had a GIANT problem with losing her pencils and would not could not use reg. pencils soooo she lost a lot of pencils to this ban. Now for some more well.. here's where my mental health begins to rapidly decline

Cat walked into her math class with her sketchbook and purse of mechanical pencils. Ms. ""B: CAT! How DARE you bring that purse and sketchbook into MY class. Those were BANNED you IDIOT! Put them back in your cubby."" Cat: ""But-"" Ms B: ""Uh uh uh PUT. THEM. BACK."" Cat reluctantly put put them back, holding back tears. This was when she knew this would be a ROUGH year.

The second story involves GF. Now GF had sprained her knee in gymnastics, now Ms. Y had appointed cat o be her personal assistant basically. Cat followed GF everywhere and got stuff for her, held her stuff, and even went down the elevator with her! But Ms. B didn't care about this. She just had EK get stuff for GF even tho GF HATED EK! Me and BFF we're pissed but Ms. B didn't give a shit.

Cat put up with so much of Ms. B's bullcrap until she snapped, she started trying to stay home as much as possible and eating candy that she snuck into school all day and 4/5 days a week would leave Ms. B's class crying, smiling, and laughing. She soon spiraled into a deep, deep, depression. BFF: ""Cat, just tell your parents already!"" Cat: ""No, they won't listen..."" BFF and Cat had this conversation nearly DAILY until she DOUBLE SNAPPED.

But this was the last straw. Ms B: ""CAT what is that under your desk!?"" She'd snatch up Cats sketchbook and FLIP THROUGH IT gasping, seeing some of her diary notes and drawings where she'd discribed her suicidal thoughts and hatred twards Ms. B but Ms. B SCOLDED HER FOR DRAWING IMAGES OF DEAD CHARACTERS AND SUICIDE AND HATRED OBVIOUSLY TWARDS HER! This woman... OH THIS WOMAN. SHE DROVE CAT TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE WITH SCISSORS AND TRY TO STRANGLE HERSELF. And she SCOLDED HER for trying TO COPE WITH HER.

Than Cat told GF and BFF about her suicide attempts... GF cared about Cat verry much and after Cats second attempt told Mom. Mom asked Cat why she wouted ld try to kill herself? And the truth about Ms. B came out and how she had insulted Cat, flipped through her PRIVATE SKETCHBOOK, given her MORE HOMEWORK, and SCOLDED HER for her coping mechanisms!

Mom knew she had to get Cat out of that class IMMEDIATLY and emailed P if there were any other options, and all the stuff Cat told her. THREE DAYS LATER P said Cat could go to a FOURTH GRADE math class.Both Mom and Cat agreed that being in a fourth grade class felt more like a punishment, keep in mind there were two other 5th grade teachers who were doing legit nothing. So mom emailed P to ask for another option P said no.

Moms next resort was to have Cat change schools and keep her home while waiting for a response. But before the response arrived there was a field trip to the local Middle School Cat needed to go on. Now Cat went, reluctantly this next story mainly deals with Ms. Y and yea. So Cat, BFF, and GF were talking Ms. Y comes over and goes ""CAT, BFF, GF SHUT UP AND LISTEN"" but when EK is talking with her friends Ms.Y does nothing! Later on Ms. Y does this AGAIN. And now for the LAST WORDS EK SAID TO CAT BEFORE SHE LEFT! ""You don't know how to act!"" she said when Cat told her that she was leaving for Ms. B bullying her.

Im doing much better now and am in therapy

Currently doing better, also this is formated like an r/entitledparents story cause I read those a lot and I posted this on r/EntitledPeople first, well was but than didn't. and copy nd pasted what I already had."

1778,"I need therapy because of my mother, can't get a session because of my mother.","I need it because of her and a million other things. I'm a teenager and have been depressed and have had anxiety for years. I had been going for a few months, she didn't believe me for a very long time, but finally made me go when school counselors got involved (and has held it over my head as an example of what a great parent she is quite a few times). Anyways, summer has been very bad for me. I've asked multiple times, and she either ignores me or just says that she'll book an appointment and never does. I honestly despise her. I hate that I am dependent on a main contributor to my mental health issues to help me fix my mental health issues. We are fine financially and we have insurance. I'm fucking frustrated. And I can never find a therapist I like, and I hate being forced to communicate to her about all these things about who I should see, why mine isn't a good fit, why I need to go. How is any kid or teen supposed to seek help for personal and family related issues when finding help has to involve said family? I can't even imagine how bad severely abused kids have it. It's not like I can use a hotline or online therapy because that's not confidential (as if actual therapy for minors even is) / will charge my phone, which she will see. I feel so horrible all the time, and there's nothing I can do. Last time I talked to her abt seeing a doctor or therapist it ended up being a screaming match, with her complaining about how I never sleep and am unhealthy. No shit. That's why I'm telling you do book me an appointment. Sorry for the rant."

1781,I don't know anymore,"Every time I think that I'm okay with my life, it feels like there's always something that rips that away for me. I don't know why I feel this way when I've had a pretty good week last week. But now I just want to end everything. I just feel so hopeless and it feels like my body is numb from everything. I've become desensitized to my surroundings. I hate it here. I really do. Life feels really useless. Why is it so much easier to express all of this on the internet than it is to my parents or my therapist? Damn, I don't know anymore.

I think about ending it a lot, especially when I'm driving. How quick and easy it is to end my life with no warning. No goodbyes. No emotional pain. Sometimes I think that if I drive fast enough then I won't feel anything, which isn't any different from the way I feel right now. Sometimes I have a strong urge to take as many melatonin pills so I can try to sleep forever. I just want to stop hearing my own thoughts. I don't want to hear anything anymore. I don't feel anything.

My head and my heart hurts and I can't bring myself to do anything about it except curl into a ball and wallow in my own feelings. It just hurts so much."

1784,My fiancee [27] would threaten me [30] that she would call 911 everytime we had an argument," 

Over the past couple of days I have been posting multiple incidents of mine and my fiancee that happened over the past few months on various subreddits. The intention is to get to know from people who have been in an abusive relationships on how to handle such situations. The intention is not Karma farming.

My fiancee would get really angry over something really trivial and start to throw things at me. She would throw knifes and glass which made me hold her hands to prevent her from doing so. Soon after, she starts to cry and says that I am hurting her and that she would call 911. She takes her phone and I see her dial 9-1.... I get scared and go grab her phone . She becomes wild as a result and starts to bang her head against the wall and goes ""I am going to die by holding my breath"". How do you even handle such a situation? Do I just let her dial 911 ?(I have been advised not to since I have held her hands and that is restraining. The cops would just arrest me) . But, taking her phone to prevent her causes her to go even more violent . She even took my phone and slammed it against the wall once because I wouldnt give her phone back. It's crazy.

After holding on to her phone for about 20 minutes (during which she hit me spit on me), she automatically calmed down only to go to the bedroom and lock herself for hours."
1785,Can Labor Organizing Treat Depression?,"[Harriet and Max chat with biomolecular engineering grad student Rachel Mendelson about her experience participating in the historic Cost Of Living Adjustment (COLA) campaign](https://anchor.fm/itsnotjustinyourhead/episodes/Ep10-Can-Labor-Organizing-Treat-Depression--ft--Rachel-Mendelson-egt14v) that started at UC Santa Cruz in September, 2019, then spread to every UC campus in California. We explore what kinds of conditions typically lead to workers going on strike, and how those conditions can be mapped into the individualistic mental health model as symptoms of depression and anxiety (ie, a sense of dread, feeling helpless and powerless, self-blame, etc). Rachel shares with us the mental health benefits she experienced from joining the wildcat strike along with thousands of other grad students risking their careers (and some being injured by police) in hopes of achieving a better quality of life for themselves as well as everyone else.

1790,Question cuz idk where else to ask,[deleted]
1791,Need Help Defining a Psychological Issue,"I've been googling endlessly but can't seem to find any info on a psychology term for when someone insists you are a victim even though you don't feel that way. For instance - let's say you were circumcised as an infant and feel completely fine with your parents having made that decision for you - What would you call it if someone insisted you were actually a victim and simply ""don't understand"" the damage it has done to you? Is this simply a form of gas-lighting?  I can only find info on people telling victims they AREN'T victims. Thanks so much!"
1792,Need Help - Friend I Believe Has DID,"I (22M) have a neighbor (41M) who is now a good friend of mine and has a family. As I’ve gotten to know them I believe his daughter (14F) has DID (dissociative identity disorder)

She claims that she has conversations with people in her own mind and that sometimes they take over and it has happened (unless she’s messing with me but I doubt it) to me first hand.

Her alters are “Blade” who is a male who is aggressive to protect her from harm. Another is “Anna” who is passive and emotionless. And “Lily” is a little who apparently represents the childhood she wanted to have.

I’m not familiar with any of this. I’m the one who told her what I believe is “wrong” (bad terminology I know) with her and she can start by fixing it by realizing what her issues are and to look into more.

I’ve tried convincing her to talk to her family (me doing that might result in something bad as she has talked about suicide as a last resort if she can’t handle it any longer— which of course I tried to deter her away from) but regardless she refuses to talk to her family claiming she has tried before and it only made her life worse.

She also experiences panic attacks from this, which I do have experience with. 

I’m not sure what to do or who to tell... if I tell anyone what I believe is happening, she would see this as a betrayal and I might miss the chance to keep her from self harm.... on the other hand, if I tell it might be what keeps her from self harm and possibly a chance towards therapy.

She has also said her school counselor is super old and hard hearing and was not helpful... then again I think her just now realizing her symptoms could change that?

I honestly do not know. I hate to do nothing, but I know it’s not my family and for me to try telling someone’s family what is wrong with their kid will probably not go well and could make her life worse. 

For now I just try to cheer her up and we talk about fun things like cartoons and anime... any advice would be great, but I’m also aware this isn’t a professional forum for psychiatrists so I’ll take everything with a grain of salt."

By the title I mean like doing kind things in order to look like a good person, but not actually caring about what you’re doing. For example, loosely listening to someone talk about their problems when you don’t actually care very much, you just want to seem considerate and kind.

In my mind there mentaly weak and they truley don't care about anyone around them, because if they did they would try to improve.

1816,"When is it considered someone is having ""suicidal thoughts""?"," 

Depending on my mood the given week, every day or maybe every few days, I have these reoccurring thoughts of hopelessness and guilt. These thoughts make me almost “fantasize” about death. It makes me think of everything I would no longer have to worry about and how all my stress could just go away. 

That being said, I would never act on these thoughts. Mostly because I think it would be very selfish since it would negatively impact those around me. 

Everything seems so contradictory. One of my biggest fears is dying before I can live a meaningful life. 

I always thought this way of thinking was normal, but maybe it is something I should seek help for."

1818,Biomarkers of mental health issues,"Hi,

I'm wondering what are ""biomarkers"" of various mental health issues (objective / measurable attributes which highly correlate with having mental disorders).

For example, for depression, it's said that this would be things like REM sleep onset latency (the smaller the worse) and total REM sleep time (the more the worse).

Anything else? Something measurable from blood? (low omega-3 levels? low lithium?)

Thanks!"
1819,Finances are by far my biggest stress,"Honestly, thinking about how much debt I have, how many bills I have each month, and the fact that I will have to work for the rest of my life just to pay rent (or a mortgage) makes me feel like killing myself.

I wouldn't ever actually kill myself because there's way cooler stuff to do in life if you get to that point of not caring. But still, I feel constant stress from not having enough money to pay bills and get food.

And I'm just like fuck.. this is the rest of my life."
1820,I feel like I can't afford another mistake,"I've feared failure for so long and have so much deep seated guilt that I feel like I can't fail more or else it'll make both fears even worse. They say mistakes are a part of success and the learning process and learning to embrace them to be fearless and everything, but I feel like I can't afford to make those mistakes both literally and figuratively, for both big or small things. Like when it comes to something small like making a new recipe I can't afford to mess up because then I'll have wasted ingredients and asking to buy them is already kind of seen as ""unnecessary"" since they're not really anything we need and since most are baking projects they're already kinda bad for physical health (living with parents because of COVID). I also feel like I can't afford to mess up in life or start new because that would also be costly/a waste of tuition. Maybe I'm just making excuses for myself again, but it really does feel that way sometimes. 

I go back and forth about whether I should attribute this to privilege, because though the friends I grew up with grew up in wealthy families that were much more well off than mine, I still see how lucky I am to have what I have, and that maybe even having these thoughts is a privilege. I don't know."

1823,"My mind is my own worst enemy, completey overthrown by its activeness when alone.","First off I should start by adding that I'm Aspergic, so this may make things a bit more complex.

Something that has been apparent since I was a kid was that I like to think about everything. Unless it's something I have an obsession with, I can never think about just one thing at once. My brain is always trying to piece things together, recognise patterns or find solutions for any problems I am having in regards to issues in my life.

When I'm alone this gets worse. I write things down, I type them out, I do everything I can to get thoughts out of my head. The moment I do however they are replaced with a new one, a new question or a new fear I have to resolve.

Talking to people makes this easier, but over my 25 years of life I've found it very difficult to make very firm, stable friendships. I have a lot of acquaintances but a very small circle. I do have a girlfriend, however she lives overseas.

I'm becoming more problematic being caught in my head, I over think about everything but even worse is I cannot bare the feeling of isolation when my mind runs rampant.

The cycle continues, feeling of isolation, more secluded in my head. Until I get to a point of mental collapse.

I've been through CBT, therapists and psychologist since I was a kid. I'm very highly functioning and I can make it easily seem like nothing is wrong as I hide it well. 

I have tried meditation. I still try my best to keep up with it as it does calm me. 

I just want to get past living in my head and thinking about every single thing at once?

I need peace. Does anyone else have any experience with this?"

I’ve had this for a long time. I feel like it hinders my ability to change my emotion, mainly from going to anxious to happy or feeling nice inside. I’m usually anxious because of my reasons. This feeling has been with me and it goes away only sometimes. When I’m cold it goes away, so I drink cold water a lot by pouring the water in my mouth and letting it go down my throat.

1831,"Why am I Having anger, anxiety, and depression over stupid things that are my fault in the first place? (Thoughts of Violence Trigger Warning)","So this thing all started when about a month ago when I was talking to my brother. I was talking about a video game and I almost spoiled it. He cut me off and started ranting (in a somewhat nice way) about how I always do this when I talk about games or movies. I know he was right, but I started having panic attacks all day and getting really mad at everything.

And then tonight I was being loud while practicing my freestyles (which are REALLY bad) and he told me to shut up cause he had work in the morning. Once again, he was totally right. I shouldn’t be blasting music this loud at 1 am and I didn’t have any consideration for his needs. 

But I somehow still feel angry and depressed and I feel like I wanna just scream at him. I know I’m wrong, I know what I was doing is wrong. So why do I still want to defend myself and say that I hate him even though it’s not true. I just feel like crying and not moving at all, but at the same time I want to beat him up and give him a piece of my mind. What’s wrong with me?"

1834,I need advice on how to manage my thoughts and if it's time to see a doctor,"This is not for reassurance, I just want to get my thoughts out. I don't have diagnosed OCD but I really don't know what else it could be. For a while I thought ADHD and whilst I fit traits for that, I'm still not sure.

My thoughts connect to each other like a pattern and all involve past behaviours.

E.G see a picture of a dog---&gt; remember when as a teen I used to smack my dog as a punishment, however I don't do that anymore---&gt; feel panic and that I'm kidding myself and that I used to hit him more than once when he was naughty and I enjoyed it----&gt; even if this wasn't true I still hit him and that's abuse and disgusting and why should I carry on with the nice life I have. 

E.G. 2 remember or see the name of someone I had a drunk one night stand with where I blacked out for a bit of the sex and can't remember actually going to sleep after----&gt; what if the bits of the sex I can't remember I forced her to do things she didn't want to do----&gt; try and check if she is viewing and liking things on Instagram as a sign she still likes me and nothing bad happened-----&gt; resist the urge to message her asking if the sex was fully consensual. (this happened 3 years ago).

Just two examples but I also get scared in the future I might hit my boyfriend or do something like that even though I haven't ever got close to feeling that anger and urge to be physically aggressive in my life except a couple of times as a young teen. 

Does anyone have any tips to break this cycle, as soon as I 'resolve' one, my brain will pick another.

I have counselling sessions but I don't know if they help with this particularly ^ as they're general and if I mention things they will just try to provide reassurance, and although I don't know if I have OCD I don't really know what if that will work. I think a diagnosis would help if I have it and I guess that means I need to go to a doctors if I want that. I'm in the UK."

Then I lost my mother, and I was assaulted, and as a result of the really bad mental health I was struggling with (Bipolar) I lost my job. I also gained an absolute tonne of weight because of the anti-psychotics I'm now on to manage my episodes. 

I managed to get work as a temp, then 'rona hit, so I am not being paid and I'm just waiting for the go ahead to be able to go back to work.

I am so proud of them, and so happy for what they have achieved, I don't resent them for it at all, but it makes me reflect on how badly I've done in comparison.

I hate myself so much for how little I've achieved. I've been desperately applying for jobs (I've applied to over 50 now, with 27 interviews, and no one will touch me because of my shitty past and losing my previous job).

This overthinking reaction led me to higher levels of anxiety. I couldn't even talk to a gay guy without feeling a horrible stomachache. So I decided to stop dating, stop looking for a partner and stop talking to gay people. I just avoided everything related to love and focused on studies and friends.

After this break time, I talked with my psychologist and know i kind of understand what happened and I can control my breathe to calm me down.

The problem now is that i started to talk with a super cute boy, and i would really like to restart dating, and kissing him. I am not sure if I will be able to control my impulses and relax in a real situation with a boy.

1846,Dealing with my mother's mental illness (Vent + Advice if you have any),"**Before you read any of this- this is quite long and not all the details have been addressed. In short my mother has times where she is paranoid and illogical (people going to kill us or attack us), but also times where her mind is normal/clearer- she knows what she has said is illogical, and knows she needs to see a doctor**

\*A lot of this is going to be quite specific, but I feel like I have no one else to talk to about this. I've definitely missed out on a bit of the whole situation, but there's so much going on 

My mother has been through a lot through her life; things she's managed to push through.

She worked for a local council as a caretaker, where she helped care/supervise old people. She liked this part of the job. Then she took an office job at the same council- working on calling clients, which she didn't exactly like; the hours were a lot worse and draining. But the job wasn't the key problem.

There were a few workers at the council who she had trouble with; they would indirectly bully her by not taking any of the calls, so the workload on her was excessive. The environment according to my mother was toxic and quite childish- like unnecessary taking behind backs, etc. 

1 year passes- about May or so; mother has a breakdown- she reports a certain person (call her BULLY) who she has ranted about for the past year for bullying her, due to encouragement through my father and a desire for herself to stand up for herself. I did not know she was going to do this; and I would have advised against doing this- because I believe you stand up to your bullies by telling to ""piss off"" in front of them. However, she told this to HR or someone. 

\~My mother is not exactly the strongest in terms of will- she prefers a simple life, which I completely understood; now and then 

She reported this person, who was bullying her- I believe this- but I don't think this bullying was that extreme (it was playground bullying). My mother made it sound like it was vile and criminal.

A week later, she stops working- taking some time off from the office- and she said that she wants BULLY to leave the office, because she cannot stand the sight of the awkwardness within the office of seeing BULLY; also I inferred that seeing BULLY's face, reminded her of all the bad stuff in the past. 

Now at this point, I'm thinking fine; I get it- the bullying is not extreme, but I get it- you need some time off to heal from a lot of working for the last 10+ years (mother has not really taken breaks off work)

However, at home, she doesn't have a lot to do- there's the COVID outbreak (last month or so), and she can't do anything 

**Now this is where things go south. (a lot of this does not make logical sense at all- I can't understand it either)**

Initially I thought good, this could all be ending. She quits her office job, after saying she'll fight to see BULLY out of the office. She sends email after email. 

She says the council is attacking her; her managers have also been involved in indirect bullying (nothing personal, but in terms of work- not okay); she thinks the emails they send back to her are threats/or mocking remarks- such as ""Hope you are okay or get well soon"". She prints out messages sent by the council and says she cannot trust anyone except for her family. 

As soon as she got emails, she'd freak out and have panic attacks. Like she emailed them- in regards to sick leave and whatever- and as soon as they replied saying it's okay- she'd freak out from these notifications. Also, at this point she was saying that the council has secrets that they were hiding, and that they were attacking her (my mother) because she knew these secrets.   
I asked her- what are these secrets? She freaked out- and said it doesn't matter. 

At this point she's also been seeing a counsellor and a doctor to talk- but then after the counsellor sends out a surveymonkey link to review how good the counsellor's services were; which she thought was some sort of hacking website so later at night she started thinking that the counsellor was attacking her because this website was a ""hacking website"" (I told her it was a legit website later) and she was scared that the council was going to attack her doctor too. The doctor gave her some advice, which she has not followed, because she believed that it wasn't effective for her. 

A lot happened on that day- she got a breast screening notification up- she'd done one 2 days before- and she thought it was the council using the breast screening centre to mock her about potential cancer (our family has a history of breast cancer btw)

**It gets worse from here**

She starts freaking out over devices- turning off location on phones- she legit woke me up and started panicking that people (the council) were tracking her. I turned it off for her, but I asked her how does the council have the technology to do this- they're not that smart and they don't have the resources.

She takes her SIM card out and then I disable her phone's email function for her; she even turns bluetooth off. She has complete distrust for the phone. She doesn't use phone anymore.

Next the Ipad. Then the TV- she thinks the DVD player (which is old af btw) is dodgy, then the computer (windows 10) which needs updating- she thinks the update is dodgy. SO now she's only watching live TV (country from where she comes from); she doesn't like live TV from where we live now. 

I got a delivery the other day; she thinks the postman is a hitman- tells me not to go outside- I tell her its fine. 

She thinks cars passing our house is dodgy, thinks there are airplanes flying above- thinks they are dodgy too. 

There's so much more I can add; she breaks down crying for no reason sometimes, she worries for me and my father's safety- saying we're being tracked or something, saying our internet's dodgy, etc.. 

**From the start I wasn't sure, I thought she might have had a mental illness, but I wasn't sure. I'm fairly sure you guys can confirm with me that she does have one. I think it's delusion or paranoia, but it was triggered by an issue that was so small. I personally think the bullying event wasn't horrendous- I just think it took her beyond what she could deal with (she's dealt with far worse things)**

In the past she has had depression (20+ years ago) when she gave birth to my sibling; at that time when she forgot her bank details and couldn't get in- she accused my father of planning to take money and leave her with the baby (this was my dad's word- i wasn't born yet) 

**VERY IMPORTANT- this is what is very confusing about this whole situation. She isn't always illogical. She's normal at times- I don't know if she's hiding her feelings or acting, but I believe she is okay at times. When she calls her doctor, her parents, she sounds fine; so they might think she is fine, but really she has a lot of spells of paranoia** 

There is limited help we can get at the moment- my mother knows her mental state is not okay- at times her mental state is clearer- and she can sort of realise that her actions/words don't always make sense, but sometimes she just is out of it (memory unclear, depressed).

I don't know who we can call (COVID restrictions); but I'd prefer face-to-face consultations for her- and I'd like to explain to the doctor her situation- because I'm fairly sure she could act normal in front of doctors. But services are so limited- and a call is not going to help her

Do you ever catch yourself raising your voice so much because you have this twisting knife in your stomach telling you that you’re gradually losing somebody’s belief in what you’re saying and you feel like you need to scream because it’s the only way they won’t walk away and stop listening? That fear of somebody not believing you completely consuming any rational way of thinking that it makes you want to scream? 

I know it just sounds like I’m an adult throwing a temper tantrum like a toddler, but if that were the case I don’t think I’d be self aware directly after the instance occurred. I hope I did my best to describe this and maybe get some enlightenment without much judgement. Thank you for your time!"
1849,"TL;DR: [Seeking advice: 27F, new to mental health treatment] Therapist of a couple months referred me to an outpatient program. The assigned Therapist never showed up to the follow-up and psychiatrist was belittling.","
TL;DR: [Seeking advice: 27F, new to mental health treatment] Therapist of a couple months referred me to an outpatient program. The assigned Therapist never showed up to the follow-up and psychiatrist was belittling. 

-- 

(Forgive me in advance, this is an incredibly long post and dialogue; I've also made a TL;DR version too) I was seeing therapist for a couple of months (Beginning of May--late June) until she thought it was best for me to be in a more extensive program. I found her through my psychiatrist's referral list.

Being that I (27F) never explored mental health treatment/being on meds for the first time and building this connection with her, I trusted her judgement.

She referred me to an outpatient program. I'm in the process of the evaluations (saw the therapist and psychiatrist in the last 2 weeks) but, I feel so many red flags. I don't have a benchmark to compare these feelings with but, I just know when my gut doesn't feel right. 

Below is the extensive timeline of my treatment so far in the new program as of 07/07:

-07/07 As I was checking into my first appointment last week, the nurse in the front desk took my info and said, ""the therapist told you to arrive a half hour early to fill out paperwork"", She didn't. I never even spoke to her; I was speaking directly with their program director. After saying I wasn't informed of that, she ignored me.

-The appointment was fine. I thought it was nice of her to process my appointments right then and there before I left, both for my follow-up and  an appointment with the psychiatrist... until the day came, and I didn't receive an email with a virtual session invite nor a phone call. 

-Eventually I called her; she returned my call, saying that she ""must've forgot to confirm my appointment in her system""...... thankfully, I had a day off so, when she asked if I had any window of time open, I took it.

-Virtual meeting was fine (my previous therapist was remote so, I didn't mind it at all). She asked how I was feeling, I was talking through it... and then, suddenly, at 30 mins, she cuts me short and says ""were out of time"". I didn't realize it was only a half hour.

-This week was my psychiatrist appointment virtually at 10am. 10:10 rolls around; nothing. 10:30... so I call my therapist, pretty much politely asking wtf is going on. I'm working from home right now so, luckily it's not a time constraint. But, nonetheless, it's still wasted time.

-Ironically, a couple of minutes after leaving her a voicemail, I receive a text message - ""[Dr. John Smith] is inviting you to a video call"" with a link.  No email. I was immediately triggered to see a male doctor's name. I wouldn't have accepted this appointment if I knew it was a male psychiatrist so, I checked on the appointment card. The therapist put ""Dr. [Smith]""... no first name.
--&gt; (backstory): I'm a rape/sexual abuse and assault survivor practically half my life. So when the program director asked me, ""would you prefer to work with a male or female mental health professional?"" I said female. I felt bad for being picky but... I just knew I wouldn't feel as open/comfortable.

-We get on a video call (at this point, it's 10:45) and I immediately let him know that I told the program director I would happily wait until my providers were female only. He was taken aback after saying he wasn't informed by this, which I understood. And he said he'd call me back with some clarity. 

-After calling me back, ""emphasizing policy"", and how ""difficult it actually is to schedule an appointment as soon as I was able to"", if I can just do the initial evaluation with him and then they will advise a female psychiatrist after. I agreed as long as it meant they would make sure it was a female and I didn't mind how long it took.

-He's asking me questions, and cutting me off along the way... but what really set me off was when he asked me who referred me to their clinic. After mentioning, ""my previous therapist bc she felt, being I never been in the mental health space before, that I deserve more extensive support and care"", he asked, (dialogue below):

--

Dr.: ""what type of care did she expect you to get here?"" 

Me: ""support group, having therapist and psychiatrist all under 1 umbrella""

Dr.: ""I just don't understand what she means by ""support"". Who did you say you spoke to prior to scheduling your appointments again? 

Me: [Says program director's name]

Dr.: ""We don't know of that name (???). I just wonder what your previous therapists ""type of clientele"" is and what she expected for you in this.""

Me: ""I've never done any treatment as I said...-""

--

At this point, I'm on the verge of tears, confused, it's past 11:45 at this point/I have no idea how long this session was supposed even last, and I feel uncomfortable, so I proceeded with:
--

Me: ""--and I do want to see through other options, and decide what is the best care for me at this point.""

Dr.: ""Let me just make sure I am hearing you correctly... you don't know if you want to move forward with this clinic because, in the beginning, your expectations weren't met and you had a male psychiatrist?""

Me: ""No. That's not it.""

Dr.: ""So help me understand, please.""

So, I lost it:
Me: ""Not only that I wasn't listened to, but I told [program director] that I didn't mind waiting until a female was available, being a rape and trauma survivor.. And, now you're telling me that you have never even heard of her name.""

(As he tries cutting me off, I proceed)

""The therapist here even forgot to schedule me in last week; I had to call her. Our appointment today was over 30 minutes behind schedule. I don't know the appropriate jargon to use for my circumstance but I was referred here by my former therapist who clearly thought I deserved more after never being in treatment in life. And you comment on her clientele... I don't know how this all works but I just want to be in the right hands, which is very hard to tell where that is right now.""

He apologized for the comment, said he was ""thinking out loud""... I didn't accept the apology because you're a fucking psychiatrist. You're not my friend or colleague; and I don't know you enough to rationalize with anything you're saying. (Not to mention, when asking me if my feelings were covid-related or if I felt this way all my life, I shared with him that my grandma passed from covid in March. He didn't make a single comment of support, nor did my therapist). 

I haven't been able to sleep because I just feel so lost. I genuinely liked my former therapist despite only working with her a couple of months. As much as I appreciated her looking into this program for me and emphasizing the care I needed, that she couldn't give me because of the pandemic... I also felt neglected, and unworthy. And, those feelings are resurfacing. 

I don't know enough to know if I should power through the first few sessions or to walk away. I feel like I should suck it up and that I should feel lucky... while the other part of me feels like I'm being treated like shit and feel wrong for wanting more support. But, my gut feeling hasn't let me down ever, and I felt so uncomfortable.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. If you can provide any insight into your experience/know of others' experiences, I would appreciate anything you can share. If this really isn't right and should look into other programs, please let me know. Or, if I should just continue seeing my current psychiatrist and seek a new therapist? My current psychiatrist is absolutely wonderful... she's kind, actively listening to me all the time, explaining the processes/diagnoses to me thoroughly...

All I want to do is get better. I appreciate your time in reading this. 💛"
1850,Do you like yourself?,"My therapist asked me this today. I felt like it would be offensive to say yes, and clichéd to say no. I know I've been awesome in handling mental health and overcoming my fears but I can't use tangible terms to justify that to someone. But the question wasn't if someone else likes me, it was if I like myself. Why is this so hard. Can I say yes? I should be able to say yes. I value myself more now. I trust myself more. I take care of myself more than ever before. Do I like me? Hmmmm. I like me for being able to value myself. Is that enough of a reason to like me? I know my therapist is kind. I know she didn't ask me if I thought I was worthy of being liked."
1851,Help figuring out what I'm going through,"So I've had ""anxiety"" ever since I was little, but honestly I feel like that doesn't really explain what I'm going through. But I'll give you some background so were on the same page here.

When I was a kid, I used to be afraid of the dark, especially sleeping. I had these recurring thoughts that something bad would happen during the night, like I would be attacked by vampires or would get sleep paralysis (reading about SP really effed me up) and I would regularly try and ""avoid"" these things by sleeping in a certain way, like on my stomach or by avoiding certain times, like I couldn't go to sleep at 3am exactly. I would also say a prayer each evening since I come from a religious family, but had to stop since it got to a point where I had to say multiple prayers because I ""wasn't sure"" if I said it properly and it got pretty obnoxious. I was sure, always, but it didn't help. I've also had these feelings that if I think about certain stuff, like swimming or the sea when I go to sleep I might somehow drown or end up in the ocean, just by thinking about them. So I would try and avoid these thoughts.
 
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm no longer afraid of the dark really and quite ironically, I suffer from high-frequency sleep paralysis... But it's ok since it's usually not scary for me. However, I got hit by a much, much more severe episode of anxiety when I started college. Long story short, I became certain that I was developing schizophrenia or other permanent psychotic illness. So certain, that I would at points not sleep for a week straight and I completely lost my belief in a bright future. I was certain that my life was over.

Well, it wasn't, and I recovered just fine in a couple of months. But turns out, this theme was recurring: last year, I got a similar episode again, and spent another couple of months in a state of stress and hopelessness. Both episodes were accompanied by frenzied googling to calm myself. But hey, it did not calm me at all: the internet made it pretty clear I was going insane. In the end, I again recovered.
 
Right now, the reason I'm writing this, is that I'm going through a similar, but different theme. I've been kind of worried that we live in a simulation, and that the beings running the simulation would want to hurt me. I keep getting these nightmare scenarios in my head and find it hard to get rid of them, as I keep thinking that the simulators could make those scenarios happen. I get these violent and scary flashes that distress me and I feel like if I think about this too much they'll come true.

To make things clear: I do NOT believe any of this is happening. I'm simply worried over quite literally nothing.

Other quirks I've had: I sometimes get very worried in movie theaters and public transport etc. over silly things like someone there having a bomb. I'm sometimes afraid random people out there, like let's say beggars that I don't give money to or people I looked at funnily would follow me home and attack me. I have to check my whole apartment when I get home to make sure no one is there, and I often double check the front door. Sometimes I even look under my bed lol. I also regularly get worried about my home burning down so I often go the extra mile to unplug everything when I go to sleep or leave my home, often double checking everything.

Does anyone see a throughline here? Is it just ""unspecified anxiety""? Where could I look for help?

TL;DR - I get worried about random bad things happening to me or something/someone hurting me simply because I think about those things, or do something ""wrong"", and it causes me distress. I also often worry about ""going insane"". Does anyone know what I might be going through?"

1858,General issues with connection,"So, I recently got sober, 5 months and a day ago. When I was actively using, (everything in the book except PCP, for good reason), I sought some sort of psychiatry assessment, because many of my associates had called into question my mental well being, and I was starting to question it as well. Namely, I generally enjoy violence and suffering to a degree and take pleasure in other creatures' emotional and physical pain, yet I am conflict avoidant when possible because I realize that sacrificing my own comfort is not a viable option to me because I would detest nothing more than sacrificing my own self will. I was turned away on account of the fact that I was actively using, understandably that can cause issues with coming to a diagnosis. Since I have been sober, nothing has really changed. People who name me as their friend receive no trust from me, and I get annoyed with others if they can't deal with the realities of the world. I view all perceived weakness with disdain, but bring it up tactfully, tailored to the individuals personality to try to influence the persons behavior to better suit me, either through an alluring, appealing idea, or drawing parallels of their current thoughts to something that will cause a degree of revulsion. I still have noticed no change in empathy. For instance, there was a squirrel on the road and my friend and his gf went onto the other lane to avoid it. When the stupid thing ran at, instead of away from our direction of travel, they both freaked out and I just yelled ""Die!""  I know self diagnosing is a bad idea, but I am having my doubts about psychiatry, because even if I get a diagnosis of any kind, I can't see that it would help me in the least. I will still be the same person, with the same viewpoint, and a diagnosis would just put a name onto something that I am already aware of. Should I seek a diagnosis, or should I simply accept that I am me, whoever me is?"
1859,It seems like I need unhappiness,"my background: Ive had a troubled childhood; when I started working when I was 15 I got heavy panic attacks and some time later I was diagnosed with clinical depressions
I was in therapy for about 4 years, got antidepressants and made very good progress
Everytime that I get the feeling of depression I now know how to handle it and how to break out of the cycle of bad thoughts

Present day - I'm in my early 20s, I have a great job, a wonderful girlfriend and a small but good circle of friends

But every other day I start to question some aspect of my life, like ""I would rather be single"", ""I want a job where I have less hours/stress so I can focus on hobbies and working out"" or ""All my friends are so much luckier than me in life"" etc. etc. 

As I've mentioned before, I don't get stuck in these thought loops anymore but they still cost a lot of energy and change my mood for the worse

Thinking back to 16, 17 y/o me, I should be so happy with my current situation


Is it sign that I tell myself too much that I'm happy or that I must be happy? 
Is it a repercussion/byeffect of my depressions? 

Does anyone else have similar feelings?"
1860,Trying to figure out what happened to me?,"This particular thing happened about 3-4 times, twice I remember more vividly. Its really strange and I've tried looking it up but to no luck so if I could get some insights that'll be great.

There's like a beat in my ears/chest but it's not something I can hear, more feel. I don't think it's my heartbeat or pulse because it was going way too fast? It speeds up when I move even the slightest or when I hear something fast paced, so when it happened I did my best to not move at all. It sucks because it throws me off and makes me feel funny? I don't really know how to explain it but it's not a nice feeling. Sometimes it gets so fast it kind of mashes together into a incoherent mess. I get a little panicked and disoriented when it gets fast. 

The first time I went out to the living room looking for my parents for help I guess and they brought me a bucket saying I looked like I was going to throw up. I couldn't walk fast because of reasons above and kind of stared into space for the whole duration.

The second time I tried focusing on a spot and it sort of worked before I lost it again and for a period of time in that duration I had racing thoughts about the most random things that didn't even make sense.

Both times happened after I suddenly woke up and didn't stop until I fell asleep which probably would have been 15 minutes later?

So, yeah, thank you for getting this far. Any opinions would be appreciated."

Content with the company of myself. As I got older, I saw how other people acted and how they had friends and in the name of fitting in, I seeked the same relationships. This was an era of getting into trouble, doing things I'm definently not pround of and pretending to be someone who I absolutely wasnt. Although I've grown, I still carry some of the traits and habits developed since then. 

I really want to go back to the way it was. I feel like if I carried the same traits from back then I would be a lot happier and I would have more time to focus on my own already deteriorating mental health.
I love my friends from the bottom of my heart but I wish there was a way I could be around them without having to try so hard playing the role of ""the funny friend"" I've made for myself. I just want to go back the quiet earnest me. That could be around people and feel okay, not pressured and forced to be something I am not. 
But I don't want to upset anyone or make them feel like I don't love them anymore. I don't know what to do."

1881,I just don't know.,"I've realized that as I'm writing this some of this may not fit into the guidelines here and if so please take it down or let me know what to change.

As the title states.  I just don't know anymore.  


Let's start off with a bit of info,  
I'm 19 and I'm from Australia, NSW specifically. I've been seeing psychologists since i was 8? 9? I can't remember, my first psych wasn't doing much for me but I was too young to realize, I stopped seeing a psych for a few months before a case-worker recommended me to someone, saw them for a little and then drifted away from them. I've been seeing my current psych for... a few years now and in that time or what I'm coming to realize is that in that time I've grown to trust this person and found that they're the only person I feel safe enough and comfortable enough opening up too fully and actually trying to be fucking okay. I'm also leaving school at the end of this year and I am completely stumped and feel at a loss with what to do, I am well aware that most people feel like this, that doesn't help. School has been my life-line over the past 3 1/2 years as I've had the privilege to attend an amazing school that I could talk up for days. I've been looking for a job since I was 14/15 trying to get a job anywhere with little to nothing to show for it.   


I have mental health issues which contribute to all of the below, those being Clinical Depression and Anxiety, when I was younger I was diagnosed with O.D.D however that has been disputed and remains something to be discussed at a later date. My main issue at the moment is that I am genuinely done with living with depression, because no matter how many days in a row I may have that I don't feel like absolute shite, depression's always fucking waiting around the corner to fucking ruin my month or week or day, anxiety stops me from doing most things, if I push myself through them I find that I am able to do them even if I feel like my blood pressure is through the roof and my knees are shaking like when I MC'd at my school's Anzac day ceremony most of the time looking back or even afterwards I realize that they were well worth doing, for whatever reason that may be. However I just... I don't want to live with mental health any more, I'm so fucking over it and I don't even have anything that bad, my best friend has Schizophrenia and I've been there for them at some if not most of their worst and I know that in comparison my struggles are fucking nothing but I just do not think I am strong enough or capable with dealing with mental health anymore. I don't want to and I don't think I can.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are that I feel like there's no escape. I have or I feel like I have so many issues and that I just don't know where to go or what to do, I feel no where near capable to be any sort independent let alone competent however my psych feels as though I've made a tremendous amount of progress over the years. (I'm self hating and realize that I cannot see when I've made progress due to the fact that I feel that any progress I make is never enough or is inadequate.) However I feel as though I've made none as though I will never be able to just be .... just be okay? just be fucking normal. My psych believes that we should be working towards ending therapy. That terrifies me, it feels like another person abandoning me. Even so, I wouldn't be able to continue seeing them in a few weeks anyway as they're becoming fully qualified which means an increase in rates, and whilst I realise that our state or country has a mental health care plan that allows me 6-10 free/rebated visits depending on the place, my mind sees it as the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no drive. I cannot see myself going out and getting a job, I only try because I feel as though it's what I'm supposed to do, I'm on government support now as I'm still a student and it is... barely enough to survive but it works. I've had a trial at a restaurant/fast-food mix sort of place and I was on the verge of a panic attack. I've done work experience in an office and I feel so out of place and like I'm going to be yelled at or like I'll get into trouble for anything I do. I feel as though I may not be cut out for working, though I keep trying to get a job as to not let others down.

&amp;#x200B;

School has been a life-line for me and now that it is ending I feel as though I have nothing to do with myself, It was my safe-space... I suppose, somewhere I could just exist, Fuck me I know i haven't done much if any work over the last three years, most definitely contributing to my startling lack of work ethic, low motivation and lack of being able to not procrastinate. However it provided somewhere for me to be, somewhere to make friends and have good times. Somewhere, I was allowed to grow without the fear... well without the expectations of anything on me. Now I don't think i will have anything to leave the house for, let alone get out of bed for.  


My memory. It is ... terrible, I don't know why and I struggle with it on a daily basis, it makes me feel like a terrible friend and trips me up in life so much. I need and want to fix it but I don't think I can. It affects everything above, on a small or large scale it doesn't matter because it's an issue that affects every single part of my life. It's so bad that I can barely remember what I did this morning without having to sit and think hard, I can't remember what I did a day ago without having to recount and I can barely remember basic details about my closest friends. It's terrifying.   


In conclusion, I don't know what the fuck to do anymore, fuck I never did I don't think but at least I had to be somewhere doing something, whereas now it's all up to me and I don't think that's a thing that should be up to me, I just wish someone could tell me what would work for me, what field I should go into or job. I'm done with most of what life has to offer. I don't think I even want to try to improve myself anymore, I just think that the easiest thing to do would be the best thing to do. If only I could get the god damned courage to do it."

1884,I NEED to take care of myself NOW but I can‘t seem to get over bad coping mechanisms.,"I’ve been diagnosed with a degenerative illness recently and I’ve been prescribed sessions with a physiotherapist and to do a specific regular physical activity every day. 

If I don’t do that, my health will deteriorate and the illness will speed up its pace instead of being in control, which is something I can obtain with just what’s has been prescribed for the time being.

I am fully aware that I need to take control and care about my body NOW, but I just can’t.
I suffer from PTSD and GAD and I’m on therapy and medication. But this is something completely unexpected. 

The idea of physically taking care of my body makes me feel utterly humiliated, which is an emotion that stems from my childhood and my relationship with my mother. My mother deeply humiliated and abandoned me in regards to health issues and particularly my body. 
My way to cope with these feelings is to completely ignore and avoid the problem. 

I need to get over this but I am very aware I cannot do it with a snap of my fingers. I am really reluctant to navigate these emotions because they also bring a lot of rage and helplessness with them.

Having been the only child I generally got what I wanted and never had anything wrong with my life I guess... I have this anxiety thing maybe? I just can’t finish anything to the point that it’s effecting my university courses. I, maybe I’m just being lazy like my mother tells me. I’ve never told anyone but I have this feeling like no matter what I do I’ll just fail anyway and so what’s the point of even putting in effort so I run away. Maybe I’m just making excuses and I’m just lying to myself to make myself feel better and trying to find some excuse that something is wrong so I feel less guilty. I keep trying to run away and this is like I’m repeating myself over and over but I feel so stupid and I’m running away by being addicted to reading online books to stop myself thinking. Which is stupid and just digs a bigger hole to put myself in. I don’t know what I want to do in the future I cannot see myself anywhere, my friend.. (I guess I should also say here that I’m terrible at making long-life friends and keeping a good connection especially online. I can say that I only have one friend. Which I lie to my parents and when they joke (maybe?) that I have no friends) My friend has a direction in life and has a boyfriend, a part-time job and has moved into a share house and hearing all that made me realised how stuck and useless and lazy I was. I’m still at home, I don’t go out with friends (moved back to Japan from Australia for uni but have been overseas for over 10 years) I don’t even have a part-time job nor experience. Who’s gonna want to hire me? What am I even doing with my life. I sometimes... I’m not to the point that I wanna die but I really feel so stupid but lazy and selfish and I’m a mess, wasting my parents’ money in raising me and giving me a good education. I don’t know how to get out of this state that I hate. Why am I even like this? Is something wrong with me or is that just an extra delusion I made to make myself feel better... maybe I’m just whining."

A few years ago I developed general anxiety and started didn't do anything about it for a while. During this time I always felt at least a degree of anxiety which pretty much left me never feeling excitement about anything.

However about about a year ago I finished my sertraline (I was on it for about 1.5 years) and I now feel fine (almost). I don't really get anxiety at all anymore beyond a few minor situations/normal levels of nerves at times but it's a healthy amount. This is great and quality of life is miles better for me now other than the fact that I don't seem to get as excited about anything anymore like I did before I ever had anxiety. 

I can't tell if it's just the fact that I'm 25 now and I developed it when I was 21 and at university so it's just a pretty normal adult transition or if it's a residual effect of anxiety.

Has anyone else had this happen to them? if so how did you get excited again?"

1894,Are there any crisis hotlines that are not non-personal?,"I want to talk to a real person, not someone following a script of questions"
1895,Vioce in my head,Say “im a god” all the time but it just pisses me even more to the point where i want to cease to exist i feel like they are trying to reinfarnate me Into another person so ill suffer more than life i have. I hate the vioces and want them to fuck off. If i where with them in irl i would murder them sometimes they spin my head sideways To the point where i start shouting punching walls telling them to fuck off They say negative shit to me for no reason and just want to cease to exist. If i die ill make sure i do. If im conscious when im dead fuck god.
1896,Faking positivity til you make it?,"I have depression and have been sarcastic and sad for most of my adult life. It's draining for those around me.

If I were to just start ""faking"" being happy, being positive etc, would it eventually rub off and start feeling real? For example, I got a text from a friend today asking how I was. I wrote back, ""I'm great, I'm hugging my dog!""

It wasn't a lie. I just chose not to tell her that I was hugging my dog because I was heavily depressed and crying in bed.

Ive been told to fake it til I make it at work (in relation to going up the corporate ladder), but would the same saying work for faking happiness?"
1897,"post-ECT headache, any advice appreciated!!","22F, bipolar 1 with psychotic features

so i’ve had ECT twice in the past week (right unilateral) and the entirety of the day after i’ve had such an excruciating headache i’m bed-bound, crying, and dry heaving. this is even after prophylactics (IV zof, toradol, tylenol, ice pack) 

what should i do? are there any better solutions anyone can think of? i know i can’t be that patient who asks for like fentanyl for a headache that’s super sketchy...i don’t wanna quit on ECT but it’s seriously so unbearable."
1898,Create,I have recently started my new company called positive striders. Its based around making positive change around the world helping people with difficulties (mental health stress depression struggling) males females young kids adults homeless people black or white etc. The aim is to try and do something new to spread awareness and to spread the message and positivity. Most teenagers and parents always go through the same thing counsilors and etc it doesn't work. SO we want something new. Any creative wanna collaborate reply. Or insta dm positive_striders
1899,I only feel Empathy when I'm stoned,"It's really weird and fucked up but I'm pretty much dead to the core till I have a smoke and suddenly all this emotion comes rushing to me. 

I pretty much find it impossible to feel anything for anyone when I'm sober and it's starting to become pretty detrimental to my day to day life. 

I've cut down my smoking loads recently which is probably why it's really starting affect me, but this has been a recurring problem since I was about 16, I'm 21 now. 

Anyone experienced this or have any advice?"

July is going to be majorly about Minority Mental Health Month at Tickle. Life! Here is all that you need to know.

The National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month is marked for every July since 2008.

Recognising the work of Bebe Moore Campbell, an American author, journalist, teacher, and an advocate of mental health needs of the Black community and other underrepresented communities, the National Minority Mental Health Month was designated to further the mission.

I can across this [podcast](https://www.tickle.life/podcast/mental-health-and-well-being/?utm_source=soc&amp;utm_medium=rddt&amp;utm_campaign=21JSS) how Gurmat spiritual wisdom can enable mental well-being when dealing with the daily struggles of life through transcendence of the sense of self."
1901,Vraylar reatlessness?,"I have hardly slept in days and when I try, I get overwhelmingly anxious and my heart rate is raised. I have gotten to sleep a few times and when I do, I wake up within 30 minutes to an hour and then I wake up and my body is so SO tired but my brain is wide awake. They just switched me to Vraylar instead of seroquel because seroquel was making me gain too much weight. I’m on 3mg of vraylar.

1906,Unable to hold a job. Scared.,"I’m 27[F] and I’ve been struggling with my mental health for most of my life. I have BPD, severe anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. I’m also currently dealing with tapering off my benzodiazepine medication as it is affecting my life negatively and severely. I’m unable to work, I feel sluggish/sick/more depressed. 

I’ve quit several jobs over the past year because of my mental health and I believe the symptoms of my medication making me feel horrible. I simply feel as if I cannot work until I get things under control. I’ve been denied once for disability, I’m willing to try again. I do have to have income, but working seems impossible. 

I JUST got another job and I don’t want to quit but I just don’t think I can do it. I can’t concentrate, I’m falling asleep on the job, etc. and I need to get things under control. However, my boyfriend is very tough on me and has this “toughen up, buttercup” mentality. He knows that I struggle, but he doesn’t seem to sympathize with me. He really wants to see me change my situation. I’m afraid that if I quit this job, he’ll leave me. It’s not a matter of me just being lazy. When I was unemployed, all he did was haggle me every day about getting a job. 

What should I tell him? Should I tell him how debilitating these symptoms are and that he needs to understand? Any recommendations as to what I should do about my job? Should I try to reapply for disability? 

Thank you."

1909,I’m way to insecure,"Before I begin, I just want to say that I don’t have any kind of diagnosis in terms of mental health.

I think and dwell a little too much on two certain questions: Am I smart, and am I creative, and if I’m not, can I somehow increase my smartness and creativity? I don’t know if this rules as being insecure, since I’m not that well versed in psychology, so I was hoping to get some help here. I am highly idealistic, and I wish to somehow make a mark on the world(I know that it sounds ridiculous, just bear with me), and for that I need to have a high level of creativity and intelligence, which I’m afraid that I probably don’t have, hence the insecurity. I focus way too much in these kinds of thoughts, and I wish too not think about it that much, and sometimes I really don’t think about it, but I feel that there’s always those kinds questions somewhere in the back of my head. As for the intelligence part, I kinda got over it, and at the moment, I don’t dwell on it too much, but ever since I stopped thinking about it a lot, I have now started questioning my creativity. And that got me thinking: am I always going to question these things? If I jumped on questioning my creativity so fast after I got over the fact that I may not be smart, I fear that even if I stop asking myself the question:”Am I creative enough?”, and move on, would I just find another thing to feel bad about? I’m hoping for someone to help me with this, thanks in advance"
1910,"So uh, i don't really know why i self harm.","I mean i am not in a good place and i got bad coping mechanisms but i don't really know if that's one of them. I have bulimia so i can spot how the self hatred cycle is causing the bulimia but i don't see that when i self harm?

The first time i self harmed was in a ""eh why not"" way and since then i cut myself for no reason whatsoever. Had a good day? Eh why not. Had a bad day? Eh why not.

I guess it's like biting my nails at this point.

I even try to make the one patch of thigh that I exclusively cut have a bit of a pattern.

Idk is this a problem? I'm not exactly sure about it."

1912,How to love your blackness,"I’ve talked on this topic before but it seems my post has disappeared so I rewrote it.

Basically I have a very hard time seeing beauty in black people at times and in myself as a black person and for years I’ve wished I could be ANY race but black. I have seen immense beauty in black people before but...I still feel really ugly. I have a hard time with accepting my skin tone (I’m brown/light brownish) and wish I was light skin. I am able to see the beauty in a variety of different skin tones, but for some reason, I always find deep, dark, rich skin tones most beautiful on other races/ethnicities especially those in Asia. I don’t want to admit that I just hate “looking black” like there’d be no doubt in anyone’s mind that I’m black. If I looked differently, I’d have no problem with my skin tone...I’d still want different hair though-I also have trouble accepting my hair texture which is extremely thick, 3c/4a/4b low porosity mixture and have had many breakdowns while doing it. I  almost ripped my hair out of anger before. Though I do enjoy having big thick hair...there’s so much I wish I could do with my hair that I can’t do with this texture. I love alternative fashion and crazy hairstyles like mullets and wild buzz cuts on finer/straight textured hair. It just sucks and I feel so limited. I know that type 4 hair is versatile, but I feel like that’s in regard to different braided hairstyles which I’m not interested in. And I’m not interested in wigs AT ALL. I also hate to admit that I sometimes struggle to see beauty in 4c hair...when I see people with 4c hair, I really wish I could admire it and see it as beautiful, but I just don’t. I’m so unsatisfied with my blackness and the way I look, but it’s not just because of the physical, it also has to do with how hated and misunderstood we are in society. I hate being apart of a hated race, being afraid to go outside at times with the things going on these days, being TERRIFIED of a police encounter just because I’m black. I figured having educated myself on a plethora of black issues would help me with this...but I still feel the same. I know that there’s nothing I can do to change these things about myself, nor do I want to, ( I’m not interested in plastic surgery, hair manipulation, or skin bleaching) i just want to learn to love and accept these things about myself, and other black people. I just don’t know where to start. This is making it very hard for me to even try to love myself. I’ve only been able to cry and feel this sort of void in me at how much I hate looking this way."
1913,Do you feel completely repulsed and disappointed with your art,"I draw and I'm in an art course. Technically I think there's nothing wrong with my art. I always get praised for it and I know in my head that I'm not terrible. Just that everytime I draw or something I am utterly disgustedd at what I am doing. I feel like I'm genuinely doing something worthless and my art will never improve, so why am I even TRYING. Like I should stop insulting myself and the world and put down the pen. I never finish an art piece as a result. The backlash I get from just making and seeing my art is so intense. This visceral disgust and sometimes flashbacks to certain things. The flashback s make me spiral and when I finally stop drawing, I feel DEPRESSED. And it stays for the rest of the day. I don;t know if this is even the right place to post, I'm sorry. I wonder how low my self-esteem actually is. Probably lower than I can even fathom. Help? haha

Also feel like I'm not only doing something wrong, I;m just wrong as a person. It's an automatic reaction. I'd like to go about life normally without feeling guilty for doing nice things. "

1915,A letter to anyone who needs it.,"A letter to anyone who needs it,

Breathe.... Take a second and breathe.. focus on your surroundings, the colour of the floor, the temperature of the air.. the ambient noise humming away in the back ground. 
And just breathe...
Big deep breaths, feel your body loosen, your mind untangle, your heart slow to a steady pace. You're okay. You may not always be okay. You might not have been okay for a good old while. But that doesn't mean you can't be okay right now. That doesn't mean you won't be okay again. 
And sometimes..okay is okay.
You haven't got to be at the height of happiness to feel... happy...
You are loved. Wanted. Needed. Essential. Matter. Important. Trusted. Cared for. 

You will be missed. Potentially more than you'll ever know. Hopefully you'll never find out just how much.. 

You may be the one hand holding another from drowning. Even though you're struggling to keep your head above water.
 
A letter from me to you.


This was a piece of writing I done, for myself.. to try and get my to keep my head above water. I then decided to share with a few friends who I know are struggling and they suggested I share it further. So.. I'm trying to have as big an impact as I can with my simple writing. Stay strong, stay fighting, I love you all."
1916,Inter-generational trauma caused by recent events has put me in a bad mental state,"I am the grandson of Holocaust survivors. The recent actions taken by Trump to put federal law enforcement officials in Portland, along with threatening to deploy them in other cities like Chicago, New York, etc., have triggered a feeling of intergenerational trauma that is scaring me and pushing my anxiety to extremely high levels. It is making me think of Hitler’s rise to power, how the Gestapo enforced his policies, and how my grandparents did not escape in time and endured several years of hiding from the Nazis to avoid being killed. Now, my anxiety is making me think I need to flee the country before it is too late and avoid what my grandparents went through. Is this sort of trauma abnormal? Because the political situation is largely out of my control (I will most certainly be voting for Biden, but I live in New York which will be blue no matter what), I am scared of this turning into a modern-day version of Nazi Germany. I recognize that the notion of concentration camps being formed is probably absurd, and I often find myself buying into the hysteria on Twitter, but the thought of Trump establishing any form of dictatorship shakes me to my core and brings up the horrifying stories that my grandparents have told me. How do I snap out of this and carry on with my life?"
1917,"Being told that I fake my problems and am just lazy, led to possibly the worst blind rage I've ever had, I actually punched things.","I just got told that I’m just lazy and years of trauma that haunt me everyday were belittled to “That’s a bullshit excuse, how DARE you blame your parents for that, you have some nerve criticizing your mother's parenting skills!""

That was said by my grandmother over the phone, because everyone has been yelling and arguing, and my mom called HER mom and told her about it.

Some background information.

6 years ago, I turned 18 and finished high school (I'm 24 now). I was terrified of driving, and we lived far out in the country. My mom refused to ever drive me to try and get a job, even when she had to go into town anyway. I tried walking,I tried biking, I physically couldn't make it after a few hours of still not arriving into town.

I gave up and resorted to sitting in my room, spending nearly every waking hour on Internet surveys making any money I could to save in the bank. I had a couple thousand dollars already given to me over the years growing up, but my dad (who my mom divorced and I didn't, and never would stay with) wouldn't sign the rights over to me. I was 18, the bank said without him signing it over, I couldn't gain access to my account until I was 21. He eventually signed it over out of desperation thinking it'd make me forgive him for years of abuse (I guess that's why?) and used that money to LEAVE.

Long story short, I ended up nearly homeless, lacking the resources to become independent so suddenly, and other family took me in.

A few months later, my family moves into civilization so I move back (because at my other family's it was a tiny podunk town and everyone started harassing me, so why the hell would I stay when I could leave and start over again?).

I had been having rage outbursts since around the time I was 18? They progressively got worse, until I got another medication added to my drug cocktail. That was this January, my rage was suppressed, I had no outbursts and at worst got annoyed instead of really angry. Until today.

My grandmother said because I criticized my mom for not being willing to drive me into town to try and get a job, I needed to move the fuck out right now. She said my (less than $10 an hour bottom level service job) savings were big (because apparently a few thousand dollars somehow overrules the fact that the money will drain into the negative soon without a STEADY SOURCE OF INCOME) and I could (magically?) afford an apartment or a room.

If I'm lucky enough to get 40 hours every week for a whole month, I barely scratch $1,200. The cheapest apartment I could find around is $850 a month. That would leave $350 a month left to spend, IF I actually got a full forty hours every week.

I started community college at the beginning of this year, but not completely sure of the major I chose, still full of uncertainty and directionless. I don't even know how school is going to go this year because of the c-virus (I don't know if I can say that here). 

If it remains completely online, that means continued struggle to stay focused, less chance to get out of this dysfunctional house, and continued isolation. Although even when I went to school, after years of bullying, abuse, and isolation, I was very to myself, didn't make any friends, too insecure about my life status to even try and make friends (24, still at home, haven't had a REAL, or even just decent job that wasn't temporary, don't have my driver license).

Some people would talk to me, and I'd talk, whether they talked to me first, or I did first . But no kind of friendship or anything developed. It regularly felt like going to campus instead of online (before online was made mandatory) was pointless for me, but it was still better than sitting at home, it was at least easier to focus, and I guess some social interaction was better than nothing?

I plan to continue this fall, even if it is just online, but still not too sure about my chosen major. I'm also now being severely pressured to move out way before I can even remotely support myself (yes, I know, I'm 24, part of this whole problem is my late start in life, and unfortunately no matter how late you start, there is no shortcut or quickstart).

My dad would come to practice driving with me (my mom can't because of a panic disorder, which I accept, and step dad is gone most of the time for work, like weeks at a time, and so far despite the not so long ago major abuse, he's been the best driving teacher for me) but the abuse never completely stopped, even after he sobered up. I can't deal with him, even my sister who is younger than me wants nothing to do with him anymore. He's an idiot, he can't comprehend why he's being ignored (or acts like he doesn't know why). 

His belittling comments never stopped, mocking me for being afraid of trying new medications, mocking me for just recently starting to learn how to drive (it was a huge deal for me), threatening to cut me off of his health insurance if I make him mad (he has to pay for my sister and let me stay on so far because his plan only requires him to pay for one child) and just being an unreasonable asshole.

So I'm down at least one person who I can practice driving with. But after today, it's possible my step dad will be mad at me again, and his rage is even worse than mine (and if mine was gone for awhile, and came back, even on medication that kept it away for the longest time, his can come back too) I will have NOBODY to practice with.

I'd still rather not have to drive, so I'll likely try to live around it, when I can live on my own, moving to a walking/transit friendly place, relying on Uber/Lyft. 

I GENERALLY feel a lack of reason to do anything without anyone forcing, or at least encouraging me to.

So the event today, was my grandmother (on the phone) telling me that BECAUSE I told my mom how I was still upset that years ago when I had no transportation, she refused to drive me so I could try and get a job and start making money, my grandmother told me that JUST BECAUSE OF THAT, I needed to IMMEDIATELY MOVE OUT, because I ""had a lot of nerve"" telling my mom ""that she was a terrible parent"" (I didn't say that).

Being stuck in that house 24/7 for a whole 2 years haunts me every day to this day, I am traumatized and have feared having to choose between going back to that or being homeless (which I also almost ended up when I tried to get out on my own) and I'm miserable and have severe mood swings EVERY DAY.

I get DISGUSTED with myself, I feel like I'm just incompatible with the entire female human race (back in grade school, I was constantly bullied and told how ugly I was, and I've been told that even more online when I had the balls to post a picture and ask how I look), I think about how if I end up homeless I want to immediately get a gun and shoot myself or jump off a building or run into a highway........

I have all kinds of disturbing thoughts, I rapidly swing between feeling ok, even hopeful, and depressed, angry.

I now know that I can still have rage outbursts on this medication, I guess my tolerance is just higher. But being told that I CHOSE to stay in my room and I was just lazy, when the truth is something that I'm haunted and traumatized by EVERY SINGLE DAY, I just lost it. I snapped. 

My vision went blurry (not blind, just blurry) I felt immediately taken over, worse than ever before, I punched stuff, not even thinking about doing it, and yelled at the top of my lungs, I think I sounded like a screeching animal. I felt nothing but pure rage just taking over me and controlling me for a minute or so, like a wild animal or something.

If this happened in public, or my grandparents were actually HERE when I blew up like that, I know I'd be in jail, and probably forced to undergo a psych evaluation. And then the doctors would want to give me more pills that would cause permanent dysfunctions like PSSD (already scared I'll get that when/if I get off of all the meds I'm on now) and treat me like a disobedient child for refusing to take them, I don't know if they can physically force yoy or not. But I'm already on medications that I've taken for many years, you can't just abruptly stop, probably even worse to do that AND ABRUPTLY START other medication, but I don't trust psych staff to give a shit. My psychiatrist just wants to pop me full of pills, disregarding non-psych meds I took that could cause interactions, that's just modern American psychitry, and hiding potential side effects, long-term risk or not....

I don't feel guilty of how I got today, I think my grandmother OWES ME an apology, and I'm now a little more worried that that rage is still inside of me, I literally can't control it, it's pretty terrifying, and obviously it can overpower medication that I was given to suppress that.

I don't want to go to prison, or a psych hospital, or to hurt anyone, I'm afraid one day I'll do something I majorly regret, and feel it is LITERALLY not me and LITERALLY out of my control.

As far as the girlfriend and sex thing, I know I'm in no position to worry about that right now, but as a 24 year old male virgin who's never had a girlfriend, it does really make me feel like shit. People like to act like it's abnormal to desire companionship and intimacy, and like being massively told how worthless and ugly I am shouldn't hurt me.

I also fear at the idea of having a girlfriend who pisses me off and the switch just flipping, and, you know.

I'm such a screwed up mess.

I wouldn't even have any reason to go on if I was homeless, I'd want to suicide right away, because I have absolutely nothing to live for if I end up homeless (and barely now).

She also said that I just sleep all day, despite previously acknowledging how I went to school (unclear how that’s going this fall because of that cv thing that I can’t say) and regularly work 30-40 hours a week, AND try to learn how to drive, but apparently suddenly I just sleep all day......"
1918,I just feel alone and its nothing to do with lockdown,"A few months before schools were closed in the UK, i managed to get into a good friendship group.  For the past 4 years (since year 8) id been with one girl mainly and i enjoyed it the first year but after that i regretted it all and felt as if i couldnt leave because id have nobody.  After ages i finally started sitting on a different table and everyone there is so nice and i just get on with them well and id known all of them at least slightly before that and had been best friends with a couple before i met the other girl.  But i still feel as if im not accepted and i feel simply tolerated.  Year 10 was such a dark year for me and when i opened up to one of the best friends i had since year 7 he just didnt seem to care at all and it kinda broke me.  Last week they were doing a socially distant meet up in one of their gardens and i didnt respond to the message until last minute because i felt like they didnt actually want me there and that it wasnt meant for me but responded as if they were happy about it.  But its not just by friends, its by family too.  I sometimes try to speak to my mum and she doesnt hear me at all because shes just on facebook or strava or whatever and i feel alone but shes not always like that it just stands out to me more when she does.  For a week in lockdown i didnt go on my phone to message people or anything - i only answered my grandad’s skype calls.  Nobody else even notixed becayse its always me starting conversations.  I feel like im not good enough."
1919,My Journey: Confessions and I am sorry to those I hurt.,"I've literally hit rock bottom and I thought I hit rock bottom before. I managed to sever ties with about 4 people in the span of a month. Unfortunately, I struggled (and still do struggle) with anger issues, chronic anxiety, depression, insomnia due to perpetual rumination, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and....\*breathes in\* Body dysmorphic disorder. So, instead of being consistent with treatment I jumped from relationship to relationship (boyfriends). HORRIBLE DECISION. I lost countless nights of sleep worrying about not getting a text back and became super obsessive with my ""favorite person"" of the month. I used to be very attractive and hyperfocused but because I became OBSESSED with my Ex...I lost focus of what truly mattered, dropped out of school, and couldn't keep a job because I prioritized him first (crazy, I know). My immune system isn't the greatest now due to the stress and lack of sleep, I ruined other relationships, and I finally seen the light today: people, you DO NOT NEED A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND TO BE HAPPY. And if you become obsessed with a dude you are dating, distance yourself from him! DO NOT DATE HIM. I'm serious. Both my ex and I had a tumultuous relationship. It was absurd and a colossal waste of time.  I hope I can recover from my disorders through therapy and develop strong relationships with other people. On top of that I wasn't kind to my family and close friends. I regret my behaviors. But there's no future in dwelling in the past. Just got to move forward and never neglect therapy. ALSO, I tended to engage in behaviors such as oversharing (with friends and acquaintances). 

If you are struggling with your mental health and believe me I am too. You are not alone. Together, we can change for the better. Also, I suffered with love-addiction and fear of abandoment. The harsh reality I came across today was that I am better off alone (at least for now and for a long time). I feel like I'm too unstable and not pretty enough for romance at the moment. But that's a harsh reality I need to come to terms with. The loss of beauty and potential and money due to becoming obsessed with somebody and having mental health issues. Treating other people poorly, especially family members...This is my karma. But now I am choosing to be kind, be consistent with therapy and treat others with the respect they deserve."

1926,So the I've been having about the worst internet experience ever and experiencing the worst anxiety ever.,"This may not surprise some people but it's because of some people on tumblr (yes, that whatever you wanna call it site) and I'm specifically anxious for someone, a friend who was being slandered by some other people who made a post about them and are unwilling to communicate and maturely resolve the issue and I've just fucking had it.

I'm not gonna go into detail about it but the worst thing about it is that I don't have a reason to be anxious. My friend doesn't care about it anymore because they were wrong, she's gotten no hate and only support, which is good, but it's still effecting me quite a bit. I think it's because I associate with and support this person is what's causing the anxiety. But it's hard for me to stop dwelling on things and I just feel so tired from all the anxiety from what was said about them and what some people think about our friend circle. I think it's that I'm trying so hard to empathize with both sides of the situation that it's taking a toll on me. But another thing that's frustrating is that all the """"drama""""is already done and there's nothing we can do about cause my friends done all she can to defend herself and so have I.

I'm tired all day, I just want to sleep, and I barely want to eat anything and my family gets a bit worried cause I'm never like that. This is the third time I'm going through this involving the same people having to do with the same petty thing: differing opinions.(except last time it was worse cause it felt like physical pain and I couldn't be happy about anything)

This is also in a fandom so I usually use the series I love as a bit of comfort when I'm in a bad mood but now I can't even do that cause it's hard for me to love it without thinking of their bullshit and it's kinda ruined for me for now. And that really fucking sucks. I feel sick and want to cry.

 I don't know what else to do, when I'm in this state it's something I just have to wait out until it completely goes away which takes about a week. I am taking a break from tumblr obviously (and I've even thought about deleting it) but I don't want to be alone with my thoughts and feelings and I'm just trying to figure them out and wait for them to go away.

Has anyone else experienced anxiety like this?(also thank your for reading all the way down here u didn't have to)"

1930,Disappointed at the Dr,"Hi all. I just created a new account because my old account was my real name and I wanted to be able to share anonymously about my mental health and sobriety struggles. 

Anyways.. I quit drinking in January, (6 months and change sober!) and have been really struggling with suicidal thoughts and anxiety the last few months. I think the alcohol was numbing it and being sober is just shining a spotlight on the issue. Today I went to the dr to see about getting some kind of medication because I can't keep living like this. As the nurse was doing the depression screening one of the questions was ""Do you have thoughts of self harm or negative thoughts towards yourself and if so how often"", I answered truthfully ""yes, everyday"". The nurse put the clipboard down and said, 'wow, I'm so surprised by that. You look so beautiful and put together"". I felt so gaslighted. idk if that's even the right term. Like you can't look at me and tell I'm depressed?? that's not how it works man. The Dr herself was really nice, and it's fine.. I just needed to vent. It made me feel like I'm making it up or something and that made me feel even worse about myself. 

Thanks for listening &lt;3"

1932,"I guess, does this count as a sadness/grief flair. I feel so fucking stupid. So, at 3:30am. I couldn’t sleep. I think I need help so I searched up a psychiatrist in Japan. It’s fucking expensive. Then I guess I just broke down I guess.","Edit: changed flair to venting. 

I (21f) who should be independent already and isn’t. I’ve had this horrid undiagnosed mindset since high school ended I think. And I though recently, enough is enough. I need help. So I researched for a psychiatrist or a therapist or something but they are so expensive in Japan. Costs like about $200 dollars for a single appointment.  I can’t afford it nor can I ask my parents. My dad recently had a stroke and he went to the icu and everything. I don’t want to be even more of a burden. Then I just thought. If I wasn’t born then my parents would have lived a much better life. With the dog, they could have lived without having to spend so much money wasting it to give me education overseas. I’m such a ducking waste of space and money that could have been saved for their retirement. And if I were to die I’d be even more of a waste of money. Then I started crying. 

 So now I’m sitting feeling sorry for myself and venting here to strangers...

1933,I need help please,"Hello everyone, first of all, I just want to say that my case is not that important I know there is people that have bigger problems than me but I just think I need help this time as I don't want my worries/problems to be bigger.

So I am a teenager and I am looking for help from you Reddit. I don't want to see a therapist for now because I think my problems are not that big but I know that I need your help since I can't do it myself unfortunately.

I feel really really alone and I feel like I'm missing out on my teenagehood since I don't see my friends, don't go to parties and look at the stock market all day.

I don't go to parties not because I don't want to or my parents won't let me go but because I am not invited. And look, i know that's some 16year old shit but man that hurts knowing I'm home alone looking at stocks. I hope I will be happy of it someday but right now I am feeling sad. 

I have awful social skills to. I would love to just see someone and just go say hello, but I can not. I have been rejected more times than I can count. I just want someone to love in my life, someone that would just care about me like I care about them. I think this would help me but I am scared to find out if it's true or not because then it that won't help me, what would I be looking forward to thinking it would help me ? 

I don't know what I need to not feel so sad. 

I know those are just some 15year old problems but I just need advice and a bit of support I can't get anywhere else. 
Thank you for your time"

1936,my cat died who has been a part of my entire life.,"Okay so im a 16 year old boy and i had a cat named Lalli. 

Lalli was 15 years and 6 moths old, he was my best friend and when i say it i truly mean it. 

2 days ago i wake up in the morning and my mom tells me that Lalli hasnt eaten any food in the entire night and i should go check up on him. i go downstairs and see that he is just laying down on the ground and being very apathetic, concerned i demand that we take him to the vet and at the vet they told us that Lalli had a massive tumor in his stomach, and that there is a surgery they could try but it is expensive and there is such a little chance that he would survive the surgery that we would have to sign a paper that they can euthanise him if the surgery wont work. 

my parents made the choice that we will euthanise Lalli so he wouldnt be in any pain anymore.

i watched my cat my best friend die in my arms, and it has been the worst thing ever to happen to me ever. 

i have been crying nonstop 2days and i cant even be in my house, because everything reminds me of him in someway, Lalli was so close to me compared to my family and i have noticed that i cared so much more about him than my family.

he was my best friend, he always was there for me and he used to spend all his time in my room with me. there was a time that i didnt have any friends and Lalli was my only friend. He never left me alone and always showed me affection and love, like i showed him.

im feeling so depressed right now and i dont mean it lightely, i have lost all motivation to everything and only thing that lets me feel better even a little bit, is alcohol. im feeling so lonely and empty inside, no one seems to understand how much in pain im in right now, not even my family. i feel like i just want to scream and never stop. i have tried everything to try to stay positive but i just cant. 

i dont know what to do anymore, i cant go literally to my room without bursting in to tears and crying for the next 30minutes, i dont sleep at nights and i spend all my time on the livingroom couch, because thats the place Lalli spent the least time. 

i post this because i need help but i dont want to ask my parents to book me a therapist, because they would overreact, i just want to get rid of this pain, loneliness and emptiness inside me. 

i have also started feeling guilt when i think about the times that i have played my ps4 and Lalli comes next to me wanting me to pet him, but i have refused to. 

i took him for granted and now i would do anything to spend even a minute with him. I would give him so much love and made sure that he would now how much i really love him and miss him. 

here is a picture of Lalli: [https://imgur.com/a/W3OwoaE](https://imgur.com/a/W3OwoaE)"

Last night was the first time that I can recall having a dream where I'm in a very depressed mood. In my dream I was explaining to my family members about how alone I feel, how I feel useless, and that I should just die. When I was explaining these things to them it's as if they were not listening nor did they care making me feel more alone in my dream.   


Needless to say, the dream messed up my mental health today. I feel depressed, alone, and also panicky due to the fact that my thoughts created that dream. It's something I haven't experienced before and I didn't know who else to tell.

1942,Help with my brothers social anxiety and germaphobia,"With the global pandemic going on my brothers social anxiety has gotten very severe, which is only made worse by his germaphobia. He hasn't left our house since early may and he doesn't plan to leave our house till the pandemic is over. With his social anxiety he has always preferred to stay home and not interact with people, but I'm worried that if he doesn't get any social interaction he will be severely affected by the end of the pandemic. My family has tried to get him to at least leave our house for a bit, but he just gets mad at us and now rarely talks to any of us. He is paranoid about getting infected even though we live in a smaller city in Canada that doesn't have very many cases. I'm wondering how I should go about helping him. The pandemic clearly won't be over soon so I don't really want him to stay hiding away for months to come. He started learning how to rock climb before the pandemic so I've been trying to get him to come climbing with me but he refuses every time. If anyone could give me some advise on how to help him deal with his anxieties it would be greatly appreciated."
1943,Creepy neighbour spying on me or just paranoia?,"Hi everyone,

So I've lived in my house for around 14 years now and the next door neighbour has always been odd. His wife is nice and she talks a lot, but this guy, something just seems... Off, he never talks, just stares. The only time he has talked to me is when he told me this creepy story of being chased by a man, when he was my age, in a local park to us. 
Since moving in as a child, I got it into my head that he has a ""spying"" hole in the bathroom. Their bathroom is right next door to ours, and I can hear them when they're showing or even just walking around etc. I don't know why I thought this, I've checked many, many times and can't find anything. We have even had the bathroom changed twice and the builders/plumbers never said anything,surely they would?
But I just can't get this out of my head and I don't know why - something as specific as a small peeping hole he can watch us through? I've thought it since being a child, since before I had anything ""wrong"" with my mental health."

1948,Dragging my feet on finding someone to talk to.,"Hey everyone, I was looking to see if anyone had any advice on finding a professional to speak to. I really don’t even know where to start with finding someone. I don’t know if I need a therapist, psychiatrist, behavior specialist, etc. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for years but always dealt with it on my own. I think I’ve developed pretty severe OCD/phobia of bugs from a past apartment that was infested on move in day. Since then I’ve had an outright phobia of bugs inside my home. I moved to a new apartment in November and it’s been great. It’s summer in the south and of course bugs are coming in but I just got over an infestation I caused by leaving potting soil outside. Now I somehow have 50 spiders a day. I think maintenance disrupted them when they were going through the attic space to the ceiling to repair my AC because that’s when they came. I feel like I have no sense of reality or even time anymore. I spend my days obsessing over searching for bugs in my apartment. I deep clean every day even though there’s nothing left to clean. I obsessively count the number of bugs I find and get worried/upset if I think I miscounted. The recent spiders are making my anxiety and depression worse and it’s to the point I don’t have much of an appetite anymore. I’m proud of myself for just taking my dog for a long walk. Other than that I wait for night to come so I can go to bed and be done with the day. Even when I go to bed I’m anxious and scared of bugs being near my bed or in my bedroom. 

So, I need to talk to someone about a lot of issues including depression and an anxiety. But I think the bug phobia and possible OCD is the most pressing matter. What kind of professional do I seek for this? I’ve been dragging my feet all summer because I’m embarrassed to have to seek professional help for something like this. It’s exhausting though and I can’t continue living like this."
1949,I’ve been so angry and sad recently. I know somethings wrong but I don’t know what. Am I depressed?,"I’ve struggled with depression a lot in the past, this is true. I’m 20 and I had a LOT of depression as a teenager. I only recently got out of that mentality in the last year or so. Recently I quit my shitty job that only paid 8.25 an hour because I want to make more money, and find a tech job considering that’s what I love. I would like to go to college too, but unfortunately with COVID nothing is open. I’ve been really struggling to find a job, and having a felony on my record doesn’t make it any easier. (I got in a dumb fight awhile back). 

I was fine for the first couple of weeks but I would say about a week ago is when I started to come down. I’ve been angry, sad, I’ve basically lost all motivation to even look for a job, or to call any psychologists like I’m supposed to be doing (court order). Not to mention I treat my girlfriend like fucking shit and verbally lash out on her over dumb shit. We haven’t had a very good relationship recently and with work and me, I’ve been stressing her out a lot. She’s definitely been less sweet and active recently. I’ve felt like we’ve grown apart and honestly, I’m worried. 

I don’t want to lose her and I know something is wrong. I haven’t been depressed in so long so I kind of forgot what that was like. Is this it? Am I depressed? I don’t even know anymore. I just want to feel more motivated. I want my girlfriend to be sweeter to me. I want to be sweet to her. I want her to miss me. I don’t know what to do."
1950,Asked for my psychiatrist to up my sertraline for like the 3rd time from 150 to 200 but he won’t do it.,"Basically, I’ve been having on and off brief depressive episodes for a while. I’ve been on sertraline for literally 6 years the dose raise will not be a major thing. Last summer I went from 100 to 150, barely noticed anything apart from gradually depression lessening. These last two weeks I’ve felt Suicidal without being triggered by anything in particular. I’m in therapy, which helps but I do have biological tendencies to go into depression. Can i just ask the gp as my psychiatrist is private. I take 200mg every few days and it does actually help a bit especially if I take it like 5 days in a row, but my prescription runs out and I have to order in early, now I have to do a mood diary for two weeks to see if it’s worth adjusting my dose. I acc feel alright today but I just want to prevent the reoccurring low mood because I can’t hold down jobs if it comes. He said he might put me on something other than sertraline anyway meaning most likely anti psychotic which I don’t agree well with from past and I don’t see why u wouldn’t go full dose with current medication rather than introduce a new one to a finely tuned patient. What would you do?"
1951,Feeling inferior to others with no reason," Hello! My problem is pretty much described in the title. Overall, I am satisfied with myself. I mean, I am proud of what I have done until now and I am satisfied that I have the will and determination to evolve and become a better person every day. I am doing well in the professional life (university) until now and I'm ready to work hard in order to maintain my success. I have some great hobbies and passions and I'm glad that I have the possibility to practice them and learn more things about what interests me. When I am with my friends, I am quite confident and I feel good about myself. So, overall, I am a happy individual I could say. (apart from the stress and some insecurities/fear of the unknown)

However, there are times when I just feel inferior to other people for no reason. I mean, today I messaged a girl for the first time (we were aquainted, but didn't know each other very well), but she was not so eager to talk to me. Well, it could be because she was in a holiday at the seaside, so I can understand. I don't feel bad or sad because of that, but here is the problem: I saw a instagram story with her and some of her friends and there was a guy (which is considered a cool guy overall. He is quite known among people my age). I know he isn't her boyfriend or something like that, but I just felt inferior in that moment. I thought something like: ""Wow, she went in a holiday with that cool dude. He must be better than me in some way"". I know that it isn't really true. Just because he is popular or taller or looks better, it doesn't mean that he's better than me. But I just get anxious and feel inferior. I was wondering if you guys could help me with some advice to get rid of this ""toxic habit"".

PS: This is not the only situation that my feeling of inferiority appears. Another example is: if I hear one of my colleagues (who is considered cool among students) opinion and if he uses fancy words or has a really sofisticated opinion, I just feel like he's better than me. I feel like my opinion would be ""worse"" than his somehow. It's an awful feeling because, like I said, I am proud of myself overall, but I often have trouble believing in myself.

PS2: I am a 20-year old dude. I have just finished the first year of university.

Thank you a lot!"
1952,Lacking Motivation and Ideas,"Hi Guys,

Could really use some advice or point me in the right direction. 

Without going into a whole thing, I’ve realized I really need to be more constructive with my free time. Being in a new city, I really do not have any social outlets besides work. Although they are nice people there, I would like to have other social circles besides just the people I work with. Especially since I’m a manager. 

While I think getting into new hobbies would be best, I also feel I am very unmotivated to do so. Like sure I can list off ten things I can give a try, I’m not necessarily “excited” to try them. Like I’m doing it just to say I have a hobby rather than really “wanting” to do it. I don’t know if that makes sense. 

I dunno. It’s just easier just to stay home everyday. Trying new things really “ups” my social anxiety and fear of rejection I guess. I work in hotels and it bums me out to see some of the best moments of so many people - friends getting together, couples celebrating a milestone, people going to theme parks or whatever - and I just find myself so envious of them and wish I can insert myself into those moments. 

It’s a struggle to open myself up and put myself out there. Would like to work on this but don’t know where to really start. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading."

1954,A weird anxiety habit,"I have some unnoticeable anxiety issues where I would keep scratching my scalp until it bleeds a little and I can’t stop till I peal a little bit of dry skin I guess, it’s so random and I’ve never heard anyone talk about it, it all started when I was back a high schooler dealing with human subjects exams(the ones that need blind memorizing), and I wouldn’t focus on studying because I would be busy scratching my head and thinking, I have some tips that I’d follow whenever I study like either wearing a headband or covering my fingers with something  like rubber ties or tape. Is there anyone that have ever experienced that?"
1955,"From one side of the coin, to the other","Hello, everyone. I am not exactly sure why am I writing this post, I am probably just looking to vent or receive some thoughts of encouragement.

Long story short, I went from being suicidal and attempting a few times to fearing death to a point where now I have death anxiety. I am a 22M so having to deal with such anxiety at such a young age is quite, well, annoying. Now, don't get me wrong, depression is an awful thing and so is anxiety, but I'd much prefer wishing to be dead and keep on living rather than fear death constantly. Is anyone else going through this? I used to be such a nihilistic individual, I was proud of my understanding that life is finite and meaningless, but look at me now, fearing death more than anything. I have crippling and intrusive thought about it and no idea how to handle them. 

I am also quite a rational thinker, so telling myself facts like everyone dies in the end is not really helping. I realize all aspects of death and logically comprehend it - that's probably why I can't fool myself into not fearing it. It's like  knowing that placebo is just placebo, that's how I feel about most solutions for death anxiety. Oh, the irony, considering myself a rational thinker, yet dealing with an irrational fear of death. 

I feel like I'll never overcome this anxiety."
1956,Can a MSW/LICSW diagnose?,"I dont even know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm very confused. 

I started going to counseling and stuff. my social worker asked me questions from a depression and anxiety questionnaire set and concluded that i fit the criteria for moderate depression (though I accidentally lied on it, so it might have moderately severe idk ill have to tell them). 

anyways, is this a diagnosis? what do I do with this information? I dont really know how this stuff works, this is my first time going to a session (I'm really new). am I being overdramatic?"

I recently got a new job and have already had to call in twice in the first three weeks, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything, I hardly even care about anything and yes I’ve been trying to get off this med for 8 weeks now but the withdraw is even worse than taking it. Finally getting in to see a doctor but not until Mid August, hopefully Hell ends then, does anyone have any advice to help me get through these next couple weeks? I CAN’T lose this job, but I know if push comes to shove and I feel like shit I’ll call out again because I mentally don’t have the strength to fight it anymore. Any support/suggestions are welcome, hoping everyone else has a great day."
1959,Went to my first Drug &amp; Alcohol Group,"I really liked it! Firstly, there were only 7 people there including myself, and secondly, I had actually been in prison with two of the ladies in the group! We talked about being in prison and read out of the AA Big Book, so it was a LOT like an AA meeting, without the Serenity Prayer and the reading of all that stuff in the beginning of the meeting. I only have to go ONE day a week (Tuesdays) which we found out is the shorter group (only 2 hours long instead of 3 hours) and I go for individual counseling once every other week.   


My Probation Officer is a cunt (I told you guys that the level of alcohol in my blood was 0.3-something), which is indicative of an outside source and not by ingesting alcohol. I would have had a MUCH higher concentration in my blood if I had been drinking, believe me. I don't drink just a tiny tiny bit usually (the tasting of my hubby's drink on his birthday was a big exception and that is only because I AM on Probation and because I really DO want to stay sober)...in the past if I were going to drink, I would drink to get plastered beyond all rational thought. Heh. I have to call the court every single morning to see if my COLOR is being called, and if it is (I am Pink--how apropos) I have to go get tested. This is only temporary and I won't be using my inhaler anymore because it has ethanol in it. I don't want to risk it.   


So, anyway, I like the group and at least I know a couple of the people there. That makes me feel better. The one lady even remembered my nickname, Pyro. Hmmm. Yeah, those were crazy times in prison, that is for sure. We swapped stories of the one bat-shit crazy inmate who kept getting thrown in the Hole. We both had experiences with her. Amusing at times, annoying when you finally had fallen asleep and she started to bang on her cell door and yell obscenities. At no one in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading. I am glad I have this group to go to, and my Partial Hospitalization Program (Mental Health) will be starting again, it looks like, in early August. So I will be somewhat busy. That is good. I just wish the temperature would make up its mind. It has been ungodly hot and humid here and I can't stand hot and muggy weather. :( This is just to let y'all know that I am doing fine and I don't mind the little curveball life has thrown me. This could actually be fun, and I get to meet and talk with actual PEOPLE (outside my family!)...whooo!!!!! Plus, we can eat and drink during group and they have snacks! :D  


LOVE to you all!!! &lt;3"
1960,The Felt-Sense of Psychological Resilience,"In the past few years, I've been trying to fully conceptualize psychological resilience. I haven't found a coherent definition yet, but here's a small expressive write-up of what this journey of searching for its meaning has been like for me: [https://medium.com/@rose.mejia1998/the-felt-sense-of-psychological-resilience-51d78c8774ec?sk=13d81afa75a2c98f720a9e6087ca2854](https://medium.com/@rose.mejia1998/the-felt-sense-of-psychological-resilience-51d78c8774ec?sk=13d81afa75a2c98f720a9e6087ca2854)

I hope some of you resonate :)"
1961,"How do I stop gaining satisfaction from getting ""revenge"" on people who have hurt me?","I really care about the people who I let into my life. I am supportive, empathetic, caring, selfless, and incredibly loyal. And I realize that very very few people are like that, so I put a limit on my expectations. All I ask for in return is appreciation, acknowledgment, and respect. When I give someone a place in my life, I also give them the power to hurt me. And I feel like they keep doing it, maybe because they're unaware of that power.

When any kind of relationship come to an end, I make sure I handle it with class and grace, no matter how deeply hurt I am, or how tempting it is to pour out all the rage I have inside me onto that person, for the way they've failed to see everything I've done for them; all the love, support, patience, honesty, acceptance. I do think it's better to part ways on a good note, and deal with inner struggles on my own.

The other day, someone who has lied to me and hurt me, who I've cut all ties with 2 months ago, reached out to me again and wanted to get back into my life. I got a really huge ego boost out of it, and felt so powerful. I have the power to reject and hurt them now, the same way they did to me. And I love it.

But then I started asking myself, why? Why does something like this bring me satisfaction and boost my self-esteem? That can't be a good thing. It must mean that there's something missing, a self-issue that needs to be resolved. It's not healthy to use scenarios like these - which have happened to me multiple times before, and I've dealt with them the same way - to feel better about myself.

I think forgiveness might be a way to avoid this kind of situation. But I don't know how to forgive. I try really hard, and I honestly end up believing that I've truly forgiven. But when they come back and give me the opportunity, all I want to do is ""get even."" How do I learn to forgive?"
1962,Im miserable,"Like many people in this sub, I (22F) have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a kid. I had intense obsessions and rituals throughout my childhood (some of these included not being able to leave my house without all the toys I owned, irrational fear of losing a limb, had to get up on a certain side of the bed). I’ve taken medication and gone to therapy since I was 12, because that’s when I began self-harming. Early high school resulted in many tumultuous friendships and relationship. In late high school I matured a lot, was much happier and learned to respond to things in healthier ways. But after I graduated, I went off my meds (huge mistake) which made me emotional, paranoid and my sex drive was gone. Though things managed to get better, but I still struggled with intense anxiety and anger, eventually becoming extremely depressed again during my junior year of college. That was the point in which I went back on my meds. The meds do make me not depressed or as agitated which is good, but I still struggle with anxiety and anger, which has put a significant strain on my relationships. My former roommate and close friend at one point compared me to her mother, a woman who struggled with BPD and eventually committed suicide. For the past 7 months, I’ve struggled to eat due to a fear of choking and an automatic urge to cough everything back up. Many other friends and acquaintances have recently described me as cold and mean, which hurts. I’ve started seeing a neuropsychologist today, but still have no idea what is wrong with me. It’s  been suggested that it’s autism, bipolar, OCD but I don’t seem to fit all the symptoms for any of these. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that there is something off, something more than just anxiety. I can’t help but feel hopeless. I feel that every teacher, counselor, and authority figure who should have helped me let me down. I’m tired of hearing people tell me to “work on myself” as if I haven’t been doing that my entire damn life. 

TL; DR: I’ve struggled with my mental health my whole life and it’s killing that I don’t have an inkling as to what’s wrong.

1967,Late night movie :),"I was feeling depressed and suicidal the entire day. It is currently 12:07am, two hours ago, I remembered a movie I watched once when I was in middle school that involves the theme of suicide and depression, which ends up with the main character dying from suicide. There was such a big difference between watching it then and now. Even though I was depressed and suicidal back then too, my understanding of my situation has gotten better over time. To understand the motives of the characters, their backstories, their lifestyle, the changes they’re going through, is fascinating. I feel at ease. After I finished watching the movie, I got up and went to brush my teeth and wash my face. I felt this sort of feeling that you feel when you go on a vacation in a foreign country, specifically a European one. My sister was going out and was wearing a perfume that reminds me of the perfume my mother used to take with her when we went on vacations. She went into the bathroom to wash her hands and all of a sudden , while I was brushing my teeth, I felt this sort of light heartiness and then laughed about our height, but not in a mean way, and said it’s so strange there’s people who are taller than us. Then I went in her room and looked in the mirror, I didn’t look that terrible to myself. My weight did not matter, nor did my lips or my terrible hair. I wonder what sort of feeling this is. I’m very glad I watched this movie again. I hope this feeling can last some time now . It has been a while since I felt truly alright and it wasn’t the mood swings :) 


I don’t know if this should go under venting, and I hope I don’t sound strange, but I hope it is ok :)"

I’ve genuinely looked into this and am sure I possess a lot of the symptoms. The thing is, I stopped seeing my therapist a while ago after lying to her for months and telling her I was doing better. She told me I was doing well and she felt I didn’t need to see her anymore. Thats what I wanted though, she didn’t really listen to what I was saying. I told her I was sure there was something wrong with me. I would explain situations where I purposely did something that hurt somebody then pretended to comfort them, but she brushed it off. I’m worried if I go to a therapist and tell them I think I have psychopathic tendencies, they’ll blow me off like every other therapist has. What do I do? I feel like no therapist will believe me because I’m a woman still in her late teens."

I study at the university and I had to do an internship. I struggled so much to find an internship and when I found one I was so happy. But after 3 weeks in they ended the internship, because of covid. A week later  I also lost my job, because I worked in a restaurant and they had to close from the goverments and they went bankrupt. Glad in my country the government gives you money after losing your job, but money is not the issue. 

I feel worthless and empty. Totally lost my motivation and willpower to make something from life. 
I lost motivation. I used to love my study, job and my life. I lost it all. Now I hate my life and I feel empty. Maybe I got a bit in a depression. I am definitely not suicidal, but I also do not see any meaning in life now or have any motivation to make someting from it  

I am young and I want to make someting from my life and I do not get a fair chance to develop myself, graduate and reach my goals. This has such a negative effect on my future. at this young age you need to enjoy life and take the chance to study and graduate. 

Now I cannot study or work so I am a worthless 20 year old human being which future is heavenly affected by this b***.

1976,Therapists who love the sound of their own voice,"Am I the only one who has come across this? It seems to me that therapists love the sound of their own voices, and I am tired of it

Yesterday, i had an appointment with a new therapist. It was our second appointment, and in the first appointment I'd told her that I was tired of therapists who just talk and talk at you, without giving you space to talk. She gave me 3 minutes to 'share'. I said that i would like some space to talk, that i would like some space to be able to discuss current and past struggles. Not to vent, but to be given space to discuss things

She then went on a 10 minute rant on how my sharing is not good for therapy, that it takes up all the time in a session, that perhaps if I wanted just to share, then I'm not ready for therapy, that I can share with my psychiatrist, that all I wanted to do was 'chat' then she explained the therapeutic relationship as though I were a child. 

She didn't once acknowledge what I said, she didn't reflect what I said back to me, she didn't check that she had understood correctly, she just barreled on without stopping

After telling me that I was in control of the sessions, and that the therapeutic relationship is a two way street,  she basically was telling me that I had no control, and that she was the only authority in the room

I then told her I didn't think we were a good fit, that she was doing exactly what I said other therapists had done, that she had misunderstood what i had said, that she hadn't even taken a breath to allow me to refute what she was saying, and then I hung up

I have been through so many therapists like this, whether they are a psychologist, counsellors, or social workers. Don't they teach empathy and listening skills anymore?"
1977,One thing after another and the weight is starting to add up. I feel like I'm losing it.,"I (34F) just need to put this all out there because honestly it’s just starting to all weigh a bit too much. 

TLDR: I’m feeling badly for myself because I feel like every time I put out one fire there is another one just waiting to spark.

It started in December. A friend of mine was killed, ridding her bike by a drunk driver. 
I barely had time to process because I had to leave for three weeks of work travel (which was very stressful) in January. 

During the trip, I’m told my grandfather has passed away.

I come home and my long distance partner tells me that “this was the best relationship he had ever been in, but he needed something (that he could not specify?) that I would not be able to give him, ever.” We decide to stay together until we could see each other again because there was still so much love. (I thought things were going well up to this point, clearly mistaken)...

My upstairs neighbor and landlord whom I’ve shared a home with for 2 years, dies at the end of January

Then comes a March, and Covid. But before covid, I was run off the highway going 75 mph by a reckless driver. Overall the accident was as minor as can be for that speed, but I suffered physical injuries in my shoulder and a concussion.

Then, I was exposed to the ol’ Rona through work and started quarantine 3/13 (I never got it, or was asymptotic) This caused a huge fight between a close friend as I was missing a celebration for her masters degree, which caused enormous stress for me. 
March and April were a stress ball of reading too much news and the uncertainty of the world. I don’t live near my family which also was stressful to be apart. 

In April, a friend of the group kills himself. 

In May I am tasked to present what was supposed to be a 4 day, in person, international sales meeting which suddenly needed to be virtually hosted and that fell on me to put together entirely. (It went well but after many hours of stressing on my end)

I realize Covid isn’t going anywhere and the dude and I break up. 

I get a cat. (This is the best part of the story. His name is Rio and he is perfect)

At the end of May, I go to the doctor because I’m still having lots of headaches, dizziness and my hair is falling out. 
They find I have an arrhythmia that needs a follow up. 
Then the MRIs get get ordered. 
I spend 4 weeks in and out of specialist and scans, they find nothing. 

My kitten starts to have a stuffy nose, and blinky eyes. I bring him in, they do 300$ worth of tests to find nothing. He still has symptoms. 

So at this point I am getting ready and excited for an outdoor river trip in my state that had been planned for a year....Then my parents call. 

My dad is not doing well. Likely MS and/or Alzheimer’s. He is coming to visit. This is not negotiable. He is coming before his doctors appointments. Which you guessed it, is right when my trip is. Well, a week after but due to his health, I didn’t feel comfortable going, while my state was spiking in cases, with no way to tell if I was a carrier before seeing him. My trip gets canceled, everyone else goes. 

The family comes to visit and I realize just how bad my dad’s memory is. He forgot I was there, he doesn’t know the year, or where he lives. 

This isn’t to mention George Floyd and that I used to live in MPLS and watched my old community burn down, my friends protest and end up in the hospital. Every time I read the news, I feel helpless, our government is keeping covid data from the cdc, that we have unmarked special forces kidnapping people for acting on their constitutional rights, or that we are having virtual meetings because it is too dangerous to meet Ib person,to discuss trying to send kids back to school in a few weeks.
 

I’m in therapy, have a job and a home, didn’t lose every and have a lot of support but I still feel like I’m losing my grip and am seeing myself shutting everyone out because somehow it just feels like to much to put on anyone else because everyone I talk to is in a seemingly similar place. 

I feel like I live in a constant state of anxiety, depression, hope and mourning and it just depends on what day you catch me.

1978,Why does this always become an argument?,"Hi! Im just curious of other people's opinions on this topic. Hopefully this is the right group to ask if not please tell me and I'll delete. 

Trigger warning: medication mention (just in case) 

So! I have dabbled with the idea of taking some sort of medication to help with my anxiety and mild depression. In the past couple of years I have tried to develop a healthier lifestyle and im very cautious with what I put on and in my body for many reasons. With that though, I dont take very many pharmaceuticals, just migraine meds and otc pain relief for migraines. Due to the possible side affects. potential long term affects, other medical conditions, and bad past experiences. 

My question is. Why is it that when I tell people I don't want to take medication it turns into an arguement and im always seen as a douche? I am not saying or implying that I dont believe in meds or that they can't be helpful to people. Im simply saying that I have found other ways to help with my mental health and I dont want to take them. Why is that a bad thing? I'm really not trying to offend anyone."
1979,Ive been taking between 110 and 140mg of propranalol when im only suppose to take 40mg...,"
My doctor first told me to take 10mg up to 3x a day but that didn’t work so she gave me a 40mg to take once a day but it still doesn’t work so I looked up the maximum amount you can take before you overdoes which was 240mg so I started taking more and depending on how anxious I am I only feel a dent when I take between 110 and 140mg 


It doesn’t even really work properly...

I’m not sure what to do because I know my doctor will be angry I took more that she specifically told me to take and if I say it doesn’t work she will put me on a slightly higher does like 80mg a day... which already didn’t work 


I’m kinda stuck..."
1980,Seeking advice,"Hello. 

I'd go to relationship advice sub, but I think this is a better sub. My wife (for almost a year) has some mental health problems. She gets high levels of anxiety and depression, and just feels awful. It's happened before and what she always says she needs is just space and time alone. This time it is lasting longer though, over a few months.
In the first year of our relationship, she mentioned to me that one year prior, it felt like the joy had been surgically removed from her life and since meeting me, my energy and happiness made her whole again. 
We've been together 4 years now, and I don't know what to do. I love her more than anything, but she's not reciprocating (I know it's because she's sad), but it's hard. All I want to do is help her, but especially during this pandemic she's all I have. The more I distance myself the more it hurts, but I want her to heal so maybe I should just deal with the pain of it now.
Edit: she does see a therapist once a week, and has been for years."

1983,Is there anyone else who does this?,"Okay, this is something that has been playing on my mind for a while now, and i'm not sure if this relates to maladaptive daydreaming or not, but I would really appreciate a reply from someone who feels like they can relate to what I'm describing: Ever since I was a kid, I have been talking to myself and imagining situations that I know would NEVER happen. They are all fictional, like from a movie, tv show, game, book, anything like that. Sometimes I even recite a speech from a YouTuber that was spoken in a video, and then sort of put myself in the shoes of that person, recite the whole speech out loud to myself and imagine it's me that's actually experiencing it.  I did have imaginary friends growing up, but when I was a teenager it sort of died down and became what I just described. When I talk to myself, imagining I'm in these fictional scenarios, I will literally get so immersed in them that I sometimes do it in public, though thank God i don't really get any funny looks from people lol. Also when I'm talking to myself/imagining, i play the part of the other person as well as my own, like i will say my part out loud and sometimes say the part of the other person too. Other times, I will simply picture the other person's part in my head and say my own part out loud. I used to act it out a lot more when I was a kid and at school, it's died down quite a lot now, but it's a habit that's still with me. I never ever thought that I could be schizophrenic because even though I do get so immersed in these ""daydreams"", or whatever you want to call them, at the same time I do realise that they're not real, and simply stem from a habit that i've ever had ever since I was a really young girl (I'm 27 now). I will also repeat lines that I like from YouTube videos, movies, games, books etc etc etc imagining that I am in the person-that's-doing-its shoes, which is pretty much exactly the same as what I just described I guess but thought it would be useful to put down here anyway. I get that everyone talks to themselves to a certain degree, and I don't have any doubt that when some people read this they will immediately jump to conclusions and just assume it's me thinking out loud to myself (for example ""where did I put my keys/phone/bag?"") which i still do, granted, the same way everyone does. But I wanted to put this out there, in hopes that someone will see it and say that they do the same thing. Also, in case anyone is wondering, absolutely NONE of this has stemmed from any trauma or anything like that, i mean I have gone through some rough patches but rest assured they didn't trigger any of this lol. I had a very good childhood, not the best time at school as a teenager but that's another story, (but the talking-to-self thing had started years before any of that anyway), again, it's just been a habit of mine that I've had since I was a child. But, reinstated, I would be so grateful if someone (ANYONE) could read this and say they do the exact same thing, as it would be very reassuring for me. Also, my daydreams (if you can call them that) don't affect my life negatively in any way at all, and they never have done. Because I still find myself chattering to myself even when I'm doing housework or anything important, so that's why I was confused as to whether they count as daydreams (they might still do but not be classed as maladaptive ones). I hope this does not mean that I could be schizophrenic or have a multiple personality disorder or anything like that, I think it's just force of habit because it seems to ""follow me everywhere"", but at least it doesn't affect my life negatively?"
1984,What’s wrong with me,"I keep getting this wave of utter dread and fear every single night for the past week, as soon as I put my phone down to go to sleep and it feels like an emotional punch in the gut. I just think about how much I love my bunnies and my cat and I literally cannot deal with the fact that they will eventually cease to exist. Then, I start thinking of a very important person in my life who very suddenly passed away (my boss, who was like a father to me) and how much I loved him and how I never got to tell him exactly how much he meant to me. 

Not to bring up religion, but I feel like it’s essential to explain my beliefs for this particular problem because it may explain why this is happening. In a nutshell, I believe in an eventual paradise on earth where people will be resurrected to live as Adam and Eve were supposed to, so I tried to find out if pets would be resurrected too and there are multiple scriptures basically saying that only humans can qualify. 

When I first read it, literally within a split second, my whole body went numb and my face got hot and I felt the type of panic you would have if you had just tripped off the side of a cliff. I have always relied on my religion for comfort when I would have existential dread or worry, but this time, I couldn’t. I felt absolutely devastated, like my whole world had just fallen apart.  I wanted to cry but instead of tears releasing my pain, I just felt all of it build up in my stomach, chest and throat. Ever since then, I have had the same experience every single night, right as I try going to sleep and sometimes in short spurts throughout the day. 

I just want it to stop so bad. I can’t even describe how painful this type of anxiety attack is. I’ve had anxiety attacks since 4th grade when I overheard my teacher saying that there was a tornado warning in our area (and this was before I had ever heard of anxiety, so I thought I was literally dying) and since then, I’ve probably had hundreds of them. I also have adhd so I have problems with really intense, uncontrollable emotions. 

My previous anxiety attacks have always felt like complete panic and terror and the physical symptoms were always hyperventilating, crying, numbness in face and extremities, lightheadedness and shaking. The only part of it that’s the same as my new attacks is the lump in my throat, but the normal one is more of a panic lump and the new one feels more like a despair, existential panic lump if that makes sense. 

But the anxiety attacks I’ve been having recently have been something Ive only felt a handful of times in my life, mostly when I deeply think about either my own mortality / the mortality of my mom or when I lose somebody I really loved to something other than death. Usually, in those situations, I can control it. But in this situation it’s almost like I’m completely possessed by a cloud of grief and I can’t do anything to help myself. 

It’s like a complete wave over my body, a lot like how it feels when acid hits you or if you do something really embarrassing in front of a whole bunch of people, but in a very, very terrible way. I can feel my heart rate skyrocket right off the bat. Rather than the usual crescendo, which was kind of like flooring it in a brand new car, it’s more like my heart skipped to the last gear in the worlds fastest manual car and went 0-100 in .5 seconds. My entire body goes numb and gets hot, rather than just my hands and face. I almost feel like I want to curl up into a ball and dig my hands into my arms and squeeze my muscles and bones inside my body from feelings of wishing I was dead and just simply not knowing what to do with all my pain. But all I ever do is lay there in the pitch black, experiencing all of these things. If somebody walked into the room and saw me, they would probably think I look catatonic or hypnotized. 

My boyfriend sleeps next to me every night, but he always falls asleep before me so I never want to wake him up to help me and my mom is always asleep too. Even though I know I could wake one of them up and they would help me without a second thought, I just can’t bring myself to move at all. Then, by the time the next day rolls around, I stop thinking about it so I don’t even want to start thinking about it again in order to tell somebody because the experience sucks that much. If I have a normal anxiety attack, as soon as it passes, I always tell my mom and boyfriend. 

I’ve never lost somebody so important to me before and I’ve never had my religion let me down like that instead of giving me hope. 

I feel hopeless and lost and terrified and sad and grief stricken all at the same time. I’ve felt kind of like this before, but it’s so intense now, I just can’t handle it. I’m usually a strong person who can move on from things very fast, but I feel like I’m stuck in a pit of thick tar and im just using all my strength to slowly wade through and never really getting anywhere. 

Is this even an anxiety attack? Is it depression? What is wrong with me? Has anybody else ever experienced this? How can I make it stop? I really can’t continue feeling like this anymore."
1985,I feel bad for Kanye West,"I feel bad for Kanye West

To begin, I’ll admit I’ve never really been a big fan of his music. Some songs here and there, plus a couple features. But this has very little to do with the music. The guy has been wrapped up in a crazy life of fame. I don’t know what it’s like being that famous, but I have to imagine it can become more than overwhelming. 

His method to keep the attention on him is what makes it happen. I think he’s addicted to fame in a major way. He acts controversial and says controversial things to keep the camera on him. The classic “no publicity is bad publicity” tactic, which in a neutral way is true. Then he married Kim Kardashian, who clearly needs no introduction. 

Now the real big thing is he’s allegedly running for president, which is something at one point many people would have found ridiculous. Trump being elected proved even someone with zero political background can make it to the top, and I think this is why West and Trump get along so well. They both thrive off the controversy they create. 

I do not support Kanye West running for president, but I do respect the determination he has. The man already held a political rally and everything, but in it I saw what truly made me feel for him.

It’s my opinion that Kanye West probably has a mental disorder, though I have no idea what kind. But the breakdowns he has compared to what he’s surrounded by all the time is like the perfect mix of mentally-destroying items that will eventually consume a person. Now Kim Kardashian allegedly threatened to lock him up and divorce him (though I’m not sure why). He claimed the movie Get Out was about him. 

Everything considered (and I’m sure there’s so much I’ve never even heard of) I think the man is in so deep that it doesn’t matter what he thinks or feels. He’s just being ran into the ground by the people around him, and the Hollywood elites that control him. 

I should also say that I don’t judge the guy at all. He’s a man that even though I don’t like his music much, I’d love to know him as a person. Mostly so I can pick his brain and get his own opinion and views on things, without the pressure or biased influence of the media around him."

Nothing in my life has ever consistently gone my way and the universe has dealt me a shitty hand of cards, time and time again, so why continue to suffer? Like if I hadn't suffered unemployment, a breakup, loss of my therapist because I have no medical insurance, and having no support system, I don't think I would be here, but alas, here I am."
1988,Anxiety and procrastination,"It's been the reason for my school struggles since I started HS. It happens every year, in every class. This summer is no exception. I switched to independent study (last school year was a disaster and it's a very long story), and have a summer class that I need to finish in three weeks so I have all of my sophomore credits. But I literally cannot get myself to start on these packets and do this textbook stuff. It's a super easy class, intro to art. I'm an artist so I've got no issue with the projects, I just cannot focus on book work for the life of me. I don't even want to start because I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish, the workload is overwhelming especially with such a short amount of time. Every time I try to sit down and start I break down and cry. Then I start spiraling, because something as simple as writing a response paragraph and answering questions should not be so difficult for me, especially in a subject I already know about. I wish I could just get my work done on time like a normal person. I don't know what will happen if I don't finish this class on time, and I have no idea how I'm going to handle a full course load of harder classes during the actual school year. I keep getting worse and worse at completing schoolwork."

1990,Moving away from home,"I’m (18f) thinking about moving out of my parents house. I’m looking for apartments and jobs in the city where I go to school but I can’t stop thinking about something. 

Is it wrong that I don’t want to live with my parents anymore? Am I stupid to do this when I’m only 18? Am I selfish to want I place for myself, where I can feel free?

My parents make me feel like shit, they’re overprotective and strict (they think they’re perfect and has no idea how I feel). I just want to live alone so that I can eat when I feel like eating or don’t have to present my friends family tree in order to be aloud to hang out with them. I’ve been wanting to move out for years and I thought it would get better when I moved to my aunt for school but it turned out she was telling them everything I did. Also they don’t want to accept that I’m bisexual (“it’s just a phase”) and that makes me uncomfortable living there.

Am I right to want this? Or am I just selfish?"

1993,I'm afraid that social media are taking a toll on my mental health.,"So if this sounds familiar it's because I've posted it somewhere else in the hope that at least someone would get interested enough to give me their advice.

I'm specifically talking about Facebook. I signed up several years ago, and I've made lots of friends who I deeply care about. I've grown quite popular in many wildlife groups, where I'm the ""bug expert"" as I'm into insects (specifically bees, wasps and the like) and I've probably saved thousands of them by convincing people that they're not a threat. 
Every day people ask me for advice about how to deal with the wasp nest that they found in their garden, or the bees that colonized their roof, this sort of problems. 

I've come to a point where I'm mentioned several times a day to deal with posts about insects, even in unrelated groups, where comments are mostly ""kill them with fire"" and flames are almost always guaranteed. 

I've come to a point that even opening a notification gives me anxiety, because most of the time there's a flame going on and people will be rude to me and I'll be rude to them or to people in real life and that makes me feel like shit. 
The situation has become so toxic that I occasionally take 1 week breaks where I log off and focus on other stuff. Then one week later I log in again out of curiosity and find dozens of notifications, most of which from people mentioning me or sending me PM's asking the same questions and making the same arguments over and over. 

I've seriously been thinking of deleting myself from Facebook lately, but on the other hand I like educating people about my field and I run groups and pages where hundreds of people can't wait for my informative posts. I don't want to lose them, or let uneducated people kill harmless bugs because there's no one to tell them that they're harmless.

Most of my friends deleted themselves from Facebook long ago, and I would've done it too if it weren't for the situation I just described. I just don't know what to do. I need some advice.
Thanks for reading through all this wall of rambling."
1994,What is diagnosis? What do they actually say? Do they give you like a certificate saying “you have Anxiety”?,I have been prescribed medication for anxiety and have been signed off school by my doctor for 2 years because of severe anxiety. But I never got like a piece of paper saying “you have Anxiety”. But like it’s in my doctors notes and my doctor has said I have it and I’m getting treatment for it. So have I been diagnosed?

1996,I struggle with being angry and I think it stems from my trauma and other issues stem to it too,"

I’ve been uncontrollably angry since I got out of an abusive relationship. I would “ see red” and break shit and felt better after. It’s manifested worse now and I have two holes in the wall. I get angry at the slightest thing and rn things just aren’t going well for me so I am just breaking whatever. 
It’s not like I like it- I can’t seem to control being this angry . I just- get angry and just “see red” it’s like o black out.

I can’t keep going on like this and idk what to do. I’m co soldering turning myself in to the hospital or something but idk.

I’m tired I’m like this...

I guess if there’s a better way to explain this- whoever watched Steven universe- remember when he was basically going all insane due to his trauma? It’s basically like that and I feel like I’m going out of control. I hope that explains it sorry if it’s blunt but Im in a very limited headspace rn 

I’m just going out of control and it feels like more and more everyday as shit gets worse I am getting worse.

I need help"

1998,Uncomfortable tension sensation when working with small objects/details,"Not even sure if this is the right sub but I just had to stop playing my new planet zoo game because of this. Trying to get the angles perfect on the placement of buildings and I’m getting this intense need to writhe and stretch and move.

It’s very frustrating, uncomfortable, and mysterious since google isn’t giving me any clue."
1999,is it okay to reduce interaction with someone who triggers our mental health?,is it okay to reduce interaction with someone who triggers our mental health without knowing? it's not that they're bad people but they were the main reason why i had a breakdown (mostly because of me overthinking) and i want to distance myself from them but not completely.
2000,Need some help thank you :),"Need advice thanks :)

hello I am 19 years old, and my teacher reached out to me at the end of last semester and told me she thinks I should get checked for ADHD because of my lack of attention. She told me to get checked in a really sweet nice way and was looking to truly help me. However, my parents are old school and don’t believe in anything mental health and weren’t supportive when I told them about the situation. Is there a way for me to get checked and talk to a psychiatrist without using my health insurance which is connected to their account? All help would be appreciated. I’ve never used ADHD medicine before but I feel my symptoms are getting out of hand. Thank you so much :)"
2001,Extreme moods and obsessive behaviour,"I think my husband has some mental health issues and I don’t know how to classify them because I’m not a doctor and I’m not sure the best way to manage them and support him without loosing my own mind. He is on a few meds that a psychiatrist prescribed to him, Zoloft and aripiprazole are two of them. The psychiatrist doesn’t spend a lot of time talking too him just prescribed. 

My husband is very obsessive compulsive and has strange rituals (like knocking three times on a door before passing, just a silly example of something small) but will get very upset if a ritual is broken. Before the meds he was always loosing his mind, was arrested and spent some time in hospital on a 72 hour watch. The last incident where I threatened to leave was a road range where a guy cut him off and when we got to a red light he dragged the guy out of his car dumped his large drink on his head and started punching him in the middle of the intersection. My 3 year old saw and was terrified. 

He has also lost jobs over violent behaviour. Now that he is on the meds he’s fine, gone from extreme rage and hyperactivity to just hyperactivity, singing the same long lyrics over and over again loudly sometimes for 2 hours straight and just driving me insane and getting our 4 year old all spun out of control. He literally bounces off the walls - happy and not raging out - but it’s till jarring and concerning. He told the physician he is fine and feels great and he actually hasn’t had a formal diagnosis. 

I’m feeling like a very exhausted single mom with a 4 year old a out of control man baby. He was mentally emotionally and physically abused as a child and although he’s never been physical with us he makes very questionable parenting decisions that worries me. Does anyone have any thoughts or insight into what might be happening with him?"
2002,Should I try to seek help?,[deleted]
2003,A vent,"I just need to get things of my chest, I'm sorry.

Before all this happened with COVID-19 I was beginning to feel happier. I even caught myself dancing in the store once. I was relaxing and working on my confidence and self acceptance. 

Now I feel like I failed everyone, especially my parents. Out of approximately 15 uni classes, I have 6 exams left for September, and I'm only taking 5 and doing the sixth in summer all over again. I just couldn't focus on anything during online classes. I want to go back to uni and have classes in person, even if I have to wear a mask and be alone with my professors. I don't mind it, I just need their physical presence there. 
I'm also on the verge of losing all my friends due to distance and me being in another country. And I spoke to mu crush and told him I've been in love with him for the past 6-7 years and he turned me down. (he was actually really sweet, and apologised to me a couple of times, but it still hurts, you know) 

I feel completely down, and not even my favourite childhood show can cheer me up, mostly cause my mum won't let me watch it when she's home.

I just feel hopeless and lost rn, I don't know what to do with myself anymore."
2004,Losing all hope that things will turn around,"So 2020 has been an absolute disaster. Financial issues  A few not so great dating experiences then covid happened here in Canada. I then lost my job. I am barely afloat. Then May rolls around  and things start looking up. I have job interviews, and I meet a new boy who is amazing (straight up everything I've been looking for). I interview a bunch and get the job. The boy (not my boyfriend) and I spend a lot of time together and things excellerate fast. I'm on the top of the world. Then some of my sexual past (months before we even knew each other) comes up in conversation causing my boyfriend to leave me. A week later I notice some issues with my private area so I see a doctor. Get scanned for STDs and all that. None of that thankfully. Things still aren't right so I take a pregnancy test just to calm my nerves (I have an IUD that I got checked to see if it was in place, so the chances are so low). It's positive. I am freaking. Can't get ahold of my ex because he's blocked me from all forms of communication. I take another test and positive. I schedule to see my GP and get checked. Few days later while I am waiting for the results one more time (they came back positive but again we were in disbelief because the odds are so low) and I get the worst pain of my life down there and end up passing a clot bigger than my fingernail. I know that was a life form. I am waiting to see my GP to confirm everything. I am beyond sad. I feel like a failure. Here's this man I really cared about who not only leaves me but then I am pregnant with his child and then I lose that. I feel at an all time low. I've suffered from mental health my whole life but I've never been this sad. What do I do? I feel like the world keeps kicking me when I am down and I honestly don't know if I can take it any longer... Any advice to get through this?

Edit- somebody please help or acknowledge my grief. I am feeling hopeless. I have got back into self harm and the habits I thought I kicked. Please. Somebody. Anybody."
