0,I think I have mental health issues and I don’t know who to go to or what to do,"Hello everyone I’m new to this reddit thing so please don’t ostracize me to much on my mess ups. I’m a 16 year old junior guy who hasn’t been feeling well for a while now. 


Let me back track. It all started when my stepdad was separated from my mom. I was so sad and upset when they separated because I really liked him. My mom me and my younger sister were coming home from whatever we were doing I don’t remember and they both left. I was feeling sad for a while and I felt an inclination to open the glove compartment. I did and found a revolver. I looked at it and saw the bullets were In there. I pressed it my head and was tempted to pull the trigger but I didn’t. I really wanted to but I didn’t. I eventually got a bit better to where I wasn’t doing that. But when I went into high school in my freshman year it came back again. It wasn’t as bad as it is now but it was still there. I didn’t get as much happiness as I used to when doing things I used to love in the past (football, basketball, seeing friends and family) it wasn’t extremely noticeable but it felt a bit off to me. I didn’t think about this to much because I was so stressed with school work and my step father coming back into the picture after my mother and he separated for a about a 6 month period. My older biological sister was facing serious mental problems and was eventually diagnosed with depression, anxiety and a severe eating disorder. Which had her not eat for extended periods of time which had her lose a lot of weight and really messed her up. She was dealing with that and it caused a lot of conflict and she went to crisis for awhile then left to live with my grand parents. She’s a lot better now. Fast forward to sophomore year and now I can’t sleep at night and talking to teachers for help for assignments freaked me out to where I sometimes felt like I would throw up.  I didn’t look forward to a lot and didn’t really get mad, happy, upset, sad or really anything. It felt like I was a hollow husk. I asked my mother for a Thearpist (which made me freak the first time I tried because I am not good at asking for things from other people) because I thought it would help but she only got me one after months of asking she got me one. and when me and him didn’t gel she just dropped the whole thing. I was smoking pot at the time because it was the only thing that helped me relax and enjoy myself for a bit. And when my parents found out they freaked out. They called me a failure, a fuck up and a train wreck. I never stopped smoking but it really hurt what they said. Then I now developed this bad habit of  getting a lighter and putting the light close to my foot and stuff like that. I can’t really explain what that is but mabey you guys will know. I now after that Thearpist asked my school to help for a Thearpist. My counselor was a saint and helped me the best he could but the social workers he sent emails to for help for me never reached out. So I went to a guy from family focus ( the family focus was there for my younger sister but I talked to the one guy and vibed with him and had a couple personal sessions with him.) He got me in touch with the new Thearpist I have right now. The problem is that he doesn’t seem to care. He keeps on rescheduling appointments and when I can talk or ask questions he never says much. Just a “oh wow you’ve been through a lot” or “ oh ok” is all I usually get. Just on Monday we had a appointment scheduled and he changed it to today and I got no email for an invite to the video chat he uses. Which is necessary for the video chat service. He seems apathetic and I don’t know what to do. And I get that it was Easter but I let him set up the times and dates and stuff like that because I don’t know how to do that. My fathers side has PTSD, bipolar, anxiety, and depression. While my moms side has anxiety and depression. Both my sisters have depression and severe anxiety and everyone in my family says they think I have something but they don’t know what. Please keep in mind they’re not psychologist but I trust my sisters a lot and they’ve been through the mental health care system and know a lot. But I don’t know what to do or who to turn to. I don’t trust my parents because they just send people to crisis if they say anything and don’t seem to care at all even when I try to have a heart to heart with them. All they do is blame the pot smoking and tell me I need to be stronger. My older sister sort of listens but she can’t really help me. The family focus guy that got me the therapist originally isn’t working with us anymore. And my therapist is extremely apathetic and doesn’t do too much. And I’ve tried the school system but the social workers didn’t help before so why would they help now? I just really need some advice and I don’t know what to do or who to turn to so if you read this long I really appreciate it and if you have some advice please tell me it. I could use all the advice I can get. 

Again sorry for the grammar and mess ups and sorry it was so long I just wanted a good explanation and background knowledge I thought was needed."
1,It all feels so hard.,"I'm sorry if this isnt formatted well or anything like that. My problems started about 6-7 months ago when I started smoking pot excessively. I've tried cutting it out but by the end of my first summer smoking I was heavily addicted. Every time I try to quit nowadays I always convince myself that smoking isnt that bad and give in and then feel like I want to die for two hours. I've stolen weed from my best friend and my dad, at least an ounce and I didn't even feel bad about it. And even without the pot problems my life is still a failure. I barely do any work and I dont even know why even the work on subjects I like. The only thing that I feel is positive in my life is the fact that I've lost around 70 pounds but that's because of pot. I have ADD and Aspergers and this is the first time I really have ever talked about this in any extent. The only reason I'm even posting this is because I had a breakdown in my room and I'm scared of telling other people. I'm sorry if this is a text dump but I just dont know what to do."
2,"Im trying to figure out whats been going on with me since Late November, Anyone have any suggestions? I feel hopeless right now like it wont ever end!!😩","I would say it started about 3 weeks after I quit smoking towards the end of November, It started with this thought of “am I going crazy” “I’m not feeling normal” “am I losing my mind” it was like it was on repeat nonstop in my head and I just labeled it off as nicotine withdrawal, but I started getting concerned mid December when the thought and a couple other thoughts were still persistent and sticking in my head even though I didn’t want them too, I started getting worried and went into a spree of research online and reddit about anxiety and this kind of similar thing and I found stories about all kinds of intrusive thoughts that get stuck in people’s heads, and one thing I read about was people who get the thought of them all the sudden being GAY or That their sexuality changes to something they don’t want. I remember in my head I was like “dang that would suck to have that thought on blast in my head” and what do you know, a few days later my thoughts started being like “what if you were gay” “oh you looked at that guy, that means you’re gay” all these thoughts are super distressing and the only time they aren’t on blast in my head is when I’m sleeping, I went and saw a physciatrist and he told me all the thoughts I’ve been having are intrusive thoughts related to anxiety, he prescribed me with fluvoxamine 100mg and after taking that for a month and a half I felt a bit better but the intrusive sexuality thoughts are still there. Recently I’ve moved up to 200mg after telling my physciatrist I’m feeling a bit better but still having the intrusive thoughts. I’m on my 2nd day at 200mg but I just wanna know when these thoughts will be gone, I feel so out of wack and not myself one bit because these thoughts cause fear and discomfort, I feel like my libido has dropped and like I can’t talk to women the same while I’m having these intrusive thoughts. Anyone know what’s going on? I’ve only ever been attracted to and had sex with women and I’ve only watched straight porn. I just wanna be back to my old self and it’s like my mind is telling me that I’ll never be the old me again, and it’s really sad to me. Any advice is appreciated!

It just makes me stuck in this mindset that I'll never be better and I'll always be stuck in this frame of mind and thoughts, and I can't get back to my old self!! Is this anxiety? Or what am I going through?!😩

Background: 20 year old male who has never experienced anxiety or anything like this before. Before this onset of intrusive thoughts started I was a daily weed smoker but I’ve quit smoking weed since these thoughts started because whenever I smoke the thoughts are even more distressing and my high isn’t enjoyable like it used to be."
3,I feel like a different person every day,"I feel like I wake up to a new body, house, family, world every day. My opinions and feelings towards people also change every single day. I don't know how else to describe it but I just wonder if anyone else gets the same feelings."
4,How can I stop closing off and becoming distant when I’m feeling hurt/upset/down?,"I know this is something I should speak to a therapist about, but with the whole Covid-19 situation, this is impossible at the moment.

I have a massive issue with closing off when I should speak up. For example, someone may say something to hurt me and I would distance myself and make the situation worse, rather than openly discuss/resolve it with the person. Each time I do this, I have massive regret after, just wishing I had spoken up and not run away. I don’t know how to deal with this, the more I hold onto what I’m feeling, the more I drown in it and I start to feel depressed. I have a history of abuse and I have low self worth sometimes which I believe may tie into this. 

Are there any exercises or approaches I can take to practice this skill? It’s very difficult for me, and is affecting some of my relationships.

Thank you very much."
5,Changing negative thoughts with therapy?,"I have had issues with anxiety for most of my life. My parents have always been very, very anxious people and my older brother was a massive bully. That's not to say my childhood was horrible or severely traumatic but I definitely have many problems with anxiety. I've been trying to make positive changes in my life over the past year. I got out of an awful job with a psychotic boss, I quit drinking, I've been taking an SSRI from my MD, I've cleaned up my diet and have lost over 50 pounds, I've been exercising, trying to get more sleep and just trying to slow down, take on less and enjoy life more. However, I still find myself constantly making negative comments to myself in my head. I've been told more than once that I am extremely hard on myself and have a lot of self esteem issues. 

I've been trying to actively counter the negative thoughts. For example, I was at the store today and just had a normal conversation with the cashier but afterward I kept automatically thinking ""why was I so awkward when talking with that cashier"". I've been trying to counter thoughts like that but I do wonder whether some kind of talk therapy would be advisable. I feel like these days I have really good insight into the nature of my anxiety and why it started and why it's right. I'm sure I already know the answer but would talking with a therapist be what is needed to really push past these issues and move on with my life?"
6,Why do I not feel better that my friend is safe,[deleted]
7,Why is it emotionally difficult and draining to write journal entries every single day?,"I find it hard to write a journal entry almost every day because I feel emotionally drained after having to write one. Maybe it's the fear of feeling vulnerable even when it's just by myself or something else entirely, but I sure hell don't understand shit like this often. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know. Thank you and I appreciate it"
8,I nees a distraction,"Hello. Hello... I'm just getting used to this thing. Testing - 1 2 3 – testing. I'm learning how to use the speaker option on my phone to speak instead of type. This is really a lot faster than it otherwise would have been.


Okay... What do I do to make myself sound interesting and/or intriguing. I love the idea of aliens – out of space kind rather than illegal kind-science, writing sometimes, watching movies, and animals. Anything really having to do it nature, the bigger picture, science. I'm not a scientist or anything... I wish I could be, but I'm not.

Ahhh...what's the point.  If your bored,going through issues, or are lonely, please feel free to comment on this thread.  Anything, I don't care.  I had a bad day and could just use the distraction"
9,[TW: SUICIDE] Does anyone else get very suicidal when they’re hungry?,"I know people get moody whenever theyre hungry, but for some odd reason, I tend to get extremely suicidal whenever I am hungry. I can even go into a mental breakdown and experience delusions (basically thinking that God has deceived us all and we are all sinners, even though I am agnostic/atheist), and it also triggers my POCD. In a nutshell, I become a maniac.
Just as a background, I have ADHD which causes me to forget to eat and also not have the ability to prepare food (executive dysfunction). This means I usually go about 10-12 hours without eating another meal, but often I go entire days without eating. I also have MDD. By any chance, has anyone else experienced this??"
10,I can't cry,"Everytime I try to make my self cry I start to tell my self stuff like it will get better, there is always hope, you don't have to be sad because of this.

Or I just start laugh and say stuff like ""damn bro are you really going to cry because of this (to be fair, this mostly happens when it actually isn't that serious)"
11,I am going insane over the coronavirus. I feel like everything in my house has germs on it.,"My mom has just recently gone through chemo and I live with her and am terrified i will give it to her. Everything i touch i feel has germs, even if it has been sanitized. When my dog goes outside, i’m scared to have her sit on my lap incase she got something on her paws when she was out. I know it is illogical, but i can’t stop. How do i stop myself from this? I have started to have hair loss which happens when i am stressed."
12,I dont know why I was born,"I cant survive like this anymore. I cant hold down a job. I cant keep friends. I dont know what I'm here for... I dont believe in a higher power... life is just so hopeless. All I want is to have never been born. 
Just needed to get that off my chest."
13,Am I selfish?,[deleted]
14,I'm not feel that I belong in nothing. Any advice?,"Since I was 15 I'm never felt that I belong in nothing. I'm not feel that I belong in my city (neighborhood) or with my friends. I'm felt the same when I was in university and I feel the same today in my work. 

It's like all people around me rejects me. It's weird and sad obviously."
15,Comic about PTSD,"Hello, I’m writing a comic about PTSD in children, I wanted to share what I have written so far in terms of story because I want to make sure it can reflect the symptoms and growth of someone who has PTSD as well as make sure it’s not offensive in any shape or form. The story is 6 pages so I appreciate it a bunch if any of you guys read it. 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BByxYDJzw4o2Eltyige4qXZcUYSmy0oaIKX22nC9y3M"
16,Idk how to handle panic attacks. Any advice?,"So I have anxiety which I live with on a day to day basis but ever since this COVID19 I have been having 
Stronger almost panic attacks I feel my chest tighten and my heart pounds I get sharp pains like in my toes and shins. They last for about 20-35 mins even while trying deep breath and get rid it... I cant call my significant other every time I have a panic attack. What should I do...."
17,How to I stop liking sadness and hopelessness?,"I've decided, I wanna get better.

To not only feel good when I'm under the influence.

But fuck man, it's so easy to just be sad and hopeless.

I can't really explain it, but it's like I have so much pent-up emotion, like I'm on the verge of crying but it feels warm and reassuring.

I can't be better and have this at the same time, but I miss crawling back into my cave when I'm doing what I'm supposed to.

I guess it just feels better being sad than feeling empty ""happiness"" .

Like if I'm laughing and having fun with friends, I can stop at anytime and think what I'm feeling doesn't feel real and want to go be sad again, and it doesn't, it feels empty.

There's alot more going on but this is the best I can explain myself.

To be clear, no I don't like being sad. But it's easy and it's ""something"". Happiness is a strange concept to me, I truly believe I haven't experienced happiness in months, naturally atleast. The closest I get to happiness is just a response to something a normal person would enjoy, I guess. This is most of the time, there are exceptions but usually any emotion at all is somewhat pleasant, because they're so rare. 

I guess what I'm asking is how do I stop feeling empty? I was supposed to go to a psychiatrist and find out but that, well got postponed.

I'm sorry for not explaining anything very well, it's hard when you forget what you were about to type in milliseconds."

19,Repeated Dreams,"Every other week or so, I keep on having a dream about a person that I would rather die than see again grab my arm. I rip my arm out of her grip and she starts chasing me and I sprint with all the energy I have. She never catches me but it bugs me as these dreams have been showing up for about 1-2 years. 

This person was a close person in my life once, but betrayed my trust and led me down a path where my light would’ve been extinguished. As soon as I stopped seeing her, I started to have these dreams of an almost “cat and mouse scenario.” My mental health has definitely gotten better and I don’t think of her every second of the day now, but she keeps popping up, no matter how hard I try to erase her from my mind. 

Any tips or answers to what I’m going through? I just want answers because I’m tired of seeing her chasing me down."
20,"""no one cares geez stop posting everywhere""","This was the first thing that greeted me on social media, specifically IG after weeks of disappearance. My ex-boyfriend's closest friends sent me that message online, of course, I only woke up so I was horrified to see that and my anxiety got so worked up in the early morning. They have been bullying me and harassing me on months, usually on Facebook, hence I took a very long hiatus. I have been posting the games I have been playing on my story, when others out there are literally posting 60 seconds TikTok on their stories, or even reposting about the dalgona coffee. I got so mad and worked up, I confronted him.

H: bruh can you stop posting on like every app (keep in mind, I have been inactive, my IG is connected to my FB)  
H: like no one cares geez  
H: nobody cares  
ME: ok? so?  
ME: u don't fucking care? a lot of people do? u don't even follow me so wtf is wrong with u?  
ME: this is my acc i do what i want  
ME: it's so obvious you guys are still bitter im cackling

I checked my IG stories, apparently, my ex-bf and his friends saw it. Keep in mind none of them follow me anymore, my IG story was like only 3 posts so wtf. Just pure videogames.

Because of that, I started crying, I've been trying to control myself, especially my anger because I say a lot of things and do a lot of things that I might regret later on when I calmed down. I reached out to my best friend, who still talks to one of the guidance counselors at their school, to ask if I could talk to his guidance counselor so I could report him. They have been bullying me and harassing me for 6 months already, they always win and I can't wait for karma no more. I think it also triggered my suicidal thoughts, because I thought I wouldn't see this if I just killed myself months ago. Why did I bother staying, if I know they're gonna linger around? I did everything I could to get rid of them, but they're like pests. Always coming back. I wish it would stop, I could never be happy. In fact, I'm not happy anymore.

edit: their guidance counselor didn’t help much, i guess because he was busy. but he told my friend that women can be exaggerated sometimes, but i’ve been literally been lowkey for 6 months... I feel weak."
21,I looking some one with knowledge about aphasia to help me build an application to help those who have it.,"Hello, 

My dad recently had aphasia and I've been learning about it, I would like to create an app specifically for him to help him out with words and stuff, but I don't mind publishing it to help other as well..

if you are interested please let me know.

thanks."
22,Pretty depressed,Pretty depressed...anyone wanna talk?
23,(31/M) a rant to dispell my setbacks and see if others relate...,[deleted]
24,Have you had so many abusive psychologists?,"I had three psychologists and two therapists, all of whom were extremely unprofessional. They named called, yelled and they mocked me. How are they qualified!

My first psychologist was respectful but over the years became more condescending. He immediately supports people I conflicted with and downplayed my problems. He had patients with all kinds of issues but solution to my mine was, “so EASY...it’s Soo EASY...just work (...or twerk?... I’m not sure what said)“. Then, some time later, when my mom was laughing at my response to his remark, he said, “You didn’t have to say it SO Stupidly”. Another time, in response to when I punched my mom in the shoulder (she refused to call the cops on a guy in prison uniform who talked about doing shit to his family (this was in my college campus, not joking, my campus is near the Cleveland Clinic close to the poor neighborhood)) he said, “I wouldn’t punch your mom” he smiled, then he said, “Or you”. At times when I talked he would puckers his lips, when I said why, he said, “He just does that”. 

Once I had a problem with my relatives and with people being disrespectful wherever I go, and I said, “we have to figure out what is behind this”, and immediately he says, “No, YOU have to figure this out”. At times, I hear him whisper “Cunt”, “Bitch” and “Fag”. This was before I repeated this in my head whenever people breathed while they talked. All these years I tried to ignore it, then one day I snapped. I wrote a profanity fueled text calling him a bitch for nearly failing college, for how he was depressed about his ex-girlfriend, how he was as sensitive as I was and how he would like it if someone called him sexual insults. He thought I was a “threat” and sent me to the hospital (This was my second time I was sent during college). I was finished with that punk.   

My college psychologist was a rough headed dike. She puckered her lips like my psychologist. She would immediately sides with the college, without hearing me out. She tried to downplay my problems, saying “I was beating myself up”. I tried to tell her my Professor changed my grade from a D to a B but she assumed it wasn’t true. (The professor called me a cunt and joked about being married to me, so I wanted him in trouble) She said, “Bharath I got a C in Geometry, I’m not taking half the challenging courses you’re taking”. She kept treating me like I was emotional and beating myself up when all I was doing was stating the facts. Then she calls me a “Cunt”. (Not all my psychologists did this, just her and my first one)

I went to a therapist. She was sorry I couldn’t get along with the psychologists but didn’t understand why students were bullying me. I tried explaining that my voice was annoying, I couldn’t articulate/summarize well, I didn’t use the right words or I tend to interrupt conversations when I’m nervous. But after more times with her, she assumed it was because my voice was loud, I appeared rude and I was an A-hole. (I’ve never been insulted for this before) (She didn’t actually say that but you get the point). Another time when I was arguing about how my parents would not let me my bike outside. (I wanted to go out and feel the breeze). She said put a fan over the treadmill. I said “That’s not....”, and she interrupts “Oh REALLY”. Then she started assuming that the insults were “locker room talk” and that I should go back to my old psychologist. When I said no, she offered me a social skills therapist but said I had to find my own psycologist. 

When my social skills therapist heard about how I was kicked out of college, she started yelling. When I stared in disbelief she looked at my mom and said, “Is this how he is at home” as though I committed a crime. She continued to scold me about how, “She is the boss”, “Your displaying POOR social skills” and “La La La La” when I fought back. When I said “Why are you doing this”, she said, “I’m not pussy footing, I’m not gonna lose you like the other psychologists”. (BITCH do you seriously think that. One more time and I’m leaving. (I didn’t actually say that but I was losing patience))

After that, she occasionally yelled but I tolerated it. (One time I called her an A-hole but that was it) She complimented me on how nice I dressed and how handsome I looked. She even thought I would date a girl. She doesn’t understand how the new generation and uses outdated/“pop-psychology” (stress balls, behaving “normal”, etc.), fortunately she never sweared at me. She didn’t call me an idiot, or a punk but she thought I had poor social skills/ I’m an A-hole.

THEN, I was kicked out of college the third time. When I told her it was because I stated to the Dean, “If you treated me like you treated other students, they would bring a gun and shoot up the whole school”. She flipped out. Again she ranted on and on. (Yes I was wrong but should I be kicked out of college over that? No, I should be given a warning, or “educated” on its implication but those pussies thought it was a threat.) I fired back at her, countering her over and over. But despite her weakening she wouldn’t stop. What did she want? Does she want me to go crazy. I decided to leave but before I left the BITCH wanted to talk to my mom (My mom was stupid to think the therapist was yelling at me for my own good). She told my mom she was trying to toughen me up for the real world. How much more do I need? Why is everyone trying to toughen me up. Get off my dick!!

We got a new psychiatrist. He’s a nice guy. Somehow all my psychiatrists are great, (maybe  they don’t hear me talk all day. He recommended I see another psychologist). We found a women and she was similar to the others. Her intentions were against me but unlike the others she was less explicit. One time I was telling her my dreams in life. When I said one of them was modernizing Indian Music, she said, “That sounds like a PITIFUL idea.” (I should have slapped her). One day I could go to her appointment and she kept replacing me with other people. Then my mom tried responding to her but she didn’t respond back. What a bitch!

My mom’s psychologist gave me to her colleague/teacher. Overall he was generous but what he didn’t understand was my impulse. Like the first therapist he thought people had a problem cause my voice sounds loud. One time I responded to his veteran patients (he was talking about my cat) and I blurted “YEAH” (though I meant to say it softly). When I closed his door and left, I could hear him telling the veteran, “YEAH, HUG me”. Apparently with him and my mom psychologist hugging is fucking. But a sin is a sin. DON’T SAY IT if people know what you mean.  

Why is this happening to me. Why is everyone stabbing me in the back. Am I alone?"
25,Even with all the support in the world...,"Even with a massive catalog of family members who care and are willing to listen to some extent. Even with great friends who i am slowly losing touch with out of narcissistic hopelessness invading our every conversation. Even with generous classmates and college professors who are willing to be lenient despite my shoddy track record. Even with perennially disappointed parents who are still willing to support me financially despite my numerous fuck-ups and demonstrations of weak character, despite my hundreds of lies and poor attempts to mask them. Even with all the things they don't know, all the drugs I've abused in the name of self-medication, all the gross things I've done to keep my ego and stamina up, and their continued efforts to support my existence. Even with an entire set of communities on here dedicated to hearing out desperate and tragically self-absorbed folk like me.

Even with all that, I still can't open up. I still can't trust anyone or let myself be fully vulnerable. I still keep my biggest fuck-ups to myself and maybe one close friend, one who is too far away from me as a human to help, to my great disadvantage, probably. I cannot be myself around anyone, maybe even myself.

And I really, really try to. Instead, I hide and pretend not to be a manically unstable character, narcissistic to the bone, unhappy, ungrateful, arrogant, and thoughtless. I still run circles around the same defects of character that I wish desperately I didn't have and juggle my old broken dreams that I desperately want to recover but know I can only achieve with enough fortitude not to be beat down by every single little comment someone makes. And I just don't have that strength, despite my absolute best, most sincere efforts. I try little things every day, but small successes don't feel like successes at all when I know everyone else is doing at least ten times as more as I am and \*they\* don't feel like they're doing enough.

I do not trust opening up. I won't say I am traumatically wounded (emotionally) because I honestly don't think I've suffered enough in any way, knowing that people have it way worse and still make it out unscathed, but letting out a sliver of who I really am to anyone almost invariably results in me being told to man up and deal with it, that everyone has problems, that I have to do something about it (like I'm not fucking trying), that I can't wallow in sadness, that I should stay positive, that I should count my blessings, yadda yadda yadda.

At this point, I have little interest in upkeeping any relationships as my real self. It takes some real effort to hide the truth of me, but it would take more effort dealing with the inevitable monsoon of self-hatred that would come out of me being actually honest with anybody and not do drugs, self harm, or otherwise damage myself. I'm stuck, stuck in this tiny room with a dim lightbulb of an ego, keeled over and completely stricken and paralyzed by the fear of the world around me.

I guess I'm just venting. I hate doing this day after day after day, but it feels like a minuscule relief to write it down somewhere. I still have hope, even with my dwindling will to live and my microscopic amounts of motivation. I am aware I am personally responsible for fixing myself and that no one else will do it for me. I want to care more, and I certainly care that I don't care, but honestly? I just don't care right now, despite my truest efforts."
26,How do you operate once things get better?,"Hey there,

I've been unable to find any answers on this online so I was wondering if anybody had advice or could point me in the direction of online resources. I won't get into the history of my mental health journey but suffice to say it was long. For years I spent time in counselling for things like abandonment, physical/mental/sexual abuse, and a few other things. It was during this time I accepted through the advice of counsellors that the best I could ever get to was a baseline functional.  


Coping rather than fixing I guess would be a better way of putting it.  


For the past 8 years I've been pushing improving my mental health with lots of ups and downs and then almost exactly a year ago, I made one large push with a big life change (moving and school). For the past year I've not so much focused on mental health (like coping mechanisms) as I have on getting ready for school, being a parent and partner, and just not being all over the place.  


About 2 months ago, I noticed I started to feel odd. Couldn't figure out what it was until I realized it was happiness (sustained, not just momentary) and a peace I'd never felt. And then a week ago something bigger happened and I've been unable to focus since.  


As far back as I can remember, I've never been attached to living (I've got journals from at least 10 stating the same). Not suicidal, at least not anymore , but just more akin to the feeling someone gets about taking a trip to visit family far away. And recently, well, it's starting to go away and now my mind is in a panic.  


I'm panicking about feeling good and alive and this hasn't happened. Some days it's like food I've eaten my whole life tastes better and I can focus a bit more on achieving milestones.  


Does anyone have any advice about how to deal with the anxiety of that? I now have this anxiety about having something inside me I can only describe as precocious; like I'm holding porcelain in my chest.  


I'm sorry if this is nonsense I'm just unsure what to do.  


Thanks again"
27,Is it normal that my friend doesn't acknowledge what I say and just jumps to a different topic?,"So just a little context for you to understand where I'm coming from, the whole socializing thing is relatively new since my entire childhood and the majority of my teen years was spent under a rock, my mom (now deceased) was over protective which actually backfired into me falling into verbally abusive friend groups in middle and high school that took advantage of my limited understanding of friendly vs abusive gestures. I have since left that friend group as well as the entirety of my conditioning as a child. I am much less socially anxious than I used to be since I'm around friends who are a lot more accepting and I don't feel embarrassed to be myself around. 

But there is one friend who kinda makes me not want to say anything at all whenever we hang out or when we're talking on our FB Messenger group chat. Whenever I have any input to the conversation or maybe say something to start conversation, he'll just verbally butt in front of me with a completely different topic as if I don't exist. I understand that conversing on a chat is a bit different, like I totally understand if I said something when no one was there and then 5 hours later a friend talks about something happening right then for them. But it's like, if people haven't been talking for a while, I'll say something like, ""I tried mountain biking for the first time today and really enjoyed it."" and then almost immediately after as if I didn't say anything, he'll steal the conversation with starter about a completely different topic.

Usually 1 or 2 friends will acknowledge what I said which makes me feel better, and I think I should really focus on that instead of being butthurt by that one friend, but it really triggers that social anxiety I used to have from when I had abusive friends who made me feel like I was insignificant. And this doesn't just happen online, it can also happen when we're hanging out in our little group, like I'll start saying something and he just butts in, or worse yet they kinda collectively are just so focused on what one of them is about to say that when I start talking they'll just start talking, it's like they don't expect me to have something to say which makes me feel like they inherently aren't interested. I think I should definitely call him out, but I just wanted to see if it's me missing something since I still have a lot to learn about socializing. The insignificance this makes me feel about what I have to say also makes me afraid to call him out because it makes me feel like I'm over reacting and what I do have to say really isn't that significant."
28,Never bored when i am alone,"Just wanted to know if i am the only one who feels like this because everyone i have talked to cant really relate to this.

I am never bored when i am alone even when i am doing nothing. The only time i get bored is when i am around other people that also includes my friends (close ones too)... I dont really understand why but i tend to zone out of conversations or just want to go home because i am bored. It is also a reason why i dont go out a lot or dont like to talk to other people on the phone. Dont get me wrong i love my friends and enjoy their company when i am with them but i just get so bored sometimes and that is never the case when i am alone. Even in quarantine i always hear people complain of being bored but i have enjoyed it so far and could do this for a few more months lol. I also havent had a lot of contact with my friends and colleagues (havent replied to messages and if i do it takes up to 4 days to reply) because i am too lazy to text back and dont really want to start a conversation I would rather have in person.

In conclusion am unproductive, like to do nothing but lay in bed all day and dont like to socialize

So now i am a bit worried because it seems like i am the only one who feels this way and it is usually common or known that humans like to socialize and seek contact to others but i am somehow the complete opposite.

I apologize if there are a lot of mistakes because english is not my first language. Hope you can understand the gist of it and help me out :)"
29,Anxiety isn’t bearable,"Quarantine hasn’t helped with my anxiety. It’s gotten to the point where it paralyzes me at times. I feel like I’m being torn from the inside out and it makes me throw up. Idk what to do, my mom gets mad when I try to ask for help. Is there ANYTHING I can do to help relive this? I’m desperate"
30,I'm So Alone,"I can't explain, but I'm not whole I feel a piece of me is missing. I can't go a day in my life feeling alone, empty and a husk of  something I've never seen. It's always been like this. All my life a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and an over whelming desire to end it all. I have no idea why."
31,Quarantine messing up your health?,"How has your health been since quarantine had been issued?
What have you done to make the most of it?

Having a hard time here and there."
32,Skin Hunger.,"So, there is this thing called ""skin hunger"", which is a desire for physical contact with another person( not sexually ) after not being touched for a long time. My family doesn't really hug. I haven't been in school to see my friends to hug them. Not being touched or hugged takes a toll on my mental health. What do I do? "
33,Help me,"So, I'm not sure if i really have anxiety but here how I feel, i would feel sometimes, i would feel like other people are mocking me or judging me when they look at me, i feel like my opinion doesn't matter and sometimes everything would be okay then sadness would kick in, i would cry for no reason somtimes... would feel uncomfortable around huge groups of people and if someone i feel like they're laughing at me, my hand would shake, my heart beat goes fast would look around and change my sitting place, i would move in and out of place, i would Sutter sometimes.. I'm so sarced help"
34,Not doing good,I am not doing okay. I am overwhelmed and anxious. During therapy today my therapist said I was so anxious I was giving them anxiety. With everything going on (not just covid) I am feeling like I am drowning and grasping at straw. I am not going to do anything I just need to vent my feelings.
35,How do I handle high stress caused by dumb mistakes that ultimately won’t hurt me much?,"I recently failed to submit a quiz on time and will receive a 20% grade penalty on the free response portion because of it. 

Here’s the thing though; I’m taking the class Pass / No pass. I only need a 50% to pass the class and 35% of my grade is just attendance and homework. By the time I get to finals (worth 25%) my grade will very likely already be over 50% (I.e. enough to skip the final and still pass)

Altogether, this mistake should be of minimal consequence in the long run, but I still couldn’t help but break down into tears after I did that. I just have these negative thoughts about myself worth that linger on for a really long time, and I have no idea how to take care of myself mentally. It seriously sucks :("
36,Any good alternatives to self harm,"It is confirmed, I am definitely hated and alone. This is will for sure just fuel my fire to do further damage on my body. I have done minor self harm before, such as scratching and whatever. But lately it’s gotten worse. And tonight I have just confirmed to myself that the friends I thought I had and the friends I thought trusted in me do not. They don’t trust me, they don’t feel comfortable with me, and they definitely don’t want to talk to me anymore. Now, with this confirmation in my mind, I am worried that my methods of harm are going to quickly turn for the worse. I need the pain for punishment, so I was wondering if anyone has suggestions for non harmful ways to punish myself for being such an awful person that nobody needs in their life. Thanks y’all"
37,how do i handle ptsd when my mom constantly does stuff to trigger me?,"i have ptsd + bipolar so it's not a good combo. my mom knows my triggers and doesnt believe my trauma, so she constantly talks about things that make me upset and harasses me about the past. this would lead to extreme rages and mental breakdowns from me. i have no friends and so loneliness also takes a part. i was just wondering how i could keep my cool and try my best to stay semi-stable when she says stuff. also, whenever i tell her to leave me alone, she doesn't. im kind of hopeless now. ive dug too deep into my mind
 so yeah, any ways i could stay connected with reality instead of going on rages and disassociating? this is too personal but i would really appreciate the help, thanks!"
38,Am I a narcissist?,"I’ve been mentally ill since I was born but sometimes I wonder if I’ve become a narcissist person because I always want to feel special on the eyes of others, I want others to recognize me and notice me In a superior way..."

40,I want to die,"I want to die. I want to die so fucking bad. Being in quarantine is getting into my head and my mental health is just deteriorating. I feel like I'm stuck inside my negative mindset without anywhere to go. I'm failing a class in school and the only way to pass it is to pass my final. There's no way I would be able to do that. I do so many extracurricular activities but it would be useless if I'm no longer eligible for a UC. My dream school is UC Davis but I'm afraid that my only option is now community college. I'm not shitting on it. It's just I can't go. It's not my dream school and my parents will be disappointed in me. Aside from that. I also broke up with my boyfriend a while back. It's been over 7 months but I don't know why I am still sad about it. Please help. I hate being sad so much. I hate it. I really do fucking hate it. My heart still skips a beat when he texts me. And my whole day goes sour when he doesn't. He was my first boyfriend I ever had. I know that this may just be your typical high school girl drama but honestly, it's been negatively impacting me so much to the point where I just don't just want to feel anything anymore.

 Please help. I am fucking sad."

43,Questions for those with ASPD - do you experience love and emotion?,"I've been interested in learning about mental illnesses since my freshman year of high school. I've learnt a lot, but I'm not yet familiar enough with personality disorders. Recently, I've been researching ASPD, and it has answered a lot of my questions but also left me with many. I'm eager to better understand the disorder but I keep reading things that completely contradict each other, so I have a few questions for those of you with ASPD who are willing to answer. If you don't want to answer all, feel free to pick and choose.

1. Are you able to experience love in any way? Whether it be for your family, friends, or a romantic partner? If so, have you ever been in love?
2. Do you experience emotions? Sadness, excitement, anger, fear? I've seen a lot of different answers to this question, some saying they don't feel emotions at all and some saying that they do feel them, but just on a lesser scale. If you do feel them, what's an example of something that might make you sad? Has a book, movie, or tv show ever made you cry?
3. Do you ever experience anxiety? Social or generalized? If so, does conversation/social settings make you nervous?
4. Do you have any other mental illnesses comorbid with your ASPD?
5. Did you experience trauma during your childhood that you feel caused/contributed to your ASPD? Or do you think you were born with it?
6. Are you very impulsive? Does your impulsivity get you into trouble or are you able to take a step back and think about the consequences of something before doing it?
7. Are you able to experience empathy, guilt, or remorse in any way? If so, what's something you might feel bad about doing?
8. Do you consider yourself to be a ""good"" person?
9. What led to you being diagnosed? Did you or your family/friends just realize that something was different? Or did something happen that led to it?
10. Do you fake your emotions? If so, how often, and why do you? Is it because it's a helpful manipulation tactic, or is it just easier to fake your emotions to ""fit in the crowd"", so to speak?
11. Do you deal with extreme boredom? If so, what are your healthy and/or unhealthy coping mechanisms for your boredom (if any)? Do you eat or use drugs/alcohol?
12. In general, do you use substances a lot? If so, which ones and why?
13. Do you ever get obsessed over anything, or do you have any current obsessions? If so, do these obsessions form out of boredom or something else?
14. Do you enjoy any creative activities, such as writing, painting, making music, making videos, etc? If so, what do you enjoy and what do you like about it? Do you ever use creativity as a way to express yourself?
15. Do you have a ""fantasy world"", or do you ever daydream?
16. Do you have high or low cognitive empathy?
17. What is something you wish more people understood about ASPD?

This a lot of questions, but I'm genuinely curious and would love to see what you guys have to say. I know mental illnesses exist on a spectrum and so not everyone will have the same experiences, but all answers are appreciated!"
44,"In a psychiatric hospital, what specific questions do they ask you in GROUP therapy","If I’m staying in a psych ward I would have one-on-one therapy but they also have group therapy questions. 
For those of you who have been, do you know/remember any of the specific questions the doctors asked the group?"
45,"To those with ASPD - When listening to music, do you focus mostly on lyrics or sound?","For those of you with antisocial personality disorder, I'm curious - do you care more about lyrics or sound when listening to music? In your opinion, is a ""good song"" one with good lyrics or a good beat/melody? Or both?"
46,I was molested at 4 now I can't even feel sexual feelings without feeling gross,"Okay so, when I was 4 my friends older sister was really sexual with me. I wasn't forced into it but I really didn't know what we were doing. She told me it was a game so I just went along with it. She would show me porn. Tell me to do stuff with her and shit like that. So at that age I would do inappropriate things when alone, make my toys do inappropriate things. Even draw stuff like that. It wasn't until I was older did it hit me like a ton of bricks. I never felt so gross in my life. The sense of shame was unbearable.  I hate being touched and when I start to feel sexual feelings I would hate myself for it. Anytime I did end up touching myself I would end up hating myself for it. It feels gross. Just now it's starting to make me depressed afterwards. Maybe because being locked up and away from my friends has heighten my anxiety and emotions in general. It's easier to get mad and annoyed by things. I can go months without the want to touch myself but when I do it's intense sometimes. It has kept me up all night a few times. I just don't know how to be okay with it. Maybe it's just cuz I'm 17 and still figuring shit out. I thought maybe getting a girlfriend would help but it's kinda hard to find one when you only really hangout with guys and the only girl you know who has some attraction to girls is a bit obsessed with one of your best friends. I just don't know how to not feel this way. Any help would be appreciated."
47,I am struggling to cope with this powerful sensation,[deleted]
48,"I just want to talk and, for once, have somebody actually listen.","I have very poor mental health, and since the beginning of quarantine I have spiralled. I’m not in a good place. I have had nobody in my life to talk to about my feelings, as I am cut off from my family. I have 2 friends, but I can’t talk to them about my mental illness, they just aren’t the emotional kind of friends. I’m sick of bottling things up and overthinking everything and I just want another real human being to talk to who will actually listen to what i’m trying so hard to deal with by myself.
Small chance anyone will but please dm me? ;-;"
49,How do I help my bf during quarantine?,"My boyfriend (22) had a history of depression and has begun to shut me out (F21). We aren’t physically with each other and I don’t know how to help. He’s becoming bitter and hopeless about this situation and I worry about him. I’ve encouraged him to do things he enjoys but he’s bored and feels the days are pointless. In our 4 years together he has never slipped back into his depression but I fear this will be it. 

I told him that I worry about him, I’m here for him and I need him to talk to me. I asked him what’s going on and he says the same thing, that he wants this to be over and it won’t be for a long time. I asked him to communicate with me even if it’s to say leave me alone but he says there’s nothing for us to talk about.. that hurt a little bit. 

I’m putting together a care package for him and I need some ideas to help improve his mental health. He loves working with his hands like building and wood working but doesn’t really have supplies at home. Money is tight as we both lost our jobs but I am willing to spend ~$100 on this package. Any advice or item suggestions for the package are very appreciated. Thank you"
50,Therapy,"My therapist wasn't bad, but she wasn't good. For the first 30 minutes, we talked. She would then call my mom in and recap everything for her. She kinda asked me if it was okay but still. Is she supposed to do that? How are therapists supposed to be?"
51,I’m not suicidal because I kinda don’t care anymore. It worse but at-least I don’t want to die.,"So, I have a bleeding heart. 

I literally lie awake at night and I think about farm animals and modern slaves and the environment and politics and all this horrible stuff. 

COVID19 didn’t really get under my skin cos I was like: “cool stack it on, I don’t give a shit” 

And I used to just think about offing myself because I can’t watch this anymore, and because I realized I could never have children because I’d be dooming them to a fucked planet. It’d be cruel to have kids honestly. 

Anyway, and I’m getting closer to this numb kind of “fuck it” attitude where it just doesn’t affect me anymore. Where I’m just waiting for the inevitable with no remorse or pain. 

So yay, no more suicidal thoughts, instead I just smoke weed all day, and run, and skip meals and watch myself get thinner and stare at YouTube for hours so I stay numb. 

But at-least I don’t want to kill myself."
52,What exactly is my brother’s issue?,"I get his charger for him, it’s outside.

I take an extra step, plug it in for him just because.

He goes in living room with the lights off, then randomly calls me in to turn on the light and check the thermostat. I ask why he can’t do those things.

&gt; Ugh I have a migraine!

Then he calls me a name or whatever and made fun of me. I told him he’s lucky I’m in a decent mood and didn’t walk away entirety."
53,Help with a number?,Hi I'd just like some help please. Someone to call. I'm not doing okay. Can I get a number to call please?
54,I feel like my mental health issues are exacerbated by my strong social conscience - and at the moment I feel terrible and conflicted.,"I do a lot of activism work. I have always cared about the world, about all of the injustices perpetuated against women, against minorities, against animals, against the environment etc. I realised a long time ago that doing nothing made the general depression and anxiety I feel much, much worse. 

I got caught up in a group last year that was really bad for my mental health. They were/are very controlling and there was a lot of sexism and stuff that they didn't address (which, for leftists, is obviously an ideological inconsistency). I left. 

But since then, I've felt really adrift. Politically that group aligned with me perfectly - and all the other groups around my area don't. It makes me feel very disillusioned with the whole thing, and totally powerless. 

I want to help people. I want to make a difference. But I've mostly given up on activist circles, they're too toxic. But, coming to this realisation (in the middle of a crisis, where I literally can't do anything except stay at home alone with my own thoughts) has put me in a really, really bad place. For the first time in a long time I'm at a ""can't get out of bed, no appetite, no desire to do anything"" depressive episode. And I really can't see any way out of it. 

I feel like I should use this time to do...something. But I can't stop thinking about all the suffering, and how stupid and pathetic I am for giving up over personal conflicts. 

This is a bit of a rant, so, any advice would be nice."
55,Can someone be suicidal without being depressed? I know how that sounds but hear me out.,"TL;DR: I'm questioning if I'm actually depressed or if I'm really just too sensitive and stubborn for the world. 

This isn't the first time I've questioned the severity of my condition. When it was at its worst, I told myself that I wasn't depressed. With multiple hospitalizations, multiple visits with psychiatrists, multiple therapy sessions, and more under my belt, I still question if I'm actually depressed or if I'm simply too weak for the world. 

It often seems like so many have it worse than me and don't have access to the resources I do, like therapy and medication, but they're stronger than I am because they keep going without those things. I have those things but I'm not getting better as much as I'd like to. I know everyone says that healing doesn't happen fast but it honestly seems like I just can't do it. Sometimes it feels like my issues are locked in my subconscious and I'm wasting my time because I can't reach them. 

So, yes, I do question if I'm really sick or if I'm just too sensitive. I do want to stop existing from time to time but is any of that valid? I think and think and think, but I don't actually act on it. I have before but haven't in years. I'm actually aware that I'm scared to die. But sometimes I really don't want to be here anymore. I'm still a sensitive person and I only cry if I feel miserable about my thoughts or my SI. I used to cry at things like sad movies and stories but for the last couple years, those things don't affect me anymore. It seems the only thing that can make me cry is my own pain."
56,Lack of purpose or motivation,"I dont know if this is the right place to be posting this , but here goes

About a month ago corona virus came to norway which lead to everything that was a necessity getting shut down. Which means gyms, hang out spots and pretty much everything social in my life. 

I am 18 years old and basically live by myself. I am an apprentice line worker and only work with guys way older than me. So I dont get to be around many guys my age. My dad works away and so does my mom and brother. They only get back weekends meaning im alone the whole work week. They work in key positions so they arent sent home or quarintined.

So basically my life consits of work and being home. I play video games but I dont have anyone to play with so i end up spending the day alone and can go the 7/8 hrs i spend at home without saying a word. 

I have now realised my life is pretty sad. I have realised i have nothing I look forward too. Cant be with friends. Family isnt home. And my motivation for working out and eating healty is at the so far gone I cant catch it. I bascially eat like trash and spend my days sleeping or living in my own little corner with s population of 1

Any help on this from people who are or have been in similar positions would be greatly appreciated"
57,Kind of depressed...,"Because of the fact I can't work or really don't want to. I'm 48 years old and living with my parents still. Gone through alot of trauma in my life, especially with family. Feel like I had some good chances at love when I was younger. But, i blew all that due to fear and problems in my life. I've tried working but i always got depressed and walked away. I eventually got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and started. Medication. I'm on ssi disability. I just feel like i have no future or hope left especially when it comes to romantic relationships. I don't feel anybody would really want me after all this besides i might not even like myself. I just feel tired and unmotivated half the time."
58,Use discord to keep date night alive for long distance relationships and stave off the loneliness. Watch hulu and other streaming services with friends and family,"So I dont know if this really belongs here, but it got removed from r/youshouldknow because post about social media are banned.

Also it deals with loneliness and its helped me and my girlfriend.

A little backstory first. If you dont care for the back story skip to the line of dashes.


Back in november I moved out of state for school leaving my girlfriend of 6 years behind. I wasn't too far away from her but it meant instead of seeing her whenever I wanted I could only see her about once a week. Due to some scheduling conflicts i didn't get to see her in January or February, and by the time I got time to see her we were in full blown covid panic. My girlfriends mother (who she lives with) was potentially exposed to the virus at her church and I'm an essential employee so I am high risk. Her mother is elderly and not in the best health so we dont want to run the risk of me accidentally exposing her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So anyways Discord has an option to stream your computer screen to your voice chat servers. You can stream hulu, disney+, amazon prime video, Netflix, and any other web based streaming platform. You can also stream media player apps and such. 

So my girlfriend and I have been keeping our bad horror movie date nights alive by streaming them. Is it as good as watching them while cuddling on the couch? No. But is it better than being lonely and missing the date nights you used to have before the coronapocalypse? Absolutely. This might be common knowledge to most people but I felt like people should know in case there's someone out there who misses going to the movies with friends or having bad horror movie nights with their long distance girlfriend.

Stay safe out there friends."
59,I feel to exhausted to go to school,"I’ve struggled with some bad stuff for some time now and it has led me to a state of pretty bad exhaustion and I haven’t felt like going to school, my teachers have talked a lot with my parents about going another year in school and I really want to avoid that, does anyone have any tips on how to get up and just go to school anyways? If so please let me know, thanks🤍"
60,Can't connect with anyone anymore,"In the past few months my mental health dropped just like rain. Despite all the treatment I do, the medication I take, I feel worse than ever and suicidal thoughts are somewhat recurrent. I no longer enjoy any of the things I used to, especially art. I cant open up to anyone because I feel like all of my friendships are falling apart and I have no energy to go after anyone to reconnect or smth. Thing is everything now is just pointless, since I dont feel like improving my skills to establish a career, I'm too exhausted to go after people and I don't want to annoy them with all I've been suffering since I have nothing else to talk about anymore. This is just the top of the iceberg but I'm feeling so disconnected from everything that not even the words make sense in my head anymore."
61,Super confused,"I’ve been questioning my sexuality for a long time. I tried telling myself I was gay for a few days but realized I liked girls. I tried telling myself I was bi which worked but it doesn’t feel right. I’ve noticed something that I have a huge problem. I’m pretty sure I’m straight, even though I masturbate to gay porn. I know it sounds crazy but for some reason it all adds up. Usually when I’m feeling confident in myself. I don’t care for gay porn and I really want to have sex with girls and stuff. When I’m not self confident it’s like I hate myself so I resort to stuff. I feel like a girl could never love me and I couldn’t because I’m just too insecure. Earlier I was feeling good about myself but now I feel like shit and can’t even like a girl. If I’m gay or bi it’s fine, but being straight just seems right for me. Idk what’s up, maybe I should try to get more self confidence?"
62,How can I be providing therapy when I'm a mess myself?,"My company has started doing telehealth with our families and clients since our early intervention clinic is closed due to Covid. All of my sessions are done on the bed or bedroom floor because of HIPPA, and the fact that my husband is also working from home. We're in a 1 bedroom apartment. Even parks and trails are chained up and locked, so there's very few options for a safe change of scenery. I feel guilty saying I can't take any more clients ( I have 4 clients and will soon have 6) because I'm the only clinician without kids or family to take care of, and we're being paid our full salary ( at least for this month). I'm having a harder and harder time holding myself together. I can't sleep, I'm crying on and off all the time, and I'm becoming anxious about everything. I don't know how to say no, or even if I can, and I just want to unplug everything and make these responsibilities go away. But I can't - because my clients and their families are hurting even more.  I don't know how long I can maintain this."
63,Pretty sure I have depression.,So in terms of depression even my dad thinks I have it. Some days I feel worthless to the world and to be honest that I’m better off in a ditch. Also with anxiety everytime I was out going to PE my bowel would literally go nuts. I would have so much anxiety it would f up the whole session.

65,"All I want to do is be with my friends, and when I'm not I feel my life is meaningless.","I have become very close with a couple I've known for a long time. Friends since childhood with him, and since teens with her, but we've never really been close. Now we talk, play games or hang out almost every day. We've become family to each other. I think our deeper friendship formed at a time where we all needed it and now they're the realest friends I've ever had. I've never been this close with anyone.

To give some context about myself, I struggle with depression and purpose. I'm constantly in a state of confusion and frustration with life. I have nothing I want except to live freely and be with the people I love. I hate working, I struggle with the feeling that I have nothing to live for. I have things I enjoy, I make music, art, photography. I used to think I wanted to pursue a career within my passions, but not even that doesn't spark any sense of purpose in me. 

I've always said the meaning of life is what you personally make of it. For me I've always thought that I should make the most of it, do what I want, and enjoy it. But I can't. I can't just tell myself to enjoy something. The only thing that makes me feel peaceful and forget about my lack of purpose is being with my friends. Then it all disappears mostly. So from that I've inferred that my sense of meaning comes from being around my friends, showing and feeling love.

But even then it comes back. When I'm with my friends for prolonged periods of time and then go home, it comes back really hard. I'll be debilitated for days, crying and feeling no hope for life. I'm tearing up just writing this because I'm in it right now. I see no escape, I see no way of getting better, I have to work everyday, I'm not free, society tells me I have to have kids and a family, and even though I know caring for people gives me purpose I feel that finding a girl and having kids for the sole reason of me feeling purpose is just wrong. Especially with the way I feel about life currently. 

It's not fair to my friends to feel this way, because they do love me and I love them. But I'm really frustrated. I can't help myself, I can't make myself feel better. I'm already in therapy, and that's helped me be more aware of my patterns and my relationships, but it doesn't change how I feel about life. I truly feel like I'm doomed. Like I'm not built for this world and that content is unachievable for me. I really don't know what to do except be with my friends. I feel horrible all the time. Its more than depression. Depression is a consequence of this, this is existential dread or discontent or something.

What do I do? Is there any specific form of therapy for this stuff, because psychotherapy isn't doing much to alleviate this feeling."
66,"Parent experiences high disorientation, and forgets simple facts very quickly."," I am not sure if this is neurological or related to mental health,  but let's give it a shot here. This is something I have seen happen to  them a lot, and I finally want to understand what it is. In stress  situations the person starts forgetting simplest of facts. For example  while we were playing a sports game as a family on my console, the  person kept forgetting in what direction we play (and couldn't figure it  out on their own). 

What really bothers me, is that I inherited this. So  when I am in stress, especially when facing a sudden decisions, I panic  and my brain empties, and forgets most basic facts. When I can prepare  for something (like an exam) that can take the problem completely away.  

During my school days we had a ton of pop quizzes which triggered this  black out quite often. In High school I became amazing at anticipating  these pop quizzes. However, I can't prepare for situations I don't  expect. 

Has anyone an idea what this is? The parent in question has BPD,  but I am not sure if this is even related."
67,Anxiety can be frightening as hell,"Anxiety has so many frightening symptons, alot of people are only under the assumption that anxiety is only in the mind. but there are so many physical symptoms that you can get because of anxiety, stress and panic, alot of these symptoms can be frightening, but it is your body's way of actually protecting you. If you look into each symptom and why anxiety causes that symptom you will see there is an explanation as to how that symptom protects you and why it happens!!

68,Should people elaborate their reasons for suicide?,[deleted]
69,This social distancing is killing me,"While I understand the need for it, it’s ruining my mental health. I was never in my life in that great of a place mentally, but now I feel I’m falling off the deep end. I’m stuck home with my psychologically abusive mom and “step father” who don’t deserve either of those titles. Came to this town 3000km from home to work. I was supposed to have gone home looong ago. I got laid off from a job that I loved and probably would not have gotten laid off otherwise. Now, because I have no other choice, I’m stuck here with people who hate me and who I, myself, hate. And I can’t even leave when I want to. 

I love to socialize. I love being around people. I love meeting new friends, meeting women, engaging in social activities ranging from bars, to jams (I’m a musician), to the gym, to swimming pools, basically any excuse to get out of the house. I had huge plans for this year to get my life on track and be successful, and they all got ripped away from me in the matter of a week. 

I’m fading away now. I spend my days playing my guitar until I get fed up with it, avoiding the people I live with, chain smoking and drinking. Because what else is there to do? I’ve lost the desire to eat, i can’t sleep properly, I can’t play video games with my friends because I’m sick of that too. It’s destroying me. I’m so god damn lonely and I don’t know how long I can last. 

Right now I’d even take a bad case of coronavirus over this. I’d trade my physical health to have my life and my mind back to normal. And you know what? If coronavirus were to actually kill me at this point I wouldn’t even give a fuck. If I can’t live my life and enjoy my freedom, I don’t even want to live at all. 

They’re saying “this is the new norm”, “social distancing blah blah blah”, “only leave the house for essentials”. Well god dammit to me being a free man is essential. 

I can’t live like this and if I have to stay in social isolation for any long period of time I know I won’t survive it. And the worst part is? I know I won’t be the only one. Not by a long shot."
70,Idk who else to turn to,"This is my first time posting on this subreddit so apologises if I'm not doing anything correctly and apologises for being confusing.    


I'm 15 and ever since I was 12 I've had issues with my dad, it eventually led to me developing depression and anxiety. During 2019 I was seeing a few therapists but my dad didn't like it.   
After my parents got a divorce and my mum moved to a different country, my mental health got a lot worse. I eventually was admitted to a mental hospital for attempting to commit suicide.  I spent a few days there and my dad wanted me to fake being fine to get discharged. From then onwards if I ever did any small thing wrong, he'd threaten to break my neck or send me back to the mental hospital, saying ""I'm crazy"". I wanted to live with my mum but it isn't possible to move to where she is, so I have to stay with my dad until I'm 18. 

Since the beginning of 2020 things, have gotten a bit better. I try my best to help my dad so he doesn't make everyday life unbearable. But if I ever do one small thing wrong he starts verbally abusing me...  Telling me I'm worthless, useless, it's better if he killed me when I was just born and much more. I'm used to those insults and I know that's not okay. I met my best friend and now boyfriend last year and ever since we've met, he helped me learn how to treat myself better and be happier. Everything started to get better, but all good things don't always last long.

Today I displeased my dad by just asking my younger brother a normal question which had the word 'what' in it. I had asked him, 'What do you want?' and immediately I get yelled at and threatened to be beaten (my dad has beaten me when I was smaller for anything small like crying). He starts spouting about how useless I am, I was used to all of that so it didn't make me sad anymore. He then brought my boyfriend into it, saying that he influenced me to become an even worse person.  I was always yelled at for being happy and that made me scared of smiling, laughing in my family. But lately, I've been happier, smiling more, laughing more etc. He then points out the time I spent with my boyfriend in VC (voice chat) is making me more useless and disgraceful. 

If I don't stop showing I'm happy, he'll make sure to get rid of my boyfriend. Like I mentioned earlier my boyfriend has helped me become happier. He is the only person who supported me when I was in a dark time so to me if he isn't there, it's hard to keep going. This may sound stupid and dramatic but he's my escape. 

I don't want to feel trapped like before. I need help to cope with all this."
71,Can someone please give me advice? Im clueless on how to help a struggling friend,"My friend has been struggling with non-diagnosed depression (im almost certain he suffers from it) and anxiety. I won't go into detail about what he's talked about, but its all stuff that worries me. He has mentioned he has had the thought of suicide but he knows how it would affect others, making him not go through with it. He hasn't spoken to any adults or professionals about his issues and has only told me and another person who he believes he drove away because of the stuff he told them. (problems he has yet to tell me) and he has expressed he only plans on getting help once he gets a job and moves into his own place, making it so no one has to know what he's been going through, which would happen, in theory, in about 6-8 years or so. He doesn't plan on getting help before then, and he never wants anyone to worry about him or give him empathy. This has been going on for a while, and with the pandemic going on its hard to reach out to professionals in person. I don't know what to do."
72,"I am listening Hannah Montana-nobody's perfect, Should I tell about it to my psychiatrist?","We are trying new meds, and I am listening Hannah Montana, I wonder if I should tell that I am listening Hannah Montana.

73,Life is hard ..,"I'm really struggling with suicidal ideation, and I'm only not killing myself because I don't want to hurt my grandma."
74,I don't understand why I'm panicking,"I don't get it. I'm not even in a bad situation right now, i rent with both my boyfriend and best friend and this pandemic has brought us all together and we've had nothing but fun playing games and watching anime. I'm just sitting in bed, snuggled up to my boyfriend, freaking out over nothing. I keep doing it, it keeps happening and I don't know why. I think it has to do with money worries, but my boyfriend has told me over and over that we are fine, my mom has told me she won't let us go hungry or be homeless, my family says they will help and so does his. Why am I panicking so much still? Why am I still so scared? Why am I freaking out when I should be calm? I don't understand, I just want to be happy. Part of me feels like I've been wasting this time and I should be doing important things but that's nothing to have a panic attack over. I've got tomorrow and I'm sure plenty more time to do things, so why am I scared? Why do I feel like everything is falling apart? I know there's people in way way way worse situations. I feel like even the thought of being anxious despite being in such a good situation makes me a dick. I just don't know what to do"
75,Meth-Induced Schizophrenia,"Not sure if this is the right sub. Perhaps I am just venting.

My sister has just about every single mental health issue you can name. Anxiety, depression, meth-induced schizophrenia, PTSD etc. Because of the shutdown she (28F) is now living with me (26M) and my family. My parents adopted her daughter (9) because she went to prison for a while. Her halfway house was shut down to stop the spread of COVID. She is also in recovery from a nasty heroin addiction. She was doing great for a few months then things have just gone downhill fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggle with PTSD and depression. Passively suicidal all the time. Hearing her when she is in a bad state, she repeats herself constantly, is extremely irritable, and is constantly hearing voices. I heard her last night while I was taking a nap before work saying that she can ""feel them in her eyes"". among other things said. 

&amp;#x200B;

It hurts me so much because she is in so much pain. I feel terrible because I think it would be a mercy if she wasn't alive any longer. Frankly, I don't want her near my family or her own daughter. While I do want to be as supportive as possible to my sister; it is an extremely toxic situation in our house. Whenever my sister is staying at our house, my dad casually mentions being passively suicidal because those two personalities are extremely conflicting. I don't want my niece raised in this toxic environment and while I think it sounds cruel to kick my sister to the curb, she made her choices.

I don't know what I need right now."
76,Explaining How I Feel In A Metaphorical Sense,"My brain is a house, and in my house i have parties. At those parties, those guest i know drop by; happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, but like every party, the guest eventually leave. One day, someone new knocks on the door, I don’t know who they are or where they came from, but they showed up uninvited, and went inside my house. “Maybe it’s just another houseguest” I thought, but this houseguest was different, they’re always here, and they won’t leave. I try to throw more parties, and invite more guest, but this new stranger, they kicked them out. Happiness, sadness, anger and all those other guest, they won’t come in. This new stranger seems to make themself at home. They’re always in my house, just sitting, or pondering around. They take anything i have; energy, motivation, enthusiasm, emotion. And no matter how hard i try, it seems as if the guest just takes more and more of the things in my house. I’m trying to kick them out, but they’re stubborn . They are stealing everything in my house, i’ll eventually have and feel nothing.

~ lately i’ve been feeling weird, out of nowhere it seems as if i’ve become emotionally numb. I don’t feel anything anymore, no emotions. I’m apathetic. I lost all motivation to do things, i don’t find things appealing anymore. it seems as if i’m going around in circles and i’m so confused for ive never felt this way before. i’ve been having nightmares and flashbacks, and i lost my appetite. i feel blank, and just, well nothing. i don’t know if i explained this good, i hope my metaphor makes sense. may someone please explain what this is?"
77,How does a panic attack or anxiety attack feels like?,"When someone is in the throes of a panic or anxiety attack, it feels to that person like everything is going wrong and something terrible is about to happen. A wave of fear sets off a fight-or-flight response. Their heart starts to race or they can’t catch their breath. “The brain and the body have fallen off a cliff in terms of their ability to do anything rationally,” explains Ronit Levy, PsyD, clinical director of the Bucks County Anxiety Center in Newtown, Pennsylvania.

While you might be tempted to tell a friend having a panic attack to shake it off, that would be so wrong in so many ways. If you really want to help a loved one, be patient, compassionate and try understanding them. 

Happy to see what others have to share!"

79,Things Are Complicated,"If anyone could help me figure out what's been bothering me, it would be much appreciated.Thanks.

\-

I'm not a mental health expert, but I know enough that I'm tired of feeling this emotion. Actually, I don't even know if it's an emotion because it changes almost all the time it's hard to tell. Years on years of thinking about what could be bothering me still hasn't given me answers, and it's so frustrating I could SERIOUSLY lose my mind at any moment. But first, let me give some context so it kind of evens this out.

Ever since I was young, I've had this obnoxious feeling that kept getting worse over the years. At first, I thought it would go away. My father ALWAYS yelled at me whenever I'd get upset over things that in his words were 'pointless' and 'stupid', so I never bothered to go to anyone to vent or discuss what was bothering me. Eventually, this feeling evolved to more than just a slap on the wrist and now I feel like it's slowly eating away at me. I'm terrified of therapists, nevertheless psychologists or psychiatrists, and I can't DREAM of going to ask for help. The first time I thought about trying, I was shaking and chattering like it was -20 degrees in my house.And so, that leaves me here.

In a shorter way to put things, I get unpleasant feelings in waves over either periods of months or maybe just a week (or day or two). These unpleasant feelings can range from anger all the way to feeling gross.Right now I believe I'm in the middle of one of those waves as everyday, I get periods where I just want to pull my hair out!I miss my friends, but at the same time, I hate, despise and feel disgusted by them for no reason.I want to talk to people but I get bored or annoyed or I just don't feel like talking to anyone.I thought that maybe if I made myself cry or get a few tears out I'd feel better, but I don't feel like crying.Or maybe I do and I just can't- but I also can't find a REASON to cry because I can't figure out what's wrong with me over these past 7 years.I want help and at the same time I fear it. I don't want people to know what I'm feeling, but I've lost my patience with this game of waiting.

There is more to add, but I think that this is enough for now.Any ideas, opinions or thoughts would really be helpful to read. If you want to ask questions, feel free to do so."

I’ve lost my job due the virus and feel useless, where do I go? What do I do? Once again I’m feeling lost, misplaced. I so badly want to feel secure and grounded. These time are so hard and I’m struggling."
82,Uncovering childhood trauma?,"Hi everyone. Recently, I've had an interest in delving into my childhood because I've been drawing many blanks regarding certain people, situations, etc. One event in particular has been picking at me a bit, and I'd like to share it in case someone can have insight regarding what it may mean.

Some background - I'm in my mid-20s, male, in good mental health.

\---

I was told by my parents that when I was right around 2-3 years old, I had a strange habit. Of course by that age I already knew how to walk. What I would do was that I would fill my underwear with socks and other underwear, to the point they were bulging, and walk out into the living room, allegedly looking quite content with myself, displaying it to my parents. Apparently, I would do this frequently.

Another thing I remember is another story my father shared with me. Apparently, right when I was born, the physician that was checking me over made a comment about my genitals, stating something along the lines ""this will be a good one.""

Perhaps one other thing I should add - I was circumcised as a child. I'm sure that this was not pleasant for a baby, let alone anyone.

Knowing what I know today about trauma and how it may manifest, I felt I would share in case I'm onto something. I know it's not good to ignore ""signs"" but at the same time, I don't want to create something where there isn't anything.

\---

What do you think, could you shed some light? If it is something worth looking into, how should I go about it, on my own?"
83,I haven't been the same since I took 10 hits of LSD,"I don't mean that in a good way either. I went through an acid stage when I was around 21 (I'll be 28 this year) for a few months. The last time I took it, it completely skewed my view of everything. 

The first few times I took it, I felt fine afterwards aside from maybe a little haziness for a few days after. Now, I didn't take 10 hits on purpose, as I would usually only take about 2 hits, maybe 3 if I was feeling it. A buddy of mine had one of those droppers with the liquid inside and he was convinced that it wasn't as potent as it should've been (he had it in his glovebox throughout the whole summer, about 90-100 degrees on average, and forgot about it). It made sense to me at the time that it would've evaporated some or broken down the solution a bit, but we were wrong.

I've never had a bad trip out of all the times I have taken it (including the last time). All of my trips are always wonderful and filled with hallucinations as well as letting my mind work in new and creative ways I never thought possible. The last trip was a bit different though (obviously, considering I took roughly 10ish hits). 

The last trip had a very different vibe. It was like speaking with ""God"" himself while I was peaking (this trip also converted me from an Atheist to a Pantheist). I can't describe it any better than that, so let your imagination go wild. Anyway, after the 12 or so hour long trip, I was finally able to  sleep. When I woke up, I could tell I wasn't feeling the same. The haze was way worse than it was before and lasted about a month. When I ""recovered"", my old self was completely gone. I used to be outgoing, talkative, and had excitement for my hobbies, and afterwards, nothing. 
It was really bad for about 4 years after that. I was depressed, unmotivated, and stopped caring for myself (days without a shower, brushing teeth, etc.). When people talked to me, I just couldn't find anything interesting to say at all. I would just sit there mostly silent. I felt awkward at every turn and always felt like cocooning up back home. 
The past couple years haven't been too bad, but I still feel like I'm missing a large part of myself. I feel emotionless most of the time, easily irritated, unmotivated, and still a lack of passion for my old hobbies. I used to love drawing, painting, coding, hanging out with friends, playing guitar, and playing video games. All of that is gone, and I grow more angry with myself every day for getting into LSD at all. It has affected every aspect of my life and I hate myself for it. 

I can hardly talk to people without my mind going blank still to this day. I even do it when I'm talking with my own best friend (who I've known since I was 5 btw), and actually get irritated whenever he tries to talk to me about anything if I'm already committed to something else (like watching tv or playing a game). I still try to get into my old hobbies, but I grow bored of them too quickly and usually just sit on my phone all day when I'm not working.

At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I'd like to avoid having to take pills and maybe go a more ""natural"" route, but honestly, right now, I'm open to anything to get my old self back. I just feel lost every day I wake up and feel like a mindless drone drifting through life. Most days, I'm just waiting for it to end so I can move on to another life and start over (and no I'm not suicidal at all, just empty).

TL;DR
I took roughly 10 hits of acid when I was 21 and it messed me up good for going on almost 7 years now. Unmotivated, depressed, and unable to hold conversations with anyone.

Any advice/questions are more than welcome and thank you for taking the time to read part of my story.

No. Anyway I miss a lot of things in life but have been holding back so much [cry session numba 3 ACTIVATE]. I just feel too much sadness and wish I could just die already but I know I can’t die yet. It’s so hard :’) I need to see my brother grow up first, my parents to get along enough for mom to move back in.

I like to find positivity in everything even in  the dark, unless it’s pretty bad then yeah. But I just find most things in life beautiful and want to appreciate everything. One day I want to be able to send penpals and self care packages to people across the world. I just want to be happy. I have two hamsters, Sugar and Daisy. I really love them a lot. It’s really hard to get out of bed most days but I still try. I only wish my friends the best and hope that they will succeed in life. I remember everyone I met in the psych ward and hope they all succeed at their recovery goals, those were the most genuine and kind people I’ve met in a long time. I hope my eyeballs depuff cause they hurt now lol. I really love a lot of things but it’s so hard. I don’t like fighting people. I don’t fight people unless there’s a reason I have to. I love being around people who are kind and empathetic towards others, aggressiveness and threatening manners will cause me to have an anxiety attack and I look dumb cause I’m always being blamed for shit. I used to never apologize for things that weren’t my fault but I had to because I felt fear. I don’t fear anymore, only fatigue and drained. Tears rollin still but that fear is long gone.

Daydreaming has become a serious part of my life. I never accept the real world as I'm always imagining this fake fairytale world. As a child it was cute, but at 28 it's depressing. I also have a severe lack of motivation. Everytime I make these plans for my life I sit around and do nothing. I miss alarms and important events, job interviews etc. I also can't sit still at times. I'm always walking around my house daydreaming and listening to music. My attention span is extremely short. I start shows and never complete them,constantly pausing them and feeling the need to walk about. I'm just curious, are these signs of a mental illness or normal behaviour patterns?"

I have resolved to not go back to my mother's house for as long as I am able to, she has not proven to be very a very good support, partially because of my distrust due to her alcoholism. She hasn't drank in quite a while, but I heard her say to her older sister after one of our arguments (and I quote): ""This is the kind of thing that makes me want to drink."" If she starts drinking, my younger brother who's at her house will at risk. She hasn't responded to my emails regarding staying at my father's home and bringing my personal items from her house to here. For all I know she's drinking again.

I'm getting tired. If there's more I need to vent I'll comment."
93,r/KindVoice is awesome,"This is a but random, but the other day I posted on r/KindVoice about mental health and touch starvation. I honestly didn't think it would get a lot of attention. I woke up the next day with a load of notifications, I checked, and my post had gained loads of amazing replies. I actually nearly cried when I saw them, I honestly didn't expect so many people to respond. This showed me that there is a really good side of Reddit behind the trolls. I had never woken up so refreshed and happy"
94,How to not get a mental health diagnosis,"This might sound stupid but i have been previously diagnosed with BPD and substance abuse in 2018 have been deemed unsafe to work unless supervised. I have been doing all the right things now, ceased all drugs and been going counselling. How do I reverse this and not get a diagnosis from the psychiatrist."
95,Why do I self sabotage,"It’s 4 am here and I just need to vent and rant. I keep self sabotaging myself and I don’t know how to break the cycle. Last week I was laid off. An amazing company had already reached out to me prior to offer me a job so I touched base with them. The job was still available but would require a move. 

I verbally told them yes. Decent pay. Great benefits. All it required from me was to move my wife and I across the country when this pandemic stuff was done. 

Over the weekend as I waited for the formal offer I broke down with anxiety and depression about leaving my home. A home that if I don’t get a new job soon I might have to leave anyway. It’s like I could only focus on the worst case scenarios. 

Come Monday and the formal offer I declined, the recruiter was confused and my actions essentially burned that bridge for good. 

Now it’s 4 AM on Wednesday and I don’t know what the hell I’m doing with my life. I don’t know why I self sabotage myself like this. Who turns down a good job when unemployed in the middle of a recession??

I feel like my lack of strength has just cost my family and I a great future. I feel like I was in a burning room with one open door but couldn’t walk through because I was worried about the color of the carpet on the other side."

97,"How would you react if your doctor said that you are healthy but just ""pathologically lazy""?",?
98,"Cognitive behavioural therapy never works for me, because it just seems like lying to yourself really hard. Thinking the opposite of your belief really hard does not make you believe it. I don't know what I'm missing here.","I have had severe depression for 10 years since I was 12 years old. Over the past two years I've been to three psychologists who have all tried to give me cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with no success. I really want it to work because I don't want to go back on medication which made me stupid and numb, but I just don't get it at all. 

They say you have to actively challenge your negative thoughts, because having negative thoughts causes depression. They say it's going to be really hard work. Okay, I get it. I'm all in, ready to put in the hard work so I can stop wanting to kill myself all the time.

So every few days when I have a severe depressive episode, crying uncontrollably, I go to my journal and write down the thoughts I'm having like they told me to. So I write down, for example, ""I'm the worst piece of shit on earth, everyone would be so much better off if I was dead"".

Okay, so now I'm meant to challenge it. I write down, ""I'm a good person and I deserve to live"". I think it really hard. I think of times people have told me I'm not worthless. I think of things I've done and try to convince myself they were good things to do and I'm proud of them. But **nothing happens** because I don't believe it. I strongly believe that I **am** worthless. It's the objective truth, and I think I'm correct and reasonable in thinking that way.

An atheist will never become a Christian by thinking really hard, ""I believe in God"", and vice versa. Lying to yourself with all your might (which I guess is the ""hard work"" psychologists always talk about) seems like a fucking stupid treatment and it just never works. I've dropped thousands of dollars I don't have on this and I'm frustrated. I want it to work and everyone says it's the most effective treatment but clearly I'm not understanding something obvious. What am I missing?"
99,I'm going insane. Why won't it end?,"How can I feel so miserable and so numb at the same time? Nothing feels real. Time doesn't exist it's only morning then it's night. I'm wasting my life away online all day but my energy is always low if my energy is low then why can't I fall asleep? I'm a shell my brain doesn't work properly. I'm not there but my shell is there. I'm so confused and tired and suicidal. I don't think I'm going to see the end of the year at this rate. Haven't attempted anything yet but I'm trying to figure out the best method. I will snap at some point I can feel it. Im beginning to loose my grasp on everything I should be scared but I just don't care anymore. I'm too tired to care about anything. I thought this would ware off a few weeks ago. I always does I'm suicidal and feel like shit for a few days and everything goes back to normal. This has just continued and everything has been getting worse. 

If I do end up finishing myself: I hope it won't be painful. Overall I'd rate my life a solid 4/10 I could've done without the whole fucked brain thing and penis could be bigger."
100,"Since everyone is doing sessions through phone or zoom, would I be able to ask my therapist what my diagnosis was?","I've been curious for the longest time to just know what they think I have and to be honest I think that whatever they say I will try and deny refute it. However, I also think that they got the diagnosis wrong. I feel like most of my issues are just related to lack of discipline and routine as well as just being used to laziness and doing what I want. I'm too comfortable with how my life is but at the same time I want to change it. I guess I'm too lazy to put effort into fixing it and actually getting a career. Anyway, I'm just really curious as to what they wrote. I requested to get my file on February 27th but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten it yet. They said they need 30 days and I think they don't have access to everything. I don't really know. I asked and they said because the office is closed they aren't able to get it."
101,How I keep focused on work while maintaining my mental health,"Okay, so this is more of a personal achievement relating to a discovery I made some time ago. It may or may not be common knowledge already, as it kind of goes against what many people claim to be the best approach across the web.

It's simple really, instead of trying to get my most difficult task done first in the morning, or my most important task, delaying the answering of emails until later on in the day or sticking to a routine of focused work at the same time every day... I decided to...

Just do whatever task I want to do first thing in the morning, and before lunch and whenever I want. When I'm ready to work I take a look at my list of tasks and just choose whatever I want to work on next. All tasks are organized in separate Trello boards \[1\] and sometimes I complete tasks from emails in my Inbox.

Sure, sometimes I will need to focus on particular tasks because of any number of reasons. However, for the majority of the time, I just focus on exactly what I want to.

The result is that I fall into focused work almost every day because I'm almost always doing jobs that I really love. I'll get around to the jobs I may not want to do on a particular day of course, because sure enough my mood changes day by day and so those unattractive tasks will soon become attractive. Or at least attractive enough!

This way I can avoid the dreaded burnout. I can prevent myself from getting fed up with work and can continue to build momentum on a regular basis. Of course, there will be times when I feel like switching off completely. Then I can fuel my mind with other useful things such as reading, exercise, cooking, quizzes, guitar and more.

102,"You say you care, just to prove you don’t","You say you care, just to prove you don’t

My name is Ryan (21M). I feel like I’m writing this because at this point, I’ve got nothing to lose. None of it matters to anybody I know anyway, so I might as well just tell all of you.

I haven’t always felt how I feel now. Up until about maybe grade 7, I had a ton of friends. People that would show genuine excitement on their faces whenever they see me, phone always going off from texts, people talking to me everyday. But ever since I’ve left middle school, things have been going downhill.

It seems like everybody I used to know just stopped caring. Whether that be because they got busy, got bored, or just didn’t care enough anymore. People always say when people want to leave your life, let them go. But after they all live one by one by one, that philosophy begins to fade. You start to look at yourself as the issue. Yourself as the problem. 

Why can’t I seem to keep people around? I’m now 21, I’m in college and I hate how I took those days for granted in the past. Where I had friends, family that showed they cared. I don’t feel like I belong anymore. Like nothing I ever do makes a difference in anybody else’s life anymore. I’ve tried to be the best friend I can be because despite how shit people treat me, I still treat others how I’d want to be treated.

Maybe a week or has passed since I’ve first tried to reach out to people who feel like me on here. At first it seems some of you all care, then by day two you guys are all gone. I hate being selfish, you all have your own lives and own stuff going on. I just wish there were people that genuinely wanted to stick around is all. I met someone on here who called me their favorite person ever after just talking for a few days. Honestly, I felt the happiest I can remember since they said that. 

But now, days later it’s like they’ve just forgotten I exist? Paragraphs fade to one word responses. “How are you feeling” every morning when I wake up, turns into no responses from them at all. A different person I thought genuinely cared about me seems to forget about me every day until about an hour before she goes to sleep that night.

I have one real friend that lives five hours ahead and I can’t help but feel like I’m smothering the hell out of her. She knows how great of a friend she is and how positively she’s impacted my life since she became a friend of mine, but I feel like I rely on her far too much. Like she does what she can, she says she likes being here for me but I can feel it crushing her.

I’m not looking for answers from anybody. Or solutions. Not looking for anything honestly. Stopped looking a while ago. I just wish I didn’t disappoint everybody in my life and was enough to keep people around is all. Every day I read about people who have succumbed to illnesses, tragedies and suicide. It’s like I feel like my life could’ve been utilized better by so many other people who have lost theirs. I don’t know...just felt like getting this out.

I hope nobody ever has to feel how I do. It sucks feeling this way. I hope you all stay safe out there. Better me be dead than any of you."

104,"Classed as low risk, despite having taken and overdose in February, and having been sent to A&amp;E in March"," I'm waiting to hear back from a mental health triage team I spoke with about a month ago. In the UK, where I live, you're supposed to be seen within 72 hours, by someone who might be able to help, as long as you're not low risk. When I spoke with the nurses who assessed me, they didn't ask me anything about feeling suicidal, despite me having taken 600mg of diazepam and almost two bottles of red wine in January. I was also sent to the emergency room after I'd called 111, the non emergency health number, as I answered some questions about suicidality. I told them I hadn't made plans to end my own life, but that I had thoughts about it everyday.

The nurses from the triage team didn't ask me anything at all about feeling suicidal, despite the appointment having been arranged due to me going to the hospital that time. I've called the centre numerous times in the last four weeks, but all I get is ""you're on a list to be called back"". It seems like no one wants to help me. I only found out I was classed as being low risk because someone from a different NHS service called me to talk with me, but that service has been redeployed due to the virus. 

What the hell do I have to do to be classed as higher risk?"
105,I just don’t know what to do.,"I just recently got out of a trauma treatment center. When I was there I finally told my dad that my stepmoms oldest some had raped me twice. My last session with my therapist and him I was told to find a new place to live because they confronted the son, and he said I was lying. I have since cut him out of my life, but I’ve been out of state for treatment for 6 months now. I am so angry at him, yet I still want to see him. I want my protector back. However he’s chosen her family over his own daughter. I feel like I’m going crazy because the two sides of black and white of combating each other.

as spontaneous as he used to be but tbh, thats just normal as we were growing up, and you change a lot through the years , what ive noticed what he kept saying sorry when he thought he did things wrong in the verry annoying way and he keeps asking us all about what do we think of him and such, he wasnt bullied also he was part of the group until he wasnt 

Then he became weird, he kinda lost the skills to socialized like he became awkward, and all of us were already close friends he just became that and we didnt know why and what was happening  an as we graduated it seems it worsen. All of us soon went on our separate paths but we would occasionally hangout and talk about stuff

But as of now about a year later, he did improve although not to his old self just to the way he was when he started becoming awkward and reserved

Guys with way more experience i want to know what is happening to him, just your insights, i have never experienced or heard of something like this ever

Also he also did seek for professional help"

109,What is this?,"What is this

Im afraid that nothing is real and im only dreaming. Im afraid that one day life will become an inescapable nightmare. I feel like nothing is real and I feel like I cant trust anything. Im so scared everyone will turn on me and torture me in an inescapable nightmare for entirety. I dont know whats wrong and I dont know what to do. Also, with my “ocd?” I feel like if I disobey it, it will slowly tear me apart, destroying everything I hold dear to me. I feel like it might make that nightmare true and I have to frequently apologize for everything. I feel like if I say anything good about myself, I will be punished. If I say I think I look good, ill be burned in a fire (stuff like that). I feel like if I dont do things a certain amount of times, ill be punished. 
I dont want that to happen 
Even typing it scares me 
I feel like talking about it might make it true but idk what to do

A recluse staying in the house avoiding all  contact possible. I don't have the energy to talk to new people or old friends I haven't really seen in a while. I hate it. I'm not myself anymore.
111,Struggling with bursts of anger and self loathing - How to deal with it?,"*Trigger Warning - talk of self harm and suicide*

Hello, like many I'm stuck at home. I am in a place of privilege as I am able to work from home and have been able to get food and medication for both me and my partner (we are both in the risk group). Physically we are doing well but recently I've became aware that my mental wellness isn't in the same boat. 

I have a history of depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm. In the last years things have been ok, my mother and partner keep a close track of me and my behaviour as I had a bad time last year with suicidal thoughts and self depreciation after losing my job. But I have been doing ok for the most part ever since. 

Everything seemed normal until two weeks ago. I've started getting irrationally upset, angry, irritated and when I would get out of that ""cloud"" I would tell my partner about it. This week things have gotten worse, I've been getting aggressive and irritated, it worries me especially when it's about small things like my cat doing naughty stuff looking for attention or thinking about things I should've done differently like taking care of my plants in a different way. 

These past few days have been full of moments where I straight up hate myself, bordered on the thoughts of self harm, hit myself once and began having suicidal thoughts again and how much better everything would be if I were not here. I know this isn't true, but when I enter these moments I can't manage to think otherwise. I am scared of falling down the rabbit hole again, I've been making sure my partner knows I've been feeling this way.

I am not sure if I'm writing this to get it off my chest or if I am seeking advice, but I am open to suggestions if anyone has them"

It feels like I’m sick when I’m not, I look outside and see all the beautiful flowers that are growing but it doesn’t bring me any joy at all 😔 I’m losing connection with my friends and family, I can’t bring myself to do anything it seems. Even just making something to eat seems really hard and after I make it I don’t even feel like eating it. I’ve felt numb for the past 3-4 years now and it’s gotten so much worse since last year and now this year has been the worse I’ve ever felt. It feels painful that I can’t release the emotion that I’m feeling or lack of for that matter and this isolation isn’t helping with this at all. I know many others that will be feeling the same way and I wish I could help them through this too ❤️ Stay Safe and I hope we can get through these hard times"
115,It's hard not to hate myself when I can see that I'm so different from other people,"I don't know if this is the best place to write about it but I would assume self hatred is under the spectrum of mental illness I guess...

But anyway, I have this issue are my ideas and thoughts are not like other people's. And I hate that about myself and it makes me want to die. It makes me feel like a worthless person. I already feel worthless for so many other reasons but that contributes. I notice it a lot online. Especially because people are able to thumbs up/thumbs down, upvote/downvote, etc. the things that you say you write. And so it's very telling that I'm just a dumbass girl with a dumbass brain who should lock herself up, delete all her social media and just die alone. Maybe it's dramatic, but that's how I feel. It feels really bad when I'm on groups on Facebook that I enjoy and I write something in a discussion and everyone gets at least one like except me. It just solidifies that I'm an idiot. Or if I contribute to a discussion on Reddit or make a post and I get zero upvotes or only a few. I wish I was normal and had normal thoughts and views and opinions like everyone else. Being outside the box isn't a good thing. And please don't misunderstand, because that seems to happen to me a lot as well and I think it's because I'm an idiot and don't know how to express myself properly, I'm not saying anything bigoted. I'm talking about normal things. This is also why I find it hard to make friends. Not only am I socially awkward and boring, but I can never click with other people and or hold conversations because I think so strangely and not down the same logical pathways that other people do."

119,WOW. I'm disappointed in my friends after discussing my mental state with them and telling them about my self harm.,"Background: Went into treatment at 17 for anorexia, used to cut myself, continued the cutting until I was 19 and on medication. I was self harm free for a couple of years, relapsed at 22, went back to therapy. I'm now 26, and have been eating under 500 calories for the past 2 weeks, and self harmed again after a binge episode. I know my routine. I'm too old for this shit. I know what I'm doing, and it's even worst, because I know. 

I'm... reasonably well off and smart and educated woman. I have no reason to be this fucked up, and a friend of mine in a group chat brought up how miserable I was sounding. I started pouring my heart out, and talked about the things I've been experiencing and how I don't do anything... and they flipped out. They said my thoughts were moronic, and they were angry with me for even speaking like that! One of them said she was embarrassed. 

These are my only friends left. If I lose them, I'll have no one. No one to talk to, and I can't handle that. I want to change, but... I'm just not in the mood to work on it. My therapist gave me his personal number, since we can't meet up in person... but I don't wanna call. I'm scared. But I'm just very disappointed in my friends. That truly broke my heart."

124,How to get over fact that I can't say I'm sorry to someone.,"Background: Ex and I had bad breakup, mostly my fault. Ihad really bad mental health at the time (intense paranoia, depressed, suicidal etc). I said things to her that really hurt her and I wanted it to hurt, on both sides. I've been recovering from my depression for over a year now and I've been able to see the problems I have/my emotions and try and find a solution to feel better. I had a long cry in the car and I realised that I was still upset about it because I want to say sorry but I can't talk to her (cut off all contact, don't want to speak to her, we're living separate lives now). 

I've accepted that I can't say sorry to her but I still feel bad about it. I was wondering in time if this feeling will go away or will I have to accept that I will feel bad about it always."
125,I'm even having troubles reaching out to my best friend.,"I always had struggles talking with people in real life because of being abused and bullied for years at school and home, I was starting to be more and more socially anxious and didn't really have friends for most of my life. 

I was lucky enough to finally make some IRL friends 4 years ago, but I ruined my friendship with my best friend and her friend because I made a mistake and accidentally offended/annoyed her, as well and constantly talking only about my deep depression and I caused a drama. It was really terrible for me since I didn't had any friends again anymore and I missed out on a lot fun with them.

They were really awesome friends too, they actually helped me during my most hardest times and showed a lot of empathy to me overall, even saved me from one suicide attempt. They cared about me way more than my family or anybody else ever had. 

I once got in a bus 2 years ago and I saw my best friend there and I was really nervous because I thought she would recognize me as that one guy, but she didn't either realize or tried to ignore it. 

I went to check her profile and I was still blocked by her, which made me really feel sad for a while, almost had tears, remembering that one drama. It took me almost half year after that to message her and apologize for what I had done in the past, she accepted it and we started talking slowly again. It was really amazing for her to comeback, but I usually would struggle picking up topics to talk about, but I've came a long way since then.

Nowadays I talk mostly fine with her, almost like during the good old days, but I occasionally would have issues talking about how I truly feel and if that would be too repetitive or not and I would just end up ""ignoring"" her and I really feel horrible and anxious about it.

Even though I know she's aware about my depression/social anxiety and that she's been a really great friend to me, I still feel she may be judging me from the ""rare"" times I ""ignore"" her. I can't afford losing her again, the only IRL friend.

I don't know how to get past this stutter. I want to talk with her a lot more often again, especially during the pandemic here, she's the only person that makes me feel better."

129,Tired of mood swing,"Is it ever going to stop? It has been almost 2 years now and what should I do?

I will be extremely depressed for a week or two. Can't even get out of bed, don't want to take a shower or brush my teeth, skip school, can't study and can't pull myself together to finish the school assignments. Feeling so guilty because I get nothing done and think about the time I have wasted. Desperately want to escape the pain and planning on suicide. I would think about how would my friends and family react if they find out I kill myself. I know they will be shocked and sad because they really are nice people. But I just don't care anymore and selfishly simply want to escape of all the things.

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning and feel extremely energetic. It may last for few days or just an hour. I feel like shower, brushing my teeth and doing all the things I missed before. The weather is perfect, the air smell fresh, everything is wonderful. I can easily finish school assignments or even study effective. I no longer want to end my life. I would want to keep going and see how things go. I would like to talk about the stupid things we did when we were young with my friends and laugh about it. 

They are literally just keep on repeating. It is so exhausting and basically I cannot get anything done. It feels terrible too. Like you feel so hopeful to the future ahead but then everything collapse and lose all the motivation. 

I don't want to be like this anymore. What's wrong with me and what should I do?"
130,Do you guys think you’d have benefitted alot if you were able to take time off of school?,"Do you think that your mental state would be different now if there was a program in place at schools that would allow you to take time off but upon coming back also having a team in place to help you (mental health specialist, tutors and a peer system thingo)? How do you think this could have impacted you if you had access to something like this?"

133,Mental health issues and studying or working,"I'd love to have  a career in the tech field, Ive tried to get a degree in college years ago, named ""application developer"". But I've quit, because it became too much for me. I couldnt focus anymore on my study, so I quit.

Which was a bad decision and let me to jobs I didnt like with people I didnt like. This path continued up until now. I am now at a point where I said to myself: enough is enough! I want to have a decent, full filling career where I can mean something to society, add value. But I have zero degrees, no job, mental health issues, a bad neigbour that makes so much noise that I cant sleep at night."
134,"Grabbed my girlfriend by her arm during an argument and pulled her towards me, I want to end my life right now.","  Just a little backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together for 1 year already. She’s absolutely amazing and super proud to call her my girlfriend, honestly she’s probably one of my best friends and if not my true best friend. She was part of a 6 year abusive relationship. She’s talked to me all about this and i absolutely never understood why anyone would do that to this sweet innocent girl. She’s truly the whole package and the fact she wants me and wants to be with me is even more of a treat. Yesterday was her birthday, for some reason I felt a little uneasy for no reason. It can happen out of nowhere and come at  random times and yesterday was one of those nights, I probably should of told her what I was feeling but instead I was trying to ignore it and brush it off. However, my girlfriends not stupid she can easily see when something is wrong and she needs to ask. She asked about 4 times yesterday and every time I gave her the same answer “no I’m fine honestly”. When our night came to end, she walked me out to my car and that’s where we started to talk. From there everything went downhill, I think of mixture of stress, exhaustion, and annoyance was just making us not see eye to eye. I had said “well if you wanna act like an fucking asshole then go ahead.” 
   She basically stormed off and I went to bring her back because in that moment I knew what I said was fucked up. That’s when I grabbed her the way I did and she immediately lost her shit and even threatened to break up with me if I didn’t leave. In those situations she feels the need to be alone or she’ll lose her shit, she doesn’t like that person she becomes and I don’t like the person I can become in that situation either. I would never abuse any woman in my life, I think I got fired up so quick from what I said which was why I reacted the way i did. I immediately regretted it and wanted to fix it. The way I went about it was insanely stupid  and kept her in my car with me til we can found a solution and just talk and calm but she didn’t even want to be around me. She was so struck by what I did that she wanted to be alone.
   I felt horrible last night and feeling it again this morning. I don’t know what got into me, i don’t know why these random moods that hit me come at some of the worse times and it feels there’s no way I can control it. She should of broke up with me last night like how she wanted to. I’m just not in a good place right now and feel I let myself down and a lot of people like her family too. Her family doesn’t know but they’re just people I think about constantly and want to show them I love their girl. This whole thing really sucks."

138,I have constant feelings of shame,"Hi, i'm a 26 year old man living in a european nation. I started getting treatment for my mental health a year or so back and i feel better than i ever have before but for one thing. I feel a constant sense of shame over how long it took for me to deal with it and how it caused me to leave college(i'm back now and doing a lot better). I feel so ashamed all the time , i have trouble meeting relatives  or making new friends because of it.  It's as if i'm afraid they will judge and resent me for my struggles and failures. I know when i type it out and think about it that it seems ridiculous and intellectually i know that they're not going to ""exile"" me from the family,  but the feeling just wont go away. Does anyone have any tips/stories to share  because my therapist  isn't really helping?"

143,yeah okay these past few days have sucked and im acknowledging it,"yep that’s my life okay don’t know why i can’t just move on 👌🏻 

like im so passive aggressive too like “oh must be nice to have x” or “oh wow i wish i had x” shit like that just put my situation in where x is. 

im aware of my awesome ability to absolutely self destruct and destroy myself and we not trying to do that again 🤪 it’s only a cycle when you continue it.

144,I’m in a weird place right now and it’s has just been really hard. I just want to talk,I’m 18 and I’ve been dealing with the same problems -anxiety depression eating disorders for awhile now. And I’ll get better but no matter what I still feel like I’m unhappy. I’m unable to get professional help like a therapist. I find myself deciding to delete all social media because I want to be alone but then I don’t want to delete it bc I just want to be able to talk. But talking doesn’t work for me anymore. I don’t want to talk to ppl but then I scare myself that if I don’t then I’m stuck with my thoughts. But talking to ppl doesn’t help. I don’t know why I’m stuck. So it just feels like there nothing I can do to help myself. Like I sit here and I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything. Being at home has just brought so much negativity back into my life. Even worse than it was before. And I’m just trying to hold on. I don’t believe in schedules. I don’t believe in these little breathing exercises. And coping skills because they don’t help anymore.
145,Why is my happiness just become clockwork at this point,"Happy, sad, happy sad. I wake up fine and happy and I go to bed with a dread in it all. I feel 2 faced to everyone I know because they only see the happy me. I feel like I can’t ask for help because I’m no different to someone who is doing it for attention. I’m dying inside I just want it to stop doing so seasonal. Let me be happy, please."
146,How/If I should quit my job? Anxiety/ Stress induced pain. (21F),"Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to read.

 I have never felt so helpless. To start, I work at a grocery that is known for being extremely physically demanding. It is an extremely stressful job that has no separation between home and work life. There's only a few of us employees, and we are all struggling to keep above water during this crisis. My issues started way before the virus affected how stores run.

I have severe anxiety and paranoia. I also deal with health issues including: food allergies(severe and stressful), celiac Disease, GERD, stomach ulcers, hernias, and other pain I deal with weekly if not daily. I have struggled to find a job that caters to these issues. I would love to own my own business someday and would like to work on that and grow as a person. I am an artist, the business runs in the family. I would love to make and sell art as a means of income. Though the stress and pain reduces the urge to be creative and do what I love. I have also been so stressed I haven't been eating as much because I get nauseated. I've had several people concerned about my health even customers! Everyone has been noticing I lost a bunch of weight (at least 10lbs, all of my pants are HUGE on me. I never tried to lose weight at all, I just worked like normal.

Flash forward to Saturday. It was a busy day and i had a hernia, as well as the day before. Saturday night after work something happened to my back and I couldn't move. It was severe Sciatic pain in my lower back. I still have trouble even walking or sitting. I cant even get out of bed on my own. The doctor didn't help, but I am going to a chiropractor later. 

At this point I am so lost and depressed. I hate my job, it gets in the way of my happiness at home and with family(that I never see because of night-shift). I want to grow as a person and work on my career, but this job is holding me back. I would really like to quit but i'm not sure what to do. Any insight is extremely helpful. I am going crazy in my own mind trying to deal with this. Thank you for the help in advance."
147,How is your mental health doing with quarantine? Here are some basic things you can do to take care of yourself at home,https://youtu.be/6vyof3xT-zA
148,Should I Be Worried About My OCD?,"I'm a male in Highschool. I've had OCD since May of 2018. As of now, I haven't got checked out by a therapist. Anyways, I first noticed my OCD symptoms when I started having obsessive thoughts. At first it was about normal thoughts that almost everyone has (ex: sexuality) but then these thoughts kept coming back and it scared me. When summer break started I ignored these thoughts which worked for awhile but more thoughts kept coming. That summer was the lowest point for me, the thoughts were worse and more severe. For example, the scariest one was I thought I would become a serial killer or kill someone in my family, now I know that no matter how tough I try to act deep down I'm a kind person. I was unhappy the whole summer and the only time I felt at peace was when I was sleeping. Summer ended and the thoughts went away but I had to move out my hometown. Soon after, my compulsions came and it has stayed so far, but it didn't interfere with my social life or emotional health. School distracted me from my compulsions and I was happy again. Then summer of 2019 it started getting worse. One time I almost stayed up all night because my brain kept telling me to close and open my door, but I managed to control myself and saved my summer, now I cope with my compulsions and learned to accept it. Some of the compulsions are, twisting doorknobs multiple times, turning the sink handle on and off, closing my door twice, putting down my toilet seat multiple times till I get it right, and placing down cups and plates till I feel like I got it right. Now we're in quarantine and I feel like my compulsions are getting worse since we're all self isolating. I've heard that if you don't treat your OCD it will get worse and I don't want it to become unbearable. No matter how messed up life is, I love it and I want to do many things and I don't want my OCD to interfere. Should I seek help and tackle it while it's weak or?"
149,I went to my first therapy session!,Had a phone session earlier today and I was really nervous and scared to open up. But I'm glad I did it! Hopefully this will lead me to a path of a better mental state.
150,Why must I be so hard on myself?,"I've survived a whole  lot of shit in my short life. I have many comorbid disorders. I know that they have affected my performance in socially, educational and other aspects. Yet I feel that it's an excuse when I didn't do aswell at something ,but looking at an outsider's perspective, I'd be like 'damn. She's amazing and a warrior.She's a miracle"".

My low self esteem  makes hard for me to compliment myself. When I was younger,  people thought I was a snob but I was really misunderstood.My autism made me blind to how I seemed to others. Now, I feel like a narcissist when I compliment myself. It makes me so sad that I can't even compliment myself. I'm going to stop  because I'm starting to ramble."
151,Some mental health disorders that I found from searching my psychiatric prescription and history.I would like to know the extent of the damage they can cause to me or others.,"Hello as the title says I looked at my psychiatric prescription and files and found out that I have been diagnosed with the following disorder
-Severe conduct disorder 
-OCD
-Impulse control disorder.
 Manic depression 

My psychiatrist never talked about this disorders to me .I take medications that I don’t know.It is under the supervision of my parents so I don’t know much about them.My parents didn’t talk about them to me until I found them out by checking the files.I had a history of physical as emotional abuse from my parents especially my mother.When I try to confront them they threaten me with dire consequences like sending me to a mental asylum.I am forced to take the medications and it’s like I have developed a dependence on them.I cannot sleep if I skip them or if their doses are reduced.My mood is also altered and I become angry and depressed most of time.Most of the time I am overwhelmed by random thoughts and sometimes I laugh uncontrollably and sometimes I cry .

What should I do to reduce these problems?Most of my  family don’t give much importance to mental problems and they threaten me with dire consequences and often fights break out where I am blamed for my problems if I try to open out or say to them so I remain mostly to myself but these problems have been aggravating .Please help.Thank you."

Does this seem like something that would be useful?"
153,"I'm really struggling. Days bleed together, and the line between work and recreation/relaxation has blurred in a way that I have no motivation to do anything left.","Meh, just need to vent. Comments, discussion, advice, whatever, is more than welcome, but writing is cathartic for me so it's fine if no one reads or comments, too. 

Malaise. This is generally what I feel. I have a history of anxiety and depression, but I've been fine for almost 7 years now. Before that, I struggled bad with addiction. But everything's been great about 7 years now, until recently.

I haven't really even left the house for about a month. I'm fortunate enough that I can work from home, but I keep putting off work because of anxiety, lack of motivation, malaise, and the inability to compartmentalize work vs play at home any more. Then, as work piles up, naturally, so does my anxiety. I've no motivation to get my work done, I made up an excuse to avoid a Zoom meeting yesterday because I just couldn't. Then I stress about the work I'm avoiding, but I can't motivate myself to do it.

At the same time, I can't even motivate myself to do things I enjoy. Video games, music, playing guitar, walks, even cooking and eating. Just... no motivation at all. I'm not at like, a suicidal depression point, but I'm really struggling with the anxiety and lack of motivation. I know if I just did my work, that'd alleviate a lot of my anxiety, but I just can't. I'm also in school, and have been pushing off my work more and more, just adding to the pile of no motivation. My only social contact is with my fiancee, who I live with, and... I love her, but she's not helping at all. I struggle to open up to her, and share my feelings (which she knows), but then when I finally do open up about this, she offers no help, no comfort, no anything. Try and tell her I just don't even feel loved right now, and she takes it as me implying I just want to have sex. As much as that'd help, and is one of the few things I could find motivation for, that's not what I meant, and just meant that like... there isn't even any physical contact. It feels... cold. Sounds lame, but I just want to lay on her stomach and cuddle while we talk. Closest I can get is us in the same room watching something on TV, while she's on facebook or talking to friends, feeling like we aren't even in the same room together. I SWEAR I love her lol, but as I said... rough patch and all, right now, and feel like our relationship isn't even helping me get through this.

Then, my friends live out of state. Gaming online with them has been my social contact and outlet for a while, but they're too busy with everything going on, so I've lost that, as well. I don't know what's wrong with me and why I can't just sit down for a few hours and get some work done to relieve anxiety. It sounds so simply, but I end up just putting it all off, literally lay down and stare at a wall, and wait until I can go to bed. Rinse and repeat until I'm forced to get some work done, and then climb back into my apathetic metality. I should be working right now. Instead, downloading Animal Crossing PRAYING it can give me some relief, but I'll likely play for 10 minutes before becoming disinterested. 

I'm not going to go back to drugs, and don't like drinking anyway, but all I can think about is how it feels like that's the only thing that could make me feel ok, if even just for a bit -- quell the anxiety, allow me to get some work done and forget about feeling like my heart's about to pop out of its chest. 

meh... I'm sorry for the rant, and I know plenty are in the same boat, or have it way worse than I do right now, but... I needed to at least get this out since I've no one else to talk to."
154,What are ways that helps you to change your thoughts into more positive ones?,"My goal during this quarantine and from every day now on is to slowly and surely focus more on the positive and what I’m grateful for in my life.

It’s been quite bad recently, just with the stress of the world. I can hear the whispery voices calling me the f-got word a lot. So much that sometimes I end up saying it to myself and not realising. 

I’m around my parents so I can’t be doing that. I can’t go to the doctors or anything, what can I do to cope."
157,How can I explain my lack of motivation to SO,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for several years now and the recent pandemic has sent me into a decline. I've lost all motivation to do my studies and many days can't even get out of bed, go to the toilet, shower, no matter how much I know I ought to. My SO doesn't seem to realise how out of my control it is and says that I'm being lazy and just can't be arsed to get up and that in turn it's damaging our relationship. I've tried to explain that it's not as simple as that but he doesn't seem to get it. Any advice about how I can make him realise that it's not something I have control over? Thanks in advance"

160,Obsession with weight taking over my life,"All I think about all day is how much I weigh. I take about 5 videos of myself a day to check how fat I look (I don't own a full length mirror). I have to wear clothes that are about three sizes too big and hide my entire body in order to feel comfortable; if I wear any clothes that are even slightly form fitting, I feel physically ill. I can't focus on my studies. I can't even focus on fun things. I know everyone is concerned with their appearance to an extent, but this can't be normal. Does anyone else experience this? Sorry if this is disorganized and doesn't make sense.

Side note: This obsession is making me feel like a vain and horrible person as well, so I end up feeling ugly inside and out."

162,I am struggling with mental clarity,"I am really struggling with my mental clarity recently and was hoping to share my concern hoping maybe someone can relate or have some advice. This really having an effect on my well-being and my relationships. I made a list of the things I have trouble with, they seem minor but are very severe to me.

* Lack of focus, I have a really short attention span
* Serious lack of concentration in everyday life, ie listening to people or driving
* Can't multitask at all, ie cooking
* Lack of consciousness in everday life, I feel like I am dreaming all the time and catch myself staring into space alot
* My memory is horrendous

I am constantly asking myself questions like do I have mental health condition I have never known about? Is it my diet making me like this? Does this happen when you get older(I'm only 25)? along with the thousands of other questions I ask myself.

I have been like this for years, I have tried meditation, changing job due to stress, really trying to be more present with everday life and more but it seems like I just end up back to square one. I am positive, nice, easy going person and I believe my days of stress are behind me. I wasnt like this when I was younger.

Is it me or is everyone else like this and I am overreacting? What have you found to help with mental clarity?"

i don't like being at home when my mom's angry

i phoned my friends to maybe get my mind off of the stressful stuff (not even to get their advice or opinions on the matter; just some small talk)

i felt even worse after talking with them

that i don't treat challenges as self-improvement but rather i treat them as punishment

i burnt myself with a cigarette as a punishment that i don't treat stuff that way

it was difficult for me to come back home

Also my body have hard to to adjust my temprature. Can feel that after I run and when i wake up in the morning.

168,Does Anyone Also Fear Irrationally About the Possible Death of Loved Ones?,"From a young age I have always been afraid of my loved ones dying. What if that happened? Or a disease is taking them? Or they are just lying to me and is actually dying rapidly in front of my face??? And now with the virus I'm even more afraid. The thought that they might leave me any second... and just a few days ago my dad had to be admitted into the hospital due to long term illnesses which went untreated for a long period of time. He has always told me for maybe the past 5 years that he might not be able to see me graduate and I am in 10 grade this year but he said it to me when I last saw him. My mothers health has also been declining a lot and my grandparents are old and I'm worried about the virus or them having another stroke... 

Long story short:

I'm becoming absolutely paranoid about loved ones dying that it has messed up my sleep and everything. Is anyone else also having these kind of worries?"

171,I can’t feel anything,I’m 18 and my family has no history of mental illness as far as I can tell. I’m writing this because I just can’t feel anything. I get I should feel attached to them and I should get happy sad etc.. but I feel nothing. I get panicked or excited sometimes but then when I stop I can’t feel anything at all. I can’t even cry. I’ve not cried in at least a year and I’ve tried but nothing helps. I’m just numb. I’m starting to wonder if it just me or if it’s completely normal?
172,Is there a way I could talk to a professional or someone online about issues I am having?,I’m just really going through a lot and kicking myself down lately. Last night I couldn’t even sleep because I just thought if I shot myself in the head and died I could sort of start my life over. I don’t want to ever think like that and I don’t want to think that’s my only option. My birthday is coming up in 2 days and I want to be happy that I made it to 25. I saw one time that you could talk to people on hotlines or text them? If you have any information please let me know.
173,I'm too depressed,[deleted]
174,Rumination of perceived bad decisions,"I have convinced myself that all my life I've made the wrong decision. When there was a fork in the road, I chose the path that was wrong at the time (investments, career, real estate).

I can't seem to convince myself otherwise, I've tried to write down positive things that have come out of my decisions, but it seems to gravitate towards the negative over and over again. I get a sick feeling that I'm somehow getting dopamine or pleasure out of this depressive behaviour, which is enabling me to continue it rather than curtail it.

It's taking a toll on my family, SO, and child. I can't seem to concentrate on anything else (OCD?) and I get agitated and frustrated with my SO when they try and comfort me about it."
175,Deep rooted insecurities have led me to believe I’m unlovable?,"I don’t actually think insecurities is the right word but anyways does anyone else feel like no matter what they’re not loved? I struggle so hard with this. My relationships with family, so, friends, etc. suffer because of this and I find it extremely difficult to form new relationships with other people because it doesn’t seem genuine or real. For instances my boyfriend and I have been together for one year and I still struggle to form a connection/bond with his family. I struggle with bonding with new people in general. Now this might be because I didn’t have my biological dad growing up and my mom/stepdad weren’t the most loving people and I was basically taught showing emotion is wrong but I don’t know. It all just sucks and hurts because I just don’t feel loved? Any advice or similar feelings or stories would help. I’m just tired of feeling alone and unlovable. I haven’t had the easiest life and I’ve experienced plenty of traumas and I’m sure that’s why I feel like this. It’s just hard to deal with and it’s hard to figure out."
176,How to retain focus?,[deleted]
177,Feeling alone and unloved,"I recently got into a series of arguments with my bf who I put a lot of my emotional support and well being into. (yes I know this is very bad and I should be self sufficient without anyone but thats just not how it is for me) I used to be a self harmer and last night we got into an argument so bad that I did something to myself that I regret (you know what I mean). Of course there were other reasons than him being the cause of my stress and my recent newfound depression in quarantine (my grandma died and I cant go to her funeral, my mom has been lashing out and we have been fighting nonstop, I had to move out of my college dorm and away from all of my friends and I have been heavily neglecting school work and getting bad grades) He saw it (it was discreet on my hip under my panties, im not an idiot) and he starts asking me why I would do that to him and talking about how bad it makes him feel and how I'm stupid and how terrible things are for him. I broke down and he decides to leave me to go take a shower but I ask him to not leave me alone and I tell him that I need him, but he leaves anyways. he comes back and continues to talk about himself. I feel like he doesnt care about me and my feelings on it at all. I keep apologizing for doing  it because i know it was stupid but he cant really understand it at all and I feel stuck. Any advice on what to do?"
178,Living With Uncertainty✨," **The problem we’re currently facing can be solved by realizing a new level of awareness**

The fastest way to get there is by letting go of the current identity that we’re attached to

Try to observe during your day the different attachment you experience in the form of thoughts and emotions, simply witness them

True power lies in awareness, awareness acts as a fire to the different impurities that are creating problems in the different areas of our life.

If you’re having experience of the same inner patterns over and over again I guess that is time to realize a new level of awareness where you’ll be able to experience yourself and your reality from a completely different perspective :)

179,They called me a terrorist,"It was early 2017. I was sitting in my dorm room browsing YouTube after I had finished all my homework. If I recall correctly, I was watching a video about the then-upcoming Star Wars film while munching on some Skittles.

Suddenly, someone knocked on my door. I opened the door and lo and behold, it was a team of police officers with their weapons drawn. They told me someone reported me as an active shooter.

***Falsely*** *reported me. I did not make any threats. I had no intentions to do any harm to anyone. I had no mental health issues. I had no access to any weapons. I had no intentions to gain access to any weapons.* ***I did literally nothing to indicate that I would commit such an atrocity yet there those cops stood, telling me that I was a terrorist.***

Regardless of the fact that they had no evidence to back up their ridiculous claims about me, they took me to the emergency room and got me involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric unit. The reason for admission was depression. Again, I did not have depression but because a bunch of corrupt police officers told the hospital staff I did, they treated me like I did despite them having no evidence to prove that I did. I was released a week later with a $90,000 medical bill, an email of permanent expulsion from the school (reason: ""public disturbance""), and no chance at pressing charges against the cops who falsely accused me. Because if I was going to sue them, I was basically going to sue the entire department, which, in the United States, is an impossibility.

I later found out the guy who falsely reported me did so because he did not like my ethnicity. My ethnicity doesn't even have the terrorist stereotype attached to it (I'm European) but that was his reasoning.

I do not care about the medical bill and I do not care about the expulsion I received. Those things don't bother me. What does bother me, however, is the fact that I am now living in a constant state of ultra-vigilance. I am not just living in fear of criminals. I am living in fear of both the people around me and the police officers who are supposed to protect me. I am living in fear that any second, some cop is gonna bust down my door and drag me off, either to jail or to an emergency room, all because of some baseless false accusation made by some random person.

I have multiple VPN subscriptions across all my devices to cover up the tracks of anything I do online. All of my social media are completely anonymous and I can no longer connect with my family on Facebook, Instagram, etc. I am constantly changing my IP address to confuse anyone who might be tracking me. I am constantly re-reading everything I post to reduce the chances of any misinterpretations or false accusations. I am constantly changing my phone number to confuse any authorities who might be trying to hunt me down, again due to false accusations that cannot be proven. At the slightest indicator of any potential false accusation made against me, I have to erase all my hard drives, buy new devices, change my sim card, leave me house for a few days, cover up my tracks, and do all this other bizarre stuff that no innocent first-world citizen should have to do. *I have to be constantly on edge, on alert, and ready to uproot myself at any moment, all because some guy thought it would be a wonderful idea to falsely report me as a terrorist without any evidence whatsoever.*

I am legally allowed to own weapons but I have forfeited that opportunity out of fear that someone is gonna misinterpret me as a threat. My first and second amendment rights are basically off the table because of what happened to me. I am not even able to physically defend myself from any criminals or crooked police officers anymore. If the cops find me and falsely accuse me of a crime I didn't commit, I have no means of defending myself from them; I'm just screwed. Or god forbid if some criminal breaks into my house and tries to murder me, I'm equally screwed. Hence why I'm always so vigilant and so on edge.

**I can't even sleep at night anymore. I periodically start hyperventilating and go into convulsions due to the memories of what happened to me. I reminisce about the perfect social life and career path I had before this happened to me. I live in constant fear that some stranger is going to falsely report me, send a team of cops to my house, and get me sent either to jail or to a psychiatric unit again without giving me a chance at due process, even though I have never done anything illegal, I am not a threat to myself or to anyone else, I have no mental health issues, and for the love of God** ***I am not depressed.***

**To the guy who falsely reported me all those years ago: you ruined my life. I, an innocent man, have to live like a fugitive out of fear that someone like you is going to falsely report me again.**

I don't know if anyone else can relate to this but if you can't, please be thankful for that. What I experienced and what I have to deal with on a daily basis is something I would never wish on my worst enemy (i.e. not even the guy who reported me).

I am truly sorry if I am involuntarily breaking any rules but I had to get this out. I don't know what's allowed and not allowed anymore. I really don't.

*And to anyone who happens to be reading through my post history: this is why I'm always so upset.*

180,Self pitty,"Hi so I’ve been feeling like I feel sorry for myself a lot and it’s annoying me now I just want to be strong and not let everything affect me but I find that emotionally I’m over sensitive and think too much.  I think think why me etc I mean I want to not care so much. And just get over things, is it possible to become this person ?  Just to be stronger mentally and emotionally,  I find I sometimes cry or get really upset if someone upsets me or shouts at me.  I get offended and I just care about this a lot so I fixate on this when the day is going forward regardless .  This is not healthy I know and I’ve read books to find out how to reduce this emotional response but application to real life I find hard.  Basically I just want to be less emotional and care less if something upsets me,  is it possible or is it just nature that I’m built like this?? Because life will be full of struggle and hurt and if I’m over reacting to simple things and getting upset about it how am I going to cope? 

I hope you can advice me with solutions ? 

Many thanks

I attempted to dissapear thrice and you must be asking yourself how is it that I am alive. Well obviously i did it trying to die but actually there's nobody out there that tells you how high should you go or how to cut your veins. Coronavirus only insolates me from the outside world and keeps me inside my mind which is pretty harmful  for a depression. My mind just kills me. My therapist is trying to help me but obviously is not the same. I'm all alone and nobody would care if i die but idk why my mind is always trying to fight. This is the worst could ever happen to a person and i feel like I will never get out of this so the best is to end it right now"

Our state has a stay at home order/ we have multiple cases in my county, I deal with severe anxiety and depression and people are walking in with their three snot nose kids and infant. I have watched people cough over furniture, and everyone is always standing way to close to be 6ft away. I've been having severe panic attacks waking up thinking this will be the day I catch this shit, I will catch it and spread it to someone and kill them, or I will catch it and it will kill me. I finally told my boss and he hasn't replied back. Idk what to do but I'm in a constant state of anxiety not knowing what's going to happen from here. Am I in the wrong here, should I just keep going in and risking my personal safety of me, my wife and for all I know anyone who comes within a 6ft distance of me.

190,I feel blank and empty on ADHD meds. Is this normal?,"I feel blank and empty on ADHD meds. Is this normal?

Hi, I’m a teenager in high school who’s been having trouble with meds for a bit now. I’ve been hopping between different medications for about 4 months now, but recently landed on focalin, the only drug that didn’t seem to give me any physical side effects. However, I feel as if my mental health has been declining. Don’t get me wrong, I realize that depression and anxiety is prevalent in high school, I was was conflicted before the meds, but I don’t recall ever feeling as hollow or empty as I do now. I can deal with bipolar emotions, but it’s hard for me to cope when I can’t easily define them. I don’t necessarily want to live; I don’t necessarily want to die either. I guess I was hoping that medication would help with my lack of motivation and my inability to follow through, but it still is here. I also feel drained of my creativity; my writing is less tasteful, I day dream less, and I feel as if I have no original thoughts.

Looking at what I wrote above, I guess this is more of a mental health thing than an adhd thing. Just looking for some general advice. Thanks"
191,I feel soiled by these events that happened and ruined for me happy things forever,"I'm utterly exhausted and crying, this things are really making me feel hurt, I am terrified of being forced to let go because I can't fix anything of this.

Even worse, what bugs me are problems that can seem irrelevant, so I have been told to focus on something else or to reframe my mindset to devalue this things. But they make me who I am, I desperately want a reset to normalcy, to a world in which these things didn't happened and didn't soil me.

\- I have an item that I dearly love, but an abusive colleague who don't know about this sent me ""humorous"" short videos that mocked and shamed a very similar item, so I feel I can't love my item anymore and I keep crying because she destroyed this connection that made me so happy

\- I put my degree thesis in the hands of a flatmate about to graduate to welcome her in the world of graduate people and she mocked it, so I feel compelled now to throw it away because is soiled, even if I am so proud of it (later in life student here)

\- I always believed I was born at 11:11 daylight saving time because that's what my mother said and it is fundamental for me every year to wait for that exact moment, now she said it was 11:11 standard time and I am desperate to keep celebrating at my precious 11:11 dst time as always, I've been done that for a lifetime and it was a moment full of significance before it was ruined

\- I wanted to celebrate new year 2020 (most important holiday for me, and a palindrome) entirely by myself, but my abusive mother said that my sister visited her on christmas and so I forced myself to go on new year afternoon to get even in being a ""good child"" and now that ritual of new year is ruined forever because I'll never get such a symbolic date again in my life, and I want to make Nature understand that I worship it and I really wanted to dedicate this full symbolic day to celebration and not break it with that visit

\- I wanted to save my wisdom teeth that a dentist wanted to pull because of cavities, she said she could fix them but was so disappointed by my reluctance to pull them that I gave in, and immediately utterly regretted: I wanted to save my body, they were my teeth and part of me, I really wanted to be at their side and fight for them... I'm still crying hard even if time has passed, I want them back like nothing else, I fought so hard to save my tonsils as a child and I wanted exactly the same for my teeth, I just went to that dentist because it was my sister's and I wanted to feel close to her... now I'm regretful to the bone

\- I hate being physically touched, but now that I have to commute with the subway to go to this job I have to be in a line where dirty people from a shady area travel often, and there are a lot of people who don't care about having physical contact... I wanted to live in a secluded garden and just to be accessible by my boyfriend and live in a word where people don't touch me without permission, now I'm completely shamed and I have no clue on how to restore my original purity and exclusive availability... I hate myself for accepting this job

I've been sick for months with this problems, I don't know what to do and I don't want to face the rest of my life with this broken self or even worse to call it normalcy."
192,Can you help me understand,"Hey there, so my attention has gotten very bad, and my ability to comprehend things has gotten worse and worse, and I'd like for that to not be the case anymore, like there are things old me could remember with ease that i just can't, like twice today I was looking up random usernames, they aren't too long, and I'd try and type them in, it'd be wrong and I'd go back and see what it is and that'd repeat a good few times until I finally got it, but I believe me from a year ago could maybe do it. So any tips would be appreciated, I used to read a lot, but I don't anymore, would that help maybe, or something. Ideas would be appreciated"
193,Is this normal for- anything?,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 3rd grade. I have always enjoyed medical stuff and have always been extremely interesting in death and gore. I found murder and road kill fascinating. I have never hurt any animal or person, and I have remorse for people. But I always imagined and dreamed of death. I didn’t want it to happen, but for as long as I can remember, I have had the most grotesque dreams. Example: I had a dream about a man who skinned a bunch of children alive in front of their mother, and hung their skins from hangers in a closet. I had that dream in 3rd grade."
194,Mirror technique - Self healing in quarantine,"Build up your self worth and self respect by doing this: 

Stand in front of a mirror. Look straight in to your eyes and say out loud *""I'm valuable and I matter""*  repeat this 10 times. Do this every day.

 In the beginning you might laugh or think it's ridiculous, but keep going. You'll soon hit that spot where your old core beliefs was, and it will crush you at first, it will hurt, it will be hard, but keep going. After a few weeks depending on, you'll start to notice that you feel more confident saying it, you're used to the habit of hearing it and looking yourself in your eyes and soon your body will respond to it like it's true, and signal it to your mind and then, it will be your new core belief about yourself.

I did this 2012. When I look in a mirror now, I still hear myself saying ""I'm valuable and I matter"" and as if I really SEE my soul when I look in to my own eyes. And my body responds to ""I'm valuable and I matter"" and I feel it and I agree.

Fun fact: You get *physically* stronger by saying positive things about yourself then if you would tell negative things about you. That's exactly how important it is to brainwash you to the positive side and leave the dark side."
195,Is this so wrong,"Is it so wrong that I want to not go anywhere or be seen by anybody I know until I get back on medication? Btw I'm 20, female in the USA.

I have a lot of mental health issues and I haven't been on my medication in 5ish months and I'm really just getting progressively worse the longer I'm not on it. I really am not pleasant at all when I'm having episodes, like I stretch from being super mean and rude to being really depressed and negative. This is the situation that really opened my eyes to NEEDING to get myself back on my medication: I caused a fight between me, my boyfriend and two best friends the other day because I couldn't calm down to even listen to reasoning. I'm not ready to talk to them about it until I can get my mind straight so I can actually explain myself without being defensive or mean. I said some really rude stuff and I was so loud and obnoxious, I just wanna scream when I think back on it cause i was such a b-tch, trust me I was.

I don't wanna be this monster anymore and I just want to get myself straight before I go around others and potentially ruin more friendships and relationships. I'm also asking because the only other person I've talked to about this is my boyfriend and he thinks I shouldn't cut off communication from everybody I know, but he does think I should get back on medication. I'm not really doing this to hide I'm just doing it to make sure that I get my ish straight before causing even more damage, because I do realize what I'm doing and I don't like it. 

I got back into therapy yesterday. It's been since November that I went last, and I have my same therapist. I was so caught up in catching up with the events that have gone on since the last session and also discussing some of my current stressers that I did not mention this topic. I'm going to most definitely speak on it next session, next week. 

Just seeking tips, yes/no's or thoughts. Or if anyone has ever gone through the same thing I'd love to know how you got through it."
196,I need some SSRI advice (TW: self harm / suicide),"
So I posted before about having visual hallucinations on Sertraline (please see other post) 

I have since come off Sertraline and started coming on to 20mg citalopram. Since my last post I have been extremely tired but also very agitated. Like my mind is ping ponging everything possible and getting things confused on the way. I can’t seem to finish anything I start because I don’t care and my friends have said a lot of things I say don’t make sense or are from an old conversation or I’ve started a new one. I’ve also been experiencing really distressing thoughts of paranoid nature i was convinced my mum broke in to my house and was stalking me and was convinced I was being followed at night. I am also convinced that my next door neighbour is a murderer. I’m feeling more level now and realise that was silly but I’m entering a stage of numbness. I’ve been entering a stage of severe suicide idealation I can’t seem to shake and I’m worried I will act.  

Is this my tablets? Anyone have similar experiences"
197,Somewhat worrying dreams,"I don't dream very often but when I do they always contain violence, rape, homicide, etc. What's weird is that I'm always the one doing those things. Just last night I had a pretty short dream. I don't remember any details from it other than the basic storyline. I was walking down a street at night, and a man, held a knife to my throat and demanded my money. I remember he looked in his late teens or early 20s and was a good deal shorter than me. Instead of handing over my wallet or fighting, I just licked the knife really sensually and tempted the man with sex. He began to back away and eventually turned around. Right after that I pretty much pounced on him and began savagely raping him. I don't remember anything after that and I'm pretty sure that's when I woke up. Other dreams I'll just kill a person and the dream ends. Other times there's an in depth story, but it always ends with violent crime done by me. Does it mean anything or do I just have weird dreams and that's it?"
198,I don't know what's wrong,"I am posting for some advice..
The basic story is i have some undiagnosed issue which is ruining/ruined my relationship.
I have no feelings most of the time. Sometimes I wonder if i actually have feelings for my partner.
When i do have feelings it feels false. Especially now. She has told me she still loves me and wants to be with me but can't take it anymore. She can't just move out as she has a 6yo, no savings for a deposit and from what we can see due to the lock down moving is not possible.
We have just watched a movie together and i just wanted to be closer to her...it hurts..i don't know how i am feeling or why i am feeling it. I just know its not good.
I'm not suicidal but I have been.
I know and understand why she wants out, but i feel it will never change. I know i need to see someone but it feels like it will take longer than i have.
I know this is just a load of nonsense but i need so much help and i can't keep it in but i have no one to turn to."
199,My father never loved me,"I'm having a breakdown right now and I need help. I was raised by my father because my mother had brain damage from complications from a surgery when I was five and she doesn't even remember who I am. 

My father never was never the first to tell me he lived me, he only did when I told him first when I was a child. He either yelled at me, put me down, gaslighted me or ignored me all together through my whole childhood/youth. I can't remember a normal conversation I had with him except maybe once after the Christmas after I moved out. He emotionally and on some occasions physically (put my head down a toilet, put tape over my mouth once when I was crying) abused me. 

I have so many scars I carry around with me since childhood and now my boyfriend of three years, whom Iove more than anything, told me he stopped loving me but wants to try again as soon as this damn quarantine ends. We live together so we are technically on a break but still see each other every day. This event ""triggered"" all the trauma I have from my childhood I thought I was over. No one loved me and I'm starting to believe no one ever will. I'm hurting so much right now and just need to vent.
If anyone has advice on how to cope with all this pain, I appreciate it. Most of the time I have my unhealthy coping mechanisms (just don't think about it, Bury my feelings,...) but sometimes, like now, my feelings come to the surface and overwhelm me.
Sorry for any mistakes, I am upset and English is not my first language."
200,Sorry for posting so much,"I finally feel like I can just word vomit everything I am going through.  I had a huge trigger Monday which led me to have a massive anxiety spell.  That led to an anxiety ""hangover"" Tuesday. Tuesday I had two big exams and I didn't do well which spiked my anxiety even higher.  I had another exam today.  I am at a breaking point. I feel like I have no calm down when it comes to anything.  I am loosing it since I have even more on my plate I can't take care of my anxiety levels now.  I just want to make it all go away and feel better (I am not suicidal). My doctor got back with me today to up my meds to hopefully have a change in anxiety level.  My school semester will be over in 4 weeks.  I just feel like I am loosing it and there is nothing else to hold on to.  I relapsed on cutting again and my eating disorder is getting out of control. I am in therapy and working on it I just don't have access to my therapist all the time.  None of my friends or classmates can understand what I am going through.  My family and loved ones try and they just tell me that I am much harder on myself and as long as I am doing the best I can then I shouldn't worry. They don't let my feelings be validated that I am okay to experience some anxiety based off the situations.  "
201,Why look forward to anything,"I have now stopped looking forward to things. I feel like everytime I do, I end up getting disappointed because nothing turns out being as good as I was expecting. I just see no point in looking forward to anything anymore, I give up"
202,Having FOMO!!,"Hey guys,

It’s apparent to me that I have FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and I want to learn how to cope with this. I hate it, especially during this quarantine. 

Does anyone know how to avoid having feelings of FOMO? I’ve tried deleting Social Media but I realized that wether I like it or not, social media is almost pretty much needed in this society. 

I’m an athlete and love math.

I believed I wanted to be the person posting on social media making people wish they were me but I realized I find it cringe trying to post things like that."

204,Body image,"I’m an 18 yo male, senior year of high school, and I’ve always been the really skinny guy. About three years ago I started working out but didn’t take it seriously, I took on a little muscle. Seven months ago I started taking it seriously, and I have made little progress. I had started exercising to try to improve my mental health, but my very small progress has been snowballing inside my head and I am getting more and more frustrated. I’m not very(physically) strong at all, but my body does not look weak I don’t think, but all I can think about is the minimal size I’ve put on. I put so much effort in and get nothing back. This is especially frustrating because I was so excited to be able to put effort into my health and get something out of it, because my mental health only gets worse no matter what I do.

I am also very sexually frustrated (I am gay) and I think this is one of the factors behind my body image. My frustration is getting more intense with every week, especially with quarantine(I have a home gym), and I can’t stop thinking about it over and over. I feel like a little p*ssy, and it is all I can think about all the time. I’ve been trying to keep myself busy but it makes me more frustrated to not be researching fitness. I’ve been considering ending my life more and more. I’m on smallish doses of two antidepressants but I am very scared to increase/try different medications because I had a very breaking experience with a dose increase once. I don’t know what to do, I just don’t want to feel like that anymore I don’t care what it takes. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it so so much and if I left out anything relevant you want to know just let me know"

209,I love it but it makes me depressed - TW: death,"This post was going to be wayyyyyyy longer but I decided to just post the short version. 

While I absolutely love physics, and most specifically astrophysics, it makes me severely depressed. With that I mean that while I love studying about how everything, including the universe, works, but the moment I read about how it will be in the future it makes me realise how insignificant we are and it also makes me incredibly aware of the inevitability of death.

This has actually caused me a lot of issues the last few years. It has caused me insomnia, anxiety, depression etc. The moment I read about the ""future of the universe"" I feel a weight on my chest and panic. More often than not, it doesn't let me sleep as I spend hours lying on my bed, often crying, thinking about death. I'm honestly tired of being that afraid of death. It's probably really unhealthy too."
210,Can worrying over a mental health issue give you symptoms of that issue?,"Recently I have suspected I have some certain issue...Recently I have been noticing signs here and there if it. Now, what I am wondering is, if you suspect you have a neurological condition, is it possible to develop symptoms from thinking to much about it and reading about it a lot? While I do fit into some signs, I do not remember doing a lot of them before I started worrying about it. Problem is that I do not have an elephants memory and could have simply not remembered about instances in my past where I showed clear signs of said neurological condition.

 So, to keep it short, is it possible that I developed some symptoms from thinking about it and over analyzing my behaviors? Some examples would be:making certain repetitive movements and sensitivity to bright light. I am aware that it could be just me recognizing it because I am thinking about it. Thanks.

Edit: 
1. I do not, and never have felt like I am suffering or having a lower quality of life than others, but at times I feel like I am at risk of getting overly obsessed about some things I am really interested in, and then try to avoid it. Other than that my life is good.
2. Why is my post pinned?"
211,I had really bad PND when my daughter was born and I have a long history of depression and anxiety but I'm not 100% convinced...,"So yeah, I'm 31 and since I was in my early 20s I have had periods of depression and anxiety according to my doctor which I am on antidepressants for.

However, without going into my whole upbringing (it was shit and there was a lot of physical abuse from my dad to my mum and my mum also had Bipolar) I'm not at all convinced I have only depression and I don't think I have anxiety, my overwhelming feelings aren't of anxiety.

I definitely think I have BPD. My moods can change within hours, I can be super happy and ""normal"" for a short while and then i can just change to being really irritable, angry and upset the next. My husband has mentioned a few times that I often speak very very quickly and it's hard for him to understand so he sometimes asks me to repeat myself which pisses me off for some reason. I also have this overwhelming fear of being abandoned, like, my mum passed away when I was 24 and I've not filled that void at all. I have zero contact with my dad because of my childhood, but when it comes to my husband and my daughter or my close friends I can't bare the thought of them leaving me but deep down it's a feeling I can't shake in thinking it'll happen one day.

When my daughter was born, she's 2 now I had really bad PND, I had a community nurse because I couldn't cope. I had some pretty dark thoughts about harming myself and giving my daughter up to for adoption. I didn't want to hold her, look at her or anything at all and I did everything I could to avoid her I just didn't bond with her at all. However, as I say she's 2 now and whilst sometimes I still struggle I love her to pieces and couldn't be without her... But I worry that the way I was when she was born and over these past 2 years could have possibly harmed our relationship, certainly hers to me if that makes sense?

I just feel like whilst I know I have depression, my mood swings and the constant up and down can't just be that?

Can anyone shed any light?"
212,"Social media is bringing back my depression and so are my "" Friends"" also possible trigger warning","So ive (23f) been thinking about deactivating my facebook account. I feel like shit. After having kids i gained a lot of weight and all i see is people posting there work out stories and how skinny they are. I also have been having a issue with the fact that one of my husband and mine friends is being so fake and is pretending that were okay. However they just ignore me and dont say a thing to me. 

Back story. Last year my mental health was absolutely horrible. Im Bipolar 1 and i was manic for over 9 months. I had started a new job working as a support care professional and i was working night shift so my mental health declined rapidly but i didnt notice not until I cheated on my husband.  It really hurt our friend circle an my kids. I had a complete mental break down in September and was hospitalized. When i got out i started a new job and it was a huge coincidence booster. I was seeing my psychologist and therapist regularly and i finally found a medication that has allowed me to be stable 7 months. 

I know i shouldnt let our friends bring me down considering i fix my relationship with my husband going to couple therapy and no we no longer have to go because were really good again. I just dont think he will understand why this hurts so much when i have busted my ass to get stable and im still looked at like this monster. We met with our friends back in March and they were all buddy buddy and when we left said ""love you guys"". But i only feel like its true to him they had been on his side the whole time never reached out to me. 

I just feel so fucking hurt still. I feel like deactivating my account will make me feel better but i dont know. I just dont wanna see people posting there work out stuff. I know its happy for them but it just brings me down. I also dont want to see our friends ""perfect life""."

214,loneliness and anxiety,"hey there
I've been feeling extremely anxious lately over everything in my life, especially my relationships with people. Last year I was diagnosed with depressive-anxious syndrome and it keeps getting worse since college started. After a year I've decided to attend therapy again and I had my first session on Monday.
 Everything seems terrifying to me these days. I need someone to talk to and maybe get friends with. All of my other ""close"" people I had abandoned me over the years. Dunno what to do"

216,My parents call me “Emotionally Distant” what does that mean?,[deleted]
217,Simply giving in around my friends.,"Should you or should you not argue with your friends if they are the only ones you have and you'll probably feel lonely if you mess it up?
I've never been able to argue or fight with my friends. I just simply give in. I just can't seem to raise my opinion fearing that it might get rejected and I'll feel miserable about it. I don't know if it's right or wrong. But atleast at the end of the day, I can sleep peacefully keeping in mind that I'm on good terms with my friends. 
It justs maintain my mental peace. 
You feel me? Should I do something differently?"
218,My Father's mental state has completely deteriorated and has put a massive strain on the house during quarantine.,"My father for a couple years now has gotten into weird religious stuff. It was weird but acceptable before the transplant he got for his kidney in 2017 but ever since the surgery he has gone crazy. He used to be part of cult esq group but has left them and has been on his own for a year now. Ever since quarantine, he has completely lost it. He spends every waking moment on Facebook, staring at abstract images that he believes are messages from Jesus himself. He believes hes an apostle and has been building shrines in and outside the house out of random junk. He hallucinates and see things that aren't there.  He lies to everyone in the family, stealing our stuff for his shrines or taking out large amounts of money buying random things. He has lost 25 pounds in the last two weeks as he says he is too busy for food. He sleeps at random hours, he thinks every word, every color, every sound is a message from god. He refuses to follow quarantine guidelines as he believes he cannot die. He constantly leaves the house, goes to graveyards and churches for a divine quest or something.

He has put a massive strain on the family and my mother has becomes incredibly upset at the thought of getting him mental help. I have no trust for him as I think hes a danger to the house. He lies, he manipulates, and one time he left the burners on the stove on as a show of ""faith"". I can't sleep when hes awake as I don't know what he will do.  

 Its only getting worse with time. His behavior becomes more and more chaotic and unpredictable. What was one shrine has turned into 15. I just don't know what to do."
219,SSRI helped but I am stuck,"I used to have terrible social anxiety from elementary to high school. Then my application to my dream university was denied and I became completely depressed, going to a weaker uni and still doing terrible grade-wise. After 3 years my grades were so bad I would have had to repeat semesters. Instead I started an even easier major, and also started doing SSRI (doing 200 mg of sertraline now). 

The antidepressant took effect quite slowly so I failed that major too already in the first year. Now (1 year later) I feel much better but have been living with my Mom for this year, doing basically nothing (playing the piano, reading, playing video games etc.) My mother thinks I will never be able to work and live with her forever. I am feeling better now and think I could start working but I have very little incentive to do so because the desire to start my own life and actually do something is quiet dulled (maybe from the SSRI), and doing nothing like this feels pretty OK too.

Has anyone been in such a situation? And what did you do?"
220,First love,"Do you ever go back and think about what it could have been. Recently I have started to think about her and wondering if the choices I made. I walked away to make her happy because I felt like I was holding her back and that she deserves better someone who is not a emotional wreck like me. She was my rock the one who kept me sane, and I let that slip from my hand. It been three years and there hasn't been a time where I though about going back but as I said she deserves someone better who can bring her happiness and joy. The decision to walk away was difficult but when things went well the rug got pulled from under me and in that respect I felt I was justified but now I wished I had stayed."

222,Starting therapy soon..,"For a while now I've known my mental state has very much deteriorated and I've been finding it hard to just exist in all honesty and experience true happiness. Whatever that may be.
I've had anxiety for some time now and it never reach this severity before. At this point honestly I feel numbed out because of it.
But I'm flushed with all kinds of emotions ranging from too much mania to very bad depression. 
I feel it's been a trend that's been going on for a while and I just keep putting off dealing with it or I just forget(adhd really doesn't help there idk)
I think i'm using this platform to maybe vent out a little before I hopefully actually go through with it and get the help I need.  
So today(tomorrow) I finally am seriously going through with it. Gonna register in my clinic and see where it goes..
I only fear the thoughts in the back of my head coming out.. And that possibly the only thing that can actually benefit me is medication.."
223,I had a mental breakdown today,This quarantine is the worst for my mental health and focus. I've already had the hardest time focusing before everything happened with the virus and now just being at home all the time when I study is the worst. I'm only taking 1 class right now (my last class) and working so things literally aren't even that bad for me. I could have all my work done so quick and relax if i could just sit down and get it all done. I'm have been diagnosed ADD and am really thinking I need to start getting prescribed adderall again. So tired of feeling stuck.
224,i feel like i hurt everyone i love,"title is pretty self explanatory. 

i keep accidentally upsetting or hurting or angering people, i forget to consider what i’m going to say and how it may impact whomever i’m saying it to. i feel like a dick and i feel so fucking guilty. 

i wish i could express properly"
225,I feel so sad and useless,"Hello,

ever since I can remember I've never been really happy or had any feelings for anything happening, I was always emotionless. Until I've met my third ex-girlfriend... Since she left me a week ago I've been feeling super bad.

I was been born on 24.4.2000. and live in Croatia. I don't really have any memories before middle school besides being kicked out of Tekvando due to having too much fun with my best friend and some from kindergarten. So the story starts around September 2008. I went to school late so I could go to class with my best friend then. I remember the first day of middle school like it was yesterday. 

When I came there the teachers separated us, 40 students, into 2 classes A and B, my luck started to show than when I learned my best friend ended up in class A and I was in class B. Mom told me it was because they knew we were best friends and didn't want us to make trouble since we were always ""Up to no good"" I remember crying the whole day... A little after that It started to show I wasn't really good fit in the class since the other kids started bullying me. Fast forward a few months my parents signed me up to fencing with my best friend, sounds great and it was for a year or soo but than I learned I don't really like going to fencing it was more my best friends interest than mine and it was a lot of stress for me since I was also bullied there. My best friend and I already started to drift apart at that point seeing each other only 2 times a week, he found new friends in school and I was still being bullied so I wasn't really cool. My parents forced me to go to fencing despite me crying and fighting every time we had to go. I was pretty bad in school passing with 3 and 4 mostly ( we have grades from 1-5, 5 being best) and most of my classmates passed with straight 5s. At that point, I was diagnosed with dyslexia. In 3rd grade, the bullying became even worst since the other kids noticed if you put one letter (the last letter of my lastname) in front of my name it became a synonym for asshole in our language after that everybody called me asshole In school. The teachers would also always silently laugh when they would say my name except for my main teacher, respect for her. The things I liked in middle school were drawing, graffiti, video games and playing guitar and that's basically everything I did besides fencing since I didn't really have any friends to hang out with on non-birthday days.

After a long 8 years I survived middle school and was still fencing, I was sort of good at it but nothing special. I tried a few other sports but I never liked any so my parents still forced me to do fencing. The time came to go to highschool.  In Croatia, we have a lot of different specialized high schools and since I didn't really have good grades and didn't really know any high schools since nobody talked to me about that. I knew there was one for electricians, one for aircraft mechanics and gimnazije which you could only get into if you had good grades ( Its sort of dumb since that's basically prolonging middle school ). 

My father always sort of pushed me to like aviation and planes since he had a PPL. So I just automatically went for that. I was always good at drawing and anything mechanical so I thought its a good idea. Little did I know the school would be hell on earth for me. Not only was it more than an hour away It was, excuse my french, hard as FUCK and I grew from the whole aviation thing pretty fast. The classmates were cool tho and I made a few friends the first year. But I realized that the average percentage of students who fail in a year is around 40%. That's a lot of people repeating years. The reason being you had to score 70% to pass the technical exams.

The 2nd year for some yet unknown reason I started to become popular in school and my hometown. But with that came the heavy smoking and drinking. 

I started smoking and drinking in 7th grade of middle school since I wanted to feel accepted at least on the island I spent my summers on where I hung around with older friends. One time I got so drunk while on the island I ended up in the ER in 8th grade. 

Back to the whole becoming popular thing, since I had a lot of ""friends"" all of a sudden, I learned there is also an art high school, that's when the school I chose started to become even more of a burden. Besides it being hard as FUCK and far away I learned there is one I would love to go too and it was even close to my house. So naturally, I asked my parents to change schools because I would love to go there. The answer was art is a useless skill.

At that point, I realized my dad was more living his dream through my life than me actually doing what I liked. They never mentioned that school when I would ask them about highschools. They would always say become an Aircraft Mechanic YOU LOVE planes. So I sort of lost respect for my dad then and started going out more and more with my ""friends"". 

At the end of the 2nd grade, my class went on a school trip where I got super drunk and broke my knee and nose. I've broken bones before but nothing this bad... 

I had 2 screws in my knee and my face looks like I took a knife to the nose. The whole thing with my knee really fucked me in the head since I was bed-bound for a little more than 3 months, had to learn to walk again twice (when they set the screws and when they took them out a year later) and almost failed 2nd grade. I couldn't continue with fencing so my mom was really pissed about that even tho I never wanted to go to fencing and it was a pain in my ass. I mean that was the only good thing that came from that (not my mom being pissed). After finally getting out of bed I found out my girlfriend doesn't like the way I look with my new destroyed nose and she broke up with me. But I still had my ""friends"" with whom Id go clubbing. Where I met my second girlfriend with whom I was the rest of the way through high school on and off (2 years). Somewhere in the middle of 3rd grade, I realized my ""friends"" liked my money but not me so I cut ties with them.  Since I was the kid who broke his knee on a school trip I wasn't really so popular in high school as well anymore. My teachers also lost respect for me because of the whole thing.  So I was just a bit better at that time than In middle school since I had a few stoner friends in class and a girlfriend. 

At that point, I started smoking weed heavily, depending on the day 2-8 joints, since It helped me with my anxiety and made me think I am happy so I would be in a better mood while high. I was a huge pothead until recently. That didn't help me with my grades and I almost failed the 3rd  year of high school along with my pothead friends and a few others. I think my dad sort of stopped liking me than since his friend was my teacher and he would talk a lot of shit about me, I think he tolerates me only because I am his son. I also got tattooed when I turned 18  and that's when my mom sort of started throwing more shade than usual even tho I'm a sucker for any type of art and love tattoos and graffiti. While in the 4th year I got my driver's license and found my love for cars, I had my motorcycle license and liked bikes but cars are next level. My uncle owns a rally team so I started studying my ass off to impress him and get a chance to drive a little with him. I almost failed 4th grade still and went to extensions again but my uncle is a cool dude and realized my love and interest in the sport so he let me drive trough summer. I broke up with my girlfriend since things ware not going anywhere with her. I lost my stoner friends when I ended high school. But I had two good friends left and were single and driving, through the summer had a lot of fun. I worked in a bar to pay for gas and some other things. On the job, I meet the girl of my dreams. She is smart, funny good, looking and charismatic. Somehow I made her my girlfriend and finally at that point, I started to feel some happiness and not like I'm just standing by watching my life like a movie. Everything started looking up and I didn't feel so empty that summer.

Just to clarify that summer lasted a long time since school ended early because it was the last year. Almost 5 months.

Then she moved to Amsterdam to go to college and we were apart for 3 months. I had a good-paying job at the bar and was driving but I started feeling empty again all of a sudden. I bought a tattoo machine and tattooed my friend and my self but I still wasn't happy... Since I went to Amsterdam for a week to visit her and liked it I booked the EBS Amsterdam international course since I don't wanna have anything to do with planes for a while after school. I still had plans to later work as an Aircraft mechanic since its a great paying job despite me not really liking aviation and planes after school. My girlfriend got back to Croatia for winter break and after we went to Amsterdam together. It was amazing and I truly loved every minute there even tho I had some problems with finding a place and failed EBS. I almost got a promising job at the airport but that slipped from me... At that point, I started feeling empty again... I loved my girlfriend and was ready to do anything for her. When I was with her I was truly happy and I really never felt that feeling with anybody or anything else. I felt like I had the power to move a mountain just by blowing at it. She made me into a better person and would always motivate me to try harder when I wanted to quit trying. After a week or so, I found a job at a bar. then the first day I was supposed to work.

The coronavirus started making havoc in Amsterdam, everything closed and it became more than a meme. I lost my job needless to say. So about 2 or 3 weeks into the virus we decided to go back to Croatia since it started looking like the airports were gonna close. We took the last plane to Croatia if I'm not wrong. So now we were back in Croatia but we had to be 2 weeks in self-isolation. That was the worst time of my life. My parents put me in my room and literally didn't let me out for 2 whole fucking weeks. I started losing my mind but I was so excited to see my girlfriend that I just focused on that and got through it. The last day came and I was making plans for tomorrow, my girlfriend didn't feel so good so I asked what her plans are, I wanted to go smoke one with my buddies since I didn't see them for about 3 months. We got into a bit of an argument that day but she said I should come by her place later. I didn't think much of it since she was a bit sick so it looked like she was just a bit grumpy that day. After I met my buddies I was rushing to my girlfriend super excited and happy I'm finally gonna see her after two weeks, I texted her that I'm coming. She was upset and called me angrily to tell me her friend is there and ""why the fuck am I coming over"" after a painful phone call with her and her friend yelling how worthless I am in the background she told me to come and take my stuff... She broke up with me... That crushed me... When I saw her I told her to sit and talk to me in the car but she just threw my stuff in and told me to go... I didn't sleep the whole night I was desperately calling and texting her to talk to me, she blocked me on everything... I somehow got her to talk with me the day after, she told me I never listened to her and that we fought too much... That crushed me even more... I did everything I could for her and I always had her best interest in mind, yes we fought every now and then but we lived together and the fights would be minor and normal like what to eat and where to go... The usual shit... I was so crushed after the 2 weeks of self-isolation and not sleeping I couldn't even mumble a word all I could do was cry and smack my head against the starting wheel. She gave me a calming pill and rushed off. That was the last time I saw her.

 Its been a week since and with everything happening all I can do is be home and think about the breakup, drive around,  and see my buddies once in a while. Since I've been in my room for 2 weeks and meeting people is sort of a no no and hard since they live far away. I've been mostly driving around. I couldn't sleep or eat the past week all I did was think about her except when I was driving. Today I wrecked my car. Now all I have left is be at home. I've never been so sad, angry and tired. Without the car, I have to be home and the worst thing is I don't have any motivation to draw or do anything to get my mind off the breakup. I'm just becoming more and more depressed every minute. I feel so empty and like I truly have no purpose now... No job, no school or college, parents think I'm crazy, friends live too far away to see them, I have a creative blockade, I'm not sleeping or eating and for some reason, I'm thinking about middle school a lot...

I once again feel like I'm just watching my life go by, the only difference is I feel something and its just sadness and disappointment. What do I do now..."
226,Minds: Beautiful &amp; Complex 1,"The beginning - Quarantine has been going on for 3 weeks and I have just about lost grip on reality. The only thing keeping me from forgetting what day it is, is my home working schedule. Everything else feels stuck or pointless. I mean there’s so many reasons to push on, it’s not going to last forever. Sure feels like it though."
227,I keep having horrible nightmares after my parents told me they care about my bipolar toxic sister more than me,"Sorry for the throwaway, this has a lot of information that makes it really easy to identify me if anyone knows me.

Ever since quarantine has started, I can't sleep at all and I keep having these horrible nightmares, and I just start randomly crying. I love my parents (most of the time) but for my entire life they've completely ignored my well being in favor of my sister (who's 2 years younger than me). I wasn't allowed to go out with my friends, I had to get a job to buy things for myself, I wasn't allowed to date, and I was constantly emotionally abused to the point where I can't even take one tiny negative comment without bursting out in tears. My sister is an absolutely disgusting person who literally only gets joy from other peoples pain; she left our high school because people saw the way she treated me and other people and they hated her so much they bullied her out. She's only friends with people that live at least 10 miles away and don't know anything about her because once they see her true colors they leave. She has tried to beat me up, threatened to have me jumped and stabbed, stolen my car and then crashed it, lied to everyone who would listen about me to make me look bad, and worst of all have told my parents that I'm the reason that she has all these problems and that I make her want to kill herself (which she's tried). She sells drugs and fake pills, has a major alcohol/theft problem, has repeatedly gotten suspended from school for threatening to kill people, and is an insane pathological liar who will do and say anything to get what she wants. She refuses to see a psychiatrist and take her medications and my parents just let her do anything she wants.

I don't think I'm perfect but I'm a decent person. I have a big group of great friends who are really good people and very supportive of me, I'm at a really well known and prestigious school working really hard towards a career that I know will allow me to help people, and I try my best to be kind to everybody I meet. I had to completely move out of my family home and into an apartment because my sister was constantly abusing me and my parents said that I have to take it because if I retaliate and she kills herself, it would be my fault. In a recent manic phase, she texted me unprompted (I haven't had contact or even seen her in MONTHS) that next time she sees me she's going to beat me up. Blocked her number, called my parents, and they said they couldn't do anything about it. 

All of this has left me feeling so depressed and unloved, and I'm 99% sure I have OCD in addition but my primary care physician refuses to acknowledge any sort of problems I have because I'm 'a healthy girl'. My friends try to be there for me but they don't understand how it feels to have your family tell you that you shouldn't come home because your sister is there and that's more important. I keep up a front but every time I'm alone I think about my situation and I just cry because I can't do anything about it.

I'm not a violent person in any means either, but this whole thing has me so upset that I keep having these horrible nightmares of attacking my sister, or her killing herself. As much as I can't stand her, I obviously would never wish her dead and these dreams make me feel even worse and so guilty. I'm stuck inside now with just me and my thoughts so I can't stop thinking like this, and it's getting hard for me to cope. I was trying to reach out to a shrink/therapist but offices are closed now and I'm scared that they would just be like my PCP and ignore everything I say. I just don't know what to do."
228,This Lamactal might be the fucking death of me,"Okay I’m probably being a little dramatic but I just got my prescription for Lamactal raised from 50 to 100mgs.

And oh my god right now it feels like I have the flu; my head is throbbing, I feel so nauseous, my stomach had been cramping so much, I have a low grade fever, my muscles feel sore and weak, and I’ve been having a shit load of diarrhea. To be fair the fever might be from my really bad UTI that I found out about this morning but the rest I’m almost positive is the Lamactal’s side effects.

How long does this crap last? Are any of those symptoms very serious that I should be concerned about?"
229,Ending it,"I have for a long time though about ending my life. I know that it would make my family sad and that for most people it gets better. In a way i dont realy want to die, just not be anymore. I have tried to find joy, but for the last 5 years i have not had more then small gaps of less then half a day of happines. Most of the time i just think of ways to justify ending it. I am still in therapy. This is my fifth psychatrist in 2 years. Most of them move on to better jobs making a big amount of the small progress i make with them completely useless. My current one doesnt want anything to do with me aswell. I have tried a lot of things to make me feel happy, but most of them just make it worse. If i dont feel better soon i dont think i will be able to hold back the urge to end anymore."
230,"Is this sadness or depression, idk",[deleted]
231,Iss it normal to feel stressed when talking to friends?,"Over the last few days I've started feeling stressed and overwhelmed when I talk to my friends for a bit. I end up having to leave the conversation and sit with my head in my hands for a few minutes. 
Does anyone else experience anything like this, and is there anything I can do to stop myself feeling like this?"
232,How do you overcome regret? As it's unavoidable.,"Feeling like you wasted the last year of your life by easily avoidable, and unimportant decisions, that took only a few seconds to make is one of the worst types of feelings you can have.

After recovering somewhat from depression, bad anxiety, and daily panic attacks caused by these decisions, I now have to overcome the regret and sadness of how much of my potential I lost due to the poor decision I made that was so easily avoidable.

What things can I think and say to mitigate maximally, the regret and the overwhelming wish that I was back 2 years ago when I was okay and fine and my life was on track?"
233,just some words about me,"Hi, i (19,f) really dont know if im posting this to the right place and please forgive me if im not. im also very new to reddit so i dont really understand how this all works, sorry again. i guess recently i've been going through some tough times and i simply want to vent and let it all out, and then try and really get better. (also just a quick TW i will briefly mention some triggering topics but no detail)

im just going to start at the beginning of my issues with my mental health, i was about 12 and my dad had an affair on my mum and abruptly left, as in the same day. the woman he cheated with (who he is still with to this day) he met through both being scout leaders. her son was in my form at high school. my dad is still in my life today but its definitely not a close relationship. after he left my mental health quickly got very bad. (TW) after taking an overdose i ended up in hospital. i told some close friends but i guess in year 9 things can so easily get out and before i knew it everyone knew about what had happened. i cant really say i got bullied, i definitely had friends but once id come back to school afterwards i could feel the aura change around me. perhaps that was because i was just sad and had bad energy about me, but certain people made comments that i dont think i will ever be able to forget. there was a particular comment made by an ex boyfriend where he alluded to my surname (i have a very uncommon surname, i dont know anyone else with it) and wrote a comment along the lines of (TW again) 'she's so stupid she doesn't even know how to kill herself properly'. Obviously anyone who saw that would know it was me. there was a couple of people who stuck up for me, but i stayed silent. ive barely mentioned it to anyone other than my therapist's since. the comment was brushed under the rug, i dont know whether he would even remember saying that. but its definitely stuck with me. he wasnt the only one who made comments, and i want to emphasise he wasnt the reason for anything that landed me in hospital (he used to tell everyone i was a psycho and was doing it to make him feel bad, i really wasnt). 

whilst all of this was happening i was in therapy, group therapy and i dont know what the job title was but this woman who used to pick me up and take me for coffee outside the therapy house. they discussed medication numerous times but always said decided against it because they didnt believe i could hack it getting worse before it got better. when i was in year 10 they diagnosed me with something called emotional dysregulation disorder. it always felt like they were just calling it that because didnt think anything was wrong with me i kept ending up in hospital and they couldnt get rid of me. i know this was wrong of me but i never felt like i was taken seriously during my sessions so i used to skip them and just wander round the town. after me cancelling two appointments in a row my therapist just never texted me again. 

somewhere before this when i was about 13/14 i dated a boy who was 17 nearly 18. needless to say that didnt end well, and he was very pressureful of certain things.

the rest of my high schools days were spent in and out of hospital, half days at school, and constantly changing friendship groups until i went to sixth form. i choose one further away to try and get away from everyone who knew about what had happened, but unbeknown to me quite a few of them choose the same college. i still meet people to this day ive never met who say something along the lines of 'yeah i didnt know if it was true..'. anyway, i survived college, i made some new friends and got my first ever proper boyfriend. i started smoking alot of weed and occasionally using drugs. my boyfriend at the time was wonderful. he was caring, kind, and really looked after me. it was a happy relationship but after nearly two years i felt we'd both progressed as people and grown out of each other. i was also going to university soon so this time felt right. i know he was upset and i still feel guilty now because he is such a caring boy it just wasnt right anymore. 

I went to university this September and i really found my people. this was the first time meeting people i knew definitely didn't know about anything in the past. ive been the happiest ive ever been but i still feel this ? sadness. im always the loudest in the room, bubbly and i know im quite ditsy so i seem like such a happy person, and i guess i kinda am because i love being around people when they're laughing but i cant stand being alone.  being alone scares me, i guess thats why im writing this now, in lockdown, obviously, no matter how brilliant the people are around you, uni halls is a breeding ground for mental illnesss, substance abuse and simply just loosing a lack of respect for yourself and your body. i definitely felt this happen. i partied nearly every single week, using drugs multiple times a week (although smoked a lot less weed) and drinking every single day. my friends started to become concerned for me, although i insisted i was fine and just having fun because i was young, i really wasnt. being quite a social butterfly i would drink with different people each day so my flatmates didnt know the extent of my drinking. this was wrong of me and where i should of seen i had a problem. 

i had another overdose attempt in febraury but only one of my flatmates know about it. not even my mum or dad knows. im not going to do it again

my birthday was in march, one of my flatmates was throwing me an event for it, i was on the poster, and so many people i knew were all going to come, i was so excited but sadly due to corona it was cancelled. i was disappointed but these things happen. the day after my birthday, the day the event should of been, my grandma sadly died. the next day i found out a girl i had been close too in my early teenage years had committed suicide. the next day i moved out of uni halls and back home where everyone from my teenage years lives. once i came back, i feel as if ive turned into a robot. i feel so so so so sad but so emotional unattached to everything, i just feel empty and dull, i cant find the motivation to get up, i cant cry. ive fallen back into smoking weed every day just because it helps. ive fallen behind on everything to do with uni i just cant be bothered to do anything but lay there

im going to stop writing this now and sleep. i hope this entire thing doesnt come across self pitiful, im grateful for all the privledges ive had in my life. i hope everyone is safe and well at this horrible time."
234,Stopped my injection,"About a month ago I stopped taking my invega injection because our insurance laps and it’s over a thousand dollars for a shot.

I was happy about this because it met one last drug in my system. I still take a antipsychotic so I thought I would be fine. The shot also makes me sick for about 3 days after I take it. To the point that I can’t get out of bed. And I have lost the ability to drive because it messes up my depth perception.

Today was the hardest day I have had off of the injection. I couldn’t stop getting angry for no reason. I had two freak outs and called my husband at work where we got in a fight on the phone. 

My husband wants me to stay off the shot... I think I’m going to end up calling the doctor first thing in the morning and beg to get a sample for this month. I just don’t know what else to do. I am searching for guidance or maybe just other people who have been through this that know how it feels."
235,Totally exhausted,"I am totally exhausted. I can't seem to recover. I was off work on Monday for Easter and called in sick yesterday cause was unwell. I was hoping that by two days total rest I would regain some form of energy. Nope.

I sleep between 9 and 10 hours a night. At bed at 8 pm. I take pills for sleep, Zopiclone And Quetiapine. Whatever you say against them, they saved my life. I eat well. Work has been intense, 7 days a week, in the past month, with workload increased because of pandemic. I'm working mostly from home. I'm quite isolated. I live alone and didn't see any human being since Friday except for the grocery delivery guy.

I've had depression and anxiety issues for several years. In the past year, it was going much better, finally some stability in my life after some job and apartment problems. I found someone also, but we are now in a long distance relationship. Not able to see each other now because of the situation. But it greatly help to bring some balance in my life. But been working a lot. Maybe it's catching back on me.

In the last days, I've had this huge brain fog. Trouble to move, like this very heavy weight against me. I feel like my face is being stretched by ghost hands. Not sure how to describe it exactly.

I'm not sure what to do. My hours are flexible as long as the job is done. I tried to alternate between naps and work..I'm just so so so tired.

Just I be off work for some time? That would be bad for my finances, I can just make ends meet with my actual revenue. That's a stress also."

237,Anxiety or PTSD??,"Does anyone know how to tell if you just have extreme anxiety or if it is actually crossing over into something more? 

I have long thought that my anxiety might actually boarder on PTSD, therapist are an extreme trigger for me because I had several bad experiences in the past so I'm scared to see anyone and talk to them about it."

239,Some Advice,"Need some advice on a situation for a close friend of mine.

Him and his ex-girlfriend broke up. The day before the breakup they were arguing and she was crying and begging for him not to leave her, because apparently he was getting close to leaving because her behaviour is controlling and abusive (would scream at him, kick his car, hit him at times, etc). The next day, she broke up with him. He tried to reconcile but it never happened. Now it's important to note, everytime they argue, he always apologises and takes the blame. He treats her well; he is always at her place, picks her up from nightouts, and spoils her (£1050 Tag watches, £200 Gucci belts, £100 MK heels, etc).

Anyway he has really had enough and hasn't contacted her in roughly 10 weeks, to which I am positive she is surprised at. They were together for three years.

BUT this is where the concern comes into it. Her social media is very much about a perceived lifestyle of expensive gifts and nice restaurants. Obviously all provided by him and he is no longer there to provide it. About 3 weeks after the breakup it started. First she did makeup like the joker, then as an evil nun, then as a clown holding knifes and now as a witch. This is totally unlike her and odd to say the least.

Although he is concerned (I told him about this), I must admit I am too. He always suspected her to have BPD or bipolar due to her mood swings and unreasonable, not proportionate or necessary reaction to life's little obstacles. I am fascinated by how someone can change so easily.

Any ideas?

I am a former criminology student and find this stuff interesting."
240,How do I stop being so pessimistic?,"I’m probably the most pessimistic person you’ll ever meet, (at least most of the time) and it’s ruining my life. I can’t ever enjoy anything because I only ever see the bad in everything. I try to tell myself that not *everything* ends unfortunately for me, but then as soon as one bad thing happens, all I can think about is how much I hate my life, and absolutely everything about myself, and that everything is terrible.
I genuinely don’t know how to see the positive in life when it **really** feels like there just isn’t any."
241,overthinking and anxiety will be what kills me,"i just dont know how people brush shit off their shoulder so it doesnt affect them

its like i feel like a pussy because i know this is something you have to learn to deal with through life

and i know crying over it does nothing but it just fucking hurts man idk"
242,redmi 7 phone,"father is in hospital my phone has decided to die. How T F to I get it to restart, it will not take my previous passwords. starting to panic since about an hour back, it is a redmi 7. I cannot see get into the phone at all, talk about timing, my dad is seriously ill"
243,"For the first time in my life, I feel like I’m not okay.","I feel like I’m mentally overwhelmed and just not mentally alright right now, and I have no idea how to deal with it.

Theres a couple factors in my life right now that could rip sideways and make everything I feel like I am come crashing down. 

I don’t feel useful or worth much currently at all, and I’ve never dealt with that. I have no clue how to deal with that. 

I don’t want to exercise, play video games, have a beer with my family, or do any of my hobbies. Nothing. 

The only thing I could imagine making me breathe a sigh of relief right now would be waking up far away from everything in another part of the world for a little while. 

None of these things that could blow up my life have happened, I’m just terrified that they’re all going to happen at once. 

I’ve always been a positive guy. The fuck it guy. The glass half full guy. I can see the good in everyone else, every time, even now, but not myself. I feel useless and defeated before something even begins, and I have no idea how to deal with it."
244,really bad feeling every night for about an hour and a half,i am so confused and i’m wondering if anyone has a slight idea of what this could be. all day i feel pretty much fine and no extreme emotions and then around 7 pm i just have such a terrible feeling. i cant describe it. it’s just very uncomfortable and i can’t get through it without sleeping. and then i wake up around 11 and it’s gone. is there any way i can prevent this?
245,Extremely bad derealization. [PLEASE HELP],"Hello everyone. I'm a teen, and I've been having extremely bad derealization. I am not suicidal, but have had really bad anxiety. I feel absolutely terrible. Nothing looks real anymore. I've been doubting if the world is really real. I feel like I am in a simulation. I suppose if I had proof that everything is real I would feel much better. I am at my absolute low. I feel slightly better at the beginning and end of the day. I'm so scared that this will get worse. Please somebody help me.

Thank You"

247,Uncontrollable Anger followed by Regret,"Hi I'm (28, M). Recently, I came to a realisation that I have started to get angry a lot. Smallest of things upset me. If things do not happen the way I want it to be, then I get angry and I tend to get into an argument with my loved ones. Also, I get more prone to throw my anger at those who are really close to me. For example, if I'd ask someone to make a cup of coffee for me and they did not pour it in the cup I wanted them to put in then I'd get so furious and out of control. I'd fight with that person verbally and not drink the coffee and because of this the whole day of mine would get ruined. I'd not be able to have a conversation with anyone for a whole day, if I do talk to anyone I'd end up having useless quarrels with them too. I know my behaviour isn't right and I shouldn't be like this but I'm unable to control this. After all the arguments, I also feel major heaviness in my head with a bad headache and then after few hours or days (depends on the severity of the situation) a feeling of slight regret comes that because of me some people had to go through so much. I've had this problem since 2 years after my bad breakup (do not want to go into the details but the breakup was the worst thing in my life). I don't know if it's realated to my past or that I'm going mad. Even while I'm typing this I've a really bad headache.
If anyone of you has ever faced such issue or know someone who has or had this problem then please help me! I don't know if this is the right platform to talk about this or not so forgive me if this isn't supposed to be posted here."
248,What's wrong with me?,"I feel like I'm not living up to my potential. I feel it is also too late for me to succeed or be someone I love. I feel like I've wasted so much time in my life worrying, stressing, being depressed and anxious, worrying about what that person might think of me, assuming everything will go wrong, assuming the worst, assuming I'm simply not capable enough to do something, that I've never learned who I am or what I truly want for myself. 

I don't know much about myself or even anything in general. I'm extremely ignorant. I have no knowledge of the world that I probably should. I'm not sure if it's because I doubt my ability to learn, so I don't. Or if I'm just stupid.

Deep down I know I'm capable of achieving great things for myself, but I have these negative thoughts and feelings and doubts that are always lingering. Thoughts and feelings that I'm not good enough, smart enough, attractive enough to achieve anything. I think and feel this way about myself which leads to not taking action because I believe I won't succeed anyway. Which then sort of becomes a negative self-fulfilling prophecy. I think I can recognize that it's all mainly ""in my head"" or something, but It still feels so real.

I need to get out of this negative cycle so I can fucking do something with my life. I'm 19 and I have literally done nothing with my life. Not exaggerating at all. I have never been employed and I'm a high school dropout. 

It's like I just exist and I'm not actually living."
249,i'm sad and just need to vent (tw?),"my mental health has sucked for years.  i started restricting calories at 14/15, self-h\*rming at 16, and have generally struggled with what I think is depression and possibly anxiety for years.  i'm 19 now and still struggle a lot, though more off and on.  i'm also not trying to self-diagnose, maybe im just a wimp idk.  

i come from a very religious home, so all through my growing up there was never much talk about mental health and such, so my family knows almost nothing.  i don't think they meant to make it such a taboo topic, its just one of those things where a lot of christian's, not all but a lot, respond to mental health issues by giving the impression that your faith is lacking and that's why you are struggling.  (i'm still a Christian and truly my faith has helped me out of some very dark places, I just don't think that your faith is the only answer.)

 so here's my issue.  my mother mentioned multiple times through my teenage years that she struggled with depression in college.  she has also struggled with her weight/body image and I believe that she most likely had some disordered eating thoughts/habits.  my older sister struggled with bulimia in college and into her adult life as well, so there definitely seems to a pattern.  knowing all of these things, i feel like as a parent i would have discussed mental health a lot more to my younger kids and made sure they knew they weren't alone, could get help, etc.

fast forward to my teenage years, and me and my mom definitely did NOT get along.  i was homeschooled my kindergarten through twelfth which was honestly just not healthy for our relationship and created a lot of tension and distention between us.  most of my childhood memories were wishes to be her favorite child, for her to love me, etc.  i was definitely my dad's favorite child and we made jokes that were really true throughout much of my growing up and into the current day.  i truly believed she didn't love me and would never love me, and it made it so i never talked to her or was around her if i didn't have to be.  

this was definitely a contributing factor to my struggling mental health as i entered my later teen years, but i also just had incredibly low self-esteem and hated myself as a person.  when my mother noticed that i was maybe not eating a lot of food, she sat me down with my dad (whom i love so so so much but was mega clueless lmao) and began to talk about me not eating and if i was having disordered eating thoughts, etc.  and then she told me ""your sister struggled with bulimia, and i just can't handle that again.""  

i don't think ill ever be able to forgive her for that statement.  to look at your child and basically tell them that even if they're struggling, as a parent you just can't handle it and need to suck it up? am i wrong to still be upset about it?  the more i think about it the more i just can't even believe that you would look at someone who clearly hates themselves so much that they are literally starving themselves and basically tell them they can't struggle because someone else in your family already struggled with something similar a long time ago.

after that, i feel like i just really fell apart. i felt so unloved i started self-h\*rming and eventually tried to commit several times later that year.   they have no idea that i still struggle with self-h\*rm to this day, and the one time my mom saw the scars on my leg she just looked at them, rubbed a finger over the corner of one, and then when i pulled my shorts down she never asked me about them.

i didn't realize until i talked to my best friend a few months ago that most parents would have asked about them or discussed mental health issues if they had seen physical evidence.  my best friend knows more about my mental health than anybody in my family.  

i don't really know why i typed this all out.  i guess to just know if i'm unreasonable for still being angry?  is it wrong to think i have depression?  does the pain and loneliness ever go away?  will my mental health struggles always be such a constant battle?"
250,Look back at the Manic,"I was going through pictures on my phone and saw a bunch where my hair and make up were crazy, I was drawing weird stuff and other things I did while I was manic. Experiencing mixed feelings on whether I should delete them or not. On one hand, they don’t make me feel good, but on the other I guess I could say I’ve come pretty far. Thoughts on whether I should just take the time to go on a pic deleting spree or should I just leave them? Ugh. Thanks."

252,Suffering from Low Moods,"**Description:**

I wake up feeling weird and generally in a low mood. I have these dreams, I can't quite recall all of them but upon waking they feel taxing to me. Sometimes their vividness scares me, for example, although I can't remember now, the music I heard in one of them felt very hallucinogenic if that makes sense.

The persistence in my low mood generally spans through the day. I try to work and concentrate, but find it incredibly hard. There's this ringing in my head that doctors have put down to tinnitus, for reference I'm age 22 Male and physically healthy. Although I hope it's tinnitus, the ringing first accompanied my decline in mental health. It brought with it brain fog, a perception that overall my cognition such as memory and intelligence has diminished. I can easily sleep 10hrs in a day. This ringing ultimately feels like it connects my symptoms. The ringing comes from my head. If I put my hand over my right ear, it doesn't seem to be prevalent. If I do it over my left ear it becomes apparent, but it sounds like the source is coming from the back of my head.

I used to have a very vivid imagination when going to bed, able to conjure up all sorts of stories. That seems to have gone now. When I close my eyes and sleep, it feels like nothing. Although it's not nothing. It's more lack of control and power in imaginative thought to what I used to have when going to sleep. Thoughts sometimes come to me, none of them disturbing, but then 30 seconds later it passes and I can't recall what I thought. Kinda like memory amnesia but only as I'm closing my eyes trying to sleep. This worries me quite a bit. It doesn't happen with every thought, but sometimes it does occur.

Fortunately, panic attacks have stopped occurring. When they did I got this sense of impending doom and kind of isolation from the environment. At some points, I thought I was going to pass out or start losing control of my mind - ie perhaps hallucinate, lose the sense of what and who I am.

I've never had what I considered 'mental problems'. In fact, if you asked me last year I'd be confused as to someone's struggle. But there's definitely been a transition from normal to this, and that scares me. This ringing in my head leads me to worry about my health as well.

1. I know what I said is very broad and vague, but how can you diagnose something you can't see? This is my first question?
2. Can anyone relate or perhaps suggest what my problem could be? If it was depression, I think there would be some satisfaction in that because I can look into treatment. But I don't know if ringing in heads and sleep issues can be related to this or not.
3. **There is no physical pain. All my symptoms are mental.**"
253,"I used to be a short haired fat loser with baby face. In the past year I’ve losses some weight, grown out my hair, and let my facial hair do it’s thing. Now I’m a long haired fat loser with a beard, and people make fun of my appearance a lot more than they used to.","I’m a loser in my own sense, that’s not what this is about. I grew out all my hair and I still get shit from people, even more than I used to. I look this way because for the first time in my life I can look in the mirror and feel like I’m not completely ugly. I still feel like nobody could possibly love me, and even if they did I’m too uncomfortable with myself and my body to do anything. But that’s also besides the point, the fact that when I feel the least bit of comfort with myself makes me feel like I’m crazy. Like I can’t even look good without criticism. Some of it’s funny and I take lightly, being called captain red beard (blond hair red beard) and Benjamin Franklin. I find those funny, but being told I look disgusting, and look like trash, I look like a loser (guess i fit the part quite well) and that I look like a dirty hippie, it hurts man. I’m sick of this, but people don’t care, nobody cares if they hurt me, and to be honest why should they, I probably do look ridiculous and dirty. Why is life so hard man?"
254,What’s helping you get through these scary times? I need to vent a bit too,"The uncertainty of everything is making my mental health just drop. I lost my job, then today my dad lost his job, Im incredibly depressed and extremely anxious since I’m immune compromised and can’t leave my apartment. I feel like I’m getting cabin fever and I can’t see my therapist or my friends. 

I would do anything for a hug right now, but I’m alone in my apartment, not sure when this nightmare will end.

What’s helping you guys? Animal Crossing is helping and my sister said there’s Ghibli movies on UK Netflix so im going to use my VPN to watch some movies later. I also got ice cream in my grocery delivery.

What’s comforting you?"
255,[Wanted to share a little bit about my journey with mental illness],"I have a history with mental illness. Now, I use that word “illness” not as a call for pity or to induce shame but to remind myself that I, in fact, have a disease and need to treat it as such. If I need to call out sick from work because I can’t get out of bed, THAT IS OKAY! We need to be gentle with ourselves. We need to remember that sometimes we can’t completely control the chemicals in our brains yet, we can take steps towards finding tools to help us cope in a healthier way. The “illness” aspect does NOT mean that recovery isn’t possible. When I say “recovery”, I don’t mean cured. This isn’t always possible for most mental health issues and guess what? That’s okay. We can still live fulfilling lives.  

I am not a therapist, expert or anything of the sort. I’m just a human who has struggled. I want to share this to bring us closer together. I can’t save anyone’s life. I’m not a knight in shining armor but I’m hoping these dialogues will inspire people to be proactive about their healing and hopefully want to stay on this earth a little(much) longer. \*\*\*My only qualification for creating this space is my experience, strength and hope. 

Tiny bit about me: I was born and raised in Burbank, California- in Los Angeles County. I’m really close to my family. I am beyond blessed. I did have a family member who struggled with extreme mental health issues and it affected my childhood heavily. This was the first appearance of mental illness in my life, as I grew older, I found, I too, have mental health issues. Confronting this fact was not easy AT ALL. So, don’t feel weak or ashamed if you’re having trouble reaching out. The first step, as you’ve heard many times before, is admitting it to yourself. You’re not defective due to this fact. 

Fast forward- I started having panic attacks in high school and then, quite suddenly, in my senior year of high school, my best friend died. This was a traumatic turning point in my life. Scientifically, some of us have a pre-disposition for mental health issues and trauma can trigger the manifestation of these issues. When Sam died, Bipolar disorder and alcoholism/addiction showed up. I was out of my body-completely out of touch with reality. Night terrors, extreme depression, suicidal ideation, disassociation,  angry/sad mood swings, couldn’t get out of bed. Started drinking heavily and using drugs. My life was, needless to say, a fucking shit show. 

This experience started a 7 year sprint of depression without any breaks. I attempted suicide while I was brown out drunk. I parked my car in the middle lane on the freeway and prayed to God a car would hit me going 80mph. My using became more constant and by the 7th year, I was pretty much always fucked up. Couldn’t shower, interact with people, eat, or do anything else without being utterly loaded. 

I learned so much about life and myself through my young adulthood. All of that pain has made me into this strong, empowered woman I am today. 

One great thing came out of that phase in my life. Well, two actually. I got my degree in social justice theater. For my thesis project, I interviewed 30 people with mental health issues and created, co-wrote and directed a play about their struggles. It was filmed. I’ll put the link at the bottom. It was so powerful and created a community of support. 

The second incredible thing that came out of all of this was, I got sober and now I can confidently say, I am the happiest, healthiest I have ever been in my entire life. I am finally identifying and healing all the shit I was running from. Trauma, ego, flaws, pain I caused myself and other people. Like, holy shit people, I am a different human. 

Bottom line, no matter what you have been through, there is hope for healing. I’m not saying it’s easy; nor am I trying to invalidate your pain. I’m just saying, you are absolutely not alone and this movement is about recognizing that and healing."

257,Anyone have distinct cycles of moods/thoughts? Like seasonal or monthly or in my case daily? LMK and read about my daily rhythm.,"I have seasonal cycles but explaining would take more time and effort. I also have a relationship cycle that last almost always 2 years but don't wanna talk that just yet. So I present to you my daily bi-polar cycle from  logical anxiety to delusional bliss.  

 I have been told by counselors that the more accurate, healthy, and happy thoughts are upon awakeing because of being refreshed and no stressors from the day yet. I downright disagree in my case or atleast the happy and healthy part. I have a very consistent daily fluctuation of my thoughts and moods.

I always waking up in instant rigid thoughts of my life's worst current situation and how can I fix it. Then the surging restless energy that feels like I am going to spontaneously combust if I'm not in a constant state of extreme movement making most morning task seem unfathomably slow and painfully. I started bicycling in the morning to offset the energy. By mid-morning to noon the search for the magic solution to my life's current crux is turning into bone crushing anxiety of the future if I don't fix the problem or the doubts of myself overwhelm any decent solution down to nothing but hoping the problem fixes itself.


Noon things start to level off and I can start mundane tasks of cleaning, shopping, personal hygiene and errands. I don't like to hang out with friends till after 330 especially if there newer peeps. Girls that spend the night are forewarned and can leave early, try to help, or the usually sleep late. I am a night owl and socialize best at night. It's amazing how the closer to night these feelings morph to a polarizing state of looser less abrasive thought cycles with a fluid flow of calmer energy of getting lost in details of situations and not rushing through just to be done with the burden. The only drawback is my thoughts seem to lose structural integrity and become more leaps of intuition. 

This polarized metamorphosis is complete by my favorite part of everyday which is laying down before sleep and letting my mind melt into subliminal states of thought all making sense till I focus on what I was just thinking and it turns into a spaghetti mess of logic and in trying to put the pieces together I slip back into the subliminal flow an wander off further down the rabbit hole. With wild emotions flowing through my senses I could never explain or even felt before in my day mindset. Then sleep and if I'm lucky wake up atleast 3 times to do the process over. Infact I crave this sensation so much that half my addiction to meth was not just the high/rush it was coming off a binge leaving my mind and body exhausted but still unable to fully sleep then laying down in a dark room to induce the subliminal flow state for 8-12 hours according to the clock anyways. Lol seems to be seconds to epochs to my mind. 

TL;DR - I wake up in anxiety &amp; rigid logically forced thinking and the closer to sleep I get the more calm &amp; thoughts flexible and more ""delusional"". I prefer the latter by alot. Do you have a set cycle?"
258,Apparently I’m not allowed to attempt to help my friend who is depressed because it makes him ‘feel bad’.,"I’ve never heard of that in my entire life. I try offering him some genuine advice because I care, and he gave me a vague explanation saying I ‘can’t do that’ and I’m not allowed to attempt to help him raise his spirits because it makes him feel worse.

Uhh, what?"
259,I can’t stop hurting,"I can’t take myself anymore.

can’t say much about myself but I’m basically a freshman college student who is staying with parents because of the corona. My parents keep a horde of animals in their house, and by a horde I mean 50+ animals, from companion animals to reptilian exotics. My job is to clean up some of the animals and cohabit every minute of my day with them, which is mentally and physically exhausting sometimes because of the amount of schoolwork, general stress, and other stuff.  

My mother is the hoarder of these pets, and from many circumstances that I can’t discuss, can’t leave her house. She is also stressed with taking care of my brother (toddler) and the 50+ animals, and she has mental issues. My stepfather definitely has anger management and personality issues, and also takes care of these animals because he had done a terrible thing to my mother (cheating, domestic violence, huge sum of debt worth $200,000 due to gambling, and death threats) and therefore has to comply with complete obedience. Our family has been in civil disputes and in court because of this incident that my stepfather caused.

The state of our house is honestly a mess. You leave one hour without cleaning the animals and they shit themselves everywhere and everything, tearing every furniture, walls, themselves, and some animals die because they get into fights with each other.  One room purely reeks of ammonia because of the amount of animals packed in that room. 

The sound of dogs barking and howling is a regular occurrence and my mother demands me to silence them. Most of them are not housebroken either.

I am also allergic to these animals.

I could describe the state of the environment all day long.

I’m so stressed with their fighting, and my mother taking her anger out on me verbally then shouting at me that I should leave the house immediately because I don’t do anything to help around the house (I am a full time student taking 6 classes who does some but not all chores in the house, like cleaning the dogs, cooking sometimes, and taking the dishes out). If I don’t do any of he chores, she yell at me; if I ask if I should do chores, like washing a dog, she says she is too sick to help me even dry a dog. I try when I can to help, but she just doesn’t realize that.

I also have a girlfriend who I really love and want to be committed to her, however, my mother thinks I am lazing when I am talking on the phone with her. And it is so hard to manage because I didn’t tell my gf any of this happening because I don’t want her worrying. Even then I lash out at her at times on the phone and become hysterical, to which my poor gf, without getting angry, responds by telling me that I can talk to her anytime. But it’s not that easy because of the abnormality of the situation compared to her world. We just live in two different environments it’s impossible for me to even tell. 

With the midst of corona, I can’t even go outside to work. I have little money that I received from my biological father, but I don’t have a car. And the quarantine seem to continue forever. I have no relatives living in the States, and I have nowhere to go in e moment. My mother demands absolute obedience or out of her house, and I understand. 

But it is all too much.

I have resorted to turning my anger on some of the animals as well, and I hate myself for it because it’s such an immoral act on a animal that doesnt know betterx

I can’t go on like this until August or whenever the quarantine ends.

I don’t want to kill myself, but I nearly overdosed. 

I feel selfish for having thoughts like this when my parents took me in and fed me during this crisis.

I really need help, but I don’t want to cause harm to anyone either.

I might delete this post as well.

Edit: Animal Control, CPS, everything has come to our house, and passed everything. It’s no use trying to change the house because my parents make it look good during their visits."

261,Help with suicide,My girlfriend is extremely suicidal and I do not know what to do she thinks no one cares and her she is hopeless she keeps telling me she wants to die I need help urgently now please help
262,U don't know if my what I'm telling myself is real anymore,"(im indulging myself in a nice long story of my (relatively short) life so far, to skip it's the next paragraph for the bulk of my story)
I've been struggling with undiagnosed (by my most likely terrible choice) mental health issues for roughly 2-3 years now and this last year I've had frequent thoughts and fantasies about suicide. I feel guilty because in my eyes they seem so unjustified, I manage to be in a neutral mood most of the time, I can usually enjoy myself in the company of others and the life I have is one I'm extremely thankful for. The only problems I have that I know for a fact change my mental state are physical problems including, like chronic fatigue, chronic pain and frequent injury due to scoliosis and hypermobility and weakened joints,tendons and ligaments. Due to these I often reserve myself from doing activities I've loved since I was still chewing pencils in school learning about multiplication, such as  Competing in track and field events and now even simpler things like going for a jog daily. Starting with feelings of boredom and disinterest in my hobbies and social interaction it slowly spread and mutated, boredom becoming apathy and disinterest in socialising becoming complete emotional isolation from all my 'friends and most of my loved ones'. It stayed like this for months until  eventually I started to  wonder if life was worth living. 

At this point I'm time it was about 2 years ago just at the start of Fall, I started to hurt myself but I never felt like I needed to. I kept doing this until eventual I thought about how it would impact my family, and just like that I stopped. Being around other people in my life who had openly talked about similar experiences to what I was having I felt a small dagger of guilt press itself into my stomach as I thought about how often they deeply struggled with soul crushing relapses. For the other people around me, it seemed to haunt them like an inescapable burden, yet I almost wasn't affected by my decision to stop. I felt/feel like a fraud, telling myself I did it to feel better but yet being able to get clean with almost no difficulty. It wasn't right and I feel like an attention seeking poser when I think back on it. I hid it and I only opened up to people who reciprocated the circumstances and yet I feel like my ""faking"" the need for it was nothing more than an insult to everybody else who truly struggles with staying clean and safe.

Ever since then I began to think about suicide as well. The greatest mistake of my life was the first time I seriously considered it. Except the only thought I had on it was how people would react. Convincing myself I was going to do it because I would be better off and not because I wanted to see how people would act. After once again talking to the people around me about it and having them tell me to take care of myself and that I'm loved. I made a pathetic half hearted attempt to kill myself. Only to very predictably survive and once again have people support me in my state of ' vulnerability '. During the time I felt as if it was all very real, I'd never blatantly fake something just for attention. But looking back I feel so ashamed that I worried people around me who have struggles much worse than I do and worried them over me when they could have been focusing on helping themselves. I leeched off of their empathy for me and stopped them from doing what they needed to do to be better. Since then there's been a dagger of guilt stabbed in me, slowly being pressed deeper into my body.

Since then I've gone through cycling waves of, feeling bored but fine most of the time and only sad/happy or anything other than disinterested about 10% of the time shifting into weeks and months of almost complete apathy in the company of others and sadness so bad it sends crippling waves of pain pulsing through my chest whenever I'm left alone with my own thoughts. But because of the way I used these issues in the past as a guise to let myself be convinced I was deserving of the attention, time and care given to me by people much more deserving than me. I can't trust myself that these feelings are real.
 I don't trust myself to not do this purely to get some sort of sick gratification from people worrying about my own safety and health. 

The last 6 months I've been in a state of constant sadness whenever I stop moving (figuratively and literally). With pain so bad sometimes it almost paralyzes me wherever I am, with the feeling of my insides being rotted away by guilt and pain from these episodes. Suicidal thoughts became more and more frequent until now I can't go half a day without vividly imagining killing myself. Despite everything I still have the same thoughts as I used to. Every time I think if dying my initial thought is of how would people around me react, what would they all do. Then of course my thoughts flit away to how it will make my sadness go away.
I can't trust myself enough to know whether all of this is real or if my mind forcing me to suffer just so I can stay relevant and significant to the other people around me and I guess myself. 

This is all I think about anymore and I can't believe in my own thoughts because I know how much they lie to me and persuade me things are different to how they actually are.

I don't know if this pain is real or just a sick excuse for me to continue and validate my reason to share my 'struggling' with people close to me to feel important and cared for.

I don't know what to believe. I can't trust what my mind is telling me I'm really feeling.

Maybe this is payback for all of the worry and effort I stole from people who needed it for themselves. Karma fulfilling the issues and pain I convinced myself I had and now I'm getting a taste of properly.

I don't know what to believe. I just feel so guilty that for so long I relied on people who were fighting so hard to keep themselves going, just to indulge whatever disgusting subconscious need I had to get from their attention and worry.

I'm not sure what I expect from this post, and I don't know what I really want from it either. But please respond. At the very least I need to know whether or not I really am leeching off of others. Based on what I've said please tell me if I'm as bad a person I think. I feel so guilty about making my problems out to be bad enough that I got others in worse positions than me to give me empathy and support I needed only to gratify myself by capitalising on such horrible things as committing suicide. I'm suffering so badly now. I haven't slept more than 3 hours in over a week because of my thoughts.

264,Meltdown,"So I'd imagine some of you here are familiar with having meltdowns and just absolutely breaking for a hot minute. What do you do? Would it be absurd to request from a psychiatrist a benzodiazepine i.e. Ativan Xanax to calm down? I'm a psych nurse, and I've worked with lots of drug seeking patients. I don’t want to be one of those. Historically, I used to cut myself when I felt that I've lost control and can't contain my emotions. I've eliminated that by smoking cigarettes on occasion. It's very rare that I do smoke, but I did tonight. And I'm just wondering if it's outlandish to request a benzo for times when you feel you can't handle yourself. I've been prescribed Buspar for anxiety, but I don’t take it regularly, as my anxiety is not regular. Cigarettes work great for me when the occasion does come. But of course, that isn't an ideal method. What are your thoughts? Thanks for reading."
265,I Want To Fall In Love,"I'm not sure how to put this all into words. I'm genuinely not trying to look for comments or empathy, I need to put my sadness somewhere. It has always been hard to formulate what I'm feeling but I will at least try.

I want to fall in love, it's the only thing I want in this life. I want comfort in someone else's presence, like full trusting and complete affection. I have so much love to give although it's not everyone else's description of love. I can't fall for someone, I can only become infatuated. Just for once in my life I'd like to not be the victim of obsession, and experience a real relationship.

I was in a relationship for a while, but all I saw her as was a filler and something weak. She was exceptionally nice and we had a good relationship, but I couldn't see her as anything more than someone who I could easily manipulate with a bendable will. I didn't take advantage of her feelings or her ever, but the thought crossed my mind just about every time I spoke to her. I know that if I was given the option to hurt her in a way that would benefit me I would've taken it.

I have only become possessive over two other people besides her, both whom I almost dated but I lost interest too early even though I still kept the infatuation. Even though they were my friends/""crushes,"" I didn't see them any different which kind of pains me. I don't know what I consider a ""crush"" anymore, and a relationship to me is just another warm body.

I don't want to live like this, I just want to be able to love someone without seeing them as something to use or betray. I can't stay with a person that long or else I become uninterested. I can't keep friends because I might wake up one day and find them so annoying that I'll drop out of their lives. I can't talk about my experiences or the way I feel because people will think I'm purposefully doing this and there is so much stigma around being the ""outsider."" I'm not even an outsider, I blend in nicely but I am so tired."
266,I don't really know where to start,"I don't exactly know what to say, I don't really have tangible issues that are contributing to my awful mental health, I just feel frustrated, upset, overstimulated and understimulated at the same time, and feeling like I can't make meaningful change in my life anymore. I am skeptical of what I can be helped with, since I don't really know what my issues are, just... I want help."
267,I have a general poll I'd like to ask..,"This is not to boast, being this way is nothing to be proud of.

But did anyone else do very well in school, have high test scores, have a higher than average IQ and then suddenly your mental health got bad and declined and your mental health increasingly got worse over time? Specifically highschool into early adulthood."

I don't feel one bit guilty. Should I?"

270,Over-focus issue ?,"Hi,

Since I was young, I have ""slight"" issue with my hearing. I don't really need to wear hearing aid yet, but i start to realize my problem may be related to my brain?

So the problem is, when I'm focus on something. (e.g: playing game, read a book, typing a document), other people talks to me and won't notice it most of the time ... It's not like they didn't talk loud enough, it just that it didn't catch my attention somehow)

It's like when I focus doing on something, my focus is so narrow to the point that other cannot distract me...in a bad way, many times when my manager talks to me at work I didn't notice it cuz I was working on my tasks and this is a bad thing :(

Also, I realize that I'm pretty bad in holding a conversation with others. I realize that people speak too fast and I have to put so much effort on the conversation in order to communicate. By reading their lip moving I can understand better the conversaion. When I watch TV, I always have to turn on subtitles ...I feel like I'm heavily depending on my eyes/visual things over my ear/hearing....I wonder could it be my strong dependence on visual ability that I gradually lose my hearing ability?  Or anything that is causing my 'over-focused"" situation?

Any idea why I have this issue?Please advise. Thanks"
271,i physically can’t show affection,"i don’t really know when this started, i can’t even remember this ever being a big issue until recently. my mom tried to hug me and i immediately broke down sobbing after she left. whenever someone tries to touch me affectionately or even playfully i just get really uncomfortable and feel sick to my stomach. even with my best friends and immediate family. i even feel weird saying i love you. i hate being vulnerable and open to people, even though i wish desperately that i could. i feel like i’ll never truly be able to be loved if i myself can’t reciprocate it. how do i fix this? where did this come from? i’ve dealt with anxiety and depression for a large part of my life, but i’ve never had any crazy trauma in my past (that i know of) that could cause this?"
272,Hey guys I'm fairly new to reddit. There's been a lot of stuff going on and I feel like need a place to vent.,"Lately there's been a lot of problems going on. My parents are not on good terms. It came out that my mother cheated on my dad. My father became an alcoholic due to the pain of knowing what my mother did. For the sake of the family, my dad decided to stay here with the family and keep the situation a secret. The only reason why I know is because I'm the only person who my father trusts. My sister is too young and would most likely hurt her to know. My mother believes that I dont know what's going on. Each day I have to look at my mother and lie to her saying that I love her. I dont see her as my mother anymore but I cant say anything because I promised my father that I would keep it a secret. Its almost like every other day I have to talk to my father and calm him down with his own rage and pain. He even told me that at one point he wanted to kill himself and I had to talk him out of it. Things seem to be better but I still see the pain in my parents eyes, mostly in my father's eyes.

I'm also currently going to college. My financial aid wasn't the say as last year and I owe the university money which us preventing me from enrolling into the next semester. My father tells me the financial problems we have and that they are living paycheck to paycheck. The possibility of losing the house is becoming more real by the day. And yet my parents try everything they can to keep me in university. Since I'm the only one out of my entire family to go to university, many family members are looking up at me. Everyone wants to see me succeed and I glad that my family is inspired to do even greater things. But it feels like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders. It feels like I'm carrying everyone. I feel like me going to university is financially hurting my family. At times I feel like I regret going to university.

There's also a lot of infighting in my father's side of the family. I havent see some of my family members in months, almost years. It all started when a couple of aunts and uncles started going to religious meeting. They became more invested in their religion and tried to get other members of the family to be part of it. However not everyone wanted to be part of it (my family included) and respectfully declined. Those who are religious aggressively tried to indoctrinate into their religion. We are not against religion and we are open-minded. But we did not like how they aggressive they were with us. This caused a schism in the family and now we cant even talk to each other without fighting. Most of young ones in the family are caught in the middle. The young ones in the family look to me because I'm the only one that both sides can listen to. I'm able to calm everyone down and promote an environment where everyone can talk freely. 

Everyone is always looking towards for me. I'm the only person who fix almost every situation. Dont get me wrong I'm happy that I can be there for my family. But this pressure keeps building and I feel like its impossible to let people know I'm strugglingly. So many people depend on me. I tell myself that ""failure is not an option"". I cant sleep. All these emotions and thoughts about the potential of losing everything is almost crippling. I tried to talk to my girlfriend about these things but she's always busy. She has a lot of school work and she's struggling too. She really tries to understand but in the end she doesn't know how it feels. I feel alone. Everyone I talk to someone, I always see the pain in their eyes. Everyday I put on a smile for other people. I tell everyone that I'm ok and I continue to be there for others. Hopefully things get better. I know things will get better. I just need to keep going. I need to keep trying."
273,Why is it ok to torture and try to destroy a few of us so other people can benefit?,"That's what therapy was, to me.  Years of psychological torture, of having everything important and worthwhile to you ripped to shreds.  Of having your reality pulled to pieces and being told that it's all just your mental illness, and you just need to learn to think acceptably like the therapist instead.

I've been through a mother who basically tried to perform minor surgery at home with a pocketknife.  I've been through being assaulted by a boyfriend I loved.  And yet I would still name experiences in therapy - experiences that as far as I can tell were completely within what a therapist is supposed to do - as the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life.  (Of course therapy tried repeatedly to convince me that I'd never been through any abuse in the first place, because none of what I'd had pinged on any of their stupid screenings.)

I am not exaggerating the level of pain by calling it torture.  And it was torture that was constantly reframed and downplayed.  Shoved into a little box called ""therapy is hard"" and ""sometimes it gets worse before it gets better.""

These were not, to any evidence, bad apples.  These were licensed and experienced professionals who had helped many others.  And they were engaging in what, as far as I can tell, was fairly standard treatment practice.

I have lost track of how many professionals I have seen.  I have not seen a single one who would even acknowledge that such a thing is *possible* to happen in therapy.  And yet I know that there are other people out there who've been through the same thing.

People like me are the sacrifices for our mental health system to work.  We're the stories that you're not allowed to tell.  The ones who get told it can't really have happened, or that we must have caused it somehow.  Or that we're inventing it for some sort of personal vendetta.

No one has ever been able to explain how therapy protects against this.  No one has been able to give me any safety precautions.  Just declarations that obviously no competent therapist would do that - when obviously competent therapists did.

Why is everyone ok with this?"

275,Exercise and PTSD,"So I recently started doing cardio consistently and I realized that it isn't impacting me mentally like many people seem to experience. While doing it, I feel kind of unhappy or agitated and I never experience that supposed rush of euphoria. Usually my PTSD symptoms gets worse after and I don't really know what to do about that. I try to combat with positive thoughts, acknowledging negative thoughts, but not lingering on them too much. Showering after tends to be the worst and I end up in a funk all day. Though my heart rate is elevated, it isn't really a feeling of anxiety, and I'm wary of using my physical state to indicate my mood.

Has anyone else experienced or heard of this issue and know what the mechanisms might be or how to deal with it? My best guess is that adrenaline has been associated with trauma for me from such a young age that I might have been classically conditioned to respond this way. Feel free to give technical terms. I've studied neuroscience and psychology, so I have some familiarity with the subject. I'm hoping to find a way to combat this that's more effective than what I do now, as I'd really like to get in shape again."
276,It seems like I'm just not trying,"I was struggling in school before the virus. I had a 60% in biology. I've never gotten below a 75% in a course before. It felt horrible. And now? I'm doing even worse.

My best is so much worse than it used to be. The virus is taking such a huge emotional toll on me, and there's little room in my mind for schoolwork. My biology course is so much harder than I ever imagined it would be; there's such a huge leap from the 11th grade to the 12th. I'm not capable of what I used to be, and I wasn't capable of much before.

I was so lost before the virus. For the first unit test, I studied for hours. I made cue cards, and I made my friends quiz me. I did practice questions. I just didn't understand. I asked my teacher for help, and tried my hardest to understand. It just didn't work. And now, I have to build on the concepts I didn't understand in the first place. I just can't keep up.

But my teachers just see a kid who's turning in shit assignments. A kid who has a nearly empty practice log for music class. A kid who isn't doing enough.

I'm still drawing and posting art. I'm drawing most of the time. The only time I don't draw is when I'm crying, because I can't see the paper through tears. It doesn't take any emotional or mental energy. My therapist encourages it because it's a really good outlet. It's a coping mechanism for me, but it just seems lazy. At the end of the day, I'm choosing art over schoolwork.

I just feel empty and useless. I'm a waste of space, of oxygen, of fucking toilet paper. I'm not enough."
277,I didn’t have birthday parties when I was a child,"I know this does seem like much, but it affects me greatly to this day. When I was a child I lived in an abusive home, my father was in and out of prison, and my mother was a heroin addict. They always forgot about my birthday, along with feeding and bathing me. So my sister had to do this all, I greatly appreciate what my sister did for me. On my birthdays my sister would steal money from people, or try to find ingredients to make or buy a treat for me and a present. It would be the littlest thing but they were so cool to me. We weren’t really allowed to leave the house ever, we’d spend weeks inside being forced to clean up the messes that my mothers boyfriends made. But my sister avoided all of these things on my birthday, she’d make a pillow fort with me, and we’d sit and talk in there for hours. It was nice to have someone also suffering with me. And to have someone to understand the pain that I went through."
278,"I’m terrified I might get hospitalized and not be able to finish my semester at college, there are only a few weeks left.","I have a history of severe mental illness, and have violent outbursts. Today I beat up my twin brother, broke and shattered the slide door window, and spit in my immune compromised dad’s face. Now I’m also worried I may have infected him with Coronavirus and he might die. I attacked my brother another time to about a month ago. My parents don’t know what to do and told me the next outburst I have they will call the cops and send me to a hospital. I CANT DO THIS, I would loose all I’ve don’t this semester at school! Part of why everything is harder for me to control my impulses right now is due to a med change my doctor advised me not to do. I take lithium and it’s made me very numb. I want and need to feel more. This change has helped in that sense but it has also made me more impulsive. I’m stuck I can’t trust myself with my actions, and I can’t go back and increase my med again because it makes me like a robot. PLEASE help me, give me suggestions of what I should do to keep my impulses at bay, I only need to hold down the fort for a few weeks until I finish my semester, then I will be okay with if I need to be hospitalized. I just want suggestions of what I could do to keep me in control until then."

Like I’ll get in depth with it. Sometimes it feels like I’m watching my life through a movie or someone else’s view. Very disconnected feeling from just my life around me. I have no sense of time, I literally can’t tell you what day it is or time without checking my phone. I sleep 15 hours or more when I do actually go to sleep. And I haven’t left my house in over a month apparently.

I find myself just kind of having conversations with myself in my head, and thinking about what would happen if I just disappeared. It’s been 8 years since my mom passed, and I barely remember her, but yet she was such a big part of my life, I think when it happened I blocked everything I felt out to the point were I forgot her entirely, and it’s tearing me apart, it doesn’t help that my dad doesn’t believe in mental health, and won’t listen to me."
282,My 16 year old daughter talks about killing and hurting herself,"I have a 16 year old daughter who has been struggling with mental health issues for the past couple years. She went to therapy in 2017 when she 13. Her therapist met with her almost every week and even prescribed her with medication. She also told me to call 911 or take my daughter to the emergency room if things got out of hand. My daughter eventually ended up quitting therapy in August of 2017. 

Since she quit, she has not shown any signs of improvement. She still talks about wanting to commit suicide or harm herself. One time, I saw somewhat old cuts on my daughter's thigh and she insisted that she slipped and fell into a fence at school. However, later on I saw fresh cuts on her thigh and she admitted to self harming. When I tried talking to her about it, she got defensive and told me that I cannot say anything about it until I try it first. If I tell her to do something she doesn't want to do, she'll sometimes say, ""I'd rather get raped."" which is a strange and offensive response. 

Since my daughter is going to be applying to colleges in the fall, she says she has plans to end her life in college. I am at my wits end. I'm having her go back to therapy this month, but during the meantime, I don't know how to handle this."
283,Is this bad?,I am 19 and my chest hearts all the time. Like I have to grip under my armpit because myheart feels like it is going to explode. It has gotten worse with this virus. Especially since now I’m on the brink of homelessness
284,how to find true love?,"  I am 18 years old, my personality is quite bad, I just don't know how to relate to the boys, I would like to fall in love but when I think about it it seems too complicated.  I have low self-esteem and there are several factors that do not let me meet people.........
I guess it's because of loneliness ¿?

 I would like to fall in love but it is impossible for me.  Does this happen to someone else?"
285,What else can I turn to?,I’ve seen several therapists. I’ve been prescribed and then switched up doses and medications all together. I eat healthy. I do yoga regularly and run on occasion. But I just have not improved mentally. I’m trying everything I can and listening to everybody but I have been struggling for years. All I want is to die. Nothing gives me real happiness. I try to go out with friends but can em ever enjoy myself because I feel nothing except wanting everything to be over. I don’t know what else to do.
286,Emotional abuse is often much worse than physical abuse and sneakily leaves no visual trace or scar.,[deleted]
287,Is there something wrong with me?,"I literally can't relax at all. I'm starting to believe I have some kind of illness or something. I'm unable to be chill in any way shape or form. When my friend doesn't respond to me immediately I get irritated, my boyfriend said he had to go away for a week and not text me back because of family stuff, I got paranoid when he said that he couldn't tell me and acted passive aggressive towards him for it, but.. why? I've dated him for 2 and a half years and have gotten closer with him than anyone else in my life, yet I... struggle to trust him still? I love him to bits and refuse to break up with him (I know what some of you are thinking) but I just think there's something wrong with me. Small stuff always gets to me and I genuinely don't know why, my friend said she was watching an anime I recommended but kept forgetting about the episodes and so I thought she wasn't actually interested in it, and that turned into an absolutely pointless and needless argument because I overreacted, this happens on video games too, do I have something wrong with me? Why can't I just quit being worthless and learn to actually fucking calm myself for once? I don't understand... Most of these things almost nobody would overreact towards..."
288,Any one else feel like they’re faking a breakdown because they ignore it?,Any one just feel like their head is a constant low level breakdown that you just tune out and continue with your day? I’m just so tired of it because I feel like it’s not bad enough to be considered bad since I’m not crying and planning my death (I physically can’t cry). Nothing feels fun anymore and even the stuff I laugh at in the moment holds no emotional value after I react. Not even pain in any form has a release anymore. Sorry if you wasted your time reading this... I just needed to get it out and pretend I’m less lonely.
289,I scheduled a meeting with a psychologist,"I am guessing it is because of the pandemic but she is booked so I can't see her until the 4th of may
I am really excited and nervous. So many thoughts are running through my mind like Does it make sense? Suppose she looks at me weird? Suppose she doesn't know what to tell me? Suppose at the end of me talking for the 50 mins she says ""okay great nice talk"" and escorts me out? .....My thoughts are a little irrational right? I noticed that it gets like that when my anxiety worsens and it clouds my judgement well. However, does it really make sense going to a psychologist? Do they give you good advice or they just sit for an hour and ask you tactful questions without giving feedback?"
290,Childhood worry,"When I was around 7-8 my stepmother would come to my mother's home to pick up me and my brother to go to their house. Sometimes my to moms would talk leaving me and my brother in the car. Then the car would start driving itself. It would loop around the neighborhood and park where it was before it started moving. Then my parents would stop talking, my stepmom would then start driving the car as if nothing happened. I would ask my brother if he remembers, but were not on speaking terms as of now.

I want to know what happened because this happened many, many times. More than 10 if I recall correctly. I can't find anything online that matches up quite right without it being very worrisome. I would love some help with this!"
291,"Sad , but true .","**This may be triggering**

&amp;#x200B;

 By the end of last year I've been really happy (I was going to sleep wanting to wake up fast so I could draw again ... I was drawing for several hours a day , everyday) for 1 month , I've never felt so energized and euphoric , after this period of more or less than 1 month I was feeling really down and when I was going to bed at that time I didn't want to wake up never again ... I feel like that type of thing (this ""boost"" in my mood) comes and goes , but after it's over , I come down to what I think it's the ""normal"" for me , being really depressed . And I feel like there's so many underlying problems , but I feel like nobody gives a damn , and I think ""but why they should give a damn when you don't give a damn about people outside of your close family ?"" As the years gone by I feel like my mental health is declining , I became bitter , envious of successful people , and besides my best efforts of doing something with the only thing I know how to do (drawing) and that still gives me some pleasure , I feel like I'll never be able to live off  of it . I'm afraid that when my mother dies I'll  die too .

And I feel like nothing can be done , since I feel like my soul already left my body ... I don't even know why I'm posting this here . I don't have any friends ...

When I was 15/16 ,  I was really active , had friends , girls , was ""popular"" in school . But all of the sudden I was feeling that my surroundings became strange , and I was thinking that I did or would do things that I would never do , like eating things you are not supposed to (rocks , coin , screws , paint , metal nails , and behaving not accordingly to my normal pattern of how I acted , so because I was so overwhelmed by all this , I decided to smoke weed for the first time (turns out it was skunk) , and that was the worst thing I've felt in my entire life , and the sensation of being trapped in dream lasted for several months ... Since then I feel like what I was before smoking died , and now feel like I'm a man without a soul and without any purpose .

Some of the things I spoken here are not in chronological order , I just took clonazepam ...

Does anyone feel like that too ? It's very strange , it all seems like a trip , and nothing makes sense (human life in general)"
292,I’m so done with everything..,[deleted]
293,What do I do about suicidal thoughts?,"I’m constantly thinking ab what would happen if I committed suicide. Why are these thoughts always in my mind and what do I do ab it? I’m concerned and scared and honestly don’t know what to do. I want to talk to family and friends, but I don’t think they’d listen in the way I’d need them to."
294,not sure if this fits here but still,quite often I get quite sad over things happening in my life but no matter much I feel I should I don't cry. I've been like this for a long period of time but no matter how sad I am I don't cry. anyone know why or is there something wrong with me
295,Why Do I feel So Complicated?,"I have a friend (a girl who is the same age as I am) who cares about me and asks me how I am doing. I appreciate her doing this even from the way I have been treating her lately. One thing about me, is that I am struggling with some mental health issues, which have been already addressed with medical professionals alongside with a medication. The only issue is that I am not sure how to completely move on from my situation. I understand that I have to be patient in recovering and taking steps forward, but I am still not sure about what to do all in all. Going back with this friend of mine, she is such a great person to be around with that I developed feelings for her 3 times in a span of 3 years. Some backstory to this, I initially saw her in my high school as a new student, who was cute and interesting. I pursued to meet her and started talking afterwards.  In a short amount of time I became completely infatuated with her and told her how I felt towards her. She then told me she wasn't interested in going out with me and only wanted to be friends with me, I felt bummed out after getting rejected and had ignored her for a while. After having come to my senses again, I agreed to be friends with her since she seemed to ""interesting"". A year later, during the summer we met up again to hangout. We enjoyed each other's company every time we hanged out, and one day we decided to meet up and take edibles together (it would be her first time taking it while it would be my second). On the day we met up to take edibles, I had initially just thought of her still as a friend, but I later then developed to have feelings for her once again. The day we took edibles together, she seemed to have taken a little bit more than she could handle, while I was still in control. I spent the entire day taking care of her, which was having her in my arms the entire time (since she was a little paranoid after having taken edibles for the first time), feeding her, caressing her, making sure she was alright. That day, I thought I was just being a friend, but knowing how that day went, I thought to myself that maybe there was something more going on. I told her again about how I felt on that day, and she seemed to understand my decision after having told her I needed some time off with her to process my feelings. Later this year, we met up a few times to catch things up and study together (since we are both in school). We explained to me how she was hospitalized for a while, in which I already knew having been told by another friend of ours, and I felt bad about it since I wasn't able to do anything for her (and also having felt slightly guilty for her being in the hospital as I might have caused her to be there in the first place). At the time she was at the hospital, she was diagnosed with a few mental illnesses which I think are severe (she has borderline personality disorder). A few weeks later our meet up together, I started having some pretty severe thoughts of suicide (which I have had before over the years) and had told her about it, A few days later I went to the hospital by myself since I was severely overwhelmed and anxious about having to think about harming myself again. At my time at the hospital, I was diagnosed with a few mental illnesses (dysthymia, GAD, and social anxiety), and from my time at the hospital, she was there with me to support me and even came to see me. I felt so blessed to have a person like her in my life. Only then I realized, she made me feel comfortable around my life. I knew that having feelings for her again would be a mistake. Yet I still pushed myself to feel in love with someone again, hoping that this person may finally love me back. After a desperate attempt to throw a surprise date to her for her birthday (which was a few days after her actual birthday), it ended up going horribly. Everything came down like a roller coaster for me and her, and yet again we discussed about each other's feelings. She made it perfectly clear that I am only her friend, and I made it perfectly clear to her I wanted to be with someone. The only issue is that she wants to stay friends, and I do too as well, but I am not sure about how to do just that while still having feelings for her. I tried to dump my emotions and everything about her that I liked, like ripping my heart out, except it's already out to begin with. She still checks up on me every now and then, but i just keep upsetting her because of how I treat her... and I don't even know what to do with myself and her anymore..."
296,"Why do I keep re-doing things until they feel ""just right?""","Ever since I was a child, I've always felt a need to re-do some things. They would be totally random actions, such as flipping the light switch ""in a right way"" or stepping ""properly."" 

If I don't do whatever I feel the urge to do, nothing bad happens, I just feel uncomfortable for a bit (similar to being itchy). I don't  particularly want to do it either, I just feel like I have to. Lately, this has been getting in my way much more than usual, and I don't think this is normal? I've never been diagnosed with anything relevant to mental health, though then again, I've never been checked out either. 

Should I have any concerns?"
297,is it pathetic or understandable?,"When I went to my old school, my classmates used to make fun of me, they always did it behind my back, when I didn't see them but I certainly realized how they treated me and what they said about me.  I used to go to the bathrooms to cry or sometimes I cried in public, sometimes I did not even go to school and I lied to my parents and teachers saying that I was sick, I almost missed the course and had to repeat subjects but I always tried to pretend that I was fine.  

I taught people that I was weak and I'm really ashamed of that"
298,How did i suppose to get friends right now?,"Well,  i'm a adolescent right now and I feel like I waste all my life cause' I never really have friends, all of that are for interest of my smartness or for make fun of me, and I see that make me lose myself, now I'm very bad ,my family seems doesn't matter about my mental health. But I have seen new people and I want to know them, but all the past damage make me unable to talk to them, can advice me for so it?"
299,Quarantine,"I can’t take this shit much longer. We keep getting told “2 more weeks” and I’ve had it. I miss my friends man. I miss my sports. I miss the gym. Before the quarantine, I would constantly be in the gym lifting or playing basketball but now, I cannot do either one. That was my life. I’ve felt a deep sadness but also a fiery anger. I miss how things were. I’ve already punched a hole in my wall. The days all feel the same now. No meaning, no purpose. The media forces mixed messages down our throats and it’s making me unsure of myself. I feel horrible about everything. What do I do?"
300,Whats wrong with me?,"Every now and then i have delusions and hallucinations. They’re not super often but the last ones i remember seeing are:
a red feather that wasn’t there
a mosquito that wasn’t there, 
stinkbugs that weren’t actually there climb out of my ceiling fan and fly at me (the ceiling fan looked like it was missing the actual fan parts and the middle part was distorted, but after the hallucination it was back to normal)
and most recently a delusion that a tune i heard in a dream was cursed and that i was going to die because i heard it. 
I’ve told my psychiatrist about most of these but she just says “okay” and moves on without another word on the topic. It doesn’t happen often enough to be a huge problem but i’m just concerned. My grandpa had schizophrenia but i don't think that’s what it is because i was never diagnosed and i don't hallucinate too much. I’m also a minor if that makes a difference"
301,Your cures for loneliness,"Hey there,
Since all this social isolation is still going strong how about a little conversation.
What do you, redditors, do to feel better when that loneliness comes creeping back?

I scream. As in I put on some heavy music and scream along. That makes me feel better.

What about you?"
302,Help. I’m freaking out whether this guy I like is legit or not. He sent me his photo on Snapchat and I don’t remember if you can fake those or not. And I’m having a panic attack trying to figure out if it’s true or not,"He showed me his face on Snapchat. Like the original sending snaps, not the chat features. Is there a way to send photos from your library to the other person as Snapchat photos? Like the kind you’d see as a red square to open? I don’t remember if the hacked version of Snapchat (Snapchat++) has that feature or not. Please help me"

304,Why Don’t I Matter,I tried reaching out for help from everyone i care about my girlfriend my friends my family. No one wants to help me and i ask so many times. I don’t want to be alive anymore but i don’t want to kill myself. I’ve been crying so much recently and crying is something i haven’t done since i was about 8 years old i’m 19M. I’ve never felt so sad ugly useless and like a waste of space. I’m so scared because i don’t know what to do. I have so many bullshit problems that don’t compare to others. I have a good family they care about me and i know they are here for me but the emotional support i need isn’t there. i feel locked in a cage and have no idea where the key is to free myself and start my life. My girlfriend and i have been having so many problems and i don’t know what to do anymore i love her to death and i have such a big heart but as we started dating longer she gets more distant and the things we used to do we don’t anymore. It’s been 5 months of us dating but we have been off and on since 7th grade. We lost contact in 9th grade and started talking again in 11th grade then we split apart bc she found someone else. Now we are together and we were both happy bc we were with each other almost everyday. A week of not seeing each other bc if the quarantine and she made me feel like i was nothing just another person she txts and calls. I tell her how i feel and she gets mad about it. We talked about our future since we were kids. Now i want to see a future but idk if we will have one. My brain is telling me i can’t lose her bc if i do i might actually kill myself. I was depressed throughout high school i had tons of friends and people who cared about me but they never CARED about me. I didn’t have anyone when everyone else had someone. I need help please someone.
305,I can't stop stalking this girl online and I don't know how to stop.,"This is kinda a weird post, but I just don't know what to do. I feel like a horrible person. I'm 18M and there is this 14 year old girl I can't stop obsessing over. I'm sure this already sounds weird. I used to go to school with her. Out of every person in that school, she had the most stand out personality to me and I ended up desperately wanting to become friends with her. I didn't have sexual feelings towards her, but I was extremely turned on by her personality and it made me completely realize my loneliness. So I tracked down her social media and tried to talk to her. I screwed up completely and now she wants absolutely nothing to do with me. I can't get myself to stop stalking her though. She is the only person I have really tried to befriend and I can't stop thinking about it. I have been so lonely my whole life and she is the only person I have seen that clicks so hard in terms of personality for me. I wish I knew how to stop thinking about her so much, but I still think about her pretty much all the time. If anybody knows how to help me, please help. I have depression and anxiety so that doesn't help with the obtrusive thoughts. I just truly need help though."
306,low key panicked about The Future but we okay now the homies had my back,"sometimes i get so freaked out about everything going on. i imagine my perfect life, but i try to rationalize it. so, if i go to college and get a degree where am i gonna work? just anywhere that’ll pay me? how will i pay for school? i want a small apartment in the city, but the city’s expensive and i’ll have no money. i want to adopt teens but what if its too expensive? what if they hate me? what if they die? what if i lose everything and i have nowhere to go?
basically, a lot of that typical “the world is ending but i just want a small house with my wife” stuff.
today, i sent my little panic to a group chat that i’m in. a few minutes after i’d sent all the above, i sent another message that said “yeah looking back at all my past messages i’ve decided that i’ll just kill myself early and i won’t have to deal with any of that shit :)”. when i sent it i thought we’d bond over that, yknow? i thought everyone thought like that. 
next thing i know, this guy (who’s mildly an asshole) starts asking me if i’m on something. after i’ve convinced him i’m sober, he says “Don’t say that shit [my name]. That your gonna kill yourself.” honestly i was a little surprised. i’ve always gotten the vibe that we weren’t that close, but we were? yknow like, you’re the first on my list for something funny, but the moment shit gets serious you’re not the one i think of. but he starts telling me about how he really cares about all of us and he worries about us and, honestly, i hadn’t realized how much i needed to hear that until he said it. 
like this asshole who has the audacity to tease me all the time also honestly believes that i’ll live a full life and that we’re all gonna be okay. 
i’ll be honest, y’all, i started sobbing. still am. 

basically, just, tell the homies you love em. please. they’re not as good as you think they are. or even as good as they think they are."

308,I just looked at my body and nearly cried.,"I hate the idea of my body changing, and now that I can’t go to the gym and am doing less physical activity my body is less nice. I just looked at myself and thought „you don’t deserve affection“. Then I worked out in the middle of the night.

I have a tendency to view myself as less a person than a resource. Like I am as valuable as my utility, and any time I get worse at something I feel like I’m less. I don’t know, this situation has been a perfect storm for destroying my mental health, this is just what happened an hour ago."
309,Being stuck at home is consuming me,"I am a single male, 24. I work out 3 times a week. Basically my whole coping mechanism was the gym but covid19 took that away from me. Now I do the best I can with home workouts. Basically a lot of my mental health problems stem from personal social failures that keep happening in my life that prevent me from maintaining/keeping friendships and intimate relationships. This hurts my self esteem and sometimes make me question myself: am I really that bad? I found the gym really helped take my mind off this. The home workouts are ok but are just not the same. Being stuck at home is amplifying those recurring thoughts of being a social failure. No adequate escape mechanism. I don't know."
310,I wish I had a reasoning for the way I act and feel.,"I haven’t gone to see a therapist (i have no money or support), so I am not diagnosed with anything. As far as I know I am a neurotypical person, but I almost wish I want so I could understand why I act the way I do.

I have been working on these traits of mine for almost as long as I can remember, and I have seen little to no improvement. I am very hot headed, and throw temper tantrums even though I am nearly 20(f). Small things easily frustrating me, and I’m thin skinned, so light teasing causes me to anger quickly. I feel like I’m sad a lot, although I’m unaware if it’s just sadness I am causing myself to feel, or something deeper if that makes any sense. Some days I have a hard time going into public, and do everything I can to avoid people, and my friends and family always think I’m over reacting, but it just makes sense to do it.

I feel like I am putting myself in a place mentally to make me feel and act this way. I’m worried to talk about it because I some times feel like I cause these issues to have people feel pity towards me."
311,Online counseling services?,"Hi there,

I was wondering if there were any free or insurance taking, legitimate online mental health or counseling services anyone knew of. 

I have a regular mental health provider right now but it's super new and I have some things I'm not comfortable addressing with him at the moment and thought finding someone online would help me remove some of that fear and help me get some of it out and processed. Honestly, a free place where I could maintain some anonymity would be wonderful, but I don't know that such a place exists. 

Thing is, a Google search gives me lots of sketch results so I figured I'd see if reddit had any recommendations. I have medicaid and am in the state of Washington, but I also could afford to pay a little bit for something like this as my issue is starting to interfere with my day to day life.

Thank you for your time!"

313,Ok like wtf...,I was crying! Like bawling my eyes out crying but I was laughing hysterically at the same time but felt kinda numb it just all happened for no reason...idk what’s going on with me today...can someone help me explain what’s going on...
314,I feel like I'm always close to have a anxiety attack especially at night I overthink to the point I can't breathe,"My dad is in a psych ward, my brother is in a psych ward getting moved to rtc, my abusive mother is at home alone with my cat. I feel like I always annoy my boyfriend (whom I live with) I feel needy and pathetic when I talk about everything. Nothing is happening to me I'm okay, I shouldn't be feeling the way I do. I'm just a insecure person who makes everything about themselves, and I'm going to inevitably loose everyone because I'm selfish and constantly looking for validation."
315,Just a question to be honest.,[deleted]
316,What is this feeling,"I don’t know if I’m depressed or if it’s something else but I’ve been feeling sort of....emotionless I guess? I’m the the type that will feel like being social one moment then the next moment I will not want to talk to anyone at all for no reason, lately I’ve been wanting to stay distant from my close friends. I don’t want them to think I’m pushing them away but I just... don’t feel as attached to them as I used to be. Even with my partner, (I’m in a LDR) before I’d always get excited to talk to him but nowadays I don’t feel as attached to him anymore (I still love him loads) but I feel like I could go days without talking to him or anyone at all. He has noticed that I seem very “sad” lately but I don’t think it is exactly sadness, could be something else. I’ve also noticed that the longer I go without talking to someone, the more detached I become. Recently me and my partner don’t talk as much because when he’s online I have school and when I’m done with it, he’s sleeping because it’s nighttime there and he also sleeps late so when he wakes up I’m asleep by then. But before we both used to make time to talk to each other but it isn’t happening these days.Why do I get detached so quickly and have this voice inside me telling me that I don’t need to put effort into sustaining my relationships and that I’ll be fine by myself."
317,Yay..,"I'm banging my head against a goddamn wall, hoping my life will get better as the quality sinks and sinks and sinks. My arms are fucking sore from crawling and clawing my way out. 

Goddammit drugs and alcohol sound so good, but I can't break my vow of sobriety."
318,Do I have a medical disorder?,"I’m going to try my best to explain this but it’s kinda hard to explain. Sometimes I feel like my mind is two separate things. Like for example I’ll just be sitting on my phone and then my mind will be like “if you don’t sing this song then bad things will happen to you” and then I have to sing it or I’ll be doing something and it’ll be like “if you don’t stop right now you’ll lose all ur friends”. Another example of my mind being weird is I’ll be praying and my mind will start picturing all these super dirty things because it knows it shouldn’t while praying and the excuse I use is “sorry God, my brain is trying to frustrate me”. I said that out loud once which is when I realized there might be a problem, because I was referring to my brain and myself as two different things. I looked up symptoms for schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder but I don’t think I match to either of those. I think at least, maybe I’m wrong. Does anyone know if I have a medical disorder?"
319,I don’t wanna be self centred anymore,"I’ve done an awful thing to some who trusted and loved me, and it’s gonna fuck with them for life they say they can’t be with me but for some reason still love me, I only thought of myself and not his feelings I’ve done this before with someone who loved me and I don’t know why I do the things I do. I don’t want to nor do I intentionally hurt people, but the fact of the matter is I do and I need to grow and reflect so I can stop this and not inflict pain on people ever again. How do I stop being so self centred and selfish, it’s not that I like to see people hurt or anything it’s just I always save myself rather than saving the other person how do I begin to change?"

321,What was this experience?,"This may be hard to put into words, but let me explain. 

About a year ago I went through a very difficult time. It seemed everything decided to go wrong at the exact perfect time. My second semester of school was just starting, but I had to get my wisdom teeth surgery done. It took me about two weeks to recover and everything went downhill from there. My english teacher, to be blunt, was god awful. I won't go into specifics, but she made it impossible for me to pass. Also, I had an argument with my dad at this time, which resulted in what I thought might be the moment in time he left me for good. 

All of this accumulated into 5 horrid months or so. I felt awful, every day and every hour. By the end of the semester, I had given up on basically all of my classes, barely getting by in many of them. I had no drive, no energy, no creativity. Nothing. I felt like a different person. My day consisted of waking up, going to school, not paying attention or doing any work most of the day, going home, and going on my phone until I fell asleep or ate dinner, if I could stay up that long.

This was also the closest I ever got to thoughts of self harm. I didnt actually self harm, but it was a much closer possibility than ever before. Normally, whenever my brain thinks of something like that, I immediately shut it down. But during this period, I would think for quite a few minutes at a time thoughts of self harm. 

I had practically abandoned any of my hobbies. I really enjoy video games, and I couldn't even bring myself to do such a simple thing.

Overall, I felt completely devoid of any drive. I just couldn't do anything. I was taking a graphic design class at the time, and every day in that class I pretty much just stared at the screen... I couldn't think of what to do, it was like my mind turned off and couldn't turn back on. It was like this in every class, even math-and I'm pretty good at math compared to other subjects.

This eventually subsided by around the end of June or July. I would really like to know why I was like this, is there a name for it, etc."
322,I force myself to look at the bad side of things,"Well, for some reason even though I may know that a particular situation doesn’t have any negative side for me whatsoever. Even if I am 100% sure that it’s positive or whatever, my brain just makes me look at the bad side of things. Like my brain wants me to be sad and depressed. I believe that I am an optimist because even though how bad a situation might be, I look at the good side and forget the bad side. But lately, even if I try to look on the good side of things, even after a bit my brain just starts overthinking the situation, imagining the bad side and the negative effects. 

For example, the most recent event of time doing this was today. I was just texting my girlfriend and she just casually said that I remind her a lot about her ex. I said cool and didn’t think much. Even though I know that she likes me more than him, but my brain is like overthinking what she said and basically forcing myself to be sad and think that I’m not good enough and she is only with me because I remind her of her ex. Idk why I do this but it’s annoying and ruins my day easily."
323,"I think it's time I see a psychiatrist, therapist, or try a psychedelic. Maybe even all three. I could use some kind words and advice.","I have a severe obsession. It's over two girls who I used to talk to. They were twin sisters. Didn't work out too well in the end. I made mistakes. I liked both of them, one more than the other. 

This split between us happened about two and a half years ago. I have been obsessing over these girls for about 4 years now. My whole brain is constantly flooded by thoughts of them to the point where I can't escape them and I'm constantly panicking. 

Every single night when I try to sleep, the most dominating thought of them is the urge to have sex with one of them. I'm constantly fantasizing. Due to these thoughts, over the past four years of this obsession, I have masturbated to either pictures of them on facebook or the simple thought of them well over a thousand times.

Accompanied with this obsession and excessive masturbation to my thoughts of these girls, I've been having popping noises occurring in my right ear. My right ear literally will pop thousands of times in a single day! Apparently, it is a case of eustachian tube dysfunction caused by anxiety. Very weird and disturbing. I often see a green and yellow lights when thoughts of suicide run through my mind. There was a time when red lights would flash, but that's gone now.

I'm looking for an epiphany. Maybe by taking a psychedelic, I'll encounter a revelation. Maybe that's when I'll truly realize that my obsession is destroying my life. I actually already know it is. It's just that I'm addicted to it and fail to take action against it. I have tried to quit masturbating to them, but the longest I can go without relapsing is a week. The cuteness overwhelms me.

The medicine that has worked best for me in the past is named Olanzapine. I ran out like a month ago. I think I need it back. I used it as a crutch for those nights that were really bad. Though numbing the thoughts of the obsession and the disturbing popping in my ear is what the medicine delivered to me, it never changed my perspective about quitting this masturbation. This is why I'm considering a psychedelic or some additional therapy. I really need a big change in my mindset."
324,Voices,I hear a male voice in my head that tells me to do really fucked up shit like literally harming someone in very gruesomeness way possible it scares me because it’s literally pictured into my brain how it wants it done but there always another voice that’ll just be repeating “ignore it” until it stops and goes away. There are only three voices that aren't mine.  What’s wrong with me? The inside of my head probably looks like an explosion occurred. Is there any way to stop hearing these voices? Or am I stuck?.
325,Why am I not better?,"My mother has asked me why I'm not better despite seeing a therapist for the past three years and medication for the past two years. She says that I shouldn't be depressed, and that she should be the one. She says that I don't love or care about her. 

My friend died from cancer when I was 9, I don't remember much about it. I just remember my feelings, how confused I was. I know it was from that moment, friendship became a thread to me. It could break so easily, and it always did. During elementary school, my emotions were incredibly dark, something a 10 or 11 year old shouldn't feel. I was so scared of losing my friends, and I did. There was some big stupid fight that still impacts me. Not what we fought about, but my feelings. 

I would write about self-hatred. I hated myself. I dabbled into self harming, biting the skin around my nails, make it bleed. I told my counselor in middle school about it, and she said not to worry about it. That it didn't matter much. My two therapists said the same thing. My high school counselor in 9th and 10th grade said the same thing. I also told her I thought about killing myself so I went to hospital and lied my way out of there. I arrived to the hospital on Friday and left on Friday. I returned to my school on Monday and my counselor checked on me for two minutes, then let me go back to class.

I learned from that my school doesn't care. My own therapist asked me one question about my little stunt. I learned that my therapist doesn't care. I learned that my mother didn't care because now she looks at me like all I want is attention, and yes, I do. I want attention so people will notice that there is something wrong with me, that it hurts to function in the real world. I want them to notice that I truly cannot finish high school not just because it is hard, but because it is painful. I want them to notice that I am slow and weak and they are all blaming me and only piling more bricks on me. 

I am responsible for my actions, yes, but what about my emotions? Why cant i control that? There is so much more to add in this post, but I just wanted to give a ""simpler"" background to my question. From this, can someone please tell me what the missing clue is? Am I just a teenager going through a phase? Am I selfish? Does my life not matter?

Why am I not better?"
326,Trying to stop binging and purging bc it’s destroying my life Pls give advice,"Feeling more helpless than ever, I can’t get out of the binge/purge cycle which is kind of exhausting, I try so hard to have self control, I’ve even been reading books on it (Currently reading Jocko) the only thing that will stop me from binging is if I’m doing coke, it’s as if my brain doesn’t know how to not go from one bad habit to the next. Part of me believes I purposely create these habits to have more reason to hate myself, but the other part of me thinks I do these things because I hate myself. Guess I won’t ever know, probably going to die from an OD or damaging my esophagus or getting stomach acid in my lungs but at this point death would be a relief"

328,"Forgot to write down appointment, too shy to call and ask, now anxiously waiting for my psychiatrist to call","I  have a new psychiatrist. With the whole corona situation, my  psychiatric appointments will all take place over phone. Now, I already  had the first appointment two weeks ago. We agreed on a new appointment  for this week, since he would go on holiday the week before, and that he  would just call me on my cell phone number.

This  week on monday, I checked my calendar to see when my appointment was.  Realized I had forgotten to write it down. Now I'm too socially anxious  to call and to ask for the date and time. Now I've spent the whole week  sitting at home instead of going outside for walks or sth because I  don't know when my appointment is. Already pissed off my best friend,  whom I'm iving with, wich only fuels my anxiety more.

It's thursday, 11am, still no call from my psychiatrist.

329,Does anyone else’s parents make them feel small and un lovable? Have you ever had so much power but felt powerless -,"
Hi everyone, I’m 17 year’s old and I’ll be turning 18 in June. Much like many in this thread me and my sister are victims of narcissistic parents/ mom in particular. My mother expresses all traits of a narc mom such as, emotional invalidation, gaslighting, boundary breaking, obsession with the external, public and at home shaming,  Considering us her sole care takers and the list goes on. 
        This has resulted in my sister being taken home early and a few DCF cases in the past due to physical and emotional abuse. I’m due to receive money from a lawsuit when I was younger (something she never lets me forget she fought for) and now I just am having a hard time getting over just sheer guilt if I’m being honest. I’ve previously tried involving DCF through high school and she would constantly try to paint me as a bad child to keep me in the house I believe solely to receive my money. 
       I am working on my emotional strength (I’m a water sign) however living home it isn’t very easy especially considering the fact that she is relying on this money planning on even quitting her job. The settlement is roughly 380K - considerable but not enough for me to now support her 41 year old retirement job. She isn’t entitled to any of it it’s for my pain and suffering however I know even if I were to give her the majority she’d still want to have complete control over where I allocate the rest of the expenses. She’s also a very experienced loan officer so sometime I do considering using her as a financial tool but again even if it were to by my business I feel she would usurp control and immediately deny me of any form of power. 
My mother is also now dealing with multiple health issues which just makes this issue with guilt so much worse. If anyone could offer any help, advice or a free service I could reach out to I’d really appreciate it."
330,A constant feeling of dread/loss,"Hey, uh I'm here cause I was feeling really odd and I'm noticing myself constantly with like a weight in my gut and I couldn't figure it out. Since quarantine started I've become hypersensitive to the fact that I base my life on distracting myself from any problems or anything and I don't know why or what I'm supposed to do. I seem to be doubting myself more and more every day and just a few nights ago I spent like an hour trying to figure out how someone would impersonate me because all I do is try to be someone better than whatever I may be. Some of my more iron-willed morals and personal goals seem to have flattened like wet paper recently, for example that I wouldn't watch anime (nothing to people who can watch it or anything, its just a stupid rule I've always kept) because I've understood that addiction is a very real thing with it and then I watched like 4 anime fully and just fucking broke down for like 2 hours in a pit of ""depression""? Then someone close to me recently got cheated on in a significant relationship to them and I tried to support them and by the time I sent the message I was feeling the weight in my gut again from a relationship I got cheated on during that seems to be coming back to haunt me and I am constantly feeling guilt and shame every time I show weakness to myself because I don't know what else I'm supposed to rely on if not myself. I've found myself watching a funny youtube highlight video and being chuckling to myself and then the video ends so i back out to see what's next and within the second I'm instantly thinking about why I'm happy and then i feel like dogshit again. Self doubt is something I've never allowed myself to be brought down by and now I am being plauged with it by everything i do. It legitimately feels as though I'm not the same person anymore or what i was even before now. It's starting to scare me a lot as well because I may screw something simple up and before i KNOW i'd just shrug it off or just get annoyed but now like i'll mess up and just a flash of a thought of harming myself and then I'll just find myself thinking like ""What the hell was that for?"" and then keep on going. And it's terrifying to me cause my dad killed himself, my friends family have killed themselves, people have talked about wanting to kill themselves to me and I've always considered myself to be the rock in the river that someone could hold onto so they don't go under because I'd ""never"" falter on that but I'm having to bare myself here and admit that I'm fucking terrified of changing for the worse. And the longer I go on the more this weight feels heavier and i feel guilty because maybe I'm just making a big deal out of it and i should man up like my dad told me to but then i fear of turning up like him and its just a mental stuggle against myself man. And it doesn't help that theres just that shit that you cant explain, like i wish it was something as simple as like a pornography addiction, or drinking alcohol underage because that seems common and not as shameful but theres just some flaws i've noticed in myself that i can barely even admit subconsciously, far less on my main account in front of random people. I feel weak, not like myself, like I need someone to hold onto that i can talk about this with personally face to face and we know each other and god knows ive tried to get into a relationship but it never works out. And then its just more self doubt and shame from more failures. I've taken psychology and I know what is and isn't normal depressive behavior yet I can't allow myself to even think of admitting that level of defeat because i know people are having it worse but I feel as though I still need something to confirm that i've not lost yet. I usually pride myself on being able to answer every question possible in as logical of a procedure possible but its so fucking painful to admit but i dont even know anything anymore it just seems like every time i try to remember something i was right about the answer has changed and i dont know what im supposed to do cause i hold myself to a high standard in terms of moral and unchanging ways but now i gotta change it feels and i dunno what to do. If any of you guys/gals/whatever can, please let me know what you think i should do. I already feel guilty for asking for help, but uh just yeah. Thank you for at least reading that, i suppose idk."
331,Something Positive About Me,"Dear Reddit,

My name is Caroline. Quarantine got me bored so I thought I should write to you guys. I want to share with you my thoughts, what I want to become one day, dreams, and again-- I’m bored. A heads up, I’m kind of bad at writing but I still hope you take the time to read this as I pour my heart and soul into it. 

To start off, hey! Kind of informal but that’s the person I am. I like to relax and have fun. My name is Caroline and I’m a high schooler from the west coast. To describe myself, I would say ambitious -- but only for things I’m passionate about. I guess that’s why I’m doing pretty bad academically. BUT if you don’t count grades and test scores, I’m doing pretty good in involving with my community and doing things I’m passionate about. I prefer to work things purely out of inspiration and bursts of energy, maybe that’s why I like to work things last minute haha (because I’m inspired to finish by the deadline). I like to smile a lot. I recently watched The Good Doctor (highly recommended) and one of the theories that was shown in there was smiling is contagious so I’m trying to test it out myself. So far, so true, even for people that’s crying. I want a lot of things in life. In my house, my father is the only person working so often time, we don’t get what we want. But that’s okay. I will get them myself. One day, I will become rich enough to buy myself a carriage house in New York with a treehouse in the backyard. I will also have two golden retrievers, a cat, and a chicken that will learn how to sit on command. I thought the chicken part was creative. One of my favorite things to do is to live. Yes, live. I saw a quote on Twitter and it goes along the line of living is different from surviving. I was greatly inspired by that haha. But what I mean by living is first off, buying disposable camera so I can capture the moments (not iPhone or Androids), *then* going on roadtrips, sing along to happy songs that I don’t know the lyrics to, pull an nighter and watch the sunrise, scream at the top of my lungs on rollercoasters, knows the joys of genuine laughter, and last but not least, easier said than done, relax and know how to have fun. I think the closest I’ve ever been to living was leaving my apartment for hours without telling my parents (don’t worry, I was safe and they never found out) to buy groceries with a friend and eat ice cream while watching the sunset on top of a hill. That day I cried after I got home-- not because I was sad-- but because it was the happiest moment of my life-- (so far because I know without a doubt my wedding will be the happiest day of my life). You know, one day I’m going to be the greatest trauma surgeon across the country or an OBGYN (still debating). A lot of people told me I won’t make it but that’s the thing. I also love proving people wrong. I know it’s a lot of confidence for someone who’s not doing so well academically but I’m determined to prove them wrong and make my grandpa proud. Okay, I’m going to go take a nap now!

This is up for debate if you disagree:

1. Money buys happiness
2. Pineapple belongs on pizza 

Songs Recommendation:

1. Someone New by Hozier (for me this song is like a confession to their love ones with each and every version of their partner)
2. Cherry Wine by Hozier (this song is about abuse in a relationship)
3. Mystery of Love by Sufjan Stevens (I don’t really listen to the lyrics for this song, just for the sounds but this song is so beautifully composed. I love it and the title really says all about how the song goes. It’s mysterious but a good kind that makes you just want to venture off and enjoy life.)

Also, what are your thoughts?

1. Witches or Mermaid
2. Roses or Sunflowers
3. Autumn or Spring
4. Calm Lakes or Stormy Seas
5. Sunset or Sunrise 
6. Cottage in the Forest or Apartment in the City
7. Horror or Romance"
332,my dad's coughing up blood because of the drinking,"i wanna take his pain away but at the same time im so mad at him. i dont want to be but i cant control it. i just dont want anything bad to happen. im scared.

edit: some background info, i (f15) recently moved in to live with my dad and his significant other. my mom works abroad. my parents separated because of my dad's addiction. 
anyways, she (dad's gf) said this happens a lot. he'll feel like shit, drink, regret it, cough up some blood and vomit and then it'll go back to normal for a while. she said she's never going to let me deal with this alone, will always provide me shelter and that she will support me no matter what. i know she gets it perfectly because both of her parents were alcoholics and they were very very abusive. 
thats why we're not calling the ambulance i guess? i dont even wanna ask. getting involved in this makes me so anxious i wanna puke."
333,We Are A UK Social Enterprise who help Authors Publish Their Mental Health Memoir For Free.,"*Hi, this is a not-for-profit post, hope it's allowed.*

I'm one of the co-founders of Supreme Movement (SUicide PREvention for MEn). As one of our ongoing campaign pledges, we are helping authors self-publish their mental health memoir for free. We take away the stress and worry for first time authors who have experience with mental health issues. This is UK-based only at the present time.

Our publishing campaign was developed because of vulnerable authors being taken advantage of, financially and psychologically. We provide extensive free help that includes formatting, cover design and account creation. We even hand over all publishing accounts to the author after the book has been published so that the author retains 100% control of their book, account, and royalties. It's a completely free service.

Our community interest company was set up in the UK to help raise awareness of mental health issues among boys and men in England and Wales.

The main campaign page is here: [https://www.suprememovement.co.uk/supreme-publishing](https://www.suprememovement.co.uk/supreme-publishing) and has an extensive FAQ section.

**A little bit about me.**

At the end of 2018, due to major depression among other ills, I was sectioned under section 2 of the Mental Health Act UK and remained in a psychiatric hospital for almost two months. During my recovery time, I rediscovered my love of writing and book production. Writing became a positive psychological tool that I used as a distraction and grounding technique to focus my emotions in the present.

It was then I realised that I needed to give something back and so I got to work with my partner to develop a mental health enterprise specifically focused on raising awareness of mental health problems in males.

My partner is a former school teacher who studied in design and is a campaigner for mental health awareness. We are dedicated to Supreme Movement and its campaigns. The publishing campaign is free and will remain free to all authors who wish to publish their mental health memoir.

We would love your help, not just in sending any authors with mental health issues our way but also to help us raise awareness of what we do. We have supporter logos available on the website along with a growing self-help resource.

One last thing - I hope the lock-down is going well for you and that you are all staying positive during this difficult time.

Thank you for reading!

Ben Oakley, founder of Supreme Movement.

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have in this thread. I'm usually online from 8am to 6pm (GMT)."
334,another quarantine rant,"maybe so many people feel the same way, and i'm really tired of this. it's been a month since i last went out because of the quarantine rule, and i feel like spiralling.

before quarantine started, i bought 4 books because i wanted to read again. i've only finished one book, started reading the other two, but until now i can't continue it. i also like to watch films, i could watch one film a day during holiday but now i'm also slowly losing interest in it. 

i'm in college and i got online classes, and an abundance of assignments. again, i don't have the energy to do it. it's not like i'm lazy, but its really hard to keep track of the assignments and it's all messy and i don't know what to do. i really want to do it, but it seems like i can't find the motivation. i'm sick of it.

my relationship with my family isn't the best either. i'm not close with my father and two brothers, so i can only talk to my mother. but still, i don't feel any connection with her, and she keeps telling me to be 'productive', which i hate. because it's not that i don't want to, something is preventing me to do so.

tl;dr, there's something that preventing me to function properly and i don't know what that is. idk if im mentally ill or not, but i'm sure i'm not neurotypical. i can't function normally right now and everything makes me sad. i even stopped opening my social media because everyone makes me sick. i feel like my whole self is shutting down and i'm scared. my head hurts. i even self harmed once. i want to cry but i can't. it's literally getting harder to breathe every single day."
335,Is there something wrong with me? Should I see a therapist? Why after 3 years I still can't move on and come to terms with losing my treasured sentimental items?,"I'm in my 20's still living with my parents. About 3 year ago, my dad took all my childhood stuff that were stored in the basement, and donated them to the thrift store without asking or telling me about it. I had some old toys, vintage mega bloks, lego sets, stuffed animals and childhood keepsakes that were stored in the basement. One day, I went downstairs to search for my stuff and found out that all the stuff from my childhood are all gone! My dad is a short tempered man, I was afraid to ask him for an explanation.I remember crying for a week before I finally got the courage to ask him why he donated my stuff without asking me? He simply said, 'welll I thought you don't wan't it anymore, so I donated it. If he doesn't want my stuff to be in his basement, he could've just tell me about it, I'm more than willing to put my stuff back into my living room. He didn't even bother to ask me about it. He just assume that I didn't want the stuff anymore without even asking me. He said he didn't do it on purpose and promised that next time he will ask before getting rid of my things. This it's just a one-off incident. So I decided to let it go and move on. I thought after discussing this issue with him he won't do the same thing again but that's the that case!

Beside from my childood keepstake and there were also some boxes of items filled with my mom's personal belongings stacked in the basement. We used the basement mainly for laundry, household items and storage, because our room doesn't have enough space to store all the things. Not long afterwards, when he decided to remodel the basement, he cleared out the entire basement and gotten rid of my mother's belongings too! He donated and gave away all her clothes, shoes, household items, mugs without her consent or knowledge. When she confronted him about it, he became defensive and lashed out. Each time this happened he acted bewildered and defensive that we were upset about the loss of our possessions and my mom would have to coerce a half-assed apology out of him. I think that he lacked the ability to get attached to possessions himself and just projected that onto everyone else. Did anyone else experience this?

Update: Me and my mom have talked about this issuee with him years ago when he got rid of our stuff from the basement, plead him not to throw our things away again without any consent or knowledge on our part. But it happened again recently. My dad continue to randomly throw things away, without any disregards to what it is and who it belongs to? It seems like he doesn’t care or respect our possessions, he doesn’t see a problem with that, and it isn’t going to change. Those toys and stuffed animals had a huge sentimental value to me and were a large part of my childhood. He just got rid of them all like they were nothing. My dad continue to giveaway whatever he wants, without even considering if it means something to me or that I may have needed it. I know there's no use for me to bring up this issue with my dad again, because it's pretty clear and obvious now he just doesn’t care or respect other people’s belongings. He had a habit of going on ""de-cluttering"" sprees and throwing our stuff away without asking. He doesn’t see a problem with that, and it isn’t going to change. 3 years since this happened, the problem is still bothering me. Sometimes this whole issue doesn't bother me, but other days it eats me up inside. I understand what's done is done. I can't get my things back. I'll have to accept that. But I'm still upset about it and every time I look at my dad it's hard to pretend to be happy with him. So how do I get over it and come to terms with the fact my stuff are gone forever, and accept that I can't get any of it back?"
336,How to deal with intense relationships?,"I have a friend who I care about, she's amazing but she texts me every single day and wants to call every second day (this isn't related to lockdown she's always been like this) she doesn't live with anyone but does have other people to talk to, she has a mental health condition (I'd rather not divulge which one) that does cause her to be extremely intense a lot of the times though so other people can only be around her in small doses. I can't handle the daily texting, usually all day. I've told her this but it never usually ends well. If I take a day away from my phone I go back to a barrage of texts of her telling me about her day that then devolve into complaining about lonliness and how noone cares etc which just makes me want to avoid the conversations more. I've comforted her before because of this and she does quickly pick up after I agree to a call but it's getting really uncomfortable because it's starting to feel like I'm obligated to talk to her within certain timeframes so I don't end up with texts trying to end the friendship or annoyance or complaining of some sort. 
On top of that when I do take time to myself she assumes it's because it's because I'm struggling with my mental health or I'm not doing well but it's just because I'm introverted and don't want 24/7 contact. I've also told her this. 

I want to be more assertive with this but I don't know how to because I know she'll receive it poorly and react intensely which I don't have the emotional energy for. I'm a bit lost at this point."
337,Hurts to like things?,"(31/F) Sorry this is a big TL;DR but ive never really put my thoughts into words before. I'll try to highlight the important parts.  


Ive heard from lots of years of studying psychology and stuff that not liking things anymore is depression...

  
but for \~13 years or so, **ive suffered from experiencing physical pain from doing the things that I like.**   


A good example that I give to people is... I used to LOVE to read, i sucked down a lot of books, anime, video games, etc.

but the past 10-13 years... i just cant. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I lived in Seattle, I got books from the library... like the little 30 page sonic the hedgehog comics and it took me a MONTH to read them. 30 pages! When before I would have a book half done before I even got home!  


**Because when I read... it PHYSICALLY is painful. I cannot WAIT to get it over with, and I can only half ass focus for about 1/2hr before I literally have to give up and do something else because the pain is so overwhelming.**  


Its the same when I play video games or watch anime.  


When I write my ""About Me"" section on websites, i still wrote that I liked these things... but last year or so, I'm like.... do I? Do I even like these things anymore? Do I even like anything anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

**The only things that I can do that DOESNT hurt is things that i HATE...** Like talking to people. I cant stand people... but day in, day out, I just am in online chatrooms, studying people... trying to figure out why I am the way I am by looking at others to see if anyone else feels the same.  


I hate cleaning, but its the one thing I can do. I used to hate memes, but I am now a memelord and I will spend every waking moment that Im not talking to people... looking up and reposting memes. I hate being a leader and telling people what to do, but I am glued to community management.  


If my friends online tell me to do things, I can do them. If they sit me down with an anime, I will binge for 17hrs... but i could NEVER bring myself to watch more than 1 episode of anything.  


**It feels like my life is on backwards. I've never met anyone in my years of community management that has EVER felt like this....**

 I just went to a psychiatrist a couple days ago and tried explaining it to him, but im not sure he fully understood it.. He tried me on 3 meds for anxiety and sleeping (Lamictal, seroquel, and Lexipro) (and ive had lamictal and seroquel before)  


But... I just want to like things again ;\_; I dont want things to hurt anymore. **i want to be able to be by myself.**  


Does anyone have any sort of any clue at ALL about what this could be? **Any thoughts are appreciated.**"
338,Feeling Down,"Hello everyone,
I’m feeling really down today. My work never fails to remind me that I am nothing but a failure. Today, my boss shared to everyone that all his team member performed so well except for that one person which is me. I’m really struggling with my work now and everybody expects that you will perform well just because everybody is doing a good job. 

I honestly feel like I’m a disposable person and everyone can jusy get rid of me anytime. After all, I’m not good enough. I have been struggling with anxiety for more than 5 years and experiencing panic attack is already a common thing. I’m scared that constant feeling of rejection and worthlessness will worsen my condition. I have been talking to a counsel the past few months and she told me to try writing what I feel, maybe it can help in releasing negative emotion.

Thank you for reading, I do not necessarily have someone to share this and I’m not the type of person that can easily open up vulnerable things about it so hope this helps. 

Again, thank you."
339,What should I do now?,"On December 28th 2019, my now ex chose to come to my home when I was recovering from a major surgery and when I had told him he was not welcome. He raped me and I called the police n spent 3 days in the hospital. I was having really bad panic attacks and anxiety and missing a lot of work cause I couldn't leave my house n I couldn't stop crying so I was put on meds for that and I couldn't sleep so I got pills for that. I was put in therapy (a 90 minute session each week) for the assault and PTSD. 

I was doing my best and then my therapy place shut down cause of the virus. They offered tela sessions but those proved ineffective for me. The clinic that would drain the fluid off my back(post op care) also shut down so now I'm very swollen and in pain all the time. 

The issue is, now that my therapy is gone, I'm falling back into how it was directly after the assault. I can't sleep much even when I take the pills, I have started having panic attacks even tho I'm taking my meds and a new thing started where when I manage to sleep, I'm crying in my sleep. I will wake up with my face wet and feeling really sad. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm missing a lot of work again because the anxiety it taking over. I don't want to miss work but I feel like I can't help it. I don't wanna lose my job. I have started crying a lot again, and I just feel like any progress I have made so far is going away and I don't know what to do to stop the regression. 

Any advice would be much appreciated."
340,No idea where else to post this,"Sometimes I just can't breath properly. It's like there's a brick on my chest, and when it's bad I start shaking a little and can't concentrate. The first time it got really bad (and lasted for about 2 days) mom took me to the doctor, and apparently there's nothing wrong with me physically. It's happening again right now, though this time it's not really that bad. I have no idea why it happens, or how I can calm myself down/stop it. I've talked to my parents about it and they say that I have nothing to be stressed about and need to learn how to deal with problems.

Can someone help me? Is there anything I can do about this?"
341,"Everytime i go through a traumatic event, 3 weeks after I tell myself I overreacted","In November, I had a fight with my ex and she threatened me 'street fight with knives' (hers) and to stab my best friend to near death. She has violence tendencies so I took it very seriously. I couldn't go out for months, had nightmares and cried myself to sleep. I'm leaving the city as soon as the lockdown is over. 
A few days before lockdown here, a guy tried to penetrate me without condoms, I took a month of PEP and have an appointment for a checkup on Monday. I put condoms on the bed so my intention of using them was cristal clear. I felt dirty, I was ashamed to say I got sexualy assaulted, and petrified to the idea he could have infected me with something. 
And everytime, everytime, I face it by crying and sucking it up. And that I overreacted. Then I tell it to people,they make a face, and I realise that yes, yes, it's heavy shit. I have no idea how I stay stable(ish). The guy I see told he's really impressed by how I deal with stuff that should make my life complicated. Guess it's a compliment? I just have to keep going."
342,I'm really critical of sounds?,"some sounds annoy me or set me off so bad that i have to make a sound to combat the one im hearing.
like, sometimes hear a sound coming from my family just walking around in the house and i HAVE to tap my pencil or i feel like im gonna explode.

ive also noticed that some sounds give me lots of comfort. Sometimes i make sure to crunch the gravel with my shoes just because it gives me a sense of comfort (i try not to if it might annoy ppl tho).

idk, i just feel critical of sounds. prolly overreacting tho aha...

also sometimes songs make me feel like im moving but that was answered in a previous post."
343,I feel down once I start chatting on a dating app,"I haven't used it in years, I used to be good at chatting to people, I'm weirdly more confident online than offline.

As soon as I interact with someone now, I get feelings of regret, wishing I didn't bother, just feel down, no mental energy.
Nothing much to say, unsure what to say, don't like to say much about myself or what I do for a living.

I guess a part of me knows that in real life I am insecure, socially confused and act similar to people who have autism. (Not sure if I have it myself, but probably).

No matter how hard I've tried in the past, throughout my childhood and 20s (now 31) I've been struggling yo fit in, socially anxious and confused. 
I feel ashamed of it and relatives have always been angry at me about it. (I know I should ""man up"" and stop being as they say ""shy"" ""pathetic"" but its not so easy).

I'm not as bad as I used to be, most anxiety symptoms have gone.
I just have nothing to say anymore.

When I start making a connection with someone, I then start to feel I shouldn't have bothered them, and then regret, because I feel like a fraud, a fantascist an idiot, hopeless and an sometimes useless in my life, since I've never achieved much and wasted a lot of my 20s and youth . 
 I then get into this inner battle whether I should delete my account.

In real life I have started to get similar feelings, regrets of talking to someone and feeling of wanting to go away as soon as I run out of things to say."
344,Why does this happen? Is it anxiety?,"Why do I always feel shaky when this happens?

I find that whenever my mind gets active, I get shaky, get heart palpitations and feel unwell. For example, I watched an interesting video, I then search more about this topic and read on different webpages to learn more. Or if I’m working on assignment and I browse over lots of information and start thinking a lot about many different ideas. I then start to do things faster because my thoughts race and I feel shaky, get heart palpitations. Is this anxiety? I don’t feel worried, it’s more that when my mind gets active it overstimulates me somehow. I could even be on facebook and writing a long comment to somebody and this happens. Does anybody experience the same?"
345,My mental health decline,"Hi everyone. I am 16M and I am from Australia.

Around 7 months ago I started dating my now ex girlfriend who lived around 10 hours away from me. The relationship wasn't perfect (as a matter of fact it was fairly toxic), she could be quite manipulative and mean at times, calling me things such as hypocrite and liar over the smallest of disagreements. But despite that I was happy and I really cared about her. She had a few mental health issues, anxiety, depression, etc (at one point she called me late at night with a knife, idk what her intentions were). I feel as if I really tried my best for her, despite not being able to spend much time with her.

 It was a few months after we started dating that I experienced a panic attack while at school for what seemed like no reason at all. A few months went by and I was speaking to a friend of hers and she told me that, she wanted to break up (this might not seem like much to some but I had really made her the centre of my world and she meant a lot to me). After reading this message I experienced another panic attack. 

After that I started to do some research into anxiety and depression from what I had read I was experiencing many signs and symptoms of both. I decided to go to my family doctor to see what he thought the best course of action would be. I tried my best to explain what I was going through to him but I don't think that he entirely understood, he offered to prescribe me antidepressants and I declined. 

We spent a few days together at Christmas and then she went back home. This is where things started to go downhill. One day she decided to pick a fight with one of my close friends over something very small and insignificant, but it escalated. I was trying my best to diffuse the situation, I told my friend to block her. For some reason this really hurt her. It hurt her so bad that she decided to start cutting herself again. She told me that it was nothing serious and a small cut. After speaking with a friend of hers later that night, I found out that it was a lot worse and she had done several deep cuts. I don't know what was going through my mind at this point but I completely lost it and started cutting myself. This incident eventually caused us to break up a few days later (she never found out about what I did). What happened after that, I fell down a rabbit hole of depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm/cutting, etc. 

I had cut her out of my life around 8 weeks back, but around 2 weeks ago I decided that I should let her back in after numerous attempts from herself and her family to contact me. I was speaking to her for about a week then I decided that in order to properly move on I would need to cut her out, I did so with a letter then I proceeded to block her on everything. 

For about 3 weeks things had really been looking up, although I have been having trouble sleeping, lying in bed for hours thinking about her. The longer I lay there thinking about things the worse my thoughts get, a few nights ago they got to that point where I started thinking about self harm again (it had been around 5 weeks since I last did it). Last night I decided to go back and start cutting myself again, but I don't really have a reason for doing it. It was just an urge that I felt, I wanted to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, that is pretty much my story and the reason why I am posting on this sub. If anybody has had a similar experience to me I'd love to hear about it."
346,I have messed-up dreams nearly every night,[deleted]
347,I almost committed a crime,"I'm 28, lost my right eye when I was a kid and never had a normal life after that. I've been outcastes and a loner my whole life. But tonight I almost committed a crime. I guess I'm finally breaking apart.

I went to a girls place to try to vandalize her vehicle.
I've spend 4 years with this chick from taking her out, buying her food and introducing each other to each other friends and family.

I know I love the hell out of her and wanted a relationship with her but she didn't want it with me so I stood around but I just couldn't stand it. Someone i was attracted to her and later on she became one of the best friends I ever had.

But everytime I had a sense she was seeing someone I would freak out. Two months ago I ruined her dates and I wasn't able to hangout with her anymore. Contact started to stop and I started to get really out of hand by calling her everyday and just wanting to hangout even if it was for 20mins.  But no, my phone goes straight to voicemail and I can only call her on Facebook. 

Tonight I found out she is dating some dude.. my anger and emotions took over... And I couldn't stand it so at 3am I drove to her place to look for her vehicle vandalize it break Windows pop tires whatever it is but her vehicle wasn't there... 

I guess I really don't love her because I wouldn't act like this if I did. 

Now I'm at the point of ""Don't hurt anyone, if you wanna hurt someone hurt yourself"" 

So maybe I should listen and end it. The more I live the more I feel like I'm torturing myself, it's my life I think I deserve to make this decision especially when I been dealing with it for over 20 years"
348,Am I expecting too much from therapy?,"I've been seeing a therapist for 6 months. My main issue is a feeling of meaninglessness and discontent with life and the world that drives me to see no way for me too feel good about existing. Basically an unwillingness to participate in the world. I have no larger goal that creates a drive strong enough for me to feel that life is worth it. The only thing that makes these feelings disappear at times are my amazing friends. This fuels depression. Also I have issues with sharing my feelings and especially feeling them in front of people. I practically can't cry in front of people and I struggle to admit that I cry at all.

My therapist has focused on the latter and my relationships with people. I'm learning to be more open which has led to closer relationships than I've ever had before, which is great. I've never felt as loved as I do today, and I've never felt love for someone else the way I do for my friends.

The problem is that my feelings towards life aren't getting better, often worse. Even though I'm bettering in other areas, I still feel a deep hopelessness for myself. Even on ""good"" days I can see myself wanting to die in the future. I've explored these feelings with my therapist, but nothing makes it better. I've told him countless times that I'm frustrated because talking about it does nothing for me. It feels good having people relate to it and hearing me. My friends care about me and they want to hear, but the feeling doesn't get better.

I told my therapist that I would like to attack this problem directly, perhaps with other forms of therapy, and honestly I don't even know if it's possible. He basically told me that he couldn't provide me with any other form of therapy than what he had done already. Now I'm thinking I might be asking for something impossible here. I know that part of me is looking to ""fill the void"" so to speak, but I would think there is some other way to treat these feelings. 

Am I expecting too much from therapy? Am I looking for something nonexistent? I don't know what I need..."
349,Changes after going through anxiety and depression,"A lot of things have changed in me. I used to be very organized, but now...everything is all over the place. I can't stick to my schedules, i'm cramming (i never crammed before. I hate it) and the worst is i'm procrastinating. I'm a lot clumsy and careless and i hate it. This has been going on for almost a year, not just this quarantine time. I tried to do what i used to do before but i can't keep up anymore. I'm trying my best now that i have a lot of time for myself but it seems that it became my new self. I don't like this. It affects my work. I feel incompetent and inefficient and i don't know how to reset myself. 

(I feel the need to say that I am very okay now. I am off meds for almost 2 years. No more suicidal thoughts but  i do get disruptive thoughts, which comes in rare nowadays. No more panic attacks too but i get occassional anxiety. )

Has anyone experienced this? This is quite frustrating for me."
350,Beyond repair?,"I’m really messed up in the head and I don’t think I’ll ever be ok. All night all I could think about was how I’m always everyone’s second choice and how no one has ever really wanted me and needless to say it’s depressing but I kind of like it? I’m not sure how to word it without it sound weird buts it’s like I always want to worst the happen because it gives me an excuse to feel awful and I’m not sure why I’m like this. 

I’m a defeatist and I’m pessimistic and I don’t think I even want to change anymore, at least part of me doesn’t. I’d rather just die. 

I basically feel completely worthless and like I’m a failure, I don’t cut myself a lot of slack anymore. And for some reason the only thing that really matters to my crazy brain anymore is getting people’s sympathy and convincing everyone how hopeless and how much of a lost cause I am. 

It feels like I’d rather have pity for being the way I am than being a success story and I’m not sure why anymore. I think it’s because I tried for so long to get better and be someone and I always came up short. I truly do feel hopeless. 

I’ll be 27 this year, I think all of my problems are kind of set in stone. I still hold onto my belief that if I can somehow one day find a way to make real money that everything will be ok. I don’t think that’ll ever happen though."
351,I feel so dumb,"Last February I saw a opening for scholarship grant for studying abroad. One of my dream is to study my masters degree abroad so I decided to apply. Although my GPA isn't that high, I think I might have a slight chance because my working experiences are connected to the degree that I am eyeing for. One of the requirements is to do a plan, stating what will you do after you finish my degree if I get accepted and how will it help my home country. 




It's been month now and I haven't finished my application yet and I feel so dumb and stupid because up until now I still haven't finish the plan requirement. There's a voice inside of me saying ""what are you thinking? you're applying for scholarship yet you can't even write a convincing plan?"" I feel so disappointed and I feel that maybe my thoughts are right. That I'm too ambitious for applying. I'm just too dumb. I felt so anxious and stupid and dumb. I don't know anymore."
352,Can't to any college (university) work,"Hi guys, I wanted some advice on studying with mental health issues. I (20F) was a straight A student up until I was about 15. I was bullied at school and forced to do the homework of my classmates every morning at school. 

I'm now at college and away from the bullies but every time I attempt to study or complete an assignment, I get the exact same feelings as I did when I was being bullied. I feel anxious, alone and afraid. I'll do absolutely anything to prevent studying. My procrastination is extreme and no amount of last minute pressure can make me meet deadlines or compete work. 

I also have OCD, so any work I do manage to somehow complete, I have to read over and over and over again to make sure it's perfect. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I know a lot of you may say to see a therapist and I already am, nothing seems to be working.

How can I complete my work and stop procrastinating and how can I beat my OCD and stop reading everything 100 times to make sure it's perfect?

TLDR: I was forced by bullies to do their homework and now every time I try to complete my own work, I get the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did then. I have OCD and have to read my work 100 times to make sure it's perfect. Any tips?"
353,Hearing things...,"So I live in South Korea where my wife teaches english. We have been on stay at home orders for about 7 weeks. For a few weeks before this happened I had been hearing some small sounds. Knocks, bumps,pops, doors stuff like that. I would hear it at home or in the car picking up our kids it didnt really matter where I was. For the most part I ignored it. Figured it was just stress and whatnot. 

In the weeks since we have been home, and by home I mean we are still going out to ride bikes in the neighborhood, grocery shopping for the family, playing in our backyard. The noises have become louder to the point I was woken up a few times by what I thought was a door being slammed or something falling next to my bed. In the last week I have started hearing laughter and whispers. They sound almost cartoon like and with a speed up cadence if that makes sense. 

I have talked to my wife and sister about it and they both just think I'm stressed from being a stay at home dad being locked indoors all the time. I'm not sure they believe me and I'm not sure where to go from here. I can't get seen at a hospital near us without a negative covid test and we are not in a hotspot area so it's not as easy to get a test as some parts of Korea.

Should I just chalk it up to stress? Thanks for reading."
354,I feel stuck,"Im not going anywhere. Im going to be stuck being in this shitty dark place in my head and i cant do shit about it. I really tried to improve. I read all those self help books, read up on psychology, tried meditation, wrote a list of things im grateful about every night, i tried everything but nothing is happening. I dont feel fucking happier. No... i still feel like shit. Im so tired of being here. Im only 16 and i already cant imagine a future where im happy. I tried envisioning myself living the best life, perhaps with a lot of wealth, a loving partner, a beautiful family, but i just cant inagine myself being happy in any of those dreams and i dont get why. Ive been like this for like the past 6 years of my life and now im starting to think maybe this is all there is to life. Maybe im actually normal and happiness is just overrated. Idk anymore..."
355,COVID Research Study,[removed]
356,I want things to end again 😓,[deleted]
357,I'd like to know what's wrong with me. Could you please help me understand?,"I don't know where to post this, so I'm going to try a few subreddits.

I know something's wrong with me and I'd like to know what. I plan on seeking professional help after covid ends, but for now I'd really like to hear different perspectives from you all. I'm asking this because something clicked inside of me today, after remembering that my best friend once asked me ""are you sure you don't have ADHD or something?"" and my bassist sometimes jokingly (?) says I have asperger's.

It's quicker if I make a list of things I do and things that happen(ed) to me, in no particular order:

* I'm a master procrastinator. I'm currently finishing university 2 years late because of this.
* I have a deeply rooted routine and I find it super hard to break from it.
* I'm intelligent, intuitive and creative. I play two instruments and I'm learning a third.
* I have zero passion in the things I'm studying. My real dream is playing music my whole life, but I've never taken steps to enter the music world/business out of fear. A fear of failing, a fear of making a leap of faith, a fear of leaving everything behind and making sacrifices.
* I tend to dabble in pleasant activities instead of working my ass off.
* I run away from responsibilities.
* I get sidetracked and distracted easily.
* I'm fidgety and I can't seem to stand or sit still.
* I'm unreliable because I don't seem to care about the outside world.
* No man is an island, but I think I could be one, until I feel lonely. Only then I feel the need to ""connect"" with someone, but as soon as that is satisfied, I have no problems becoming an island again.
* I reply to emails and texts after weeks or months because it's like I'm afraid of something. Of a flowing conversation maybe? To be covered in responsibilities or things to do maybe? To potentially have awkward moments in the conversation maybe?
* I have little to no empathy, I suck at reading emotions and providing emotional support.
* I'm super rational, to the point where someone once compared me to a robot. Not good.
* I have like five people whom I really consider ""important"" in my life.
* My best friend once told me I'm emotionally stunted.
* I have low self-esteem and I don't think highly of myself.
* People say I'm modest, but I'm afraid it's not true modesty.
* My current girlfriend told me I'm devoid of emotions, things aren't going that well now.
* I was over-parented by my mother as a child, she was suffocating, anxious, controlling and always did things for me instead of teaching me how to do them. She was always proud of me as if I were some kind of perfect child, had enormous expectations of me, was always worried that I would engage in ""bad"" activities (""bad"" was a very loose term for her, everything was bad apparently), banned videogames and swearwords in the house, still treats me like a 6 year old child. She is passive-aggressive and always guilt-trips people. She gave me a lot of attention when I was little and was always careful not to neglect me, but at the same time lived (and lives) in her own world and it seems like she always cared about her ""reputation"" and how others would see her more than anything else.
* I never seriously confided in my parents, not because I don't trust them, but because I have a weird relationship with them, as if they were my teachers and I were their student (they're both teachers btw).
* I'm afraid of being abandoned in relationships, to the point where I blurt out promises and excuses and bend over backwards in order to take the relationship back to a ""stable"" situation. Then, when I'm comfortable, I tend to slip right back into my old behaviors.
* I'm anxious and I tend to get needy and possessive as soon as someone I care about pulls back.
* When I'm out with friends, or at a social event, or even at a family reunion, I drink a lot. I never get drunk or embarrass myself in front of others, but I keep filling up my glass, I drink more than I should (unless I'm the one who's got to drive home), to the point where I'm usually tipsy before the second course is served.
* Sometimes I get really horny and masturbate a lot of times a day, for days and days. If I don't control myself, I might find myself browsing porn websites for hours on end.
* I'm really good at adapting to new situations.
* I'm really good at breaking habits, IF my habit is out of reach. Out of sight, out of mind works really well for me. I might spend a whole day on reddit, youtube and facebook, but put me in a room without devices, and I'll gladly spend a week there without complaining. If there's no alcohol in the house for a month, I won't drink for a month and I won't crave it. Same thing for basically anything else (except music).
* I have a weird sense of humor and I'm capable of adapting to different conversations, unless the topic is football or some other boring shit. I could easily spend hours talking to a wide range of different people with different personalities.
* However, I immediately notice if someone ""resonates"" with me or not. It's rare for me to find a person that ticks all of my boxes. If they don't, I'm still nice and respectful, but it will be harder for me to ""let them in"".
* I'm a people pleaser, I find it hard to say no.
* I suck at putting up boundaries.
* I find it hard to open up to people.
* I never speak up for myself, thus building up resentment over time.
* I bottle everything up and after months and months I explode in an unpredictable way.
* I haven't cried for years.
* My best friend told me I'm aggressive and I have a hard time managing my anger.
* My girlfriend told me I sometimes get passive-aggressive.
* I lose contact with most people. I either stop replying or I don't check up on them.
* I sometimes feel empty and like a failure.
* I've never been suicidal.
* I feel like I really need to grow up and become a man, but it's easy for me to relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

If something else comes to mind, I'll edit the post.

To counter some of this bad stuff, I've started a daily plan. I have a bunch of actions I'm going to carry out EVERY DAY, like meditating, exercising, doing an act of kindness, studying, etc. For now it's going well and I'm feeling a sense of fulfillment and purpose after doing these activities.

Still, before I go to therapy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance."
358,Quarantine could just be getting to me,"This could be quarantine or this could just be me being crazy, but I noticed that people pause a lot when they’re talking to me. As if they’re thinking of something to say but then they don’t say it. I’m not sure if I’m just imagining it or if it’s a real thing. I am very used to quick responses and replies because I come from a loud family of quick talkers and I could be projecting that? I’m not sure 🤔 Has anyone else here experienced that before? People taking pauses after you’ve said something and experiencing anxiety over it?"
359,Was I wrong to leave?,"So I was voluntarily admitted for depression recently due to an increase in intense suicidal thoughts and urges. 

I was admitted to a unit specifically catered to mood disordered people, known for being the calm and quiet unit where there aren’t any triggers, and to get in there you usually have to hit a certain criteria. This is so that the unit houses the most stable patients to foster the best rehabilitative environment. Usually that just means: don’t be aggressive, and listen to the nurses. I’m averse to any form of aggression and know how to stay in my own lane, so I would say that aside from the suicidal thoughts, I would’ve been a nurse’s dream. 

But when I got into the unit, of the few days I spent in there, a lot happened. I witnessed shouting matches over the smallest issues (or sometimes no issue at all), and multiple manic meltdowns where chairs were being thrown and doors were being banged. It was all really overwhelming for me that I felt trapped in the unit in an environment that felt far more stressful and aggressive than I was told it would be. A fellow patient (repeat admission) agreed that this was a bad time to be admitted, as if something was in the water that was causing everyone to go a little out of sorts. 

I was incredibly triggered by the overloading aggression (not even towards me, but just around me) that I broke down for an hour in front of a nurse and requested a review to be discharged, and spent the rest of the day emotionally exhausted and non-operational. 

I signed myself in to take a break from life, and signed myself out against medical advice (doctors kept saying, “it’s just an adjustment period, it’s just not a good time in the unit, you just need to distract yourself and don’t get involved”) because I felt myself deteriorating more than when I went in. 

Did I make the right call leaving against the doctors’ recommendation? Was I wrong to leave?"
360,"Those with OCD/OCD-like symptoms, how did therapy help?","My therapist found that I have OCD-like symptoms, and that it affected multiple parts of my life. The compulsions themselves vary. HAVING to call someone until they pick up if im distressed, HAVING to work on weekends etc etc. prior to pinpointing these symptoms, I felt like I was in an eternal cycle of anxiety. Everything I did revolves around my mood.

The therapy helped me connect my thoughts, emotions and behaviours in a way that I didn't think of earlier. I feel like I know who I am, and that makes it easier to predict my negative tendencies as well.

What are your experiences?"
361,Why am I still thinking about this?,"A few weeks ago, I was let go from my job. It was a job I extremely hated. My boss was very unfair and manipulative and was in a toxic work environment altogether.

Since being let go, I will admit I’ve been dramatically happier. I went back on my weight loss diet and have lost five pounds, getting back into hobbies, and doing anything that makes me happy. 

Still, thorough-out the day I still think about past events that occurred there and it’s brings me down. I’m trying to think of ones to stop thinking about it but I cant.

So has anyone been through something similar and knows what I can do to help myself?"
362,"Mother is imagining things because of stress, won't sleep, me and dad don't know how to help.","I feel so guilty right now. My mother hasn't sleep for three nights now, she's really stressed and she keeps saying that she hears people try to get in the house and walk on the roof.  


I feel guilty because she's been so busy lately, doing things at home due to we all being stuck in quarantine, having to see constant annoying coronavirus news, and the thing is, a few days ago we did have a break-in attempt; a real one, but as I said, it was a few days ago--there's no one walking on the roof at night!!! We already tried to reassure her again and again, but she won't believe us! She wants to keep guard all night and she won't listen to us. She's already called the police three times at night ( nothing came of it, because there's no one walking on the roof!!!) and me and dad can't sleep either.   


What made me cry today was that she asked me not to be mad at her, and go get some sleep, and said that she'll go to the hospice. I don't want her any harm, I'm just really tired and hurt. Me and dad want her to be well but she won't listen to us. I feel angry too, because I could've helped her ou more at home and maybe she wouldn't have gotten this stressed. I'm also angry because her side of the family always asks things of her, and only her, and they definitely had a hand in causing her to get like this too.   


Please help. I need proper advice on how to proceed, what professionals to contact, how to talk to HER, I don't want to fight or yell at her, I just want her to be well.

363,Is it a common thing to have a high sex drive when one is feeling down/depressed or anxious?,"I’m aspergers and also have depression. I’ve heard over and over again that people with clinical depression have low sex drive or no sex drive at all, but I’m the exactly the opposite, because when I’m feeling down or anxious (which is pretty much every day) I feel the need to masturbate, and I’m in my late 20s.. Is it a common thing among Aspergers? Is there a correlation between Aspergers and hyper-sexuality?"
364,"I recently survived a terrible rip current that dragged me out from the shore, and I can't tell anyone about the whole, frightening experience. I'm in shock.","I tell this story calmly, as if a little wave shook me so I swam away, but really I was unknowingly dragged out from shore and battered by waves. Deep down inside, I felt scared, dumb, and helpless, but now I'm oddly at peace?

I swim in the ocean bay for exercise. I noticed the waves were higher than usual, but when they crash along the reef, smaller swells form. I had a body board with me, and it feels nice bobbing along the swells. Suddenly, I started to feel a small pull, which I didn't mind because I could stand and hold myself on a rock. Then the swells got bigger, and before I knew it... I was farther from shore, on my tip toes, waves just... crashing and pulling me... ^farther (I can barely type this). I felt myself panic for a minute, but I knew to stay calm, control breathing, swim parallel to shore. But that fear, being dragged away, the helplessness, no people around, being beat up by water, the possibility of hitting some rock/coral, was in the back of my mind. I yelled out ""help"" once, but knew this was on me.

I swam after each wave hit and dragging force, it felt like a slow battle against Poseidon. After a while, a huge wave came in and I braced myself, I lost my board for a moment, couldn't see, but was carried a long distance away staying afloat. I got back on my board and was hit by another wave, could barely see, carried another long distance, but my leg was scratched by some coral! I felt a little bit of relief, because the coral meant I was close to the shallow, coral filled bay. I could get my footing, and I saw another wave approach, and instead of bracing myself, I got on my board and surfed the wave peacefully. That moment felt so surreal, like time had slowed, everything was clear and quiet, and my body was numb. I moved carefully in the calmer water, just now noticing the pain from the coral scratches.

I could never tell anyone of how foolish, afraid, and helpless I felt. I never mention the fatal ""what ifs"" that could've happened but didn't... and I'd feel crazy to say life has a whole different meaning to me now.

Notes: I always have safety on call, I notify a friend when I swim and give a curfew when I'm back, and they know to call for help if I don't report back in. Luckily, I made it back 30 mins early, on time.
Please do not call me stupid, I was ignorant about being close to the swells, and I learned my lesson.

TL;DR I got stuck in a rip current and I felt like this was the end for me, but after a long battle I managed my way out with some coral scratches. I told my LDR spouse and a friend it spooked me but it was no big deal, but I cannot openly share the trauma/enlightenment from it all. Could anyone relate? Anyone felt this way before?"
365,Do you guys ever experience this: suddenly you develop an obsession/pet peeves over things you didn't care for before.,"So basically like maybe you were fine about something all along (such as a noise maybe), you don't really think about it at all, it's kinda like you heard noise and you just let go, no thoughts, no issues. Then suddenly, one day you feel obsessed about the noise, like the noise makes you feel very annoyed. The feeling of being annoyed makes you more attached to the noise, so now you remembers it, you also associate bad feelings with the trigger, and you have a new obsession/pet peeves.

It's not necessarily a noise, it can be anything, that you didn't feel bothered, but suddenly feel bothered now.

I admit I have several mental health issues, I have an OCD that has something to do with numbers/counting, I have some anxiety issues, I have a mild depression, so maybe that's why what I described happens to me.

I think what I described is just a symptom, surely there are more fundamental reasons behind the symptom.

But I just want to know if other people experience similar things before and how you handle it.

Personally, I feel our mind is very tricky, like if you don't give a damn about something, then you don't get bothered and feel good, if you starts to feel a damn about it, then it gets worse and worse, because you kind of remember the bad feeling and associate it with the thing, and this association stays with you.

Sometimes I wish I can selectively manipulate my memory, so I can just erase some things that bother me."

368,Effectiveness of CBT?,"Hello, everyone!

Long-time depressive here. My question is - what is the effectiveness of CBT for clinical depression? Most meta-analysis studies report the range to be between 50-85% (which, honestly, the very different range makes me question the methodology of the studies sampled). 

However, reading into what CBT actually does, it makes me think it's just a way to teach yourself to gaslight yourself more effectively? Is it wrong of me to think that?

Thanks."

371,I feel digusted with myself,"Hey guys, 

I normally don´t post much on reddit but I just don´t know who I should talk to and feel like ventig for a bit. (Please excuse any grammer or spelling mistakes I make, english isn´t my first language).

First some thins about me: I´m currently 18 and a girl, 162 cm tall and weigh around 50 kg

My story begins from my childhood on. I was always the fat kid in my family and was kinda bullied for it from my family members. When I was around 16 I decided I don´t want to deal with it any longer and changed my whole lifestyle. I went to the gym regularly and ate much healthier. Thanks to that I actually was able to lose 15 kg and I was so proud of myself. I had the confidence I never had before and my whole life changed for the better because it motivated me. 

But all of that changed. I still have lots of body fat and it shows especially on my tummy. It makes me teribly insecure. i´ve started clean eating and I really enjoy it but on some days I just feel like eating and when I begin eating I just can´t stop myself. Today for exable I ate more then a quarter of an cake my mom made and three bowls of cereal (it was made out of whole grains and oats but still...) . I didn´t eat it in one sitting (exept the bowls of cereal), but I think you can understand why it kinda upsets me. After I ate I walked in my room and saw myself in the mirror and just started crying. I feel so disguting. Why do I always do that? One piece of cke would be enough. One bowl of cereal would be enough. So why can´t i stop myself. It realy takes a lot of willpower for me to stop eating. I only stop, when I feel my stomach hurt. Like I feel that I´m full but somthing in me tells me ""no it tasts good eat more"".

One factor that makes all of that worst for me is, that clean eating and regualar excercise actually worked and on one day I had such a nice, toned stomach. I was so incredibly happy, I felt like I loved myself, what isn´t the case very often. But know all of that is gone, just because I can´t contol myself.

I really just want a healthy relationship with food and my body but I just can´t seem to find peace with it. I want food and my body to be my friend not the reason I cry myself to sleep.

I´m sorry my post is so long, thanks or reading."

376,Having cancer treatment and struggling with no contact,"My bf (33M) of 4 years and I (34F) broke up at the end of January and i was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in March. The break up was his call, and he struggled with co-dependency issues in the relationship and has asked for no contact.

I am really struggling. I've started chemo and have my lumpectomy scheduled for the end of the month, but I live on my own and not allowed to leave the house OR take anyone to the hospital with me because of corona virus.

Also, I had lymphoma in 2015 and I can feel a distinct difference with the support (and attention, I guess) that i've received from my friends this time around. My cancer support therapist says that's not uncommon with second cancers ...although I'm sure this is also feeling amplified by being stuck in the house 24/7 with nothing to do but think. This is really hard.

I'm the most lonely I've ever been at a time where i really need to stay positive. I miss him and i miss his friendship. I have reached out to him and asked for some contact during this time. I know it's selfish. I just feel like i need *one* thing to feel ""ok"" at the moment :( Nothing feels certain like he always did.

Any advice?"

379,"Falling into ""The Slump"" again","I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for a few years now and been on anti-depressants for the last year or so, but typically have it managed and under control so that it doesn't affect my day to day life toooo much.

However, I feel myself falling back into the slump again. This happens every so often with no real trigger - or not one that I seem to have identified as of yet.

You know when you just feel yourself feeling more drained than normal, mentally exhausted, quiet, and have no desire to do anything? I can't even bring myself to watch TV.

I'm a people pleaser, and forcing myself into work during this pandemic. Every single ounce of energy that I seem to be able to summon is going into dragging myself into work and putting my all in. It means when I come home I physically cannot muster anything inside myself to do anything and it makes me feel really low.

My mind is just constantly unfocused and I keep feeling really emotional, and then really distant.

It comes and goes, normally I just power through stages like this, but I'm wondering:

&amp;#x200B;

When you feel yourself getting into ""the slump"", what do you do?

I want to try and be proactive with this and cope a bit better.  I just want to hear others thoughts and opinions and feel a bit more normal and reassured I guess."

381,Auditory hallucinations.,"Back in 2016, I started experiencing auditory hallucinations, after messing about trying to contact spirits.  I did successfully contact something, but then after some bad event with these entities, I began hearing voices.  They didn't really last long, a few days to a week at most.

Now they've come back, and it's difficult not to believe that they're some sort of demon-like entity.  They've told me things before I knew about them, and they seem more able to communicate in sophisticated language, than what I thought was possible with hallucinations.  You really can have a conversation with them, and there are a few of them.  

I can easily win them with logical argument, but they're relentless and totally evil.  Well except at least one of them, she has been nice to me, but I've had a real horrible experience with some of the others.

Their intelligence level ranges from mostly average, rarely above average, and some are totally stupid.

It's a nightmare, and I don't want to deal with it.  I now wish I'd never contacted what I thought were spirits.

Someone help me :("

about a week or so me and my stepdad got into an argument and he threatened to kick me out and since then you can feel the tension in the house between everybody. so theres that. work has been stressing me out as im a nurse (i dont work in the covid units as i have a 1 year old and both my parents are high risk) also everything going on with the world is making my anxiety and emotions be at an all time high.

388,Should I confront an ex-friend about some very hurtful things she said to me?," tw // suicide

I had a friend (who will be referred to as Rachel). Rachel and I had been friends for a couple of years, but at the time this incident happened, our relationship was extremely tentative (and we'd had problems in the past, most of them unfortunately caused by me). We'd stopped officially being friends, but somehow we ended up talking from time to time anyway.

Anyway, I have been struggling with my mental health recently, and a few months back I attempted suicide. While in hospital, I messaged Rachel and we had a fairly normal conversation which ended because she was going to bed. The last message she sent me included her stating that my attempted suicide was a **shitty thing to do** and that **she was annoyed about i**t. Then the next day, we had a major argument and one of the things she said was that **she didn't think I had actually intended to take my own life.**

After this, we decided that it was better if we didn't speak at all, and see if things were any better in the future. However, we eventually concluded that it was best if we went our separate ways permanently, and that's how it's been apart from a couple of occasions.

The problem is, I never confronted her about the things she said to me, despite the fact that they really affected me. I strongly believe that it would help me if I could make it clear that she'd said some unacceptable things that were negatively impacting my mental health, but I don't know if I should as she doesn't want to speak to me.

(Also, we have not been speaking since around February, it hasn't been years or anything.)"
389,Trying to work with school at home sucks. (Rant),"Highschool was always difficult, not only for classes and getting help, but because I was too anxious to be around others. Now with Zoom and everything happening, I can't get out of bed and be able to focus on my school work because of home life. I missed a week of school online because of my parents constantly fighting, and when they weren't fighting my neighbors are making a racket (I live in a trailer park, you can hear everything.) When. I actually tried showing up for my classes and doing my work it never helped. My teachers for my college classes are counting everything as a normal grade, not taking in the fact that it's hard to learn anything at home. I ask for help, but with the groans of other students understanding everything already and just sending videos as if it will help me learn just makes me panic. They're not just participation grades, we're being forced to take tests that count as if we were in school.

 I was already anxious in school but now it's even worse. I have to have my camera on and feel embarrassed for what other students have to hear or see anything because my teacher insists that we have to have it on or makes a snide comment about it. I stopped participating and joining after what I heard about Zoom too, (I've been using my school account that's connected to my school data which has all my information about me, which is scary since the hacker problems).

I really don't know what to do, I'm getting less sleep at night then I do in school too because of chronic nightmares, so it's hard to focus on work with that alone. I almost had a panic attack because one of my teachers tried to call me and ask where I am. I'm too embarrassed with not being able to understand my homework and being able to ask for help without looking an idiot. I just don't know what to do."
390,Intrusive Thoughts,"Lately, I have been suffering through intrusive thoughts. Terrible thoughts of death, either about me or my family.

My family walked away almost injure-free, but I broke my arm very badly and I have two plates and 11 screws in my arm, with pain on the daily.

392,Where do I begin to seek help?,"I recently I lost my father due to negligence while hospitalized, it has left me disheveled and tore at me knowing the people responsible for taking care of him left him to die. He died 8 days after hospitals in my state stopped allowing visitors. He was 58 and dies of completely unrelated causes of what brought him to the hospital This has destroyed my faith in healthcare.

I am 29, I have very good health insurance and live in Ohio. I feel myself losing touch with reality, I am confusing my dreams for real life and am just very disassociated from where I was a few weeks ago. I don't feel suicidal but I have been down that path before and do not want to head there. I've never really grieved before and never lost anyone close besides aunts and uncles (which never felt this way). I always assumed I may have been a sociopath because I never cried over death until now. Today was my first day back at work, my dad and I worked together in the same industry for years but I took a new job in October and am now feeling so angry I didn't stay to see him more. I don't know if any of this is normal but I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Sorry to unpack all this, I don't really have friends and with all that is going on, I don't socialize much to begin with but was close with my dad. What I'm asking for advice on is, where do I begin to seek help with this? I don't have a GP and haven't been to one since I was a child and had a pediatrician. Do I seek a GP then go from there? I know that's not what I need but everyone is telling me that I have to be refereed to a therapist or psychiatrist by a GP. Please, any help would be appreciated. Thank you."
393,How to go back to therapy after a traumatic experience with mental healthcare?,"I am looking for general advice on how to move past this and be brave enough to seek help once more. 

I was in counseling for about a year and things were going really well. One day I had to meet with a different counselor than my normal one and she Baker Acted me because I USED TO BE suicidal (I haven’t been for a while but sometimes I would talk to my therapist to process those times) and she twisted my words a lot to make it seem like I still was.

For those who don’t know, the Baker Act is forced hospitalization by pretty much any means necessary. Basically I got handcuffed by police while people I knew looked on and got sent to a facility in my city which is notoriously the worst one. I spent 12 hours locked in an empty waiting room and they didn’t give me a place to sleep that night, I had to sit on a couch with all the lights on outside the patient area. They didn’t let me sleep at all because they wanted me to eat breakfast, which was meat based and I am a vegetarian. I finally got a place to sleep and slept through the next two meals, so the staff started calling me lazy and said I was faking being vegetarian to make things more complicated for them. I told them I wasn’t suicidal and a staff member said that if that was the case I should have kept my problems to myself. They ended up billing me for thousands of dollars which wiped out all my savings. A lot of other scary shit happened there and I was almost sexually assaulted but moving on ...

I didn’t want to meet with my therapist again afterwards, but she urged me to come in. She was sympathetic, but some of the stuff she said made me feel really attacked and I never went back. I later found out that the hospital I was sent to broke a lot of the requirements around the Baker Act laws while I was there, but there’s no way for me to press charges because if I do that information will become public and could wreck my future career opportunities. 

About a year has passed since then and I am still struggling with my mental health and I want to go back to therapy, but I am terrified that something like this will happen again. How can I seek mental healthcare after an experience like this? I don’t want to struggle alone anymore."
394,I’m a bad person,"Everything I do seems to be wrong. I just fought with my mother, we never really do get along and it breaks me that she doesn’t feel this angry towards anyone else except me. She says I’m a copy of my father who apparently looks just like me and acts like me. He was abusive and pathetic. I hate being compared to him and their side of the family. She always looks and speaks to me like I’m an alien or something. She’s so warm and lively with everyone else but it’s like everything dies down when I’m in the room. I can never feel comfortable. 

She always says things that she forgets and acts like I’m going crazy or I’m confused when I bring something up. She gets mad at me all the time. I just can’t do anything right. I can’t make her proud. I’m depressed and useless and just feel like a burden. Quarantine has been really hard because I have a big family. I don’t get on well with them. 

My emotions are always so out of whack and it’s hard to control them. I’m also struggling with my self esteem and don’t eat properly anymore. I either eat too little or eat too much. I feel pleased when I punish myself because I feel like I deserve it. I’m just a mistake. Life isn’t good for me. I’m never happy. I just let everyone down.

I try not to let people influence me. They’re not worth my tears but I can’t help it. I just can’t deal with it. I feel pathetic writing this as I’ve got no other place to vent. I know I’ve been getting worse and I know I need to do something about it. But I never do."

They look nothing like me and they have a look which is very sexualised by society. I don't know why but the other day I was looking at some of them (probably to torture myself) and began to get turned on and started masturbating. I don't know if it's the thought of them being with my boyfriend, or me actually being that girl but I now feel disgusting and I just want to die. Some of them were only 19 (which I know is legal) but I'm 26 and feel like a monster. What weirdo looks through their boyfriends Instagram follows and faps?!? FML."

399,struggling with school and motivation,"I definitely have an aversion towards school, I always have I never learned how to actually do schoolwork on my own because I was either had private tutoring every day or my father tutoring me. My father was very strict and abusive because of school up until I got diagnosed with MDD at 15 (currently 20). I barely graduated high school and it was only because I got pity passed by the committee. I have been to therapy for the past 5 years but it was always focused on my family situation as it is dysfunctional.

Now I am in my first year of fine arts and I am struggling. I always thought it was because I was not interested in the subjects that I was so miserable at school but only now do I realise that I have school-related trauma. I can NEVER start working, I will make a to-do list and all that shit but I just can not start. I love my school but I'm failing because I have given up before I even started. All the work then snowballs and paralyzes me with anxiety which makes me work even less!

Sometimes I really wanna bring up my depression when my parents get on me about this stuff, but then I’ll just look like I’m using my mental issues as an excuse, or a crutch. So I don’t say anything, and they go on thinking I’m selfish and lazy."

I feel so fake. I don't have any diagnosis or anything. I'm getting ""checked"" in a few days though. But I feel as if I get any diagnosis it would be a mistake. I don't have a reason. I'm just a shitty person."

409,Trying to find help after too much lsd use as a teen,"Hello!! When I was 15 I started using lsd as trying to find a reason to find any joy in my life. I was deeply depressed for a couple of years already and never seeked help just because of fear I guess. I had used acid only 3 times until i was around 16 and a half and thats when i really amped up my use. Going from 3 trips to 20-25 in about 3 months, i was just with a really good group of friends and had really deep conscious openings (in this span i was only taking 1 to 2 hits of 375 ugs and i knew it was good because of who i was getting it from). On my last trip I was with some good friends and took 3 hits, which i had only done one other time on my 3rd trip, putting me over my limit and it wasn't bad but extremely intense and i got stuck in a loop and i was doing some crazy shit that in reality doesn't make sense but that doesn't matter. Basically afterwards I came out of it and knew something wasn't right. The next day was spent with my ex who was already burnt out too, and i remember feeling like i was stuck in a tv screen and could see everything and hear it but i couldn't feel anything. It was as if i was wrapped in plastic and had lost all touch with any reality around me, I had forgotten my friends, how to deal with situations, anything academics related was gone and my sanity was more chaotic than ever. It took me years to find myself and had to stop smoking weed and calm down with my life, i was a kid who never had to try but could accomplish anything in great efficiency and well. After this i found myself to be happy just to exist and sometimes be able to have the happiness in at least not feeling like i'm falling through endless voids of nothingness. Now being almost 19 I haven't used lsd in over a year but i'm nowhere where i used to be, My sducidal thoughts are still around and with quarantine i've lost all confidence. Theres a lot more to this that goes into why i started smoking weed and using acid due to my parents, just didn't feel like getting into all that. Never really had any role models growing up and everyone saw me as smart and told me i'd go to collage and be something, but nothings working as i hope and i don't know. It is what it is"
410,Does anyone have healthy habits that they can use when having panic attacks?,"I'm not looking for the cure-all, but I go thru these panic attacks where my mind builds up this network of questions and accusations against me that ends up whittling me down to nothing.

I want to try and break the cycle of thoughts and just allow myself to be present in the moment.

I don't know what I hope to achieve with this post, but if you could list your healthy habits maybe that would help spark something in me to change mine."
411,My brother's constant cleaning is tearing my family apart,"My little brother has had an obsession with contamination for the past year. Recently, it's gotten so much worse. Now, he showers around 5 times a day, even in the middle of the night, every time he uses the bathroom. This is always accompanied by screaming and crying. My parents aren't helping. They tell him he needs to cope better and control himself, while yelling these things angrily at him. This happens just about all day, every day now and I can't take much more of it. I know it's kind of selfish of me, being the only household member not directly involved but I still feel like I'm on the edge of snapping. I'm pretty sure my brother has little to no insight on his issue. Whenever someone tells him what he's doing is excessive, he just starts going on about how 'dirty' something is. I don't think there's anything I can do to help without making people angrier. My parents keep going on about how he won't be able to go to the school we got accepted into next year and stuff. I just can't bear seeing him descend further and further into this vicious cycle. I just don't know what to do."
412,My doctor doesn't think she can help me,"My doctor doesn't think she can help me. This isn't the first time one of my therapist's have said something like this. But I don't know where it comes from. It seems everyone I talk to these days becomes so destroyed by me. I'm not even saying REALLY heavy things, at least not all the time. Yet every professional, and every person in my life I've talked to seems to see such pain. More pain than I believe I have. I'm not sure if I'm just so used to living like this that I simply can't see what everyone else can, or I'm sending some sort of unintentional vibe. 

I am aware of an influence I have over people, it's something I've always had, but I can't stand the way people look at me. Even strangers. As if I'm walking around already dead. 

How am I suppose to hide something, at least the healthy way, without knowing what it is that people I don't even know can see?"

414,I’ve tried to talk to my friends but they haven’t helped so I’m putting this all here,"So I’ve mental health issues since I was 10 and I’m 17 now (girl). I used to cut when I was 11 and I can’t even remember why. I don’t need to give my whole life story about what was going on at the time, but I have some daddy issues. I have gotten diagnosed with anxiety and depression from my family doctor. I want to see a psychiatrist because I’m not doing good but we can’t afford it (idk if they are even open now). I’ve been getting these fits of anger where I am trying to workout and I just breakdown and I cry and stuff more often it was like once a week or so ago and then yesterday and today. I don’t know. I’ve always had issues I guess. I feel like I’m crazy and that’s why nobody stays with me long or loves me anymore. My mom were fighting one time and said she was going to send me to a ward, she didn’t mean it but sometimes I wish she would. I journal every night and I use headspace, I try really hard to better myself on my own. I’m not good at eating but I force myself to eat whenever I can and am willing. Before this I would lift everyday (which made it okay for me to eat in my head) and I’ve gotten much skinnier since quarantine. I ate to fuel my body and I don’t do anything besides run sometimes and body weight stuff and work (grocery store). I tried reaching out to my mom and my best friend (lives in the state I used to live) and they don’t seem interested in helping me. This all word vomit I’m sorry if it’s not coherent. Thanks for being an outlet reddit lol"

I can feel myself reverting back to my tangled up ways. 
I was doing so well. Sure, my anxiety was still overwhelming but I had distractions and I’d improved on my mental state A LOT with help from the people around me the past few months. But now, now my anxiety is consuming me. I’m just left alone with my thoughts, eating away at me.
But it’s okay to have ups and downs!"
416,I’m a worthless failure,All I am is a worthless failure. My job has been taking a toll on me and I’m sick of living in fear of a virus. My mental health has gotten so much worse in these times and I just wish I didn’t exist so I wouldn’t have to even try to make things work. I’m useless and pathetic.
417,I have no reason to be in crisis and no options on how to help myself.,"Let me start by giving some background. I’m an 18 y/o female living in the United States. I live a pretty amazing life by most people’s standards but have attempted suicide twice. I am severely depressed, see a psychiatrist, and am about to meet my 4th therapist that I’ve ever had for the first time in a few weeks.

I don’t have any major trauma that I can identify and I am really well off in life, but I’m depressed. Heck, my parents are about to get a small pool for our house.

For some reason though I’m on the brink of suicide. I think about how I’m going to end it 24/7 and can’t tell anyone because it seems like I’m looking for attention. I don’t know where I should turn.

Thanks for listening to my ramble."
418,Self sabotaging behaviour getting worse,"I've been self sabotaging myself since I was a young kid. I remember being 9, and purposely spilling my drink on myself. I don't know why I did it, I just got an overwhelming temptation to do (which I obviously gave into). Whenever I go out of depressive episodes, I wish I could go back. I miss the sympathy and the ability to relate to people. I wish that people bully me, so I can feel sad, then people ask me what's wrong. I've probably offended a load of people by this, but this is killing me. I crave attention.


These go into my thoughts as well. If something bad happens, my brain casually thinks about me and everyone I know dying. It's happened so many times I'm pretty much desensitised to it. Does this match the description of an illness?

- awful reputation. I had beef with classmates and did stupid stuff in my ""buddy retard"" phase. Now damage is already done

- I always think people talk behind my back

- I sometimes find it hard to take criticism

- I also had (still sometimes have) a lot of violent thoughts and of taking revenge. Only thing that's on my way is consequences I will face.

421,"living alone, mental heath and classwork (F20)","Hi everyone. I've never posted on here but I'm just feeling completely alone. I've been living alone for the past month and have had little to no interaction outside of my caretaking job. I live over 300 miles from home and quarantine measures have prevented me from leaving along with my job. I've fallen behind on school to the point where I don't know what to do. I've had a resurgence in my depression to the point where even getting out of bed sucks the life out of me. Whenever I try and do my schoolwork I just think, ""well if you fail you can always just end it all and then you won't fail anymore."" The only thing that kept my spirits up was talking to my boyfriend, but he cut interactions with everyone for a while in order to boost his own mental health. I don't blame him, but he also knows that I'm by myself and not doing well. I just don't want to be here anymore"
422,Supporting others whilst battling self-doubt,I’ve been struggling lately to support my best friend. I am extremely logically driven and she very emotionally driven. Her feelings are intense and deep and she will often make emotional decisions. She will also seem ‘different’ to her normal self sometimes (acting quiet/short with me) which will prompt me to ask if she’s okay. She’ll often just say ‘yeah all fine you?’  I’ll press and assure her she can talk to me etc but she’ll maintain this stance. This is where I struggle: I have no idea what could be wrong so no idea how best to support her (give her a distraction? Support? A solution?). I ask what she needs and she says it’s fine. So this makes me insecure and doubt myself hugely because I deduce that I must be shit at reading her emotions and that maybe nothing is wrong after all. Because if it is...why would she not tell me when she seems to tell me other times? Have I done something? I always ask a few days later if something was wrong and she will usually say things like ‘trust your gut more’ ‘sometimes I can’t articulate things’. But this still doesn’t help me know what to do :( I don’t get why she can’t just say ‘oh I feel a bit fed up but I don’t really want to talk about it’. I’d then just know she needs cheering up. Can anyone relate to mine or her feelings? Be good to hear other perspectives!
423,Feeling down about school,"I'm in highschool freshman, and I really cant get along with my class I have a few friends but stick with them more because I just wanna get through day by day. I've never had that problem, always had my group of trusted friends. I feel really isolated and left behind, because I'm not fitting in the atmosphere which is in my class- which is partying till you cant drink anymore and making fun of teachers. I'm sure there's more to it, they are okay people, but I feel like I'm classified as not cool enough. I've been wondering since mid september if I should change school, but I wanted to wait, maybe something changes. But it didn't, I'm crying again, and just wanted to know opinion from someone who I havent spoken to yet. I wanna change school, I'm scared, but really I dont think that something in my class will change. I'm just not brave enough and I've been putting it off for so long that I dont know if it has any sense know. Has anyone have been in that kind of situation? I'm feeling really lost and down, I'm scared which is not typical for me but I'm stressing over this since the beginning. If you have any advice, please help me."
424,"Today, after two years of wanting to kill myself, cutting, drinking and smoking, I told my parents that I think I am depressed. My mother rolled her eyes. Now what? I feel like it would be so easy to just go through with it but I worry about my little brother. What am I supposed to do now?",
425,"I don't care about doing things for myself, and I don't know why, but I want to. (If you're going to read please read the whole thing)","I don't know how to effectively describe this, but I'll try my best. An issue that's been affecting me for a long time is that I don't do things on my own without a prompt or reminder. Mostly with chores around the house or basic hygiene things like brushing my teeth or showering. I don't do these things because I don't think to do them. I know that this makes me sound like I'm just lazy and don't want to put in any effort, but that's not the case. I *do* want to help out around the house, and be able to do things for myself. But I don't for some reason, and I have no idea why. I'm 16 years old and have to be reminded to brush my teeth or even eat 3 meals a day, otherwise it's likely I won't do them.

I say this is difficult to describe because it doesn't just boil down to me forgetting things. I've tried reminders, lists, and my dad having consequences for me not doing things I have to do daily. But they haven't been effective. It's not about me forgetting, it's that until something becomes a problem that's affecting me right now, I subconsciously push it aside and won't think about it.

The point I'm trying to make is that I don't care about things, but I *want* to. I, for whatever reason, won't eat lunch if nobody tells me to because it doesn't feel important in that moment. I genuinely don't know if this is an actual mental issue or if I'm just an a\*\*hole who refuses to admit that he is one,  but I don't have any ideas on how to get myself to care about this and need any help I can get.

I'm aware that this sounds almost dumb and not even something worth posting about. I am also aware that there are people who have it worse than me. Before I get yelled at for complaining about ""first world problems"" I want to clear a few things up regardless of whether or not they help explain the situation;

* I have been medically diagnosed with and ADHD and am medicated for it
* I don't *always* need to be reminded of things; I 8/10 times remember to bathe myself, but that's really the most I do without prompt
* I *am* currently seeing a therapist and have brought this up with them, however it has gotten to the point where neither of us know how to solve this
* As a sort of ""main idea"" for this; I am aware that this is a problem, and I want to be better. But for whatever reason I do not often think about it as a problem. I can be effective in doing things myself responsibly for a day or two, but there's a high chance I will end up going back to the ""unaware, unbothered"" phase.

I don't know if anything I said here made sense, or if there was any consistency in what I was saying. But if always being aware of this problem is the first step necessary to solve it, then I guess a Reddit post will have to do for now."
426,"I have no idea what is going on and I don't even know if it is a mental disorder, is it schizophrenia?","some background: I always talked to myself, a lot. Not because I don't have friends or anything like that, I am a weird person, people say, but I always had a handful of friends. But throughout my days I keep finding myself talking to well, myself. People notice it and at this point I gave up on saying ""I was just thinking out-loud"". Since last year or something along those lines some weird thing kept happening to me, sometimes once a week sometimes once a month. Let's say I just read a book, put the book on a coffee table next to my bed and went to sleep as I always do. When I wake up, on random, I might see the book on my lap, or on the ground alongside the ""real"" one. When I try to touch it I feel like, that thing I can't describe. And until I close my eyes for a few seconds and open them again that imagery does not disappear. 

Now the problem is:
This has turned into thinking I spill a drink only to find out I haven't even though I clearly saw it spilling and I heard it too to seeing someone walk past me just to find out noone did. Seeing imagery like me eating my own goddamned flesh just flash for a millisecond when I close my eyes for no reason or relevance and talking to myself more and more often. This night (in my country it is like midnight) I talked to myself again and got so irritated I wrote this gigantic post. I only consulted to one of my friends just to hear ""no, what, it doesn't happen to me or anyone I know, you ok?"". In my entire life nothing traumatic happened to me. I have never suffered from and mental disorder - if you don't count me talking to myself. This situation is not driving me crazy, I like talking to myself, it helps me think better (?) and not that hallucinating thing doesn't bother me much. What should I do?"
427,"I'm spiraling again, I don't know what's wrong with me (TW)","Every single time I get better, I get so motivated and excited and my confidence increases a bit and I'm working so hard to achieve my goals and improve myself, but then something gets in the way and I'm miserable. 

I don't understand why, I've been working so damn hard to build my self esteem, to self care, to watch out for myself and to love myself and now I just can't do this anymore.

I've been struggling to do my homework the past few days. All the teachers dumped the homework on the same day and it requires so much thinking. I don't have a passion, how can I come up with a passion project? I don't know what linear and non linear patterns are, I'm so fucking lost. Maybe I know but I can't remember because I'm so fucking stressed, and so damn tired. 

I achieved almost 2 months of no self harm (12 days left) and I'm trying so hard not to self harm but I really want to relieve some stress but I can't because my family members will see. 

I feel so alone and stupid and I hate myself for always falling back once I make progress. Why am I so incompetent? Why can't I finish my homework? Why am I so unmotivated and incapable of completing my tasks? I used to be able to do all of this, so why can't I now? 

I feel so worthless. Nothing I do works and I always end up back where I started."
428,"If you live in America, Good luck with affording Mental Health Perscriptions","Speaking from my own personal experiences, America doesn't care about your mental health. Do you need a new SSRI that's come out in the past 10 years that helps you a lot? How about you pay over $1,000 for it? Oops, you need that medication to save your life and don't have insurance? Sorry, here in America we don't consider mental health (or health in general) important. So I guess that just means you'll just have to go without it. Guess you'll just have to worry every day of your life about whether or not you can afford basic mental health care.

As of right now, I recommend to all of you in America to switch from your current pharmacy to Publix (or other cheap pharmacy) and get an RX card. I still can't afford Trintellix, but at least Lexapro has been around long enough to afford it. I'm so happy to have grown up in a conservative family that never got me mental health/ADHD help ever until I'm an adult so that now I can't afford it. It makes me so happy to be in a SOcIEty that belives my mental health isn't' important and that I should just ""suck it up"" and get back to work which I can't because of covid-19. :DDDDD"

I've deeply suffered from depression and social anxiety for years and years, and just prior to the lockdown was an extremely low point for me.  Since being locked down and staying at home, I've broken out of a lot of bad circular thoughts, gotten into exercise, and spent a ton of time tending to my hobby.  I really feel like this massive breakup of my daily routine has kind of restarted my entire system.  There have been some minor setbacks, but I was able to fight through them fairly quickly.

433,My mental health has gotten to a point where I need help,"Hey everyone,

TLDR BELOW

Please excuse me this is my first Reddit post I’m sorry if I put way too much unnecessary info
Alright well it’s been quite a life for me in terms of my mental health. Ever since junior year of high school I have had random unexplained bouts of depression and anxiety. I remember the first memorable feeling of bad anxiety I have ever felt was walking into gym class the first days of junior year and it was one of the most overwhelming feeling I have ever felt. Just hundreds of kids and after summer you haven’t seen them  for months. I just felt so out of place and just strange. Just starting to worry for no reason and having brain fog. Senior year is when depression really hit. Again not many external factors for this. Slowly I’m not having as much fun with my friends, I’m less funny, less interesting, less energetic. It shows but I just do my best to hide it. I guess my friends kinda noticed but it wasn’t just too obvious. After high school man shit just got even worse for my mental health. I had no fucking energy. I’m still depressed and don’t really have a plan for life. My grades and focus have just taken a hit because of my depression and fatigue. I forgot to mention keep in mind I am a weird but goofy fun loving person at heart. This really showed itself in middle school and high school without the mental health struggles. I go to community college for a bit but I’m just not doing too well. I struggle to make friends and my grades aren’t that good. The mental focus just isn’t there. I drop out of school and my parents are eventually fine with it. School just wasn’t for me. 2015 was the shittiest year of my life. The fatigue was just getting too much. My parents are getting a divorce. I’m working shit jobs at Walmart and Subway, Walmart I lasted one or two days and walked out. I couldn’t take it, I just felt like shit and walked out. Subway I tried my best but I’m just not good with food and I got fired. I’m losing that close bond with my friends. I don’t even hit them up anymore because I just feel like I don’t fit in anymore and that connection is just not the same. We’re always goofy and making fun of each other but their jokes are actually starting to get to me. 2016, 2017, 2018 are all gradually better years for me as I’m starting to get in a better situation with life and just accept that I was depressed. I started to eat healthy and I really think that helped. I still always felt different than everybody else. I’m a weird motherfucker. My thoughts are just weird but you know I just accept who I am. 2019 was the best year of my life ever since being depressed. I had two back surgeries but I had disc replacement surgery in October of 2018 and I’m finally getting back to playing sports, I’m feeling happier and more clear headed than I’ve ever felt since depressed. The one thing that I’m starting to really notice is a problem is my over active mind. But other than that I’m still doing well. I can have so many thoughts and in reality I’m just sitting somewhere doing nothing. Well the beginning of 2020 has been good but I would say a month ago I made a really bad decision. I took a hit of weed from a bong. Keep in mind weed has really fucked me up mentally before. All my friends (I have a very small group of friends) smoke weed and I first tried it when I was depressed and not having fun because I’m like hey I’m not having any fun on New Year’s Eve and everyone smokes weed now so I’m like let me just try this finally after being against it for so long. I got completely fucked up and I started feeling so sad. Time started to feel like it was in slow motion and I was just having bad thoughts. It like the weed was making my anxiety worse. Me and my friends go in my friends house so they can calm me down and then I all of a sudden start feeling like laughing and then I keep cycling between being sad and laughing. I try weed more times since then and I never get a good effect. So back to the time I took a bong hit. It was just one big hit and I got completely fucked up mentally. My thoughts were RACING and I started connecting all these thoughts together and I was thinking of so many moments that happened in my life. All while I’m just sitting there with my head down and my hands covering my eyes. Thought after thought after thought after thought. This was my mental health struggle just amplified and I was experiencing this terrible feeling. I can’t just stay in the moment. Too many thoughts distracting me and I just start to feel reality just being altered and like I just broke away from realty. Ok so fast forward to now, recently these nonstop thoughts have been ruining my life. I can’t be present or it’s just so hard to be present and just be in the now. I’m always in my fucking head. As I was driving home I was just thinking what would it be like if I committed suicide and just ended this. I wouldn’t have to experience these racing thoughts anymore. I cried and then told myself I am a fucking fighter and always have been. Then the thoughts started coming back and ruining my mood. Meanwhile I’m just sitting here driving a car home. What the fuck is wrong with me. I just wanna have normal mental health? I can’t take this anymore. Can anyone please give me advice on what to do next? There’s other things I’m leaving out or else this would be too long to read, it already is a really long read. I am suspecting I might have low testosterone but this can’t be the cause of all this? I’ve gotten my testosterone tested before when I was young and had the terrible fatigue and it was very low, talking 200 to 300 ng/dl somewhere around there. I mean I really just wanna find the root cause to all this and steps I can take right now to help. Thank you so much, this is my first reddit post so I thank you for any input you may have for me








TLDR

Mental health problems since junior year of high school

Depression and anxiety

Unexplained fatigue

I am a weird and goofy light hearted kid at heart

Over the years I am developing an over active mind and it’s ruining my ability to stay present.

Recently took a bong hit of weed and it just 
amplified all that for hours.

Now I am having really bad over active thoughts and it’s starting to really affect the quality of my life

I always feel like I’m not running optimally

Any suggestions for testing or next steps?

Possible health problems? Low testosterone, sleep problem? Vitamin or Mineral problem? Maybe it really just is a mental health problem idk? Please help god bless all of you"
434,How did you push through?,"Hi!   
I am really new here, so sorry if something's not right.  
I rarely share my thoughts or opinions on the internet (or ask questions), so here it goes...  


It's been around a year, that I don't have any excuse for not moving forward, but I still can't find the strength, reason or solution how to do that. How did you push through?  
So here is the background. I am f25 and I work in creative industry. I have quit my job a year ago because of the stress, that I couldn't handle. The best part, I have created the stress my self. I am one of those perfectionist here. I have done everything ""right"" all my life. I have been bullied at school (that made me kind shy/timid. Parent really didn't know how to help with self esteem), so I have compensated my self esteem with good grades (couldn't imagine how someone could have something less than A... yup), also my parents expressed love for this behavior, so I have mistaken love and my worth with being perfect. So perfect became normal. I missed my exploration and ""finding yourself time' train, also social life kinda died. I am at this place where anything that requires my creativity (work mostly), I just freeze or panic (can't stop crying) and I can't do anything about it. Even if it is my own project. Now there is no rules, no anything to fit my self in, to be right and to be good. I am afraid to express myself, not only to be neglected by someone, but mostly by myself. I have my ideals, but I guess I am nowhere near them and I just can't accept it. It also seems that the solution would be to explore more, just let everything flow, improvise or 'Just do it'. But just how can I be 'not productive' or do stuff that is uncertain and it might or might not bear any fruits. I just don't feel I can afford that, because I am really productivity/work oriented (tho it's what I need). 

I have had my therapy for at least two years now, I have analysed my problems back and forth, but I can't still deal with them. It is closely connected with fear. I consider myself a hard worker, but when topic hits my esteem, I  just can't move a finger and the fear rises just from one little thought. This stops me from enjoying everything, because I am neither happy neither sad (something that scares me a lot. Experienced quite a lot of downs), basically just waiting for something to happen.  


Thank you..."

437,Please someone give me a reason to get out of bed,It’s late evening where I live and I haven’t gotten up. There’s no point. I’m starting to get hungry and antsy over all the work I have to do for tomorrow but I see no point. Please help please.
438,"Have had bouts of mania, delusion and hallucinations as a child, now an adult and not sure if I should be aware of any info / do anything about it.","So basically having read some things about mental health recently, specifically with bi-polar and schizophrenia and realised I had quite a few episodes growing up as a child, which my mum always explained to me as simply being a type of nightmare that continues when you wake up.  But, that type of a nightmare doesn't exist and I was always fully concious when the bout came on, although normally at night.  I just want to know what people make of the symptoms and if you have any advice.

It would always start with me thinking about mortality and the fact I would die one day, always as I was getting ready to sleep the inevitability of death was always a major feature.  Through the whole experience I would just be thinking ""shit im gonna die, shit im gonna die"" again and again and again. 

After thinking about my mortality id start having minor visual hallucinations such as the walls warping and being too close / too far away.  If I would close my eyes to avoid looking at it I would feel an intense sensation of speed, as if I was rushing forward.  
This would then come along with a panic response, really fast heart beat and my mind moving a mile a minute, and I would become very rushed.

  I would then become convinced the only way to feel better would be to gather up soft this like blankets and towels, but no matter how many I had they always felt 'too thin', it was hard to describe but it was never enough.  Then the visual hallucinations would get worse, I'd see faces coming out of the wall, or I spent one night feeling like my room was inside of a glitch ms paint program. 

I'd normally just walk around until I felt a bit better a few hours later and just try to sleep as fast as possible.
I had the last bout when I was 16/17 and haven't had any real issues since then.  

Since then I've  smoked a fair amount of weed and used to experiment with magic mushrooms a lot and have never had any issues during or after using these drugs and even went through a simulated psychotic experience (volunteering for university research) and was fine after.

So I think I'm good, but I understand these would be fairly severe symptoms,  is there some way I should prepare myself for a potential future problem?

Edit: also apologies if I used the names in the title wrong, those just seem to describe what happened"
439,My life is central defined and unique because of my bi-polar. I accept the cursed gift of having huge emotional depths and energy. Life is short I want to dig in and really feel it while I am here get the most bang for my buck. How far out from center of lifes rolling wheel can you stand?," 

&gt;I have done many a foolish things in maniac episodes spending $2,000 in a single weekend in a year I only made $14,000. Which ended up causing me to live in my car for 6 months traveling the States from Cali to Colorado to a minor detour to Alabama. I was helping another vagabond found in Texas get to see his daughter for the first time in 3 years and making some more risky reckless decisions while there and befriended some gutter druggies and smoked fake weed and crack for the 1st time. I ended up running thru a Walmart parking lot naked trying to get into a middle aged couples RV. Where I was promptly flashed a firearm and swift kick to the face and landing head first on asphalt , lol, talk about a moment of clarity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then escorted to a mental infirmary by EMS &amp; Sheriffs where I manged to escape in about 12 hours time but only had the foam happy face shoes and hospital gown from being butt naked on arrival. Mind you its freezing out cause this was in December and I spent the next 2 and half weeks wondering around Mobile, Alabama and eventually outlaying suburbs including Sims which is where my car was. Living of what I found on the streets what some people offered and eventually to the point of stealing food and warmer cloths. Walking at night to be safe and keep my body warm and sleeping at day with the poor mans blanket the sun.  
&gt;  
&gt;All this happening while missing my 1st Christmas of my youngest son conceived in a maniac attempt to save a floundering marriage of 6 years the cause of my oldest son who was the real cause of the marriage of two unbalanced individuals who went from Hello to I do in 12 days. Getting the marriage license bought by pawning my guitar and rolling up to the local Justice of the Peace, without informing any friends or family, said the state mandated vows and I do in shorts flip-flops and a short sleeve plaid button up while she sported gym shorts and a rolling stones t-shirt topped of with a facial expression of Fear and eyes screaming WTF am I doing right before stumbling over the words I do.  
&gt;  
&gt;Just some adventures of my life induced by bi-polar disorder but my point is its me and I accept it have matured my episodes learning to damage control and come a little closer to center of the wheel of life but I have lived a dozen different lifes and I am only 31 one of the pros of being out on the edge of the wheel you cover more area of experience and began to acquire a broader perception and can see the good in pretty much anything. Enjoy your flaws that is where your greatest gifts are."
440,I worked myself through a panic attack today without medication.,"I’m sharing my hurrah because I need it today. I was on a jog and had a panic attack in the middle of the woods. I could tell it was going to be a bad one. I didn’t have water (my one thing that always calms me down, don’t know why) or my medication. Instead of screaming or making myself sick, or even calling for an ambulance, I was kind to myself. It was difficult because the panic kept trying to push through. I told my body it was safe and reminded my mind it’s Norma to be overwhelmed and anxious right now. It took half a mile of walking and self talk, but I did it. I’m proud of myself and wanted to share with you guys."

442,What's the best way to describe what it's like having depression?,"My depression has gotten severely worse over the last few days for complicated reasons. I'm desperate to speak to a counselor and hopefully that will be in a couple weeks, but I'm dyspraxic and finding it really difficult to understand what I'm feeling and find the words to describe it. I was curious to see what others say it feels like to see if I can make some sort of resemblence as to how I'm feeling.
Thanks for reading!"
443,I can’t stand anyone remotely similar to my ex,"So long story short about a year and a half ago I started going out with a boy he did some pretty horrible stuff and I don’t talk to him anymore.

The problem is I can’t stand anyone remotely similar to him. Facial features, clothing style, voice, physique, etc. I get an instant feeling of distrust and sometimes disgust.

It’s so irrational it annoys me. It honestly is instinctive and involuntary.

I haven’t told this to anyone. Not even my best friend. I feel too ashamed and dumb to do it. Those are prejudices I didn’t use to have.

How do I stop this? Is this normal?"
444,I dont know what is wrong with me.,"Like the title suggests. 
I'm 26F. I have three degrees, 2 bachelors and one post grad. Unemployed. 
And yet I dont do the things in supposed to, to get a good job. I'm required to study for competitive exams. 
I've always been an average student due to lack of hard work. 
Other than that I have certain personality flaws. Extremely impulsive. Short tempered. No patience. No self control. Lazy. Insecure. Under confident. 

I feel like my life is a waste. I dont do anything. I am not good at anything. I dont have any hobbies. There isnt anything that I like to do. I am just existing. I make up stories in my head, hoping for them to come true but never working to make them come true. I always keep myself distracted, phone or laptop. 

I realise everything. In the sense I know what in required to do, I know what will happen if I dont. I know my life will be fucking difficult if I don't make something of it. Trust me, I know, see and realise everything  but still I dont ""do"" anything that I'm supposed to. I waste my time a lot.

When I do try, I always do something to sabotage my progress. 
Over the years I have taken many projects in my life, but I have never completed them ever. I leave things halfway. 
I also have a habit of sabotaging my relationships, I give my partner hell, but he sticks with me. I make issues out of nothing and we fight for hours and I feel horrible later on. And the thing is I have no control over these outbursts, sort of. I really dont know the problem.
Now the clock is really ticking, and I'm scared and I'm starting to panick which is bringing out the worst in me, I still am wasting my time. 

Can anyone please suggest something? 

Also, I have read a million things online. They tell me to set small goals, and make a schedule, etc. Didnt help.

Edit: I wanted to add that at times I feel like a complete failure in life. And I sometimes do think if I could trade the remaining years of my life with someone who would do more with this time. Which reminds me, also wanted to write that I'm also extremely pessimistic."
445,Finally opened up to my parents,"I've been back at my parents house for about a month now. They already new I was finding uni and stuff a little difficult but not to anywhere near the full extent.

Today I broke down crying in my room and then I went to talk to my mum. I told her I hadn't been to uni in months and was very far behind. I told her part of the reason I had been delaying applying for accomodation and everything was because I am worried and have no idea what will be happening next year (will I be resitting? Will I be kicked out? Will I be continuing? Should I take a year out?). She said she had suspected I was doing worse than I was showing and we hugged.

Then we decided me and my dad should go for a bike ride on saturday (I've left the house twice in about 4 weeks both times I just went into the garden for a little bit) so we proposed it to my dad and I gave him a brief explanation of how I wasn't doing good.

Then they both prayed for me (which I'm fine with, I'm a Christian myself).

I'm so lucky to have such caring parents. Part of the reason I find it difficult to talk to them about my problems is because my family and home is like my safe space so I don't want to bring anything negative in incase it destroys the good. I have to learn that the good helps fight against the bad."

447,I’m stuck in the past and I don’t how to get out?,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old female and let me give you some background information about my past. So high school was a living hell for me. I was a shitty person as well as a hot mess. I was really mean to a lot of my friends and I was super abusive as well. During high school I was in a relationship with a guy. We were both horrible to each other. We would break up get back together and he would sexually touch me when I didn’t ask him too. I would also verbally abuse him too. I also had horrible grades in high school I never did any of my work. I was bullied a lot all throughout school. After I graduated high school I left that all behind me. I changed a lot as a person. I got a job that I really love working with animals. I started to go to college and making really good grades. I have a 3.5 gpa now. I left the guy I was dating and 8 months later I started dating someone else. My current relationship is great we get along super well both very happy in the relationship. It feels like a real relationship. I love him very much, he’s showed me how to live a beautiful life. I also cut off my toxic friendships from high school. Their pretty pissed at me for it, but I’m really glad their gone. I feel weight lifted off of me. One of my old friends and my Ex bf are going around spreading rumors about me saying stuff that I never did/said. Not all my friendships in high school were toxic. Some of my friends we just drifted apart, because we had not a whole lot in common anymore. I still love them dearly haven’t talked to them in a really long time. I’m still really good friends with one girl. We have a lot in common and we been friends since middle school. She’s super sweet we hangout a good amount. Life has gotten better after high school. Just one thing is I can’t let the past go. I’m obsessed with thinking about the past. I think about it all the time. I get flash backs of things I did that were horrible or horrible things that happened to me. I’m so embarrassed in myself, because of it. It makes me extremely depressed, even having thoughts of hurting myself. Every time see someone from my past out in public I get really nervous, because they will remember from what I was like back then. I feel very guilty in what I have done to people in high school. I hate myself for my past I knew I was a asshole back then. I don’t know whats wrong with me. I work on myself all the time. I’m in therapy right know, but had to stop due to quarantine. I really want to work in the mental health felid in the future and help teens. I’m just scared I won’t be able to handle it, because once I hear something similar about my past I get all shaken up about it. I don’t know what to do?"
448,Relapsing at its finest,"As a little background information, I'm a teenager and have struggled with depression, trauma and suicidal thoughts/intents for quite a few years. It's gotten a lot better in the past 2 months due to therapy and me finding passion in things again generally, but recently everything just collapsed. I'm aware that this happens and relapses are normal so I was sort of prepared for it, but now that it actually happened I just feel awful. My boyfriend broke up with me last week which really got to me, it still does, and now this quarantine bullshit on top gave me the rest. I've had a lot of thoughts on self-harm again and even suicide, especially at night when I can't fall asleep.  I didn't do anything because I'm afraid to be sent to a mental hospital again and because I wanted to stop hurting myself, but every time the urge gets stronger and I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried all the coping mechanisms my therapist has told me but nothing seems to work. At this point I'm so mentally unstable, I can barely get myself to get out of bed anymore at all. On top of that, I'm stuck at home with my mother who treats me like shit most of the time. She's been very emotionally abusive in the past and she starts yelling at me a lot now for the smallest things. I don't know what I could do anymore, I feel helpless. I've lost my purpose in life entirely. I know it's probably just another relapse, I've had those before, but I'm tired of hearing ""It gets better."" I just want to feel okay and be able to enjoy life like everyone tells me I should.    
I don't know what to do anymore with myself. I hate turning to the internet with my problems since I feel like I'm exposing myself and everyone I know and not know will see this, but I can't take it anymore. I'm struggling more and more every day. I was hoping to find some advice or recommandations on what I could do from other people. I'd be really grateful for that and just overall, I thank anyone who took their time to even read this, it means a lot to me."
449,"I’m 19, suffering from depression, Bipolar disorder, ADHD and Asthma. I’m unemployed, and I want to earn money but I can’t find the energy to make the steps to get a job.","I want to get a job, but I fee like there’s something blocking me from doing it. Since this coronavirus epidemic the job market got killed and I really want to make money however I can. I’m also in college doing the online classes since we’re quarantined. 

To the outside I have a really good life! I have two loving parents a relatively big house compared to the rest of society. We go on vacations every couple months, my parents pay for my college. I’m basically coddled. I grew up in a “somewhat rich” neighborhood. Also I’m white, so I have what people call white privilege. So I can get away with a lot of things that other people that aren’t white normally don’t get away with. 

I have a beautiful, kind, and caring girlfriend who also has a job and lives a little bit less than a half hour from me and my school. I should have every reason NOT to be depressed, unmotivated, and anxious to even get out of bed, do my school work, and find a job. 

Yet here’s another thing I haven’t told you. I have a history of drug abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
I have abused marijuana, LSD, I’ve done cocaine twice, I’ve drank alcohol in excess, I regularly vape nicotine in the form of Juul / Disposables. I abused adderall in the past, and I’ve abused Klonopin. 

I also don’t have a solid sleep schedule. I never go to sleep at the same time every night and when I wake up the times I wake up varies as well. I barely eat, I barely drink enough water, I’m 5’11 152Lbs. 

I’m constantly on edge, whenever my parents try to talk to me I always feel annoyed even if I wasn’t annoyed before they started talking to me. I’m quick to anger and as of recently I’ve been having thoughts of self harm, hopelessness, lack of enjoyment of my favorite videogames etc. I’ve also been having suicidal thoughts. I thought it all out completely, like how I’d do it and all the different ways I could do it. I even thought up a suicide note and everything. Usually when those things happen, I just sit in my room, listen to sad music and further compress the problem. But I never actually go through with suicide because I know how much pain it would bring to everyone who loved me. 

But with that being said, it doesn’t stop those thoughts from ruining every day of my life. Deep down there’s a part of me that knows I don’t want to die. I just want this anguish to cease. 

How do I find the strength to pull myself out of this hole of depression before these thoughts consume me entirely ?"

451,Can someone explain this for me?,"I'm 22M, I dont really know why this happens but it seems every year I end up getting extremely depressed like thinking my life is worthless. I feel like it's always work related too like its normally whenever I'm at a job for a year it seems I start getting tired of it and go in a spiral of depression.

I'm currently in that stage now, I recently got promoted to manager in a food chain and I actually feel like it's made me be in a bad place mentally like I'm so mentally exhausted I just dont even want to speak to anyone and people are starting to pick up on it too I feel like I've lost my whole personality and I'm just stale to everyone.

I dont even know how to explain all this tbh."
452,This pandemic is making me a danger to myself,"I know how this sounds, selfish, I mean people are dying and getting sick and I know that but I just need to vent about all of this.

I’m not here to make you feel bad about me, I’m here to talk because I have no where else to go. I’m terrified, being alone isn’t good for me, I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again, I’m having multiple panic attacks a day, I’m cutting everyone off, my episodes are getting worse and occurring more than usual. I’m scared that I’m going to become a danger to my life. I’ve attempted 3 times, each time ended in a hospitalization. But I was getting better, I was taking my meds everyday, going outside, trusting people, using my coping skills, I was getting better. Than the virus hit. I’m alone all the time, I don’t have enough money to get all of my meds, I’m to anxious to even order groceries. I don’t know what to do. My therapist office is closed and don’t have a way to do it online. I’m on my last week of meds and if it’s this bad with my meds I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it without them. Anyway I’m so sorry if his was long or unimportant I just needed to let it out and also ask for help. Please help me."

454,My fear of spiders is too huge,"I saw a spider when i was searching on google images for a photoshop (almost two days ago). Not only that i had trouble sleeping at night, but i cant do daily activities (instead of videogames) beacuse of fear. After i saw it i had some type of panic attack for 10 min, after that i played a game, then the panic attack came again (this kind of pattern was reapeted and still is, I am curently shaking while writing this) people say that the best way to get rid of a fear is to face it, but I dont think i would be able to, if im thinking about something spiders come in the thought (if i have a made up story in my mind where i talk to a person they would turn in a spider). I dont have any idea if this is relevant but i have been abused. What should i do?"
455,Moving past it all.,"After suffering from depression and anxiety, being a a lot of bad relationships including one that was codependent, and going through therapy, I have done friends who give a shit about me. 

We have been friends for a couple years now and though shit hit the fan a couple times, they are still very supportive, patient with me and forgiving. I am at the point where I am starting to believe that they are *real* friend. 

Now it is getting to the point that to really move past my insecurities I have to confront my own bad habits. Though this that part of me that feels like I am going to just be abandoned is still trying to make it to the surface. I am trying to keep in mind that it will be hard, but at the other end I will be a better person. I will have my friends through this and it will all be okay."
456,How do I help a suicidal friend??,"I have had many conversations with many people where I have had to stop them doing something dangerous, but I need some advice on how I can help them better. It's just hard they say there is no point in life and I can't really disagree."

459,Is it ok to have violent thoughts?,"When someone wrongs me, I wish them pain and sadness. Like I literally imagine myself torturing them in the most brutal ways. For some people, I couldn’t care less if they died. In fact, I think I’d celebrate their deaths. I only have these thoughts on people that I really don’t like or I have conflict with. Everyone else that I’ve talked to said that it isn’t normal to have these thoughts. Am I ok?"
460,Insomia becoming worse,"It started a few months ago, it started as Just not being able to fall asleep in a normal time, then it gradually became worse, I don't know what to do, I started sometimes sending whole nights with out sleeping, it's just keeps getting worse, it started bothering me most nights, what can I do?"
461,How would you email a teacher about your mental health struggles during quarantine?,"What would you write in an email about your own mental health issues to a teacher, or to a boss if you're not in school anymore? 

Like everyone else with mental illnesses, I'm having a really hard time dealing with the quarantine. I feel like I should email my teachers and tell them that I'm struggling so they know I'm not just slacking off. If they know I'm trying to succeed, I'm guaranteed to pass with a decent grade. I just have no idea how to go about sending such an email. How would you go about saying something so personal to a teacher without going too in-depth? How can I keep them from thinking I'm just lazy?

I have a lot of trouble motivating, and that was already bad before the virus. Family is a huge issue, and it was already pretty bad before. As a result, I'm suicidal, have showered maybe once since social distancing started, and have major issues focusing and absorbing information. I'm spending more time on schoolwork than my school board said (the guideline was 9 hours per week for me, because I only have 3 classes) but I still just can't grasp the information. I know it's a problem with my anxiety, and my anxiety is higher than ever right now. Worrying about how my teachers are perceiving my poor schoolwork is keeping me up at night. I've been crying multiple times daily because of the stress. I just feel stuck, and I know I need to do something about it."
462,I've recently noticed I've been feeling empty for most of my life.,"I'm a first time redditor, I don't want to tell anyone in my personal life about this. I'm just wondering if anyone can give me an idea of it, I don't want to self diagnosis, even just a little idea i guess. 

So I came to the realisation that I've never cared about myself and most events in my life. I just need to vent to get an idea of things so sorry if it's long, i need to vent.

I genuinely can't be bothered to care about myself, more so in well being and health stuff like eating. i see no point. But I do have lots of negative things to say, only positive thing is that I can write and draw nicely. I've never had the mindset of love yourself no matter what. I've just always been meh about it. even when I was a lot younger, like since i can remember. Life has always been meh, I don't care about it, it's plain nothing to be happy about. It's not like I've had a bad life, I have great friends and family.

I've never cared about eating, I do eat but I never feel hungry really. when I was 11 or 12 I just stopped eating at school and I always tried to not eat breakfast. I was found out by my parents and I've stopped. Idk i just couldn't be bothered to eat, might have been some deep down issues as well.

If I do suddenly gain a lot of weight I'd do it again, I just can't find myself caring about what happens to me. I've always been skinny and bony and I have lots to say about my body when I think about it, nothing is really good.

I'm a 14(f) and its always been jammed into my head by adults, body positivity and shit. I don't care, I've never took in those words, I find it pointless to try to love myself when I fucking don't. Why should I care about words when I can't be bothered to care about myself. Even my own parents words, It doesn't matter to me.

In the past I've been a dumb bitch and did stupid shit. I've always had a problem with catching stuff, I flinch and turn away. when I was 13 I decided I needed to punish myself for being useless and stupid. So I took one of those small steak knifes and cut into my wrist while calling myself things, like think of all the swear words in the book and useless, that I deserved it. I only stopped because my friend noticed the scars. I lied and stopped. I fucking hate my self for that, trying to be edgy and putting down actual depressed people, god I was stupid. 

For the past few years I've been hiding in my room more and more being alone, I still talk with my friends and before this pandemic I hung out with them at school and out of school. It was fun but I still felt detached. I've been talking with them less and less. I don't want to be a bitch and bother them with my words. So I'll never tell anyone about this, I never had for years.

I'd been chatting with this guy since year 7, I tried to tell him about shit, I did in the dumbest way. I was saying how I felt like cutting my wrists, Then I realised how stupid I was being and said it was a joke. He said he knew I wouldn't do that when I did already. I never told anyone about shit after that, and we fell apart when entering high school then he suddenly moved states, before I knew this I texted him to see if he was okay. He didn't respond for months. I told myself he hated me and wanted to live his life without me so I deleted all his stuff on my phone so I couldn't bother him.

I'd rather keep this to myself. I feel uncomfortable telling people I know and I know what they'll say and those words don't do shit to me, I don't care. I never actually feel compliments, whether it be about my art or just me. Noting matters, its all not worth it in the long run.

I know what I want to do in the future, but idk how to get there if all fails and I lose everyone I'll just end it before it can get worse, but I know that will never come to that, but it's at the back of my mind.I always know that if everything fucks up I just end it before it can get worse, But i don't want to right now. I have support but support means nothing. It's just words.

I feel like everything has been on an increase since this pandemic, I feel so unmotivated to do anything, it's just going to fail but at the same time I feel like shit for not doing things right now and I'm stuck in a place hiding in my room and being alone.

I don't want to be one of those teenage girls saying their depressed but I looked up symptoms last night and I can relate to a lot of issues, things like low self esteem and self blame, as well as just not caring about myself and feeling empty most of the time. Even a little self half in the past.

sorry you had to listen to my bullshit if some even see it, but I need to vent and I idk maybe it'd be nice to have even a little idea of things, even if its not super accurate. Maybe not the best to do this on Reddit but I'm never telling any of this to the people in my life. So does it sound anything like something bad or am I being over dramatic?

also sorry if this is messy, its my first time writing everything out."
463,Have a good cry. get it all out.move on. go be happy,This is my one of my favorite quotes and it's from one of my favorite shows. I've been pretty down lately and this sometimes helps me remember that what I'm feeling is okay. Their is always a light at the end of tunnel. Even if it's a really long dark tunnel.
464,I can’t handle social media anymore. I’m such a snowflake. Should i take a break from the internet?,Okay so i have been seeing gore graphic videos ( not on purpose ) either a friend sends them to me or i’m in a groupchat and suddenly someone decides to make a smart move and send shit like that there. I can’t handle videos like that or pics. I get soo scared and realize that the world is cruel and no higher being is watching over us and i can’t comprehend what just happened at that video/pic. Anything can happen. I just don’t get how people can watch that without getting some sort of mental damage etc. It cannot be healthy.
465,I’m not sure what is going on with me,"Hello, before anyone reads this I just want to say...this isn’t as important or serious as many posts I see here. So just, I’m sorry if I waste anyone’s time! So I started therapy this year and i have session every month, for the past few sessions we’ve been trying to figure out what’s happening with me.

At first, it’s prescribed as depression, which I already guessed but go figure. The pills make me feel better, great right? Well things still aren’t right, I’m awful and school and always have been, even though I’m on depression pills I still get these “fits” of sadness. Due to some school stuff and attention issues she prescribed me with ADHD, I asked a friend who has ADHD and she said I checked all the boxes. However things don’t really feel right with me, when I go to the doctors to ask about meds they say no. They want to wait to see if the depression pills help clear the possible ADHD. Fine by me, I’m not even sure if I really have it. The doctor isn’t sure either.   
I just got off the phone with the therapist now, she says I have symptoms of bipolar disorder.   
we know I don’t have bipolar disorder, just symptoms.   


honestly I’m just so confused at this point. She says some of the symptoms and they fit with me...kinda..almost but something is off. Like whenever she says something it almost fits but not quite. Even she says that trying to find out what’s happening has been confusing.   


I will list of the things I feel here: 

crazy overwhelming feelings of boredom. Not like normal bored feelings, like crazy. I’m so bored I feel like I absolutely h a v e to do something, if I don’t do something I just keep breaking down. The thing is I just can’t do anything at the same time, I’ll have things to do put right in front of me and I just can’t. My mind just tells me no, so at these moments I just feel trapped. These moments are rare, I have to feel really bored to have them.   


Im very sensitive. Now again not just sensitive, like crazy sensitive. Its hard to know where to even start... first I’ll go with the most “destructive “  overreaction, anger. Things can get me so angry, I say stuff I don’t mean, crazy stuff. Once my brother and I got in a fight and he kept trying to walk away, I screamed that I wanted to kill him, while crying. I felt so angry I was crying pulling my hair and scratching my face, while again screaming I wanted to kill him. I love my brother though... Another time I was doing math, I kept getting all the questions wrong and I was getting so frustrated. I grabbed a pair of (thankfully dull) scissors and slammed them full force into my knee several times before just crying with frustration more. Sometimes I get highly irritated from normal things...like someone sits close to me... I can feel anger take over me. Anyways next emotion, sadness,  I can go from slightly upset to really horrible things in less than an hour. Like I’ll be sad, or just inconvenienced by something then it just escalates so far. I’ll tell myself I should run away, and it’s okay if I die. I’ll tell my parents I wanna jump out of the car. Even in 3rd grade I told myself I’d grow up to be homeless and I’d die on the streets. 

this is all I can think of for now, if I rack my brain enough I’m sure I’ll think of more words to describe what’s going on.   
This might just be so clear, maybe it’s just clear cut. I’m just really stupid and I feel like the things I’ve been described with...doesn’t fit fully.   
If anyone knows what this is please let me know."
466,i feel like im not ready to socialize and should quit internet since its really bad.,"i manage to get downvoted a lot on reddit, people call me out and call me an attention seeker. it feels like none cares in here and i should quit internet. cant comprehend anything. im too much of a fucking sensitive shit."
467,I have been on and off been struggling with my works culture. Any help would be appreciated,"I left my old job because wasn’t making money but I was happy. I got to work remote and work hours I wanted. It was a small company and relaxing. I could just work and not deal with typical office politics and all the fake ass kidding that is going on .

But I left for a company because thought would be a great place to get my sales career back on track in terms of learning and development.   I have been them top performer and I am miserable .

Sometimes I feel good but other times I have severe depression. I feel trapped and stuck because I don’t want to leave another job 

This place is very much a high school environment. Constant micro managing. A lot of fake ass kissing and people just not being genuine .  Constant “ high fives ! Way to go !!”
And managers constantly trying to motivate us with prizes and gifts.  We do games like show and tell and guess whose baby pciite for meetings. I have to constantly , even remote ,still so much forces socializing 

I need help and advice. I am struggling  and dont know what to do. Luckily remote now but still struggling with this culture here"
468,I really need help!,"My issues aren't nearly at the level of what some people here are experiencing, but I need serious help. Basically, I can't sleep. It got a lot worse during quarantine, because my day just feels so unfurfilled, when I have to go to bed, I just feel so unsatisfied with my day, and then I go like, ok maybe just browse some twitter or reddit, or watch some youtube, to make yourself feel happier, but then I get way too deep into this thought process of: c'mon if you don't watch all of it now, then when are you gonna get the time to do it? Which is a stupid thought process I know, bit my mind just doesn't work the same in this stage of conciousness where I feel like I wanna colapse of tiredness but, I keep denying that I'm tired. Then something even worse sets in, I like to call it Fear Of Insomnia Induced Insomnia or FOIII for short. It' where I basically get so afraid of not being able to sleep that I fall into a loop of trying to fall asleep, getting startled by the thought of not being able to sleep, then browsing social media to calm down, trying to fall asleep again, and it just keeps going on, and on, and on, until like 4-5 am where I am so tired I just fall asleep instantly, like if my subconciousse is taking control and saying, ok no more wasting time SLEEP NOW! 

And then, here is the payoff of this horid cycle, I wake up at like 1-2pm because I have no things to do early because it's quarantine, and lose more than half of my day, still feeling sleepy as fuck, the day just seems to breeze right past me, and oh golly oh gee it looks like it's time to sleep again! I think you're picking up on the even bigger problem here... I feel unsatisfied with my day again, I can't sleep again, and the whooooole cycle begins anew..."
469,My sister helped,"Me/Myself/I = 20F, generalized anxiety/panic attacks/ADHD/little bit of depression (IT’S A PARTY in my brain) 

TL;DR: the above-described brain freaked out when my dog ate my chocolate and my sister knew how to help me, a welcome surprise after being away at college for years.

It started when my idiot dog snuck out of the living room on the first floor during dinner. She then proceeded to go upstairs to my room (I usually close it but there was PIZZA). She took my gallon ziploc baggy of candy out of my Easter basket, took the boxes of Cadbury eggs out of the bag, then proceeded to EAT SIX WHOLE CADBURY EGGS, leaving no trace. We only caught her because we realized she was not bugging us about our pizza and I then heard her chewing through the plastic container of my dove chocolate (which she took out of the basket/bag/its unopened box). She completely ignored everything that wasn’t a large container of chocolate.

ANYWAYS, I had PLANS that got derailed. I had been eating my chocolate slowly on purpose (self restraint bc I’m allergic and addicted to it so...). This plan derailment was not good for my brain as it is described above. It could not handle being simultaneously mad and worried about the dog on top of THE PLAN being destroyed on top of the fact that I had forgotten to take one of my dinner meds on top of a stressful day of working two jobs and taking 17 credits of classes all online. 

So there was a breakdown, complete with a minor panic attack. I haven’t been home for one of these in a while but covid19, ya know. So it was a surprise when my younger sister (17) knocked and came in. She looked at me, huddled in the corner of my room with my blanket, then came and sat down by me. She asked me “would you like a hug or would that make it worse” because she knows physical contact is usually not good for me. But sometimes a girl needs a hug from her sister. She asked what was up and I explained in between breaths and tears until I got all calmed down. She asked if I needed anything.

I’ve been away at college for the better parts of 3 years and I’ve gotten so used to dealing with these brain things on my own and it was really nice to have someone know that I needed someone to sit down, ask to give me a hug, and talk to me."

471,Are Intrusive thoughts and Ruminations symptoms of Anxiety?,"My first rumination was me literally thinking “am I going crazy” “your not feeling normal” “your not normal mentally” that thought was like on blast repeat in my head for like a week then it transitioned to a scary horror movie figure that I couldn’t get out of my head and while I was going through those two things I read up a lot online about other anxiety intrusions and thoughts and I read about some people who experience anxiety attacking them and bombarding them with thoughts like “are you gay” or that your sexuality just changed all the sudden and you feel uncomfortable and know it’s not true, and that’s when my anxiety started putting thoughts like that in my head, such as “oh did you look at that guy, that makes you gay” or just other intrusions like that, and it’s honestly made me feel like not myself, I feel like my life and relationship building is on pause Rn with women because of these thoughts, I just don’t feel like my old-self and such with these thoughts and it makes it tough to talk to women like I used to! Ive been stuck on these thoughts for like a month and a half now and they seem to be decreasing in intensity but their still there! Anyone else experienced similar like things? And does it get better or do I need to see a counselor? I’m currently on Fluvoxamine 200mg as of this week since I went to a physciatrist who prescribed me with anxiety. Any advice and help is greatly appreciated! I’m a 20 year old male who has never had anxiety before in my life and this kind of thing started up in December. Thanks!"
472,i feel paranoid and im at the edge of panicing.,"i just saw a video on youtube about a NOVA explosion at night and i feel bad cause i dont want to die.

THIS CAN'T GET ANY WORSE."
473,Keep Having Irrational Thoughts During the Lockdown,"I've dealt with irrational thoughts all my life but it's so bad right now. I find I tend to get the most irrational when people tell me what to do, if I feel persecuted. 

Right now the big thing is the mask mandates that have been going out. I can't stop focusing on them, knowing that the government is telling me what to wear. I understand the need for them, I know I have to be compassionate during this time. But there's this almost primal part of my brain that tells me to lash out when people tell me to wear a mask. I've been such an asshole to people recently.

I've tried talking to myself rationally but just when I feel like I can actually wear a mask I just can't do it. I think about how I'd be helping my community, how I'd be saving lives, how it'll keep me healthy. But then my brain just goes ""Yeah, but you'd be giving into what other people are telling you and then you'd just be like everyone else. Just another freaked out idiot trying to get some bread"" I can't look like that, I won't listen to what the CDC tells me.

I'm losing friends over this, I feel isolated. It's really mixing bad with my depression. I think a lot about how I don't care if I get sick because it's not like have a future. I'm so tired of all of this, I hate my brain."
474,What's happening to me?,"I hallucinate a lot, but I don't think it can be considered as a hallucination because I know when I'm hallucinating and I know that it's not real (except on a few occasions). I've experienced auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, and they all feel like they're happening on the outside. Once I heard a C on a piano play over and over again, and it sounded as if it was coming through my ears. Once I felt a hand pat grab my back at while I layed in bed and it felt real. Once I saw this girl in my room and it looked as if I could touch her. 

Now I say this because, I did some research and thought it might be pseudo-hallucinations-- but I read into it and it said that if I was pseudo-hallucinating then I wouldn't feel like it came from the outside. You would hear something, but it wouldn't come through your ears if that makes more sense.

So what is this?"

In other news, what are places I shouldn’t cut at, just to be safe cause my body goes numb so I never know how hard I press. So I try to be safe, but there’s blood pooling on top of my wrist"
477,Hey guys. I hope you are all able to look at the positives during these rough times. Please consider checking out the link below as a little “pick me up”,"I want to start this by saying: I am NOT looking for views or anything. You don’t even have to click on the video if you don’t want to, so I copy and pasted the message from the description here to make it easier to find :) 

This video exist for two reasons.

The first one: it is important during these rough times that we think and give our best wishes to the people who are being affected by this virus the most. And if you aren’t one of them, make sure to find a way to either help or support people who are worse off than yourself. And remember no matter how bad it gets to focus on the positives...

Second: It is also important that we focus on our own mental health and take some time to breathe, get off our phones and the internet and just sit down and decompress. I encourage you to do this with me, and if it makes it more relaxing to you try listening to some music during your ten minutes as well! Remember to look after yourself, loved ones and friends during these times. And keep your head up! 

Focus on the positives and stay healthy!

478,I see no problem with killing myself once I go home.,I’ve been staying at my friends house for most of quarentine and I’m going home tonight. Usually when I have suicidal thoughts I remember that I want a family and I want a future life. But for the past few days... I don’t give a fuck. I’m ready to die. I don’t care about the future anymore. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
479,Someone please give me a sign to live...,I can’t do this anymore. I have a way out and I’m ready to take it. I’m ready to die.
480,What’s the goddamned point?,"I have been actively participating and practicing healthy coping for over 3 months. I have also put my wife through the ringer before doing so. She knows about me being bipolar and works with me to the best of her abilities. I am in the midst of breaking the habit of deleting convos between old friends for fear that she’ll see them and assume I’m trying to get fucked up again. Which I’m not. I’m working the 5th step of AA and contacting those I have wronged. Dumb pattern of behavior on my part, I know. But she won’t hear me out due to my past of lying about stupid shit. I’ve never cheated nor given another female a split second of my attention in a flirtatious way. Ever. She insists that she will begin hiding shit from me and keeping me on edge. Like that’s supposed to help me get better. Fuck it. I’m about to prove everyone right and go get hammered and stoned as shit. Fuck it all. I fucking give up."
481,Overthinking everything I say,"i just want  to get this out and tell someone about it but I don’t feel that anyone would understand what i am feeling so i am writing here maybe that would help me feel better
So since i was a child I have been always quiet around people I don’t know well because i was afraid that I would say something wrong or can be misinterpreted and that grew with me, now i am 20 years old and I always overthink anything i want to say before saying it when i talk to someone i am not so familiar with, that makes texting a colleague for example very exhausting i feel that writing few texts to someone other than my close friends drain my energy and it has gotten worse recently as i keep rethinking everything i did or said during the day and feel maybe I shouldn’t have said this or that or maybe something I said or did came as rude to other people and all of that overthinking makes me feel discomfort in my stomach and have slight shortness of breath, it started making me not able to concentrate while studying as whenever I start studying these thoughts attacks me and i loose concentration and motivation to study which makes me more anxious as my exams are in two weeks and i am wasting time"
482,I don’t think I’ll be the same after this pandemic,"So even before this pandemic happened I was dealing with my anxiety and panic attacks ( high school shit, whatever ) and I was also dealing with some insecurities iv had for a really long time. 

So here comes this pandemic and iv been lately feeling very lonely and overall miss being able to hug and just see my friends overall. It really just breaks my heart not being able to physically see them and I’m not sure how I’ll feel when it’s all over. 

I’m kinda worried about being very depressed *maybe even for weeks* about this and not being able to effectively do my school work (I’m in a decent amount of AP classes so homework is really everything; and I’m graduating next year so grades mean a alot junior year) 

Anyways I’m pretty sure when it’s all over and I go back to school *if that even happens* I’ll probably end up getting very emotional and I feel like things just won’t be the same for me 

P.S - like yea I do text and FaceTime my friends but it’s different when u physically get to see them u know ? 

All advice is welcomed"
483,An introduction,"Hello i am new as a redditor and thought perhaps I could share in this feed a poem I wrote about my own issues and the positive outcomes that I have been experiencing since I decided to take this journey of understanding and healing ..

&amp;#x200B;

 PTSD, Anxiety,  
Always trying to get the best of me,  
Subconsciously testing me,  
Thoughts of unworthiness  
Will I ever be free?  
Trapped in this Mental slavery,  
My own ghosts just won't stop  
Haunting me,  
Silent screams that no one could ever hear,  
Yet somehow I slowly begin to see,  
That it's not in control,  
My life is up to Me,  
I don't want to be famous,  
Or search out notoriety,  
I just wanna be free,  
Of the mental chains that bind me,  
Get back to a semblance  
Of normalcy,

Forgiveness if not to only free myself

And regain  control of my 

own mental health 

On my past 

I simply cannot dwell

or i will remain 

Living in  my own personal hell 

Forgive and set free 

all that is behind me"
484,Seeking support: Confused by multiple diagnoses,"(Not asking for a diagnosis - just help in coping with different ones.)

I am diagnosed with bipolar disorder, BPD and OCD. Currently my psychiatrist is also evaluating me for ADHD and OCPD. Yesterday, I saw my psychologist, and she suggested that I might have autism.

I don't think it's good to have so many diagnoses. I know they are just labels, but honestly, they're confusing. I mean, how many disorders can a person have?! The only reason I'd like a proper diagnosis is because I want the right treatment.

Has anybody been in this boat of having many different diagnoses? How do you deal with it or make sense of it?

I am wondering if I should seek a second opinion from someone new. I am just so sick of not knowing what's really wrong."
485,A question for survivors of sexual assault,[deleted]
486,do i have an eating disorder?,"hi. im a 14 year old girl and for a while now i have been struggling with my body image. i don't really think i'm fat, but i really want to be skinny. i don't have a toned body, or an hourglass figure, and i know i shouldn't be worrying about that at this age but i often compare myself to my friends with perfect bodies. 

i purposely starve myself sometimes so i could be skinnier. the most i went was for two days, and now and then i'll set a timer to fast for 24 hours. on days where i don't fast, i try my best to eat under 500 calories, but i often give up and binge. i try to purge, but it's hard, and i have a fear of someone in my house hearing me.

i don't own a scale, so i don't know for sure, but just looking at myself i don't see i lost weight. my arms, especially upper arms, are still flabby and my stomach isn't flat and i just see myself as a fat, ugly, mess.

one of the worst parts is that i can't eat properly anymore. whenever i think ""oh, whatever, fuck this."" and eat just a small thing, i feel disgusting. i automatically beat myself up, to the point where i'm in tears and telling myself i shouldve just starved. i hate the feeling of being full, not that i feel like that much anymore. i can't remember the last time i ate a full meal, it's mostly just snacks and junk food i binge on.

i dont know exactly why im like this. one factor is that all my life, my family only talked about my eating. everyday of my life my mom would tell me i need to start eating better, even when i was really young. everyday of my life my mom would threaten to send me to a hospital and get needles jabbed into me to make me ""normal."" she's calmed down a bit, but the damage is already there. i could also be like this because my friend would glamorize pro ana to me ever since we were in early elementary school, and she still does. she's recovered now, but she still talks about it with me, knowing that i struggle. often times she sends me videos on tiktok of girls bodychecking (theres a LOT of videos like that on tiktok) and ed humor. and i know the jokes are to cope, but i feel like whenever i see them, i should starve myself. it just makes me feel horrible.

this might be an eating disorder, but a lot of the times i doubt it. i'm not twig skinny,i don't have horrible side effects, and the most ive gone without eating is only 2 days. its nothing compared to anyone else with an ed."
487,A tarot card put me in a depressive episode,"So I did something stupid. I got a tarot card reading from a friend and I was extremely disappointed. For anyone who might not know tarot reading is like a psychic reading. You ask a question and they do some things with the cards and it will give you advice on what direction you should take your life. I probably shouldn’t have asked such an important question, but I’m indecisive about what to do with my life so I wanted to get a different answer outside of family. I asked about pursuing a career I’ve been thinking about and her reading was that I should not pursue this career and that I should think rationally. The career I want is one that most people consider unreliable, but I was researching and was having a glimmer of hope that it may be possible.

Most people in my life tell me not to pursue a lot of things in my life and I got tired of it so that’s mainly why I resorted to a card reading hoping for a yes. The only person that supports my dreams is my partner. 

Unfortunately I have a lot of anxiety specifically about the future so it’s very nerve wrecking to talk about careers with other people because the majority of the time they have something negative to say.

Now I’m not really superstitious, but I think it got to me because even a tarot reading said no to me. I also know nothing about this stuff so I’m not sure how to feel. To an extent I kind of believe in the power of the “universe” or whatever.

No I’m laying in bed in the dark depressed out of my mind. I can’t concentrate on my college work so I decided to type something out to make me feel slightly better."

489,My friend needs help. Now,"For the past several months, a buddy who I know through friends, and have only hung out with a handful of times several years ago, is completely losing it on Facebook.  He is making posts that don't make sense, rambling off, and then he will comment on his own posts, and I'm talking 500-600 comments from himself of more ramblings, photos, emojis, etc.  All random. He's disorganized, though processes are detached. He has also posted videos of himself driving across the country and although I can't prove it I'm suspicious there might be open containers in the car. 

I'm a physician resident, although not in psych, but I believe he is likely suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, but how can I help him when he is in another state? I've tried reaching out to family or past friends and have had no luck. I KNOW he needs mental help and I dont feel he is safe to others or himself right now.  What are my options? Who could I contact? I think hes either in Wyoming, Colorado, or Idaho?"

491,"I dont know why, but I often find myself scared to sleep.","It's hard to find an accurate way to describe it. Its not fear of sleeping itself, but of it suddenly being the next day as soon as I do. I'm not sure if it's due to some sort of anxiety or somthing else, or if I'm just screwing myself over by overthinking things.

If started a few months ago, getting really bad around january. It was making me even more exhausted than usual, and the more exhausted I was the more I was scared to sleep. Up until a few days ago i hadn't felt that way since the quarantine started. But now that schoolwork is picking up again it's back. 

I just dont know why. I feel like my brain is broken. I cant tell if it's the schedule of meetings or the idea of doing work or somthing else entirely. It's almost midnight and I'm so tired but cant sleep and I dont know what to do. I dont understand."
492,Need advice for constantly looking back and regretting my past,"Lately I’ve been finding myself thinking about things I said, did, or even thought about doing at random points in my life that I regret or wish didn’t happen. It’s been causing me a lot of anxiety and pushed me towards anxiety attacks but they come so suddenly and strongly I can’t stop them."
493,Living with bipolar II is a rollercoaster — even when things are good. Most people just don't understand.,"I try every day to be better. I try my best to be reliable and socially adept. I try with every ounce of my being to be content/happy.

My rollercoaster is one of false hope and disappointment — hypomania and depression.

So much stigma though, but who am I to blame others? Those who have not suffered as I have could not possibly understand. I wish I were so blissfully unaware of the horrors of manic depression.

For 6 long years, every single day, suicide was on my mind. Recently, things have improved drastically. Life is very difficult, but now worth living. Even still, when suicide is rarely on my mind, I understand why the suicide rate is so much higher for people like me. Life can be okay for awhile, but eventually you will remember that longing for an escape.

It's one thing to wake up without motivation and even to be anhedonic, but to be lonely on top of that is hell.

Maybe one day I will be happy and without relapse. I am still so young. Hope is the one constant I've had — the only reason I'm around.

Stay strong everyone."

i’ve also had a past of feeling out of touch with reality since i was very young hearing voices seeing things that aren’t real ect and it’s honestly messing with me as i get older because most of the time i feel like i’m in a VCR headset yk 

ik it sounds so weird, but hopefully someone can maybe understand what’s going on in my head.

thank youuu :~)"

496,My mom won't see my dads abuse,"My dad has been physically and emotionally abusive towards me since I was a child. I am now 16 and have cut him from my life by contacting child services. I go to a boarding school where I stay most of the time and on weekends or holidays my dad leaves the house and I get to stay with my mom and my brother. It seems like my mom just doesn't get why I don't want to see my father. Even though she saw me getting beat up or yelled at, she denies it being abusive. Everytime I tell her that it's not normal for a father to be violent towards their child under any circumstances and that none of my friends or people that I've reached out to think that I deserve any of it, she just says that I only tell my side of the story. She says If I just behave better and that If I clean my room and just do the stuff that I'm told, he wouldn't have to yell at me. This is complete bullshit. Sure my room is messy at times or sometimes I'm a bit lazy but I'm just a normal kid. Compared to my friends or people that I know I am actually very well behaved. Nothing justifies him calling me a lazy slut, a dumb bitch or a liar. I've never had any kind of problems with my mom about any of the stuff that my dad would beat me up for so why is she using that as an excuse if she isn't even bothered by any of that stuff. She also keeps saying that it's mutual? That me and my dad are the same and that both of us are victims?  How is that fair. How can a 10 year old child having a temper tantrum justify a father hitting and slapping his child? How can me dressing the way I like justify him telling me that I look like shit. How are we both victims in that scenario. How can a teenager yelling and insulting her dad  be compared to the dad insulting and beating his teenage daughter. How can my Mom even look at him after how he treated me? I have tried to kill myself because of him, I have no self esteem, I have panic attacks and I have nightmares and PTSD from all the stuff he did to me. How I she able to still live with him and love him? She dismisses all of my pain. I hate it."
497,I’m scared to get help,"For the past 4 years I’ve felt terrible. I have no motivation and I don’t enjoy anything I used to like.  For example drawing or even playing video games are things I used to love doing but now it just feels like a chore. For the past few years the only thing I looked forward for was sleep and I would go through everyday just waiting for night so I can sleep. Only recently I’ve not even been able to get to sleep, all I think about now is how easy it would be if I could just die. 

I’ve been very stressed out lately because I’m failing two courses and if I don’t pass I can’t go on to university next year. But I’m to scared to reach out for help. I’m terrified my parents will find out how I’ve been feeling because there not that excepting and will probably be really disappointed. 

I don’t know where my life is going and I feel like I’m trapped. I feel like my only way out is to die and I would go through with is if I wasn’t scared of surviving  and everyone’s idea of me changing."
498,I'm a fucking failure,"The more I look around me, the more I see how everyone else is ahead, smarter and has much more talents and skills than I do. I can't even fucking play video games good. I'm a shitty human being who thinks he's depressed but is probably just looking for attention. Nothing is fun anymore. I just play video games just to play them. I lash out at people and don't know how to express my own emotions. I cam keep my feelings hidden, but now nobody will believe me because of how I've created this mask. My brown parents always ask me if I'm alright but if I say something is wrong I'm ungrateful. I don't even know why I'm living anymore. I was already feeling either nothing or guilt for the past year, with some random moments of happiness, and this quarantine made it worse. I've gone as far as writing a suicide note and now I feel even worse about myself. I'm sorry about this jumbled rant. I just don't know what to do. I can't schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist because of how free America is. Nor do I even trust myself because of how i always go from fine to feeling depressed and suicidal. I don't even know why I'm posting this when ranting won't make me happy. The world is probably gonna end soon anyway so who the fuck cares if I died. I'm nothing more than a shitty burden to everyone around me anyways.."
499,I have irrational fears that make it very hard for me to function around people sometimes lol,"Alright, I've have insomnia my whole life. Since I could remember I had a very hard time falling asleep And staying asleep. I would usually wake up in a panic, and be extremely terrified of either a sound or a feeling that had just jolted me awake. It's hard to explain, but I'd wake up in absolute terror and pain, and my hands and feet would be vibrating. I would often see things, either figures that looked like plants, or swirling air, even objects that weren't normally there. As I got older it just got way worse. And since my family is pretty fucked up as it is, this was normal for us. Like literally, we had haunted houses, everyone in my damn house would deal with really fucking weird shit like cups falling, lights clicking, disembodied voices and whistling and random shadow cats. So insomnia related hallucinations, completely normal for my house hold. Didn't make it any easier. So my insomnia got to the point I was terrified of sleeping, and of a specific lamp that was in my room. I was convinced the lamp was fucking with me, it would click on its own. If it was plugged in, it would turn on. Sometimes it clicked randomly, just to get your attention. Then it would click endlessly until you left the room. Which was my fucking bedroom. Family said it's just a lamp, my dad wanted the lamp safe because it was a super old lamp and was his grandma's so I wasn't allowed to move it somewhere else. So I baracaded in the corner with all my stuff. My room was a mess lol my sense of reality was so warped I couldn't tell when I was dreaming or when I was awake and I stayed up days at a time. What didn't help was the knocking on my door. It was never anyone, no one else heard it, and it would be endless. When I was awake, or asleep. My dad knew I was struggling really bad with everything so he got me animals to take care of just so I felt like I had something I needed to do. Which honestly, helped tremendously. When I had to move and sell my farm animals, I was extremely depressed. I hallucinated about people being in my room, I was obsesses with locking my door, sounds terrified me if they were too loud and it was almost painful when dogs barked or the TV was slightly too loud. Balloons cause me to panic, once I hallucinated one and it said something really fucked up on it and a heard a roar in my ear and it freaked me out. Didn't sleep for 2 days after that. A lot of shit has gone on, and I haven't had nearly as bad of sleeping issues for a couple of years. It will still happen. I'm still paranoid about sleeping, being around table lamps, and I am extremely suspicious of balloons. I watch shows on my phone with headphones as being around multiple people just makes it unbearable if it's too loud. I'm usually fine in stores but I tend to freak out if too many people are close to me or crowding a small area. Knocking or anyone messing with my door is the quickest way to terrify me. I tend to break down in my room when I get home a lot when I've been around people, or when noises have just gotten to be too much for me. I try to not flip out in public or at family as much as I used to. I draw the things I've seen. I've made characters inspired by them, and I'll never fully Express exactly what I've seen or felt, or the intensity of the hallucinations I would have Because they're just so bizarre and unbelievable. When I did actually try to explain to my Drs they would say it was for attention, or they just didn't think it was serious."

502,I’m in the military and currently on orders supporting covid19. I’m losing my mind,"i’m in the Army currently supporting this pandemic. i’ve been out here for a month and will be here for at least another month. my first week out here i was doing security at a testing site and where patients were being held. it wasn’t too bad. only thing that i really had to deal with was one patient attempting to kill herself.


now for the past few weeks i’ve been at a huge convention center that was transformed into a hospital to hold patients. seeing these patients come in has really been fucking with me. yesterday i watched an old man take his last breath as they were taking him out the ambulance. this whole situation has me beyond stressed. i’m working 12-15 hours day, 7 days a week, 0 days off. i’m not sleeping well so i’m only getting about 3 hours of rest a night. my girlfriend and i broke up a few nights ago. she said i was taking things out on her and being a jerk for not talking to her. i haven’t talked to my family in about 2 weeks. i just have no desire to talk to anyone. i don’t feel like myself right now.
i just don’t even know what to do. i just feel dull inside."
503,A mentally ill love story,"Ok. Where to start? I guess I am half venting, half looking for advice or options. This is extremely difficult to write.  
I guess I've never really connected with anybody on an emotional level, all of my relationships have been short, with me being there purely to have fun, not for love or to build a relationship. I've never wanted kids or a family. I stopped establishing relationships for a long time because I couldn't lead people on and older women seemed more leary of my 'style' of doing things.   
So one day, after a long and brutal run-up to the event, I ended up being admitted to the hospital, in the psych ward, with an initial diagnosis related to psychosis. Now I've been through a few things, but this was the most terrifying experience of my life. From my perspective, it was a horrible nightmare, with my deepest darkest fears coming to life. Without getting into details as to why, I'll just say that being locked in a cage like that, confused, scared, and alone, seemed to me a far worse fate than death.  
Shortly after arriving, I started going around in a very confused state, kind of testing things, opening doors, making noise and randomly stirring things up, while the kindly nurses kept a close eye on me to prevent problems.  
At one point, I ended up back in my assigned room, just sitting there. I have no memory of how I got there, or probably a portion of what went on after my arrival, but I was still completely freaking out inside. All of a sudden, in walks this one nurse. This one nurse... I don't know how to describe what happened next, or the order in which events took place, but it was amazing. I know I quickly made it very clear that she was very, very attractive. The conversation almost immediately became sexual in nature, but we ended up talking for what seems like hours and hours on a number of topics. She maintained eye contact almost the entire time, being very much in control and very sexy. She seemed to enjoy teasing me as I explained just how beautiful she really was. There was no clock, and she would not tell me what time it was or how long we had been there. I told her about things I've never told anybody and completely opened up to her. I could go on and on about details, but in short, I for the first time, fell completely and totally, flat on my face in love with this girl. A freakin psych nurse of all people. She was away from work for most of my stay, so I only saw her briefly in a public area before leaving.  
So now here I sit, pondering my dilemma. I've been back to the ward, and that is really what I want to do now. Obviously this has become an obsession. Last time I told the admitting nurse about her, and they still admitted me. She was nice to me, and was even my assigned nurse the last time I was there. I couldn't bring myself to talk about my obsession, to her or anybody else, it was just so nice talking to her, to hear her voice, to get lost in her eyes. I'm pretty confident a relationship cannot happen, even if she wanted it to, because of me being a patient.  
I've been doing well for a while, no more medication, and stopped going to the doctor months ago, even went on a date, but it seems like I'm slipping back.  
I can't afford therapy or counselling, and I'm not sure I want to talk about things with anybody but her. The only real option I think have right now is to check myself in and go see her, but it makes me feel like a stalker. I am also very fearful of covid-19 due to a pre-existing condition. It feels like I've been through the worst possible breakup, and somehow have to get over it, plus my mental health issues on my own. I'm not really even attracted to other women the same way anymore. Would I be taking advantage of the system by going back? Its not like its all fun and games in the psych ward, but I don't know, that's kind of why i'm trying to talk this through here I guess. Going back would mean a huge hit to the progress I've made since being out, and I don't think the benefits will outweigh the risks. I kind of wish we had never met.  
  
The devil bent my ear today  
About his magical elixir  
That would  
Make the sorrow go away  
Help me forget I'd ever met you  
Give me  
A baker's dozen please  
Wrap me up to go away"
504,I’m a fuck up,I feel like such a fuck up. I dropped out of school. I’m addicted to morphine. I just had a break up with the girl of my dreams. I know that death isn’t supposed to be an option but I really really want to hang myself or cut open my rist. No one has asked me if I’m ok I only get people who tell me to kill myself. Just because I’m a damaged kid doesn’t mean I don’t have feelings. No one sees that so I’ve started to believe that my feelings aren’t real. I feel like nothin is real. People shun me cause I’m different. I have strong urges to go out in public and just let loose with an assault rifle. I keep telling myself that these feelings aren’t normal and I need to stop but the voices won’t shut up. Why can’t I just be normal. I want people to like me. To ask how I’m doing every now and then but no one cares for me. I just want to fucking die. Why do I have to exist. Wish my mom didn’t miss the bus to the abortion clinic.
505,A (26M) that struggles with self worth.,"So I am twenty six years of age, and I'm making this post in an attempt to reach out on the internet since I feel utterly alone right now.

I will try to include as much relevant information as I can because I want an actual solution, not just to complain about my life.

For as long as I can remember ice always had this feeling of being ""overlooked"" by friends, and family.
I already know theres nothing ""special"" about me, and I'd rather not entertain any falsehoods.

Within my childhood I was the middle kid growing up. My two siblings and I are four years apart, so i always felt like I couldn't be around my older brother because of the route he chose, and my younger brother because I didn't know how to connect with him. 

There were various factors that contributed to me feeling this way at an early age. I was the quiet nerd who felt like I was always an inconvenience to others due to me being viewed as a tag along with most.

I stuck to video games and virtual worlds because I could be someone else, even if it wasn't real I felt like I mattered. (I.G. World of Warcraft guild) 

When I was growing up I was surrounded by black people (I myself am black) but I always felt like an outsider among my own race because they chose to focus on getting women, and running the streets while I was focused on school.

Then abruptly one summer between my freshman and sophomore year of high school, (I think this was in some way connected to my brother) the house we lived at was robbed. As a result my little brothers dad was shot with a shotgun and he thought my mother put a hit on him, and kicked us out.

Thankfully my aunt immediately moved us in so we weren't homeless. (Shes my role model, this is important later.)

So now when I moved I was then surrounded by caucasian people and it was difficult for me to adjust mainly because of my own insecurities I think.

But this was also the first time I actually had friends thanks to one person I knew. Eventually we ended up spending almost every day together and thought of each other as family.

I had more than my fair share of endless racist jokes and people poking fun at me because it was easy for them to do so. But they were my friends.. so I let it slide because they made me feel like I belonged (for the most part. )

Within my family life things were kind of like a dictatorship. 

What I mean by that is in my household you dont question or disobey your parent(s) ever.

Doing so gives them the ""right"" to traumatize you, or incite a situation where you end up losing your composure only to call everyone else in the family and tell them what you did, without mentioning what they did to cause that reaction out of you.

This has happened from about the age of eight to now, it still happens. 

Because of this, I have a plethora of oent up emotions and things that I cannot let go of because I feel like that was utterly wrong and the same way they (family) holds me to a higher standard, I do the same to them. Now the only thing g that has remained consistent with my family and ""friends"" is that they only want to speak to me when they want something and guilt teup me about how much they ""need"" it to get done when I refuse.

It makes me feel like I'm nothing more than a tool to be used until they are satisfied and it has driven me to suicidal thoughts, a few attempts and being hauled off to the psychiatric unit from my job because I couldn't take it anymore. It now leads me to believe that I have no other purpose than to serve other people and neglect myself in the process.

When that happened I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and PTSD. 

I jumped around a lot and I apologize because its difficult to keep track as I reread this.

Does anyone have potential tools, techniques, or anything to help me that doesn't involve the following;
Weed, Hydrocodone, Xanax, Cocaine, Codeine, Liquor, Beer, etc.? 

I've used all of those substances and nothing helps. 

I've also tried therapy for a brief moment, but I couldn't afford the sessions to continue.

Thanks taking time out to help, or just read.

Have a great day."

She started talking to herself tonight loudly mostly gibberish but still dark stuff staying stuff like “it’s all over I hate it stop it it doesn’t matter it’s time for bed” or just “ bullshit bullshit ” over and over, it’s only when she drinks but is this normal with heavy drinking? :("

509,"Meds help with motivation, but I have no motivation to take the meds.","Kind of funny, honestly. I wish I could give my meds to someone who actually wanted them, because I know there are huge issues with access to medications. I just don't want to take them. 

It feels so pointless. I don't even want to stop being suicidal. I don't want to get better. I don't want to put in the effort. I don't want to take the meds for nothing, so I just don't. All I want is death, and until I die I just want to sleep.

Anyways, I feel really guilty about not taking my meds because my parents think I'm taking them. They didn't work when I was taking them consistently, though, and neither have the other meds I've tried. And my therapist sucks, and I haven't been able to get another therapist. I've made no progress, so I've given up on trying. I don't give a shit anymore.

Just not looking forward to the trouble I'll be in when my parents inevitably find out I haven't been taking my meds. Oops."
510,How to tell my parents that i might have Asperger and i want to be diagnosed?,"Hi, i am a 19 M living in Vietnam where mental health care isn’t the best. I am chronically depressed and have some suicidal thought. After some researching, i find that i have some sign of a person with Asperger Syndrome but i don’t want to label myself as one just after reading some article of doing some quiz. So i want to get some professional advice from a doctor. But my parents is very controlling, so everything i do must go through them. I am afraid that if i tell them they are just going to tell it nothing or i am just making up excused for my bad behaviour or just simply blame me playing videogame, Can anyone give me any good advice on what to do?"
511,Final exams and depression,"So I currently study with a bottle of sleeping pills (anti psychotics) on my desk. I use this as motivation because the only thing I look forward to is taking them at 11 and crashing. 
Also it gives me comfort because I know that if my mental health is ever so unbearable, it’s my way out . 

Part of me wants to check myself into a psychward because it’s so hard living at home with a parent that has no idea how depressed I really am . And if they knew, they wouldn’t understand 

Fuck I feel so alone"
512,A daydream/night dream,"I'm not sure if this is normal. But often I have this dream or daydream that I'm in therapy (which I have never been to before), and the therapists tells me I have a bunch of mental health issues that I have symptoms for in real life. Depression, ADHD, and schizophrenia. And immediately 2 men drag me away out of the room and into a psych ward. And I'm crying, and screaming, and fighting. They put me in this coat that I see in movies that doesn't allow me to move my arms and holds them across my body. And they throw me into an isolation room. I give in to everything that already happens to me in real life. I start talking to myself louder, listening to the voices in my head, constantly pacing. I don't know what's wrong with me but I just want to know if anyone else was is/had experiencing/experienced anything similar."

514,I don’t fit in.,"Since I was a kid it has always seemed like any group of friends that I try to participate or join just disowns me from the start, or they choose to tolerate me but I can tell they don’t actively want to be friends with me. I have never had a friend group who will text or call and ask if I want to do anything, or ask what I’m doing. I have never really had any friends. I used to play basketball but I quit because everyone on the team made it very apparent I didn’t belong there, they were stuck up kids now that I look back on it but still. I skateboarded for a couple of years and was getting pretty good, and then that whole community just disowned me. And the stoner friends only hang out with me because they used me to smoke or to get something.. I just feel at a loss. I want some real friends for once or just someone to talk to and grow up with."
515,How do I take the next step?,"This is my first post on Reddit, so apologies if I've broken any rules or guidelines.

  
I'll try keeping this short as there's a fair bit to cover.

  
I think I've been struggling with my mental health for a while now but have always kept it suppressed and hidden from people as I feel like its never been as bad as other people have had it. It's gradually gotten worse over the last year or so after I finished my research-oriented degree at university. I've been living out of home for the last 3-4 years in a different country from my family and even though my family and I have had our ups and downs, I think being away from them has made me more likely to ignore my physical and mental health. In terms of my mental health, I and other friends have noticed that I've not been myself for almost a year and tend to get upset very quickly and easily.   


Long story short, I've upset a close friend of mine and it's made me realise how my behaviour affects people. I've finally had enough of this and am seeking help from my doctor. But the thing is, whenever I try to talk to people about this, I always end up having a breakdown and can't stop crying. How do I avoid this when I see my doctor, and what kinds of questions can I expect? I'm not even sure how to bring up this topic, like do I say ""Hey I'm depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I Googled it and think I have this diagnosis."" I mean of course not that, but I'm not sure how to prepare for this kind of conversation. I've done an online questionnaire from a trusted mental health website and I could show her the results, but again, I have no clue how to go about this. I've not even told my parents, as I come from an Asian background where mental health is not talked about often, and the one time I told them that I was feeling very sad, they brushed it off and told me to go outside instead. 

There's a lot of things that have happened over the last year, and if people want to hear about it then I can make a separate post, but **TLDR**; I've accepted that there is definitely something wrong with my mental health and I need to make a change ASAP. But I'm not sure how to go about telling my doctor any of this.

Any advice or stories of your own experience is much appreciated!"
516,My friend needs help.,My friend is currently a high school student. He's 18. He asked me if everyone's life is better off without him being alive. I tried talking to him and he gave a reason why he wanted to end it. He believes that he is a source of bad luck because the people around him seem to have the worst of luck after knowing him for a while. He told me that one of the worker at school got fired after knowing him. The worker told it's not my friend's fault but my friend believes it's because of him. And one of his friend got unfriended by his previous friends after befriending my friend. I told my friend that i know that it is not his fault people around him are having issues. I think there must be a rational reason why the people's issues appear after knowing him. I'm currently stumped and dont know how to continue convincing him to stay. He has been like this for months now. What do i need to say to get it through him that he is not the source of other people's problem and for him to stay alive?

518,My little cousin might be sexually harassing my sister? I’m scared and so confused,My sister (19) just confided in me that my cousin (m12) who we started fostering 3 years ago has been making inappropriate comments towards her. Today he took a picture on her phone of his penis. She told me he has Called her a bitch and other nasty names. He said he saw her ass and has made comments about her breast. I never in a million years would’ve thought something like this would happen. We love my cousin dearly and my dad said we will find a therapist for him but if it doesn’t work out he will be kicked out. I’m in complete shock. My sister is incredibly scared that I now have to lock our bedroom door. I don’t know what to do. I feel helpless and confused and scared myself.

519,Should I take PTO now while everyone is working from home?,"I am feeling quite burnt out lately. Been working hard since October and only to a couple days off at new year's. Was planning on taking some time off around April or May but this whole lockdown situation has made it kinda confusing. Working from home isn't that fun. I feel I'm putting more hours into doing work and being less productive.

Everyone is now working from home. I don't have kids or a family to support while obviously some colleagues do. I feel a bit guilty thinking about asking for time off. Especially since I can't go anywhere. It also seems like it might be a waste. On the flip side, it is slowing down a bit and may be a good time to take a break before things open back up and the pressure to catch up increases again.

How would you navigate this situation?"
520,Contacting someone: is it worth it?,"Continuing from my previous post, it has left me wondering, am I really getting these continuous, and at times torturous dreams because I didn’t get closure? 

This said person left my life in shambles and left without any explanation. She was my teacher whom I trusted very much. She led me down a path of self-destruction and that in-turn led to everything around me crumbling. After some time, with her “supporting” me, she completely cut me off without warning or explanation. 

So, is it worth it to get closure so that I can move on? What would I say, what would I do? Is it worth it?"

I'm a non-binary person who has been taking testosterone for almost two years now, and I've gotten to the point where I've decided to stop taking it for now. It's been a really hard decision to stop taking it, just as it was when I decided to start taking it. I have OCD and I've been debating and negotiating stopping or not in my head constantly for the past week, and before that for other extended periods of time. I've always loved singing, and have been doing it pretty much my whole life. As many of you probably know, testosterone causes your voice to drop. Being me, I love having my new low range, but I really miss having the strength in my upper range that I used to have. So I went on YouTube and looked up some vocal exercises. Then for some reason I decided it would be a good idea to go to my old YouTube channel, where I have a lot of old videos of me singing and playing bass guitar, and several with an old friend, we'll call her Jane, who I am no longer in contact with. This triggered a huge amount of anxiety in me. The way things ended with that friend was very traumatic and seeing her and hearing her on the videos made me feel really terrible. Basically when we went off to different colleges, we drifted apart even though I tried really hard to remain close, and she ended up getting sick of me and of our friendship. She didn't understand why it was so distressing to me, we had been best friends through all of high school and I cared very deeply about her. We had a lot of lead-up to things falling apart, me trying to initiate conversations with her and her seeming annoyed, busy, uninterested, etc. It got progressively worse. So one day when we both had come home for summer break, she asked if she could come over, and she broke things off with me in my driveway. She told me it creeped her out how much I cared and that I was just way too sheltered, etc., and said she talked to her parents about what had been going on and they agreed that this was the right thing to do. My parents watched out the windows as I stood there sobbing begging her not to go. I felt so fucking guilty, so upset that I had failed her as a friend. I felt so terrible that I made her feel so bad, it was the complete opposite of my intention by trying to remain close with her.

Jane was friends with my roommate from that school year that had just ended, we'll call her A, and A was friends with pretty much all of my new friends at that college. Basically they all collectively decided being friends with me was too much work, not worth it, that I was too needy. They started spreading rumors that I was doing weird stuff I wasn't doing, talking shit about me behind my back, and being nice to my face until they realized I had found out about it. And maybe I was too needy. But I always tried my hardest to be there for them. I always gave them a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to, have fun with, laugh with, anything. I didn't do anything fucked. I know maybe I wasn't the easiest person to be friends with at some points - I worried about my friends a lot and I've always suffered from extreme anxiety, worrying that they would abandon me or that they would get hurt. I know I could have done better at managing my own feelings. But on top of all that, I was closeted at the time and having grown up so sheltered, was going through a very difficult time trying to get to know myself, adjust to my new environment, and just feel okay. It was so fucking hard.

This was very traumatic to me. I had friends leave me before this point, but it never had hurt so bad, been someone so close to me, and all of my friends leaving at the same time. And I also know those friends were toxic in several ways. I did grow up pretty sheltered and I have always had an anxious attachment style. But the way things ended with Jane, the one who I saw on YouTube tonight, really hurt me deeply. This was in 2016, and it took me probably at least 2 years to stop thinking about every single day. I still think about it a lot. She was my closest friend and we have so many memories together. When she broke things off it was just so fucking painful. I felt my heart shatter into pieces. I couldn't understand why she didn't care enough to try to work on things between us. I cared so deeply about her and hoped we could be on good terms at least. I was so confused and distraught, I couldn't stop sobbing when she ended things. She had said we could be on good terms but then she blocked me on everything. I felt so broken, stupid, humiliated. I tried so hard to save our friendship but it didn't help. It still hurts so much to think about it. A couple years ago I ran into her at a concert and she pretended she didn't even see me or know me. That was really painful. I had a panic attack at the concert. Sometimes she shows up in my dreams still, and always has the upper hand.

Fast-forward back to now. I can't listen to the same music I listened to back then because it reminds me of everything that happened. Music that used to mean so much to me now stirs up too much pain to hear. Ever since then, my only close friendship/relationship has been with my partner, who I love and know that he loves me. But I've found it so hard to connect with people ever since then. I have no friends that I feel close to (besides my partner), no friends at all that weren't my partner's friends first. I have felt lonely because of this. I've also been thinking about how my decision to start taking testosterone plays into all this stuff. I started taking it in 2018 (2 years after my friend(s) left) and part of me wonders if my shame about who I was and all the things that happened in the past contributed to why I started taking it. That might be an intrusive thought, i don't know. But it's something I've been contemplating that makes me upset to think about.

I feel strongly disconnected from my past, not just the things related to my friend leaving, but in general. It's hard to explain. Like, I remember it very well, and I know that it happened, and it still hurts to think about, but it's just so different than how things are now in my life, and feels so....weird. It doesn't feel like it happened to me or in this lifetime or something, I wish I knew how to explain it better. I think I've never dealt with those feelings or trauma in a helpful way. I want to feel whole again, including my past. I've been struggling so fucking much lately with learning to accept things (including myself), had difficulty focusing, being present, and with learning how to cope with my feelings in a healthier way. It's been so fucking hard, and this quarantine has made it a lot worse because I've been trapped with my own thoughts all day. Before the quarantine I was already having a super hard time managing my constant anxiety and having panic attacks. Now I feel trapped with them.

If you're still reading, thank you so much for taking time to listen to my story, I hope it makes sense. I wanted to talk to my partner about this stuff tonight, but he's asleep and i didn't want to wake him. Besides, I already feel like I put my personal crises on him enough as it is and I know I can be exhausting to be around sometimes. I'm trying to get better at managing my feelings on my own. But I felt too upset tonight, I had to let it out somewhere and get some support.

Was I crazy for being so hurt when my friend(s) left? Am I justified in all of these feelings and thoughts? I'm really unsure how to start healing from everything that's happened. I know it has affected my current state tremendously. How do I start feeling whole again? Does anybody understand what this is like or what's going on at all?

Again, thank you so much for reading. I appreciate it so much."

526,"Ketamine infusions are working, but giving me awful nightmares","I recently started receiving ketamine infusions for my severe PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Psychosis. One of the few side effects is vivid dreaming, and mix that with my PTSD nightmares to get a truly horrifying night. The infusions can also increase psychosis in those who experience it.
Tonight I woke up from a series of very graphic and violent dreams. I felt extremely paranoid and KNEW that I wasn’t alone in the worst way. 

I’ve calmed down my nervous system enough to go back to sleep now. But I’m terrified of what nightmares I’ll have next. 

These ketamine infusions better be worth it"
527,Advise please??,"I haven’t talked to anyone about this because I’m not sure if this is normal or not. I’m young (13 F) and have been diagnosed with depression, ADD and anxiety. I went to a very bad therapist for a short amount of time and learned nothing about any of my own issues. I look up stuff from time to time but I’m never able to get a clear identification from google of how I feel. 

I feel almost crazy from time to time. Just about 10 minutes ago I made up my mind I wanted to kill myself. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. These thoughts come in except their too strong to just be random  thoughts, except I don’t feel suicidal either. It’s so hard to explain. But I feel so sure. I was just about to kill myself literally. 

This happens multiple times week with other things too. An idea pops up in my head which happens to everyone I assume, you get random thoughts you would actually never do, but my body decides to do them. I have no control. I feel blanked out. I feel empty. I feel not me like someone is controlling me but I know it’s me also but it’s not. It’s like another conscience inside of me. Sometimes I have these thoughts except I don’t remover blanking out my conscience or coming back in, almost like sleeping, you don’t remember when you sleep and when you wake up. Someone please help me. I’ll be posting this on other sub-reddits too so I can try to find the right help somewhere."
528,The miscues and delusion leading up to being hospitalized &amp; diagnosed the first time. Huge Post of personal experiences off early cerebral moments and first full blown psychotic episode.,"The official start of my psychiatric therapy career started when I was 19. Though this was the climax of complete or mostly false alignment with reality starting way before 19. Possible starting as a initial false datum and growing to a corroding steady drop ingraining into the mind a deeper path for a stream flowing in to a river finally bursting into a cascading waterfall crashing into full blown psychotic/criminal episode/spree. The initial progression to the point of even being prone to mental illness or criminal offenses most likely don't start out of any consciousness control. 

Very well and highly likely the prologue to mental illness is in certain dna, than tramatic womb/fetus state, intense birth experience, or first 3-5 years of neurological layering discord. There is scientific research that all of these stages of existence are crucial to mentality, personality, and thought structure. Infact by age 5 a vast majority of a persons mind frame is established now just firming up the details and defintion. 


 All these experiences are 95% out of a persons control. We are all given a randomized starting rolls of stats and traits (for you rpg dorks) and it is then a matter of slowly adjusting the stats and traits into areas needed and beneficial to moving through individuals set niche in a culture that is a small piece of reality. Overall sustaining a positive reality should be the goal. When dreams, goals and efforts change from sustaining happiness to inflicting pain or fear on anyone including self is when I believe psychiatric help and hospitalization is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**A extremely note worthy sidebar discussion**

*((So say there are some uncontrollable architecture in your mental structure turns out. Well, IMO thats not the real problem its being born into the right embrace of a accepting matching cultural niches support that matters the most. Fitting into a cultures general architecture of niches is a rule of thumb that has been accepted &amp; established by the powers that be as what is right and wrong for said culture. With certain obtrusion to the regular fold of the culture carry more negative meaning based on level of contradictory to cultures standards. I.e. silly vs. offensive or independent vs. heretic/infidel. 

Cultures are sometimes at major miscues with each other even polarized niches in community. A Western culture person from about any era after Christ that can see/hear things that others cant see/hear are mostly discounted as false claims or if persistently announced as real are likely locked up and experimented on to stop process and convenienced the experience is negative thus reinforce negative symptoms. While Native American &amp; African &amp; select Eastern cultures would honor the person persons ""ability/gift"" of seeing/hearing what others can't. Even looking to the more intense perceptions of altered reailty as more spiritual connected and made Shamans &amp; Priest.

  Even inside cultures there are different niches of acceptability in modern America their are people that make livings of selling books on 'how to connect to your spirit guide','open up telekinesis communication', 'kundalinai awaking'  or even direct services of communicating to the passed over and feeling energies and auras others can't see or hear but say the same thing in a state hospital and you're squaring yourself.

 Bottom line isthe context of your reality matters just as much if not more to how you operate/think.))*

&amp;#x200B;

My first sensation of bizarre cerebral &amp; reality jarring experience was at age 4 or 5 laying under my grandmothers coffee table holding my hands to my ears, which as a child/kid I enjoyed sensory deprivation without knowing it was a thing. I began asking myself under the coffee table which of these thought/voices going on up there is the real me. I never assumed that any of the internal voices weren't me . Just different levels of truth to each thought a few even mocking the obviously truer thoughts in a direct attempt to pull me away from my truth to delusional truths of me and my surroundings. Which is why I wanted to find the truest mind voicing so I could see my true reality.

&amp;#x200B;

The experience began as 2 internal voices and they would ping-pong the same question over and over ""which one is the real me?"". This picked up speed and intensity and the voicing's seemed to grow out and more different. This internal argument become incoherent to even myself but I could feel/sense the exchange even more to the point that my skin started to feel extremely tight and itchy and eventually my head was ringing with a high pitched frequency. After it was over I felt extremely tired and like I was on a different planet. I think a predestined circumstance made me more aware/vulnerable to internal monologue and over analysis most things easily to points of anxiety and delusions.

&amp;#x200B;

Another red flag I was heading to narrower niches was In 1st grade I would right 'I think' in front of every sentence I wrote. The whole year every sentence. I think I am jumping rope. I think the bee stung me. I think the color is purple. Ect. to ad nauesum. First exalted for my creativity and then faded into a nagging concern point for the teacher who eventual had a group phone call with my parents &amp; the school counselor. I was put into counselling then and through most schools I attended. Didn't go to a school 2 whole consecutive years in a row till my high school cause of always moving. Went from being considered to having a learning disability for reading in 3rd grade and put in a special program at one school then moved half way thru 3rd grade and with the help of a few months of intensive reading tutoring from previous school. I was then the top A.R. student (a program that gives points based on difficulty &amp; length of book &amp; score on book quiz)  till high school where a Jehovah witness kid took my top spot, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we established the very early pre-existing brain functioning hiccups go ahead and fast forward to 16. I start drinking and smoking weed (which I found so attractive cause of the instant relief of social anxiety and low self worth/esteem) as I progress in my party endeavors not noticing right away that weird thoughts began gaining steam in my head. Before 18 I was shooting cocaine eating xo's and xanax and anything else peeps said would get me high. Which I think all these chemicals played a cataclysmic role in the full blown psychosis &amp; treatment coming up around the bend.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 months before I was hospitalized my thoughts were already majorly out of whack with reality but I had established a niche lifestyle so that no one noticed or cared. Essentially I was thinking close family members and friends had ultra alternative lives to what I actually witnessed but could read their hints and miscues. All this was because I was part of something very important and good at whatever the mission was. Though I didn't even know if i was a good guy or bad guy just efficient for whatever team i was predisposed to be on in this vast overwhelming delusion.

&amp;#x200B;

All this didn't really matter cause I was always right there fixing to solve the problem figure it all out. Future event dates where written around my house cause I had conjured up a very accurate way of intuitive knowing all this stuff with out a shred of evidence just circumstance coincidences establishing huge concepts on pieces of trash on the ground. Sometimes following signs for hours and hours walking trying to figure out the next hint to the puzzle. I couldn't decide on anything worth crap it was November 2008 and the night of tallying election votes for Obama vs. McCain and I was so delusional I thought I was choosing the next president by which house I decided to sleep in that night my parents house meant Obama and my little studio meant McCain and I never picked a set bed kept getting up and going back and forth all night.

&amp;#x200B;

I had internal images of a secret compass appearing in my head which consisted of the analog clock numbers in a circle of a pentagram with colors in each tip of the 5 point star went from brown in top left to pink in top right to orange in bottom right and white on the bottom and then finally black on the bottom left and this compass the direction names where fixed positions. North to the 12 East to the 3 South to the 6 and West to the 9. I can even go into more obscure detail of any of these delusions but i think your getting the point none of it was rooted in actually reality. Just snapshots of half thoughts becoming my concrete internal scenario. I'd just think some new delusional thought up and know for 100% fact it was true. So these bizarre connections made and assumed their selves to the point of rapidly deteriorating choices and actions. Such as breaking into houses, churches and business because the next hint to the overall mission was right there I knew it. Also I hadn't talked to my parents in 3 months and avoided my girlfriend as much as possible thinking she was a mexican cartel arrangement. Aunt stopped by didn't remember the encounter but apparently I scared her pretty bad to the point of her telling my parents 'I think your son is lost forever he is not home and dunno if he'll ever find it again.'

&amp;#x200B;

Still evolving the theories even deeper and formulated just for sheer principle I had to kill, my very loving, no frills or bullshit honesty, and hardest working man you'll ever meet, my Father. For crimes I had just formulated siting in my house not talking to him or anyone but the t.v. for months. Very day I knew I was going to kill my dad is they day I was taken by my dad to a mental hospital I wasn't sure where we were going but thought it was perfect timing to do the evil deed particularly when he was to drop me back off and get out of truck and hug me like usual. Thank whatever powers may be because the intake specialist waived me on in after I signed admittance paper with a big smiley face taking up the whole page and babbling on how I was on a different plain of existence than my dad and everyone there with him just saying 'I know'. I was feeling like he was provoking me to do it right then in front of the doctors and staff but the tension was noticed and I was escorted and pat down and when they find my knife I proclaimed  'it's not mine, I didn't know it was there', thinking they had read my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways a lot more thought process like that for two weeks and doctors had officially diagnosed me psychosis n.o.s. which translates to we dunno but it ain't right. lol. I went back home calmer but not nearly full health. Forced to move back home to my parents and take the meds prescribed and it was two or so months of this before it started to hit me that something may have been up with how I was thinking. Then after 3 months out of hospital it snapped I had gonna fucking coo-coo for 6 months and had pre-developing thoughts to the final episode two years prior to hospitalization. The reality hurt a lot knowing I had so frantically built and believed a false world on no proof for so long and know was shell shocked from all my absurd thoughts let alone actions. Truly I actually missed the comfort of being right there onto the next clue frantic outings into the unknown to figure a way for all the nonsense to final fit together.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started the long road of recovery which looks different for every person and has unique timelines. I for one slept at least 12 hours a day for about 8 months after the snapping point and developed a ability to lay in bed even when wide awake and still be comfortable. Only words I could muster for months was 'yeah' or 'no'.  Looking back on all this I have come so far but dangerously close to similar spots."
529,Finally made friends and I'll never see them again (17M),"I spent my entire childhood having no friends, no social skills, no talents, and being socially isolated from the entire earth after being homeschooled from 7th to 10th grade. I somehow made a couple of nice friends with embarrassing social skills and was starting to feel great about myself for once in my life, and now I'll never see them in person again since we're going to be locked in our houses until at least Fall 2021 lmao"

531,My partner needs help,"TW: Mentions suicide
I’m really active here today but regardless I’m extremely worried about my partner. Or more that I don’t know what I can do. He’s having thoughts of suicide because he’s extremely overwhelmed by college and he can’t shake the feeling that he thinks he’s a failure. That or he talks about just getting in his car and leaving everyone behind.

He changed his major halfway through his last one because he wasn’t happy or interested in that major. I always support whatever decision he feels he wants to do. It’s terrible because he doesn’t seem to enjoy college ever since he started. 

Myself and his family try our best to talk to him but those feelings keep coming back too frequently or too strongly. It feels like the longer he stays the worse it gets. He has pressure from family to not quit college but he feels like he can’t go on but also that if he quits college he won’t find a good job or struggle a lot .

He’s a hard worker I just wish he knew his potential and would stop thinking low of himself. I did try suggesting counseling on campus that’s free but he didn’t like it. He said that it seems like the counselors don’t really care. I went there too and I agree. They seem like they take your issues lightly and it’s just some normal thing that’s not problematic at all. He doesn’t have insurance so finding a doctor wouldn’t be possible. I thought about the hotline but I also worry that they don’t really care either since I don’t have any experience calling them. I would appreciate it if anyone would offer any suggestions of what I could do."
532,experienced trauma and now i want to take baths all the time,"not sure what i’m really asking for, validation? advice? anyways, about a month ago i was in an extremely serious car accident and have been suffering from some bad ptsd and i’ve started seeing a therapist about it but it’s still in the beginning stages so i’m very much staying stagnant. for the last few weeks, all i’ve wanted to do is take baths? i’ve never really been a bath person and i never really found them relaxing but i started taking them to help with back pain and now it’s all i want to do. i will sometimes take 2-3 baths a day now that i’m stuck in quarantine and work from home. it’s just really comforting and relaxing and i’m not sure what to do. is this normal? should i just let it play out until i start getting better or is there something i can implement in my day to break this? advice welcomed."
533,"I live with my depressed mother, and her Mam died last week (on my birthday) and I feel she's going downhill. It's completely wearing me out.","I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to support my mother during this time. I'm completely exhausted and can barely see straight from my constant headaches. She's on anti-depressant and off work on bereavement and has been given a further 2 weeks sick. She already wants 2 more weeks as well a sher meds being extended (which was agreed with the doc she was going to start coming off).

Obviously this is already an INCREDIBLY difficult time, especially to lose a mother. She hasn't been able to see her, or the rest of our family. The funeral is in 1hr and I'm at my end at how to cope and help her.

Any advice is appreciated."
534,Rapidly shifting attitudes,"Somedays I feel like I'm on top of the world, and the very next day feel like the most worthless piece of shit that doesn't even deserve to live. 

Some days my self-confidence is through the roof, some days it's at rock bottom. I can feel empowered and self-assured one day, and weak, fragile, and sensitive the very next. 

I feel like I have little to no sense of self. I just exist and live my life, but I don't really know who I am. I know the things I don't like about myself, but I don't really have even a general idea of who I am or who I want to be. I feel like everyone perceives me so differently and there are so many masks I have to wear depending on the situation that I don't know which one is the one true ""me"". 

I can go to a therapy session and leave feeling confident and like I have a solid, steady foundation in my mental health and sense of self, but it either quickly wears off or is completely forgotten about the very next time I experience a mishap. I will feel stable sometimes but I will lose that stability so quickly and easily that I don't think I'm actually stable, just under the impression that I am.

I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I experienced a few traumas in my late teens and I'm now 21. However, even before those events, I still felt this way. I've just always felt very lost and neurotic. I'm currently looking into childhood emotional neglect and feel that it explains a lot of my home life and the way I handle (or don't know how to handle) my own emotions. I'm wondering if that's what has caused this feeling as well, or if this is just a normal experience of being human."
535,I'm just so confused right kow,"So this took me a lot of energy to end up typing and posting somewhere where people can see my username (even if this is just my alt).

Basically for a while it felt like if I were to define myself I had to define , at first,  3 different people.  Then now its 5. (I know one joined start of this year. ) 
They all have kinda mainly been inside my head up until recently.  In situations I acted ""out of character"" it was as if these parts were holding my hand and foing it for me before going back inside or so.
Recently the youngest has been coming out more fully I guess?? I completely shift into acting like a little kid that needs protecting from another person.  I physically feel way smaller and kinda roll up to replicate that I suppose.  I also talk more baby like and noticed sometimes I stutter a lot / day one word like 20 times before continuing but cant really control that. I am aware I'm not physically a little kid in the moment,  I'm aware of my relationships with people from after when I actually was that age. I'm not sure what is happening. 
This younger part kind of picked out a close friend who unfortunately lives abroad as the person she feels safest with and wants to kind of take the parenting role. Said friend is physically younger than me and here it just gets more confusing.  
The oldest &amp; newest part I can kind of feel/hear arguing with her about it. Scolding her that she should not pick someone physically younger  than us, who lives outside the country and ESPECIALLY  not without asking them first.  Which is fair enough I guess?
That oldest one also seems to have come out last night for short periods of times trying to force me to go to sleep when the youngest and me both kind of kept awake.
Then the 3 other parts are kind of just regular me and two again younger but in early and late teens.
Other than ""main me"" the other ones seem to have kind

I know I kinda switch here between saying ""I"" and ""We"". Sorry about that. I'm just not really sure how I should adress the parts as a group. 

I guess just in case some age references I guess?

Youngest(she/her): seems to  slide between kindergarten and primary school ages. I would say mainly about  5-7.

Younger teen(she/her); I think about 13-14. Has kinda been in the back lately but I can kinda sometimes feel her presence in my mind when I feel like the parts are arguing over stuff.

Older teen(she/they); 16-17 I think?? I can't pinpoint down an age really,  but from the image of them in my head they look like when I was that age.  Haven't heard or felt them a lot lately tho...

Current me(any pronouns); 18 I think? I should be... I'm just kinda here I guess

Oldest(they/he): 19-20/21, again not really able to pinpoint it down but I'm aware they're slightly older than I physically am.

As of now outside my head aside from current me the youngest has been out a lot lately. Especially when the day includes/included a lot of trauma related things that are triggering to me. Oldest only a little bit I guess trying to make sure I take care of myself because I'm really a mess lately but yeah.

I don't think there are many, if any, amnesia walls between the parts which confuses me even more.

My therapist knows they exist inside my head and the whole ""holding by my hand"" part but ever since they came out idk how to bring it up or tell her about it. Any advice?;; 1 hour appointments seem to not be enough time to build up the courage and I feel bad sending everything via emails..."
536,Physical punishment as discipline from a parent,"TW: physical abuse
emotional abuse
suicidal thoughts

I feel silly for resenting my father who has:
- struck me with a wooden stick when i was around 5 or 6. I can't remember the reason.
- slapped my cheek hard when I was 9 for refusing to go on a family trip
- called me a ""burden"" when I was 23, suicidal and refusing to talk to anyone and going out of my room.

My mother also believed in ""spare the rod, spoil the child"" kind of discipline, but she only hit me once with a plastic hanger and I recall not being scared, confident that she wouldn't really hurt me. My father, on the other hand, seemed really intent on making the punishment painful.

I am 25 now. My father has had several strokes. It affected some parts of his brain, and his judgement and emotional control isn't as good. He'd cry a lot and make really irrational decisions. Recently, he was also hospitalized because of diabetes. He has not fully recovered. We had to prep his meals and clean him up.

Every time I had to take care of him, I feel spiteful and resentful. I find him pathetic. I don't feel sorry for him. His situation doesn't make me sad (unlike when my mom was in critical condition before and I cried for days)

I also hate him for treating our mom like shit. He's verbally abusive and would always snap at her over mundane questions.

It made me think if I was traumatized by my father. However, I feel silly because it's not as bad as other abuse victims. Those were pretty much the norm in South East Asian families.

My shrink thinks this is the case. He asked me how I would feel if my father was in critical condition. My honest answer was ""relieved"". I feel like an asshole, but it's really how I feel. Maybe some complicated grief, but mostly relief.

I don't love my father, I only take care of him out of duty and because my relatives would guilt trip me for not loving him.

I feel like no one would like me for the person I am, I also don’t wanna change myself just to be liked by someone. My friends are really nice people but I don’t really wanna bother anyone i feel like i am not good enough and I ruin everything. I am really sensitive and emotional but I have been trying to be something I am not I am pretending to be cold and that I don’t give a shit but literally anything and everything makes me cry, cry till the point i pass out, I starve myself i feel like I don’t deserve food my appetite is dead. I really need help it’s getting worse inside me. Also i am not suicidal it hasn’t got to that point yet. I am trying to be okay but I really need help."
538,Please help. I don’t know what is wrong with me,"
I truly need help as I cannot stand feeling this way anymore. 

I have no idea why, but for the past 6 months, my life has just been painful as fuck. Nothing necessarily traumatic has happened, but I find myself never in a good mood, the slightest thing makes me anxious beyond belief, I throw up almost every day when I wake up due to anxiety about the day I’m about to have, I feel like I walk on egg shells when I don’t really have any reason to be. I genuinely cannot find joy in anything I do anymore. I hate it so much. Growing up, I use to be the kind of kid that hated to sit still and always wanted something to do, but now, I get anxious to the point I feel tears in my eyes over something as minor as waking up for work. I don’t get it. I can’t bring myself to do anything. I feel constantly tired. I have no idea what has caused this. I’m not diagnosed with anything but I have been struggling with anxiety for the past couple years now. I just need to get back to the person I use to be because I cannot stand feeling this way. I really need some help here."

I can’t bring it up with my mom because 1, she’ll say I’m either faking being upset because I have nothing to upset over. Or 2, say I’m too young (15y/o). I haven’t felt suicidal in years, but I’m not sober to cutting. I don’t feel safe being me."

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXdaOpl5074](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXdaOpl5074)

Lately I've felt so much pressure to keep being ""productive"", I made a video about how I feel about this.  In these weird times we've seen ourselves ""stuck"" at home and longing for a desire to feel ""fulfilled"" from home, looking for things to do and keep doing. Perhaps we can shift the conversation from how to stay productive to how to stay mentally healthy rather than put pressure on a mum homeschooling three children and having to work from home, or keep putting pressure on people just trying to keep their businesses afloat, or keep putting even more pressure on people going through depression and other mental health issues...

544,Is this okay for a parent to do?,"I'm pretty sure it isnt but my brain is trying to see the good in the situation. My mother has had a past of making threats and violent gestures towards me, liking almost punching me and threatening to get my dad to beat the fuck out of me. When I didn't want to talk to her about an issue because I was having a panic attack she started slamming my bedroom door and I had to sit on the floor outside it and get one of my friends to call the cops. Then she stopped paying for my food at college because I wouldn't talk to her because I was terrified. When I opened up about sexual abuse she was already aware ofduring an argument she forced on me  she said it never happened and didn't even care, and she never took any responsibility for anything she's done. I also. Opened up about my self harm and suicidal tendacies, she said it was all for a attention over the phone to my grandad. That's not everything she's done but its hard to talk about."
545,Effects of mentally ill mother,"Hi,

I am 26 and living with my parents.

My mother has schizophrenia and has always been emotionally cold and unavailable since i can remember. She is there physically like cooks and smiles, but has never been psychologically supportive. I cannot remember a single moment when she has asked why I was sad or how my day went. 

My father has been verbally abusive towards and treats her like a child. 

I have been feeling so immature as compared to my peers and even others who are younger. Somewhere, I feel, I have not grown mentally and emotionally regarding maturity. I have always felt disconnected at times from everyone around me. Like I do not understand anyone and vice versa. 

I am really private, closed and reticent by nature. I wouldn't say I love my parents, but yeah taking care of them is my duty which I am fulfilling. 


Does having such a family environment contribute to my state of mind ? Am I regressing ?"
546,How to get over my near crippling fear of abandonment?,"I (16M) have a deep fear of losing my close friends. 

When I was young, my dad got addicted to drugs ditched my family. My mum and my stepdad were physically and emotionally abusive, and for all of my childhood and early teenage years, my friendships had fallen apart.

Now I’ve had a pretty stable group of close friends for the past couple years. I love them to death, and I am so scared of losing them, to the point where it makes me physically sick even thinking about it. I can’t stop thinking of every worst case scenario: Them moving away, them turning against me, them finding a better friend and never speaking to me again, even them dying. 

Even someone not responding to a text quickly can make me spiral so fast. I had gotten over this fear for a little bit, but I recently had to deal with a couple suicidal friends and it reignited that fear. What made it worse is that one of those friends is someone I only know through the internet, so if something did happen there is nothing I can do to save her.

Sometimes I try to stir myself up into a fit of rage to numb my love for my friends, and therefor numb my fear of losing them, but doing this just makes me feel so guilty. A couple days ago, I cut myself for the first time in years because of this. 

Please tell me what to do, I can’t keep living like this"

548,My memory has went to S***,"Seriously. It's gotten to the point where it's became somewhat of a joke about how little I seem to retain information these days. Everything seems muffled; hazy and otherwise devoid from my mind these days. I never used to be this forgetful or aloof around reminders, consistency and little pieces of information.

With all that's going on right now I fear that my mental health is going downhill and I'll end up forgetting who I am or who my friends are."
549,"""stay strong""","Is it just me or does anyone else find that phrase to not be helpful in the slightest. I just feel like it puts a lot of pressure on people. let's say someone experienced a traumatic event in their life. If they took their own life would it mean they were any ""weaker"" than someone who tried to push through and make it out the other end? I personally don't think either scenario makes the person any weaker or stronger and I feel like it's really unhealthy to be honest because at the end of the day we all respond to emotion differently and our outcomes inevitably aren't going to be the same as someone else's outcome"
550,This week I finally realised I have a problem and I need help.,"17/M

I understand if no one wants to read this, but I’d just like to vent to feel less alone before I can get some help. Paragraphs on paragraphs get long and boring, so I’ve tried to summarise how I feel. I really want to get a diagnosis and start helping myself. I've known something isn't right with my mental health for years but brushed it off because I feel guilty and that my problems aren't bad enough, other people have it worse. I realise now I need to face this and I'd like to just put this out there as my own recognition of the start of fighting this.

\&gt; I very often feel worthless and empty in a weird way like I’ve been disconnected from something, it’s almost like a physical heaviness or weight in my head and upper body.

\&gt; I’m constantly trying to prove my own worth to myself, the only thing that give me any sense of self worth is making music, and even that is getting joyless and frustrating, for a while it’s become less and less enjoyable and I’ve become more and more critical of myself. I thought it was perfectionism or writer’s block for ages, but I genuinely just hate everything I create and never think it’s good enough which makes me delete countless hours of work. I’ve made over 500 hours of music in the last 3 years and released about 3, and most of that I hate. I constantly compare myself to my friends who also make music and who are doing undeniably better than me. They have big characters and confidence and are unapologetically them, and promote constantly on social media. I feel like an annoyance and a burden to people when I promote my music or ask someone to even give it a listen, so I keep most of it to myself. It breaks my heart because its the only thing I’ve ever felt good at and I hide it away because I feel like I hate it, and other people will hate it.

\&gt; I oversleep and sleep erratically through the day any time I can. I sometimes shiver and shake for no apparent reason. I feel tired and drained after little to no exertion. When I feel very low I neglect my hygiene and only really get out of bed to eat or use the toilet. I sleep to avoid feeling low.

\&gt; I feel little sexual desire most of the time even though I have an attractive and amazingly supportive girlfriend, who I tend to cut off when I feel especially low then feel extremely guilty about doing.

\&gt; I usually feel spaced out and sad and empty, I feel trapped in my head and my home. I'm usually alternating from rapid negative thoughts to just staring at nothing blankly, feeling heavy and low. I lose focus easily and find it hard to concentrate on things.

\&gt; At social events I’m on edge and jittery and don’t approach or talk to people unless I’m intoxicated. I have a general hatred for most people and always see the worst in people around me and humanity in general.

\&gt; I was bullied relentlessly throughout all of secondary (high) school and it’s become a blur in my memories like I’ve subconsciously tried to block it out, I’m obviously not qualified to say this for myself but I think my school experience sort of ‘traumatised’ me (for lack of a better word) in a way, it destroyed my confidence and social skills and although college built my sociability back up, I think there are lots of parts of my brain that haven’t repaired.

\&gt; I became obsessed with documenting my life and thoughts that I thought were important for a period, I now realise it was a desperate attempt to try and feel more self worth, I tried to convince myself my thoughts are important and that I could publish them or somehow release them when I die, which almost gave me some peace of mind for a few days. I still have an obsession with having a legacy/ memories of me when I’m dead so my life wasn’t meaningless, through my music, but like I said, I don’t have the confidence or self assurance to push it.

\&gt; I find it very difficult to open up emotionally to people or befriend people. I feel uncomfortable spending time with my family and have a strained relationship with them. I’m distrusting and cautious and don’t speak to people first but I’ll latch on to people and become too reliant or clingy if they show me extended kindness or friendship.

\&gt; I have subconsciously given up on happiness and begun to constantly thinking about leaving a good impression after my death.

\&gt; I punch and claw myself, I'm easily irritable and have explosive angry outbursts over minor things.

There are more and this is just the start. I’m realising that so many little problems my life are probably due to depression. I’ve felt so sad but been unable to cry for so long, and at some points wished I could cry to try and relieve some of the emotional weight, but this morning collecting all these thoughts and realising this made me completely break down, and I’m tearing up writing this now. I just want to be happier."

553,I recently learned about Childhood Emotional Neglect. I recommend checking it out,"I just wanted to be able to share this optimistic news. I was reading a cognitive behavioral health book and I realized that it wasn’t talking about the root of my issues: my childhood. So I went to google and discovered Childhood Emotional Neglect. There’s a free questionnaire online and then I bought a book called “Running On Empty” and it’s really helping. I feel validated, and reassured that I’m not crazy or overly-sensitive. I’m going to be working on recognizing and naming my feelings, and working through the feelings I pushed down throughout my childhood. If anyone has any other books or reading they’d recommend, I appreciate it too."

557,How do I start being human again?,"After a lengthy list of issues and trauma that no one has the time to read about, it's made me into some dysfunctional alien cyborg. My emotions are limited, and when I do feel something it's like I just got electrocuted, and I can't really put them out normally. My therapist told me to reference childhood, but I can't. I was hardly any better then, I just had more feelings and expressions. There's not much to take from that time, I wasnt really raised (raised by myself and the internet). Most, if not all influences around me were awful.

 
That being said, I'd like to learn how to have normal emotions/expressions. I'm usually very blank, and sometimes I laugh at stuff. I cant smile on cue or when the social context calls for it, and if its forced it's obvious because I'm a terrible actor. Learning to comfort people would be great, my therapist suggested that I think about what I would want when being comforted (from childhood to right now), but the answer is always ""Nothing"". I don't know/understand what people want, I like being left alone when I'm upset. Lastly, whatever the feeling is when you guys get gifts from loved ones. I hate those holidays/events specifically because I can't mimic that feeling and they think I hate the gift. I'm *really* tired of accidentally making people feel uncomfortable, and I want these amazing lifelong relationships that normal people have."

560,seeking advice on managing an eating disorder while living with non-understanding family,"i'm asking for ideas on how to manage my eating disorder (anorexia with purging) while living in quarantine with my family.
basically, i've struggled with an ed for years. i've received extensive treatment in the states for it, but while i've certainly improved, recent events have caused my symptoms to be severe again. my family is from an asian culture not very well-versed in mental health, and they've come a long way in trying to educate themselves, but they still don't know what to do 90% of the time. we also don't really have options for therapy.
now that i've moved back in with them and spending time with them 24/7, their lack of understanding has made much more of an impact on me and my disorder. my parents continue to do and say very triggering things, and when they ""catch"" me purging or not eating, they just tell me to ""just stop doing that."" i feel extremely isolated and defeated, and while i lack the motivation to turn my situation around completely, i am looking for ways to make things marginally more manageable.

561,I need a diagnosis but I can't get one,"I've been dealing with Anxiety, depression, stage fright, ect for many years and it seems to just continue to get worse. It's gotten to the point where my last therapist said I should drop out of high school because of my anxiety attacks. Most of this was due to my mom's awful parenting skills by saying that I ""half ass everything you do"", ""can't do anything right"", ""just overreacting and you're too sensitive"", ""you're acting like a bitch"", ""a lot of the times I just want to slap you across the face"". She never hit me unless it was spanks as a child. 

I'm a teen currently, had bully problems in middle school, caused suicidal depression and that's when all the on and off therapy began. I'd be on and off therapy due to not being able to make my appointments, they'd be too expensive, too far away, ect.

He’s heavily abusing drugs and alcohol, and refuses to change any of his lifestyle habits, I’m getting tired of trying to be there for them but then they’re not doing anything to improve their situation

Edit: when I say “I’m getting tired of trying to be there for them” I realize this sounds very selfish but this has been going on for years, and I’m under a lot of stress at work as it is and I don’t have the energy to keep playing the understanding friend who can always be there and I’m just trying to keep myself from snapping at him and making it worse.

570,Imagine saying this in response to someone who wants to die,[https://twitter.com/averaoxi/status/1251170060200280069](https://twitter.com/averaoxi/status/1251170060200280069)
571,Covid-19 communication advice,"Now that we are all at home with our significant others I think we can all agree that some new challenges have come up that we may or may not have seen coming. These could be discovering that all of a sudden this person that you love has a bad habit or talking to much, or that they may have decided that they don't like something about you. All of these situations will need to be addressed at some point if they haven't been already. Listening to someone else try to tell you something you disagree with or don't care about can be one of the most annoying, and brain numbing experiences ever, but we still need to learn how to listen to others. When I say that we need to listen its important to under stand the difference between listening and hearing. when  some one hears something all they are experiencing is the sound hitting their ear drums but they aren't actively trying to understand it, when it comes to listening thought there are still two different types. The two types of listening can be broken down to mindless or mindful listening. the first and probably most obvious would be mindless listening, which is essentially when you hear it and nod your head indicating ""aah yes of course"" when in reality your thinking about what your going to have for lunch. An example of this would be in charlie brown when they hear the teacher talking ""waam waamp wa wa"" this is exactly what mindless listening is. Mindless listening can also be lust listening to interesting parts, or only what you want to hear like if you are in an argument for example. What we should be aiming for though is MINDFUL listening where we hear their comments and interpret the and reply with a genuine comment or opinion. although there are many types of mindless listening I will be focusing on mindful listening so I can keep this as quick and sweet as possible. When we use our mindful listening we will then respond in one of a few ways the first would be that we may respond by is judging. This one can be used in a way that makes the other person feel like they have been listened to and been offered some thoughtful advice, but if done incorrectly can leave the speaker feeling put down or ignored. the proper way to respond with a judgment is to supply a positive one such as saying "" oh man that was a silly thing of me to do now that i hear it"" or ""yeah that seems like a good idea now that I think about it"". the WRONG way would be to say ""well that seems like a stupid thing to say"" although comments like this do have a place you need to be very careful not to misuse them. Prompting is the second way that you can reply, and this can be as simple as just asking what they meant by saying ""it was annoying"" and what about it was annoying. this technique will often lead the speaker to open up more about a topic, and makes them think about it them selves as well. when doing this though you need to be careful not to use any comment that can entrap, blame, or questions with only one reasonable answer. over all prompting and questioning can be a good way to talk with someone who needs advice, but you aren't quite sure what to tell them. Some times though we know exactly what to tell someone to help them out, and this can be a great situation to have knowing you can help, but you just aren't sure how to say it. when telling them its important to be sure the speaker wants advice, or if its even needed, because some people just aren't looking for answers. for the sake of this post I will combine the responses of analyzing and para phrasing into one section. when telling the speaker what you have heard and how you've interpreted be sure not to trivialize their situation, because not only will this make them frustrated it will also make them not want to talk to you. Also if you are going to give what you saw in a shortened version or how you considered it be sure that you aren't simplifying problems into black and white, because this can cause some confusion on why you believe some parts over others. the last way of replying to these and perhaps the most reassuring way is supporting them. this can be done through offering support, agreeing with them, praise, reassurance, and empathizing with them. this is usually the safest and sure fire way to help some one when they are stressed out so that they can become relaxed enough to talk about it logically. Keep in mind as we go about speaking with others that no conversation is the same and there is no flow chart that will always provide the right answer, so it relies on us to use our better judgment in the end of this all."
572,I'd love to receive some advice,"So, quick introduction. I am a 20 yo male, fit, and pretty good looking.
I always battled with myself because of my homosexuality and constant perfectionism, since I was incredibly small. I was considered very mature when compared to the others of my age, capable of the most profound thoughts, even though I wasn't happy. Growing up I faced horrible challenges. Last year was spent being an anorexic, and right now I am struggling with bulimia and addictions, apparently winning. 
I want to ask you, where do you find strength? I always lacked strength and willpower, at least regarding the things that could help me grow instead of destroying me (it takes willpower to fast for days or eat 100 calories for one week,and I am perfectly capable of doing that for months, but God forbid if I put some serious effort into doing things that would help).

I'm finally in a place in my life where I'm acknowledging that I need help. But I have no idea where to start. I feel like it's so important to find a good therapist/psychologist and I don't know what to look for or what I need. I know certain doctors have different areas of expertise. I'll start with some background so it may be easier to give advice.

I'm in the US in Maryland. I'm dealing with grief that occurred 9 years ago for which I harbor a lot of guilt (father committed suicide). I think many of my other issues may stem from this too.

About 2 years ago I was in the realm of self-harm from this due to not processing his death. I feel like this is no longer a concern. I feel as though I've made a lot of progress since then.

I suffer from anxiety that has been worsening lately. I'm also finding myself withdrawing from others even though I think I've improved so much.

I don't THINK I will need meds. I think I just need to work through these lingering thoughts and feelings, but then again I'm not so sure. Should I seek a therapist or a psychologist? Also, is a Master Level Clinician the same as a therapist? Is there a way I can know which doctors in my area have expertise with my issues? I can't find any reviews for these kinds of doctors in my area.


Tl;dr I suffer from prolonged grief, anxiety, withdrawing from people, and have a history of self harm. How can I know what kind of professional help I need?"
575,Feeling disconnected from reality sometimes,"I understand that this may be dissociation? In mainly stressful situations this happens, it's not often  such as every week or 3 weeks. It's hard to describe how I feel and what I think. It's like I question reality? Is this real? Why is reality like this? I feel quite numb and..well I don't know how to describe it. It's quick and doesn't last long. Seconds, few minutes max. Does anyone know why I do this? This this just how my mind deals with extremely stressful situations?"
576,Can someone explain/tell me how to know if you disassociate? (Mental health related),"So I have no idea if I’m “disassociating” or not, and I keep thinking I am but when I read up on it, it’s not that clear like “oh yeah I left my body and i could see my self third person” -because something like that has NEVER happened to me. (and I even want it to! I want to have an OBE) 

So the disassociation part, whenever I have conversations with my family now, I seem to get in this ‘defense-like mode’ &amp; seem to always express the negative part of things... or so my mom says I do. Which is TOTALLY not who I am. I am all about love, caring, happiness &amp; empathy, so I’d cry if I killed an ant (I have so I know I would, lol), let alone be a jerk to someone. When I am in conversation, it’s like I get so focused on “proving myself” or ‘protecting’ myself that I don’t have the immediate remembrance of my usual peaceful frame of mind. It’s like i get so heated when someone is offensive, says I’m wrong, or has an attitude. It like immediately switches me to “defend &amp; attack” mode and my frame of mind is just so focused on like ‘winning’ a conversation. Winning as in I don’t feel ‘defeated’. Or like, I walk away from the conversation with confidence, not guilt-which is usually always how it turns out bc I notice right AFTER that I like turned into a beast/totally not who I am. Like if I saw a recording of me how I act &amp; respond, I would probably never want to speak a word again. Because seeing anyone be mean or attitude-y, makes me so upset because how could someone be so cruel when we are all just ‘walking each other home’.

Anyways, what would you think this is? Disassociating? Or me just getting so caught up in what I’m ‘dealing with’ (speaking) that I can’t remember to ‘keep my cool’. 
It’s just I cannot realize in the moment that I’m acting ‘negative’/not my true self. It’s like I let anger or ‘my bully’ out and identify with it. 

It’s frustrating because I  hate to upset people yet I cannot even realize in the moment because I’m like defending myself because I’m so easily negatively affected by others thoughts, feelings, &amp; expressions!

ALSO, I’ve been shy &amp; introverted my whole life, and didn’t start speaking in school until like high school, so yes, a late bloomer. (Thanks stage fright &amp; social anxiety:) So I’ve never been good at speaking, so anything to do with talking just flares up my social anxiety so it’s already hard enough. And I’m an empath &amp; HSP so I REALLY am affected by what happens around me.

Sorry if this is a lot, I just don’t know how to put it."

579,Wondering if anyone else deals with severe pharmacophobia,"I'll try to keep this brief. I suffer from pretty severe pharmacophobia where I have panic attacks every time I have to orally take medicine or supplements.

I feel like they mock mental illnesses. I never ask of someone has an illness because that’s rude, but I don’t like them mocking if they don’t have it. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
581,How to start identifying mental problems and dealing with them?,"This is a throwaway account because I have an irrational fear of people finding my main account (although I rarely ever use reddit unless I’m posting fanart) and judging me for my posts 
(Also this post is going to be everywhere bc I currently am too anxious to properly format this to be truly readable, I’m sorry.)

I (16f) have no idea how to process my emotions. I guess process isn’t really the right word but I don’t know how else to describe it (or anything else really that’s not academics or me over-analyzing obsessive media). I don’t know how to identify my emotions, what to do with them, and how to ever go about learning the former two options. I saw someone earlier mention “childhood emotional neglect” and I went up and googled it (I went to the first result and read it but that was it) and i hit every point home! Except,,, I. Was never neglected as a kid I guess? I don’t even know if that’s the problem I’m struggling with. I second guess myself a lot and I don’t know what to do.

To start over, I’m having a lot of mental issues and I can’t identify any of it. I don’t know what’s causing it, why it’s happening, or how to stop it and it’s caused me pain for over 5 years now and I want it to stop. It’s been happening since 4th grade (so 8/9) and I guess I could blame it on my early internet access but that doesn’t give me any idea as to why I’m so messed up. I get anxious over the stupidest things (I get paranoid about my interests and things I like and will refuse to talk about them, I almost cried in the car because my mom wanted me to go in and get milk and I thought the cashier was going to mock me, literally just writing this I’m thinking of memories and things I have to do and it’s making my chest ache and hurt.) I second guess myself a lot, I don’t know!!! I don’t know how I’m suppose to know!!! I just want to stop feeling like everything I do is wrong, or that my friends who I’ve barely known for 2 months will suddenly just drop me because they don’t like my humor or me, or how I’ll fail academically and disappoint my entire financially ruined family, or how my girlfriend will leave me because I’m so horrible about opening up about who I am that she won’t want to be with me anymore. I’ve been dating her for almost half a year now and my mom doesn’t even know I’m lgbt!!!! And I’ve known since I was 12!!!!!!

I also have a horrible attention span too I think?? I often times have to doodle all OVER my papers to even focus (one time, for a state test, I redrew the entire story of undertale on every page just to focus) and I can’t sit and watch anything unless I’m eating (YouTube somehow tends to be an exception) and I’ll often sit and play games without ever noticing time (I played over 8 hours of acnh the other day and hurt myself) and even then it doesn’t feel like adhd or add but who am I to know? Maybe I’m lying! I lie a lot! I lie about really simple things! Like just now!! I didn’t hurt myself from playing acnh, I hurt my hand by reading and absorbing too much media on my phone a day after!!! And I don’t know why I have to bend the truth like that!!!

I just want to stop feeling like I’ll disappoint me and everyone around me. My mom always calls me the “genius” of our family because I like technology and I’ve made straight As my entire life. Our grandfather and my father left my family in financial ruin (we pay 500$ to the irs every month and with the virus we can barely afford the phone bill and have been cutting utilities) she often talks about how she can’t wait for me to become a wealthy and rich IT person and for her to live in my mansion with me. I know she doesn’t mean anything by it as she always says “just get me a shed out in the back and I’ll never both you” but it just. I dunno hurts I guess? I don’t even know if technology is what I wanna go into. It stresses me out because I’m getting close to graduating and I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I thought I was gonna die during my highschool years, I was so dependent on that though that I never planned for a future. 

To jump again, I’m also “”””partially disabled””””” and I put that in quotes because I don’t get any type of disability . Stuff, and half of it isn’t even diagnosed. I have walked issues and walking can become very painful for me (we think it’s flat foot? I’m not sure) and I have to go see an otolaryngologist every 5 months (aka ear doctor) due to chronic ear wax build that causes temporary hearing loss. These two things make me feel horrible, especially financially because my family can’t afford health care. My mom and I don’t have it, but my sister (20) and grandma do due to retirement and the college she attends offering it. It makes me so bad when my mom has to save up 400$ every 5 months for me to go to my specialist when she can’t even fix her rotting teeth or get new glasses. I feel like it’s my fault and I have to fix it somehow but I can’t get a job because it’s too scary. I’ll fuck up and someone will hate me. Someone will hit me, abuse me. Something will happen. And I wasn’t even bullied or hit as a kid; I was loved by everyone. They all called me so mature and smart for my age. I don’t know what they’re expecting of me, and I don’t know why they would. I’m just a stupid girl who obsesses over anime and video games to try and distract herself from her ever growing mental problems.

I’m also incredibly lazy too I guess?? I dunno. I lack motivation a lot and tend to off put everything to last minute. I take a college course and I was suppose to write an email to contact my project members on Monday. I still have to read chapters for that class. They’re all due this Monday, and that doesn’t count my other three classes. I sleep in a lot too. My friends often joke I’m “Nena” from the game Kindered Spirits on the Roof because she sleeps so often. My friends also call my the “Kiyotaka love bot” because I talk about him so much (from the danganronpa series) or the Iida Tenya one (bnha series, same thing) and I dunno. I feel bad I guess? I don’t know. I don’t. I don’t know how I’m suppose to know how to feel. No one ever told me and I wanna get better. Even if I can’t now because of money and the virus, I want to. At the very least, I want to know what’s wrong with me. Some sort of identifier. “Oh, you show symptoms of certain anxiety disorders! You might have one of those!” Or “oh! You might be showing signs of imposter syndrome!” Or some stupid shit like that. I just wanna know. Something that I can research and google and cry over. 

Tl;dr; I (16f) have growing mental problems (anxiety, fear of disappointment, probably depression idk, among other concerns) and I don’t know how to identify any of this and it’s making hard to live. I want to know some sort of inkling as to what my problems might be so I can get over it. Any advice or tips? (To identifying problems or just handling them better. Anything, please)
(I’m sorry if this was hard to read. I’m not very good at expressing what I feel or putting it into words. The only way I know how is to compare myself to fictional characters and say “lol that’s me!” I also might’ve accidentally excluded some stuff but my fingers are starting to hurt from holding my phone for a long time.)"

I take online classes for college which are really difficult. I don’t have a job anymore. I can’t really go out to get food cause my parents are on the higher risk for COVID-19. I just don’t want to live in a world like this. It sucks and I don’t want to do this for however many more months or years it could be. How is everyone else pushing themselves through this?"
585,Strugfling with life and happiness,"So i am 24 years, student and work in a store. Im not born in the cou try i live in now but i grew up here, im originaly from germany. Let me guve you guys a short backstory, it might help a little bit :
So almost all the years i have lived in here (Norway) i have been struggeling with being bullied or excluded from things because i am from germany. Were they used to litteraly call me nazi and things in the breaks or just refused to hang out with me so i had to spent alot of time alone judt because i was born i a damn country... 
This just got worse and worse for a long time, i managed to make great friends, but the problem remained and the school system here was/is alwats like it was probably a joke, or they just refused to do anything like i deserved it. This at one point got to the point of me just litteraly refusing to speak german to my parents or in general, i was just afraid of letting anyone know because the entire situation got so out of hand and i grew tired and broken. 8 years or so passed without me speaking german or anything at home or at school(i just refused it all) in order to try to protect myself from people øike those, cause i knew that noone would do anything about it, or protect those people rather then me. 

Which brings me to the point of were i started to study and work for a store called kiwi. Everything was fine. For a long time, but then i got asked to work in a store as extra help cause they needed it, so i happily sayed yes. 
At first everything was fine most of the people there were nice and humble, except that one person wjo struck me like a little douchy. He was always trying to talk like he is the shit, and everytimw a female walked by he would either just stare at their butt or walk after them a little bit to. I didnt bother doing anything with it cause i wasnt working for that store so that behaviour wasnt my problem. 
But then it happened, i thought i wouldnt have to deal with idiots like this anymore, i wasnt working those days but he just came to me and started calling me a nazi for veing german it went like this : 

Er : youre a proper nazi arnt you
Me : uhmm, no 
Er : yes your a nazi, yourw german ofc you are a nazi 

It went on like this for a while until the current assisting store manager heard it and started talking back, but he kept going as if he was almighty. The second time was me buying items : 

Er : what are you gonna do wheb you get home? 
Me : not much read and study 
There was some more but dont remember all of it
Er : youre going home to watch your filthy german things arent you

That happened when i was paying for my thing, with like 8 people standing there and lissening as i had to just pretend.... as if that was a joke. It was fucking humiliating.... both of those things happened in the stpre so everyone could lissen in.

Which bring me to NOW, where i found a job with great people, where i manaaged to actually find joy in having some people around they arr great and i have had alot of good times with them. But then we needed a new assisting store manager, and guess what he popped up. I told my boss about it, but she shruggged it off as if its nothing serious.... i litteraly cried trying to tell her and she just pretends its nothing and hires him anyway. I stopped working at the previous place because i didnt wanna have to deal with people like him. And it litteraly broke me once i heard she still picked him... i felt so worthless and i still do. 
The few people that i homd dearest just act normally and are having a good time with him, while im struggling to stay happy or get anything done... i havnt studied properly in so long because this entire situation in destroying me. I dont know what to do... i cant be mean to him and im unable to act as if i like him/forgive him, last time i did that that thing happened where he called me those things. And as it is currebtly everyone is enjpying being around him, and im afriad they will hate me or turn against and protect him. I really felt that the people i considered really good friends were it and i still do... but its breaking my heart trying to be around him or seing them enjoying him... i littrraly spent all free time in bed, or sitting somewhere because im just a mess.... i cant talk about it with them i feel because they dont wanna hear it or want take my side anyways.....
So i just sit for myself, struggling with everything and often not being able to be happy....

586,Microdosing for ADHD/depression,"Hello, my genuine inquiry regarding microdosing was removed on r/ADHD, so I’m not sure if this is completely relevant to mental health, but I’m just looking for some advice.


Have any of you guys ever tried microdosing psychedelics or similar drugs in substitution for amphetamines/methylphenidates? I currently on focalin, but I really don’t like the way stimulants seem to stifle my creativity and emotion. I’ve had no prior psychedelic or hard drug experience, just wondering if any of you had any thoughts on the microdosing trend. I’m not a huge believer in taking drugs daily anyways, but If I’m going to, I want to be aware of all the options."
587,I am obsessing over something really bad I did and my OCD makes it worse.,"So, the other day I (F26) was having pretty bad anxiety and sometimes when I feel down I kind of do things that may be harmful i.e. drink alcohol, or scroll through my boyfriends (M30) follow list and compare myself to the girls he follows. This time was different though. I was looking at his follow list and it was turning me on. He follows a bunch of hot Instagram models and I masturbated to them.

I feel like a monster because:

a) who the f goes through their boyfriends follow list and masturbates to women when they don't even identify as bi?

b) some of the girls were like 19 (I checked after) so now I feel like a pervert (I'm 26).

c) some of the models were doing sexual poses, but they weren't porn stars - I feel like I violated them.

And now my anxiety is 1 billion times worse. So there you go. I guess I'm wondering if I'm some freak of nature or if anyone has done anything similar.

P.S. I would never tell my boyfriend to stop following these girls, he can do what he wants. I shouldn't have looked through them. It kind of feels like a relapse."

I have exam anxiety, yes I know the doctor said it is treatable but I don't believe them anymore, I have it for more than four years. It's become worse every single day.
My problem is that last semester in the final exam period, I get the worst anxiety attack in my life, then I go into a depression period, that because I did very bad in the exam that I studied very well for and I totally understand the material but yes I get the anxiety attack and then I can't just concentrate and solve the exam. now I am in my last semester and with the quarantine and since we didn't take midterms exams before the quarantine, my university decided to make a final exam from at least 70 or 80.
I am freaking out because I don't know what will happen, I did one exam before quarantine and I get anxiety attack even before the exam start, and I did very bad in the exam even though the exam was very easy, I hardly pass it. 
I just want to end this semester with the least losses, I have a very good GPA and I really don't want to destroy what I work for for years, especially that I need to deal with my anxiety and my exam at the same time.
I just want some advice or any thing that can help.

591,Hey. I need desperate help.,[deleted]
592,Tired of feeling so easily overwhelmed/burned out!,"Hello everyone, and in case you are reading this, sincerely thank you for taking your time!

I am 24y old &amp; currently doing my Master's in Sustainability Sciences. Things were different in highschool, but since starting University (first my Bachelor's) and now my Master's, my mental health has suffered so much and I've come to realize, I cannot take any decisions on my own seems like.

I have pretty much academic performance anxiety, and even though I wanna find a healthy way of coping with it, I stress too much about the future (how will this exam be like in 3 months, or 6 or when I finish with my Master's?). I have finished my Bachelor's in the required time (3y), but during that time, I do not remember a single day without being anxious because of University, which led to me going to the hospital 2x due to horrible stomach pain and being in there for a couple days. My grades have always been really good so far, but my mental health not.

Now that I have started my Master's, nothing has changed. Even though some days are less stressful, I cannot stop feeling overwhelmed and even having times where depersonalization is going on. I had the initial plan of taking 1y more on my Master's and take less courses, but that doesn't make it better neither since I am not happy about the fact of taking less courses and taking longer on my Master's. I just don't know what to do since I cannot decide on taking less classes, as I would also stress over the fact that I am doing less than I am supposed to do.

Thank you so much for your time! Maybe someone can give me some advice? Going rn to therapy wouldn't be an option due to the COVID situation."
593,Locus of Control: What It Means and What We Can Infer,"Locus of Control: What It Means and What We Can Infer

By; Matt Boulay

 In my time studying the field of psychology, one of the most interesting topics I have come across is the topic of, “Locus of Control.” Coined by the behavioral psychologist Julian Rotter in 1954, this terms’ meaning is one that, once explained, most will realize they already knew it, or at least had a notion of its meaning. At its essence, locus of control is a manner of personal perception of how one perceives the world, its events, and their environments. One can have an internal or an external locus of control, meaning you view the world in terms of external causes or internal causes. An example of this is as follows; say I have an external locus of control and I get fired from my job. One way I could interpret my being fired is that it was the cause of my boss being cruel, the economy being bad, or that the company itself is not a good place to work. Notice here that all of these explanations are external causes that exist outside of one’s control. On the other side of the coin, if I get fired and I have an internal locus of control, some possible explanations I may come up with are that I was not good enough at my job, that I am lazy, or that the time I showed up late was what got me fired. Once again, take notice that these are all internal causes, supposedly within the control of oneself. 

 One of the most fascinating bits of information that I have come across in researching this topic is how having an internal locus of control could possibly have an effect on one’s overall health. In a research study done by Francesco Pagnini, Katherine Bercowitz, and Ellen Langer of Harvard University, they state, “A broad range of studies conducted over the past 50 years suggest that perceived control is an important construct to physical health and psychological well-being. When people feel that they can exert control, they demonstrate better immune responses, cardiovascular functioning, physical strength, increased longevity, increased life satisfaction, and decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms,” (Pagnini, Bercowitz, and Langer 2016). In another part of the article, the authors offer an explanation based on research as to why this may be the case; “As a result, these individuals may be more likely to adopt and maintain healthy behaviors, such as exercising, following a healthy diet, and adhering to the advice of medical professionals,” (Pagnini, Bercowitz, and Langer, 2016). It seems that, based on their research, people with an internal locus of control take more responsibility for their lives and actions and thus are able to better themselves and their health. Truly amazing.

 So which one is better to have? In my research on this problem the answer is not a clear one, as both internal and external locus of controls, when taken to the extreme, can have detrimental effects on one’s life. Imagine if, every time something happened to a person, they thought that it was mere chance or that it was entirely out of their hands. With this type of attitude, the task of bettering oneself would be absolutely impossible, as nothing is one’s fault and one is merely at the behest of the universe, a mere puppet on strings. This is also a form of narcissism in the sense that one believes that things are happening specifically for/against them, or in other words, that the world revolves around them. On the other hand, imagine if every time something happened to a person, they thought it was entirely within their control. When taking this attitude, one can once again delve into a deep form of narcissism as they feel that everything is within their control, and that all of the great things in their life are because they themselves are great. So, again I ask, which one is better? My answer is this; When viewing the world, it is important to have a humble sense of an internal locus of control. What I mean by this is that people should have a sense of personal responsibility in their lives. They need to be able to accept the outcomes of their actions as just that, the actual outcomes of their actions. If one cannot do this, then there is essentially no meaning in life because now everything is out of your control. Where the term humble comes in, however, is that one needs to have a certain level of awareness as to events that are outside of their control, so they do not drive themselves crazy by trying to fix something that they cannot, or so that they do not get lost in ideas of grandeur and think that all of the great things in their life is because of their own greatness. Achieving this level of awareness is an extremely difficult task, one that I will not even pretend to know where to start, yet it is extremely important if one hopes to live a responsible, healthy, and meaningful life.

I was just realizing I am into girls and she was beautiful and hilarious and she tried to make me laugh even though I couldn't bring myself to say anything. Some things happened with her. She wasn't the one that made everything horrible but I was in a very bad state and my mental health was very unstable and the things she did were the cherry on top the most suicidal year of my life. She broke me. 

I never really forgave her but I understand why she did those things, now when I'm in a better place. I am not mad at her anymore. but I didn't have a real crush on a girl since her. I used to get tons of crushes on boys and girls, but now I just get crushes on boys. I started thinking. what if what happened back then made my brain go ""NOPE"" and something in me stops me from falling in love with girls? I am working with a therapist and I notice a lot of problems I didn't realize stayed with me. I am just wondering. did I just stop being bisexual?  I don't think it's possible. I think I'm subconsciously repressing those feelings. but what do you think? and if you agree do you think it's permanent? because I really miss having a crush on a girl."
598,I feel empty and broken.,"Why? I dont know. But recently I cant do anything. I cant sleep, I cant concentrate. I have this constant and overwhelming feeling of nothingness. I constantly fuckup and disappoint my family and I hate it. I dont know what to do anymore, in life. Suggestions would be really helpful."
599,So totally confused,"Okay. So I’m very very confused right now. Lately I’ve been having even more trouble focusing and carrying conversations. I’ll be good for a little bit, and then I just zone out completely. It’s like everything goes blurry and dull? Like I’m seeing everything through a very crappy video screen. I can see myself doing stuff, but it’s almost like I have zero control over it. I gone to multiple doctors to see if it was something serious. So I’ve had so many tests done. However my doctor has decided that it’s nothing serious, and they can do nothing for me. They told me to try to ignore it the best I can. The problem is I can’t. I want to ignore it but it’s like there’s something in my head telling me that I need to know. Anyway, I’ve been wanting to maybe go see a physiologist? Problem is I’m 17 and my parents are not very supportive of my decision. I also did not want to google whats going on because Frankly I do not want to rely on web.m.d. So I figured I’d go on here see if anyone else has any ideas on what I should do. Any advice on how not to go completely ape until I turn 18."
600,I just found out that I’m not going back to school,"I know that it’s better to stay home, and not be around people. I know that my problems, which aren’t actual problems are minuscule to everything else that’s happening, but I’m not doing well. I’m an introvert, but I miss everything. I miss my friends and going places. I didn’t have any big plans, but I just miss being around people. So far, quarantine has been effecting me very negatively. I just spiral every single day and get way too deep in my thoughts. I don’t take care of myself and even though I’m with my family, I feel really lonely and I don’t want to talk to them. Every single day is the same thing: I do my school work, and then I stay in bed all day because I don’t have the energy or care to do anything. I don’t care about my health or anything anymore. All I wanted was to go back to school and finish the year, and now I can’t. Everything is going downhill. I just need advice, I can’t stop spiraling, I don’t take care of myself, and I’m extremely lonely."
601,Is there no way out of the mind?,[removed]
602,What should I do if I would rather kill myself than get a real job?,"I know the answer here should never be to advocate for suicide. But seriously, even with therapy and meds the idea of going back to work to support myself is quite literally intolerable?"
603,Being isolated,I think at one point this was my dream being isolated but after a few weeks it's driving me insane. I really need help but it's never been further away from me. I don't know what to do. Every day I'm moving further to thinking about just ending it.
604,Just wanna feel better,I’ve been on medication (Zoloft) for harm ocd and anxiety I had suicidal thoughts still at first while taking 25mg. I’ve just upped my does to 50mg after 5 weeks and the unwanted suicidal thoughts are coming back. Should I be worried or will they go away?? P.S. this is day 5 on 50mg
605,"Is there a difference between having schizophrenia with a bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective?","I lied to my psychologist, which said I was bipolar at the start of my sessions. This scared me, so I decided to lie and say that no, I didn't have any type of mood changes and such (I'm a good liar), he discarded that, and after a while we noticed I have schizophrenia, the weird thing is, my iq is supposed to be high, and it hasn't really decreased (which he said it would), actually, I feel like I've started to get a better grasp of myself. 

I no longer go to the psychologist, or a phyquiatrist. And it got me thinking.... It's actually quite clear that I'm bipolar, but I also seem to be schizophrenic. I know this seems like i'm self-diagnosing, but.. to be honest, i was technically already diagnosed.

I just want to know what's the difference, so that I can have a better understanding, also, going back to the psychologist is sadly a no-no, so yeah, i'm on my own.

Sorry if this offends anyone"
606,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I'm sorry if this is a stupid post. I just really need to tell this to someone and I don't have anyone who I can talk to in person. I've been having trouble lately..

First off, it's been about 3 months since people noticed that my eating habits aren't quite normal, yet I can't stop. They comment on how little I eat, but I don't think I do. However, I do think about food all the time. During lunch, I can only think about how many calories there is in what I'm eating. I don't eat anything else during the day, if I can control myself, and I almost never let myself eat over 300 calories a day. I know it's not supposed to be healthy, but I absolutely never feel hungry and I feel like I don't need more.. of course I do have a desire to lose weight though. I'm 53 kg now but I look like I have more. I think about this, about food and weight all the time and I can't stop.

That's not the only problem though. It's been a few weeks since I started having some kinds of breakdowns.. but not as in I go crazy in front of everyone. They consist of me going to my room or bathroom and crying my eyes out, hating myself and everything around me. I don't know why this is happening, I don't think I have a bad life. I have an okay family and I've never had any problems in that area, and nothing else either crosses my mind. Right before writing this post, I actually broke down crying in my bathroom for absolutely no reason.

I know probably nobody can tell me exactly what in the world is happening with me, I just needed to write this because I've gathered all my thoughts and needed to get them out somewhere. I've started noticing the eating habits because of people around me who comment about it, and my breakdowns, well, because they are getting more frequent. I can absolutely not talk to my family about this because I come from a place where mental health isn't talked about and they would just tell me to 'get it together', or look at me weirdly and say 'what's wrong with you, just be normal like everyone else, it's not that hard'. They don't mean to be rude or mean or anything, it's just that they're not used to it.. 

I'm so sorry that this post is longer than it probably should have been. I need to let this out of my system. Thank you to anyone who even bothers to read."
607,Is this a normal amount of worry/stress for a 14 year old?,[deleted]
608,This is the story of a 24 year old nurse who written a will due to COVID-19,"[Nurse’s Story](https://thepivotallifecoach.com/2020/04/17/nurses-perspective-of-covid-19/) 

Please read it and spread it to your family and friends who still have no idea of what’s happening right now."
609,Back in the hole,"Rightly or wrongly I came to the nihilistic conclusion that there is no meaning in life 10 or so years ago while in my 20s. The more I thought about it the more it cemented the idea that nothing I do will last or matter or mean anything in the long run.

I'm not sure if it caused me to feel depressed, or being depressed makes me think this way (side question: what do you think?). I managed to control things a bit and after a very low point finished last year positively and with a good outlook for 2020.

All of this covid shit has dragged me back towards my low point. It has confirmed that almost everyone's job can not happen and society will just roll on. It has confirmed that there isn't much to life really other than distracting yourself. It has confirmed to me that whether I lay in bed all day or not doesn't really matter, that all the things that everyone including myself is a facade, and that whether we die today or in 50 years doesn't mean anything.

I don't like that if I voice that my lost outlets mean something to me and has a real affect on my mental health I get shrieked at that people are dying and to put things into perspective. Ok... so my enjoyment in life doesn't matter: thanks for confirming that.

I'm not doing ok. I wasn't doing ok before, and I don't think I'll do ok.

Specifics... I live in a country town, with minimal access to mental health thingos normally let alone now, and my wife can't listen to this stuff any more. I made contact with an online service and have a call scheduled for Monday. I am only doing that for her and hold no hope personally that it'll help."
610,It feels as if I'm falling apart.,"Sorry for the bothering you all with this, but I needed it let it out. I'm (M28) tired of burdening my friends with my issues and my family doesn't understand what my mental ill-health is like. I've tried explaining it to them, but it doesn't get through. 

Over the past few years I've come to realise I have some sort of mental issue(s) that stems mostly from anxiety and feelings of hopelessness. Sometimes it feels like my entire reality is not really what I thought it to be. I've lost friends because they really weren't friends. I only added value to them
 because of what I could do for them and never just as a genuine friend. For the most part, I've stopped interacting with these people and letting them into my personal life. I can't take their behavior any longer. I was just the easy target because I'm a push over so they could take advantage of me.

Socially, I'm shit. People find me awkward, creepy and generally uncomfortable to be around. I'm pretty sure I have terrible breath and body odour, even though I take good care of my hygeine. Nowdays I rather opt out of interacting with people in general cause I really don't want to make anyone uncomfortable or forced into speaking with me.

Right now, I'm struggling. Work is a mess. I've voiced my challenges, but it feels like no one is listening because they know I'll just do the job (I take it too seriously because I genuinely enjoy helping people in my line of work). I can't leave, or, rather, I don't want to leave because I also genuinely enjoy the company I work for. However, I'm still struggling. People at work find me creepy so I don't have any colleagues that would be comfortable speaking with me. I had a friend at work, whom I helped get the role, but they quickly ditched me for others that had more social value than I do, even though I had been friends with this person since high school. 

I wanted to start therapy this year due to the fact that I had saved to pay for my own sessions, but even the psychologist I approached ghosted me. I want to get help, but I don't know where to go and no one is taking on anyone new due to what's happening right now. 

Honestly, it feels like everything is just falling apart and I'm going to implode. I don't want to. I'm scared I'll lose my job and even the few friends I still have.

Again, I'm so sorry for this, but thanks for listening.

For anyone else going through similar experiences, I hope you find the help you need and that you get through this better than I have ❤"
611,I can't even starve myself right.,"Feeling so much lately that I can't do anything right. I can't complete school work, finding a job is miserable, I have absolutely no positive body image. I so badly want to lose weight and look good but I have no motivation and can't maintain healthy habits. I tried one eating 2 meals a day today yet all I can do is eat. I didn't stick to my goal of working out every day. 

Just needed to rant. Thanks for reading."
612,Arabic info about how to deal with mania,"Hi, I have a friend who is experiencing manic episodes due to family pressures. Her parents keep asking me what’s wrong with her but there is a huge language barrier. Can someone send me a link or video that is in the Arabic language about how to calm someone down when they are having a lot of panic or mania

Her parents are starting to hate her because of the things she says when she starts being manic. I don’t know if it’s too late to send them something, but it’s very serious"
613,Why shouldn’t I just end it?,"I’ve been having a hard time trying to find reasons to want to be alive. When faced with life, I wish I was dead, but when faced with the possibility of death, I become afraid, so I live based on being afraid of death. Why do I just repeat this worthless cycle? Am I that damn stupid? Am I that worthless? I can’t even decide weather or not I deserve to feel happy while living life. I’m just fucking pathetic."
614,Calling people who have benefited from psychiatry!,"I have finally made the leap of faith in getting an appointment with a psychiatrist. I've realised it is in the best interest for me and those around me. Any of my primary care doctors have never really given me what I needed mentally, so I knew it was time.

What can I expect going into this? I am going for past childhood trauma and major anxiety. What was your experience and do you feel it has helped you in any way?

What questions did you ask, what should I? Any feedback is very appreciated as I am very very nervous about it."
615,Recovering from social rejection,"Hi everyone. I had a really rough time earlier this year; my then boyfriend who I was wildly in love with moved across the country on two days notice and broke up with me and right after this, my friend group kicked me out, leaving me with no friends at my college. I had spent all my time with my boyfriend and that friend group so I was feeling super alone. 

Fast forward to now (about 7 months later) and I’m doing much better; getting over the ex, making new friends, etc. But the whole thing with my old friend group was really painful and is still impactful to me; they were my first and only friends at my school and they never told me why they didn’t want to be my friend anymore. They also still all hangout together and when they see me on campus they say hello and make small talk as if everything’s fine. I’m not usually very responsive to this because I’m still kind of upset with them. 

But now I’m noticing it’s affecting my current friendships. For example, two of my really close friends (we have a little group of three) were hanging out last night and they didn’t invite me and it made me really insecure. It made me wonder if they are about to kick me out of the group or something when in reality, they are totally allowed to have their individual friendship. I have this idea in my head that everyone is always just going to leave with no explanation, just like my ex and my friends did. Obviously because of this fear, romantic relationships are pretty much off the table right now.

Do you guys have any advice for this? Any books to recommend? I want to be more secure in my relationships and this has never been a problem for me before. Thanks. Sorry for the long post, shoutout if you made it all the way down to here!"
616,Service sent me a letter discharging me for non-attendance. Not sure what to do now (UK),"Hey, so I'm(27f) just looking for some advice service wise.

So, i self referred to a group, NHS based service and they put me on CBT for stress and anxiety. But they said i have a low end PTSD score so the CBT may not work effectively.
I asked for the workshop to be in person but none of the groups were in my travel radius so they were all online. I attended all but the first session as i was told the same day and couldn't be added to that particular one on the short notice (which was fine).  
However i had a lot of issues with the actual service, i didn't receive questionnaire e-mails after all but one of the sessions. Nor did i get a work book that we were supposedly meant to have received (i e-mail them about this but didnt get a single reply) and after the final session i received a letter of ""discharge from service for non-attendance"". Basically the letter said i have not attended any of the sessions and was CC'd to my GP. 
I called them and told them about the mistake and was told i would get a call back but haven't heard from them and its been 10 days now. 

Obviously i'm going to call them back but I'm wondering what i should be doing/asking them to do. The CBT really doesn't seem to have helped much but I'm not sure if thats because of the lack of material they were meant to send me or if its just because of me not using the information correctly (because i constantly just have no idea if im doing anything right) or because of the potential PTSD.. 

Its only been about 2 and 1/2 weeks since the last session and honestly this whole situation has sent my anxiety into over drive because of the potential that my GP would see this letter as a reason to not take anything further if i needed extra help. 

Im just not really sure what i should be asking for from them at this stage, or whether i should leave it and take a different route or service.
TIA"
617,Oh no suddenly off my meds,I took my last Lexapro this morning and forgot to get my refill. The pharmacy is already closed for the weekend so I can’t get any more until Monday. Any advice? I’m a little nervous about what’ll happen now.
618,If I don't help my parents soon they're definitely gonna get depressed but Idk what to do.,"Both my parents have a history of depression and I myself got diagnosed with clinical depression around a year ago but thank God I got help and I'm over it. 

So, in this quarantine both my parents are showing signs of depression especially my dad who is 60 years old and I don't know how to help him. I try to keep a daily routine and do things I find fun but he only eats and follows all the negative news about the pandemic. He has no hobbies, follows no series, not a big movie guy &amp; he just prefers to sit down and play candy crush or watch news until he can't do it anymore. I really feel for him but I have absolutely no idea about what to do. Any help would be appreciated."
619,Can someone help me?,"I've never been diagnosed for anything as I have not had insurance for almost 8 years and don't have the funds. The thing I need help with is, I feel I have major mood swings and/or am bipolar and I can't help myself. The more I read and hear other's stories really reminds me of myself when I step back and look at myself at another person's view. I don't know how to control my mood swings when they happen, it just happens, and then I'll feel guilty about it later when it dawn's upon me that maybe that wasn't the best course of action or words. This is really starting to affect my relationships with people. I'll be cheerful and playful and flirty for a day or two, and then just depressed or salty the next. Then it repeats like a circle, and sometimes that circle goes off course for a bit but it always comes back. What do I do?"
620,Ketamine medicinal therapy experience,"That was so weird. It got even weirder, because I got low blood sugar (diabetes) and I thought at one point I was going to die (this was a feeling, there was no risk of hypoglycemic coma, because I had a medical professional with me and I was in the proper setting) and I just accepted it. I try to control everything and that causes pain. Resistance is pain. I came face to face with what I thought was my own mortality and I accepted it. That’s pretty fucking incredible. Bro. What the fuck. I’m kinda floored. Have any of you tried it? Experiences?"
621,There it goes yup she said it straight to my face!,My mom told me to “stop having problems and act normal” because I caused them.
622,F*ck life.,This shits dumb af.
623,Am I experiencing emotional numbing?,"I have been in a secret long-distance relationship for almost 3 years now. My plan has been to tell my close ones about it soon, but never tell when the relationship actually started. This is creating a lot of pressure, keeping the start of the relationship as a secret.
Now I have been wondering why I feel almost like being in a coma whenever I meet with my partner: I come back to ”reality” when they leave back home, I don’t feel as strongly about the nice things they do or say to me as I would from other people and I still cannot feel love even though I care very much about them and thus love them as a person like I do my best friends. I feel extremely uneasy if there is a small convenience (e.g. they are not happy about something I did).
So, how unhealthy is this really and what can I do about it?

Edit. I also feel quite numb sexually (lack of arousal) but it might also happen for another physical health-related reasons."

626,You don't have to constantly feel guilty or lie awake reliving moments you regret - it's possible to let it go and live a life free from constant remorse,"Remorse can help us to reflect on errors and avoid repeating them - but its important to keep things in perspective. If we didn't intent harm to others, it's import that we treat ourselves with compassion as we would a friend. We can let go of regular feelings of guilt by looking deeply into its roots - this episode of Mindfulness for Beginners includes a guided mindfulness meditation supporting you to let go of guilt.

627,I live in a super-conscious state all the time and it prevents me from being in touch with the real world,"Since i was a child i have always been an introvert overthinker person. Whenever i do something i tend to analize weather it is good or bad for me. I even analize my way of thinking. You would think this mental process can be positive for self growth but i am tired. It has reached a point where i do not want to learn more about myslelf. I just want to enjoy life and be able to simply ""go with the flow"".  And my overthinking mind just can't stop looking for conclusions, finding more and more weak points of myself, thinking about how should i be or talk or think. This prevents me from being happy. And i cant stop."
628,Haven't showered in weeks,"I would never admit this irl but I can't remember the last time I showered. It was either 2 or 3 weeks ago. I know it's gross. Usually when I'm not doing great I am motivated to have at least 1 shower a week because of church but there's no church atm. I've been intending to shower but I just haven't gotten round to it. I usually sleep a lot, eat breakfast, go back to lie in my bed and watch videos, occasionally sit up in bed and go on my laptop, eat lunch, eat dinner, sleep, repeat.

Tomorrow I'm actually going to shower and wash my super greasy hair because I'm leaving the house for the first time in over a month. Me and my dad are going cycling for our hour of daily exercise. I might even shave which would make me feel more comfortable wearing summery clothes."

632,How to overcome/avoid panick attacks relating to seeing your own blood?,"My mum (49) is a nurse. She sees blood and death every single working day. She can act swiftly in most medical emergencies other people face, even off work and even when drunk. However, she has a deep-rooted fear of seeing her own blood, often leading to hyperventilation and temporary loss of consciousness. This may be caused by something as insignifcant as stumbling on a staircase and hitting your knee. The last time this happened, she described that she had believed her bone to be sticking out of her flesh, despite it being only a graze. She is deeply upset by the thought that a small wound like this could give her a panick attack. Is there any method to overcome or avoid such panick attacks, even when their usual initiators occur? Would confrontational therapy help? Please advise."
633,I hate happy people,"I just hate being around them.  I told my grandma about this and she wasn’t pleased, in a felt bad for me kind of way.  Happy people just seem so fake to me.

F24. Looking for help. Feeling very hopeless about finding someone who will love me given my history with suicidal ideation; i was at one point severely suicidal with a plan and everything. Right now im still depressed and lack self-esteem, but not actively suicidal and im in therapy/ might get medication. Please tell me theres hope in me finding someone who accepts me."
635,What’s the point?,"Why can’t I be good at anything? It seems no matter what I do I can’t get into anything, when I was a kid everyone called me smart and mature but now as a 17 yr old in just as dumb as ever, I’m not good at anything in school even though I study, I used to find enjoyment in video games but now even with this quarantine I’m playing all day every day and I just can’t get better, I’m still bad and can’t keep up, I want to try driving but I have to be like 21 to get a job as a delivery driver so what’s the point if I can’t find ANYTHING that I’m good at, enjoy, or am considered for employment?"

637,Ny ex is suicidal,"My exboyfriend tried to kill himself (after I broke up with him) he texted me and I called an ambulance. He was in a hospital for one week, after that he was allowed to go home (to a friend, because of the break up) under the condition to go to therapy. I know that he already has a flat. 
Shortly after that our country shut down. Therapy stoped and he lost his job. This is probably the worst time of his life and he already had a horrible childhood, no family, no money, nothing. 
We have been together for almost 6 years  my family was his family and he lost them too. Everything else like our dog is also mine because I brought her into our relationship.
He texts me strange things which sound very suicidal to me. I don't know what to do. The clinic won't do anything because of the virus. I am his ex so I can't even do anything. 

I don't want him in my life anymore but I want him to have a good life. He is a really good guy. I couldn't live with myself if he kills himself after everything."
638,I was fired from my job for not showing up for work due to major anxiety,"Disclaimer: First time poster.

Yesterday I received an email from my supervisor stating that he had removed me from the schedule ""for the next couple of weeks"" and urged me to call if I had any questions. I emailed back letting him know that I had spoken to our manager about a possible schedule change, and his response was ""Since you did not come into work your last 3 shifts without informing the hospital your position is considered abandoned. We have ordered your last check and it will be arriving in the mail.""I tried to explain myself and apologized and pleaded but to no avail. ""The decision is final."" he said. I closed my laptop and cried until my head hurt. I've never been fired from a job. In the past, I've prided myself on being a hard-working, positive person and this feels unreal.

Now, let me tell you what happened.

When I was 16, I was diagnosed with [trichotillomania](https://reddit.com/r/trichotillomania/). Most of my life I've been dealing with mild to moderate depression and general anxiety, both untreated. By the time I was leaving my last job (around **October 2019**), I had shaved my head because my hair pulling was out of control and by the time I saw a therapist (**November**) I was suicidal and consequently diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Long story short, my anxiety and depression were poorly managed since I ended up losing my health insurance for a few months after quitting my old job. During that time, I was taking zoloft 100mg and able to stay afloat, mentally. 

Starting the **new** job (**December**) helped with reducing stress and anxiety and I was feeling so much better. Come **February**, I accidentally lapsed on my medication. I had another major depressive episode, shaved my head again and managed to get in touch with my health care providers to get back on track. 

Approx 2 weeks later (**March**), COVID19 is declared a national pandemic and shit starts hitting the fan. I'm on edge, picking at my skin since I can't pull my hair,  unable to sleep, irritable, and barely hanging on. My job is considered essential and though I felt extremely fortunate to be able to continue working, I was also feeling terrified every single day. The nights before work I would stay up all night reading articles about coronavirus. In the mornings, I'd stay in bed and hope that good news would arrive so I had something to look forward to. I starting coming in late to work. Protocols were changing, quickly. And my anxiety, along with the sleeplessness, the feelings of despair, and the fear of the unknown started wearing me down. I felt like an empty, broken shell of myself. 

Then, last weekend (**April**), my son's elderly grandfather (85yrs) whom we live with, developed a cough. The next day, my son developed a cough and I just lost my mind. I froze. I shut down. I didn't show up for work and I didn't call. I stayed home, contacted my son's doctor who was not super helpful, and tried to keep it together. The next day, instead of going to work, I emailed my manager and CC'd my supervisor to apologize and let them know what was going on. I asked if I could temporarily change my schedule to overnights since I would be around less people and hopefully be a little less stressed. My manager told me he would let me know the next day. But I didn't show up to work; instead I spent the day messaging with my therapist and psychiatrists' offices, trying to get help. No one called or messaged me to check in. All I got was an email letting me know that I was ""taken off the schedule"" and to call if I had any questions.

I feel like an absolute failure. I feel like I've had the floor taken out from under me. Obviously, I should have called, I should have made more of an effort to communicate and make it clear that I intended to return to work. I thought that admin would be more understanding but the bottom line is ""rules are rules"". I LOVED that job, more than any other job I've had before. I feel like an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; my mental illness, COVID19, and my general stupidness conspired to get myself fired from work. I hate myself and I can't believe I let this happen. Stay safe everyone.**

639,How can I ask for help?,"I know this question gets asked a lot but I am having an issue with a specific situation that I couldn't find anything about on this subreddit. 

Basically I have no idea what is going on with me or if something is going on at all. I have tried to see a psychologist a couple of times, after being prompted by my GP and parents, but when I'm sitting in their office I genuinely don't know what to say. All I feel is this intense need to cry but I don't know why and I try not it because when they ask me why I cried, I don't have an answer. 

This makes me feel like a fraud and that I am probably just fine and overreacting. I also have the feeling that they think the same.

Because of all these I completely blank out and I just say very generic things or I just focus on a specific issue that comes to my mind first without necessarily meaning it. However, after the appointment I can usually think of a million things I should have said. 

So my question is this. How can I actually ask for help when I don't know exactly what the problem is or if there is a problem at all? And how can I say everything that's on my mind during an appointment when I'm convinced I'm just faking it and I don't know how to phrase all the things that are going on in my mind? 

Thanks for your time"

641,Losing my mind.,"I wouldn't normal post something like this, but I'm really struggling. I have severe anxiety, clinical depression, ADHD, and abandonment issues. I struggle to talk to people on a daily basis and feel isolated in normal circumstances, but it is almost more than I can stand with quarantine. 
I haven't had physical human contact in weeks, I barely speak at all anymore, and my anxiety and paranoia are through the roof. The loneliness and isolation combined with my conditions are slowly driving me insane. Not to mention that my state decided that mental health care was 'non-essential' so I can't even talk to a therapist and get help. I feel like I'm drowning and don't know what to do. I want to have people to talk to and to keep me company, but my anxiety and related issues keep me from being able to engage and to talk. I don't want to burden people with my problems, so I keep it to myself, but it feels like it's killing me. I just want to stop hurting and stop being so painfully alone. 
I'm sorry if this is rambling, I am just in a rough place and I can't even keep my own head straight anymore. I don't really know what I wanted out of this, maybe just to vent, maybe someone has advice that might actually get through all my shit. I dunno. I guess I'll see what happens when this posts."
642,Resources/Education for COVID-19,"Hi everyone, I am a registered nurse in an ambulatory surgery center that is currently shut down.

643,Someone help me,"Trapped within this 3 dimensional prison.
For no fucking reason. No body wants to fucking listen. Nobody really cares, they say imma grow out of it. Nah cause u cant grow out of your own existence. Why am I here. Nobody knows.
Everybody asks themselves the same question and then acts like they fucking know.
But all I rlly know is pain, and nothing fucking else cause I was crying the first time I took my first breath for my self.
Yeah my life could be worse, and that thought keeps me depressed , but I'm so scared of death scared of what to could come next. I cant even end it all cause if hell was real I would go there. Says all preverlant religions so why should I care.
I feel like the worlds neglected me so i feel to neglect the world. But I've neglected myself so have nothing to own. I feel all alone even though I'm surrounded by people. Drugs drugs drugs oh I guess they're my best friend cause they never failed to make me happy. But they're also my worst enemy cause they backstab me and run away when the comedown appears and I'm left in a worse way. 
My mental state is deteriorating every day I got some loose screws. But these ones cant be fixed cause they are what holds my whole existence in two. Fuck god please please please take me to heaven cause i hate living in hell even if this is a lesson. 
If life all had a meaning I dont even care just make me happy forever I dont wanna care no more. I dont wanna watch everyone I love die and then watch myself die too. I dont wanna work a shit job for money just to survive in this shit shit life cause my basic survival instincts depend on it. I dont wanna do anything. I just want happiness. But ffs the things that make u happy kill you. What sort of sadistic fucking reality is this I mean seriously. The one thing that make you feel good and okay fucking kill you what a joke. And we lie to our self saying this life is great. I think we are in hell . That we've been judged already and this is our punishment. Cause if I live in a world where the things that feel good kill u then I guess we r not supposed to feel good. Fuck sake fuck this all. Theres no way out. I'm a slave to existence. It never ends even after death u just probably carry on. I love sleeping it's the best part of existence cause I dont remember it fuck everything.
All i want is love tbh maybe if I feel more loved I'll feel at place. But i dont sorry maybe I am just selfish and ignorant well so be it cause that doesn't change the fact that I still feel this way. My heart is fucking broken and I truly weep for humanity. Well fucking done humans well done cause you've made the planet fucking shit for everyone you little cunts. And fuck pain and suffering fuck it all it's not fair it's not fucking fair. I'm going mental I'm going fucking insane inside my head. And no one knows no one but me. Maybe I'm not alone maybe someone else feels my pain. Fuck this fuck life fuck it all fuck sake so tired of this shit."
644,Bulimia/ADHD and meds,"Hi, I'm 20F and I have multiple diagnosed mental disorders. For background, I had severe social anxiety and depression when I was in high school, and which got better through therapy and medication (I was on celexa for over three years). Anyways, I was diagnosed with minor bipolar 1 and bulimia last summer. Not much was done for the bulimia other than suggested therapy, and I started taking lamotrigine for bipolar which has been working okay. As of recent it's come to my attention that I might have ADHD, I realized that my behaviors that I thought were normal are actually symptoms of ADHD. It felt relieving to figure this out, and I have been researching medication, and I came across vyvanse which also helps binge eating. I had my bulimia kind of under control for 6 months or so, but in quarantine I've been focusing and stressing about food a lot more, and the b/p urges have come back full force, which has been really rough because I had gotten so much better. There's a lot of information on vyvanse helping BED, but not specifically bulimia. Obviously this is something to talk about with my psychiatrist and get an actual diagnosis which I'm aware of, and I do have a zoom appointment next week lol.  I'm in therapy as well but it only does so much. All my shit aside, I just wanted to ask if anyone has experience with vyvanse helping control b/p urges along with helping ADHD. I read a lot about vyvanse helping people not obsess over food, and it would be life changing if that could happen for me. Thank you!"
645,i feel disconnected and i feel like my emotions aren’t truly mine; i’m confused,"so this has been a sort of thing in the background of my life for however long i can remember but i’ve never really cared about it? more recently it’s become more prevalent and this quarantine isn’t helping it, so i decided to give it some concern and try to see what is up 


i feel mostly empty when i’m alone. i don’t feel anything, other than the occasional spot of sadness or frustration/anger. i can’t tell if it’s actually me feeling nothing at all or if it is me not being able to process emotion properly. you see, when i am with people, whether that be over call, in person or over text, i can become very extroverted and i can be almost wild at times. however i can become very distant and quiet out of nowhere when with these people. it never is usually caused by anything, but it just happens. once i leave these people and am on my own again, it’s just emptiness again. it’s like i change person completely.

 i have very lazy and unproductive habits: i leave my rubbish everywhere, i don’t get out of bed till 2-4pm, i play video games all day and struggle to complete the simplest tasks or assignments of work. i don’t even enjoy watching porn at this point (apologies if that’s tmi). i have trouble eating as i can’t bring myself to make even a sandwich, i eat whatever packaged food is laying around (which isn’t usually a lot). i used to starve myself throughout the day as i wasn’t comfortable with my size and this went on for weeks. i felt close to no emotion while doing this. 

i have trouble remembering things, which can also anger my parents as i forget to do things like take things upstairs, and defrost food. whatever it may be, small or not, i have trouble recalling 

my mom gets angry at me whenever i bring up that i don’t feel much on my own and she just blames it on my “sluggish, boring” behaviours. at this point i don’t know whether she’s right or if it’s something else causing this emptiness. i have no previous recorded mental health problems with depression or anxiety. however my dad has had both depression and anxiety which also could be a correlation but i am in no position to say that it is.

edit: i think the title could be contradicting to some. what i mean is that the emotions i feel when around others, like a sort of mellow happiness, seem like it’s not actually how i feel. maybe i’m just social??"
646,Need Help for my Little Brother,"Hi, everyone. I hope you guys are doing well. My little brother recently had a mental breakdown and we admitted him to a psychiatrist hospital for teenagers. None of my family have ever been in and have no idea what he's going through. I was hoping to have someone whose been in his shoes talk to him. I asked him and he said he would appreciate being able to talk to someone who knows how he is feeling. I want to be able to help him but I know there are things I can't help with since I'm not in his shoes. He's taking zyprexa and is telling me he doesn't feel himself.

I am in California USA."
647,idek anymore,[deleted]
648,I've been really sad because of what's going on but I can guarantee it's not about what you think,"A few years ago I got into a lot of trouble and that resulted in my mum taking away my ps4, now this isn't for a week or a month, this is forever, obviously I was pissed, I was really Angry for a while,(I was 11 when this  happened) it was like just after Christmas as well. So I get used to it after a few months but the thing is I had to make up a lie to tell my friends why I don't play anymore and they still don't know, I used to play all the time with them when I had the chance, obviously I'm still not happy about it. Up until August of the next year i thought she had gotten rid of it. Until one day when I was cleaning the house and I found it in a cupboard. I raced upstairs pleading to have it back and she said maybe, now we all know when parents say maybe they mean no. So fast forward 2 years later and we're in quarantine and no body had anything g to do, this is when it's really bad cuz it's been sitting in my living room since then and I'm not allowed to use it, all my friends are going on and playing basically all day and I'm just sitting with my thumb up my ass all day trynna find something to do, now I get slightly depressed every now and then but it's never been worse than this and I know I'm not gonna get it back. I'm not asking what I should do or anything i just wanna get it off my back. Thanks, I'm not making a tldr cuz I don't know how to summarise this.  

(Edit: I know this is a pissy little thing to be complaining about and that there's other people with much worse things going on, but for me this is really hard and id appreciate if took it seriously, sounds like something of im14andthisisdeep lol)"
649,Aggressive family member refuses help and refuses to acknowledge that something is wrong.,"I live with my parents and older brother. My older brother is prone to lashing out, throwing things, getting mad at the littlest of things (even if it’s his fault), etc. I tried asking if he was okay and he said everything is fine when clearly it’s not. When someone does something for him (eg. Our mom will always make dinner) he will still be in a bad mood and be unappreciative. 

How do I go about this? He’s an adult and I don’t think other people should be responsible for fixing all his problems. But he’s not willing to do anything that will make things better for himself. It also gets very uncomfortable to have to live in the same house as him."
650,Loneliness setting in during sadboi hours,"Usually I can keep it upbeat and happy all day at work, but when night comes I am buffeted with a wave of loneliness. I miss my high school friends. Now we’ve grown up and apart. I have at least.

Out of boredom I scroll through social media and see my old classmates’ posts. Their pictures with each other and their significant others. Meanwhile I sit here alone. I feel like a fading memory.

I’m damaged and I know it. I’m left wondering whether it’s my fault. Am I an asshole? I question everything I say or do now. I want friends. I assume people fade because they sense that I’m not being my genuine self. Hell, I don’t even know my genuine self outside of being a funny guy.

All my friends eventually forget me. They exclude me. No matter how hard I try. I want to blame them, but that just seems like me wanting to pass on responsibility. I want to get better. I want to stop being lonely. 


TLDR: I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams."
651,"*please read* I have been meaning to tell my therapist, or anyone about this but I can’t. So I’m doing it here. Is this worth telling?","When I was 4, my cousin (also 4) and I were inseparable. We played games like house, Lego, and zoo. The games be played always were a bit.. strange. At least on his part. He look lick our “baby” (a doll) in the private parts. I didn’t think of it. We are 2nd cousins and he had a crush on me. We were both little and didn’t understand what “crush” meant. The games we played got weirder, and sometimes he would make me kiss him. One day, the most vivid memory, (We were probably 5) we were pretending to sleep in our game of house. He told me to come here. He threw things at me and hurt me when he got mad, so I came over. He told me to kid him. I said no. He asked me again. I said no. He grabbed me, put a thin see through cloth between our lips and pulled me on top of him. I laid on top of him as he did something. That’s all I remember. It turns out, he was sexually abused by HIS cousin, so he thought that was how you showed someone love. I don’t know if he remembers. But I do. I see him all the time. I am scared of him. I am only in 6th grade, so I need to tell someone about this? Is it bad or not? I have depression and anxiety."
652,at home with parents and toxic mother,"I’ve temporarily moved back in with my parents during this time to avoid the germs from the city I live in. I’ve been here for about a month or so and things have been better than I expected with my family, up until tonight. 

My mom is a bad alcoholic and she’s thankfully been sober the last two years, but that doesn’t erase any of my anger, resentment and hurt I have, as growing up with an alcoholic isn’t easy. She was always mean, mistrusting and judgmental when she was drunk, which was sadly most of the time, so it was hard for me to ever bond with her on a close level. 

Even though it has been pretty good and neutral since being here, tonight it flipped and became awful. Since getting sober, she’s development an eating disorder (something my therapist says is her “new addiction”) and is really mean about my weight.

I’m a 23 year old, five foot six female that weighs around 125 pounds - so I’m very very average and really don’t give her any reason to be mean about my weight. I eat well and moderately exercise. But she still nags me about it as I guess any mother would, to eat more healthily etc. tonight though she told me I was fat and to stop eating. 

I’ve been struggling with my body image for a while as this is the biggest I’ve ever been in my life and even though I know I’m not “fat” I’m adjusting to my new body. And this just doesn’t help.

I’m so upset and don’t want this to discourage me from my self love journey I’ve been on. 

How can I feel better and handle these situations better?"
653,That's how i feel and i really can't take it anymore,"This is my experience and i don't know if it's a good idea to share it here but i just really want to get some things off my chest and please, if you've been through the same thing i'd like to hear your experiences too. I just feel like my brain it's wrong. It's a bit embarrassing to say these things here but it's the internet after all, am i right. When i was a kid i used to have some notebooks where i used to wrote different things or questions i was anxious about and, it's weird i don't even know how to explain. Questions and different things would've popped out in my mind and i couldn't feel well till i didn't write those things down. It was distressing i was just a little kid, i was 8 or 9 maybe. I used to check the gas and the door everytime but this thing stopped concerning me after a few years. Last year i had some random pain in my body, in the pelvic area specifically and i got so anxious about it i started to search symptoms only just to reassure myself that nothing was wrong with me and different questions about these symptoms were popping out in my brain.. again and i felt trapped in my own thoughts. That i was in a circle where i get anxious, then i need to reasure myself then i got anxious about other thing, etc. I stopped with this thing too after a few months, it came back but it didn't last long. And now i just overthink everything. I've always done that i get anxious and i feel like i need reassurance from people about specific things that i have to ask things multiple times so i can be sure that a certain thing won't happen. I don't know what it is i don't understand this brain. Sorry about this long ass rant but i needed to say these things."
654,My brother is mentally ill and I don't know what to do,"My older brother is 30 years old. Growing up, he was always a quiet kid, but I didn't think much of it. Sometime around age 22, I noticed some changes and things have just gotten more bizarre as time goes on. 

Currently, he lives with our mom and has been unemployed for 1.5 years. He hasn't taken a shower since Thanksgiving 2019. He takes 2-3 hours to eat dinner. He has lost tons of weight and his BMI is about 18.0. It seems like he isn't even in the same realm as the rest of the world. He will just walk around the house and stare intensely at the floor like he's seeing something on the ground. I went to visit my mom's house and happened to go in his room. It is filled with garbage, rotten food, and there were even about 5-6 water bottles full of piss. I'm certain he is a hoarder. About 2 years ago was when I first noticed this, so I took all of his trash and bagged it up and took it to a fast food dumpster. Later that night I saw him leave the house and was suspicious so I followed him and he was in the dumpster retrieving his trash to take back home. I've had talks with my mom and she just won't do anything about it. She's in declining health and still supports him. It's starting to anger me because 1) He lives with my mom rent free, doesn't work, and has destroyed his side of the house 2) It's a health risk to my other siblings that live there. I've tried to talk with him but he's just very unresponsive and rarely talks to anyone. 

Now, how should I approach this? I want to  truly help. I love my brother &amp; my entire family, I want to to try to approach this in a way that helps everyone. I think I'm the only one in my family that will actually take initiative to get something done. I just have no idea where to go from here..."

658,The place where I get help is closing permanently,Got the mail today and I got a letter from the mental health facility where I get help (therapy and medication) is closing permanently. They gave me resources in the letter. But I feel lost and scared. I don't trust people that well because of what I've gone through. And this virus seems to just add more and more stress. I want to scream and cry. I didn't think it could get worse...I hate covid-19...
659,How am I supposed to know how I feel??,"I kinda don't know what emotions I feel if that makes sense. Like I do have emotions, it's just I can't categorize how I'm feeling in one emotion like happy, sad, angry etc. I also just like change my mood constantly, I don't really know how to describe it but I don't ger like ""sad"" for a while, I'm always just changing idk.

661,What the fuck is my life,"I feel like I'm going to fucking kill myself. I'm tired of living in constant fear every fucking day. Only God knows how many phobias I've got. I'm scared of insects, spiders, the darkness, I'm scared of being alone, and I feel like I could die at any time and nobody would notice it. Every day I feel like something terrible is about to happen and I get hurt somehow. Hell, I can't even sleep at night. What if a spider crawls up my bed one night and I wake up with it on my face, or anywhere else on my body, huh? What if some psychopath just comes in one day and straight up kills me or kidnaps me? I just CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THESE FUCKING THINGS. There's nothing I can do to stop it. My sleeping schedule's been fucked for over a month now. The only thing that distracts me from these things is gaming. But I can't do that for a very long time because I'll fuck my eyes. Please, just help me. At least try. I can't take this anymore."
662,What is wrong with me?,I have been depressed since I can remember. Blame it on my fucked up childhood. I don’t think about it anymore or blame it I really don’t. But two kids later. I’m off all meds. I’m fine per say. But I wake up every single day and am excited to go back to bed. I can’t seem to fully enjoy anything because I’m so fucking exhausted. I literally feel like I could fall asleep all day. No matter how much coffee. Energy drinks. My fatigue is relentless. I got my labs done the doctor said nothing looks concerning. I had been told that my depression is most likely from severe add which makes a lot of sense. But I hate myself. I can’t ever seem to live up to my potential. Follow through with things. And the person I want to be and who I am are just not close. I feel like I don’t have the energy to go through daily tasks. I was diagnosed with mdd. Prozac did wonders for me. But then it stopped and did nothing. My mom dad and brother are extreme heroine and meth addicts and every time I take adderall I break it up into tiny pieces and take it because I’m to scared to be an addict and don’t want to be using a substance to make me feel like I’m doing better if it’s drug induced delusion of doing better. I’m at a loss.
663,I’m stuck in the past and I don’t how to get out?,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old female and let me give you some background information about my past. So high school was a living hell for me. I was a shitty person as well as a hot mess. I was really mean to a lot of my friends and I was super abusive as well. During high school I was in a relationship with a guy. We were both horrible to each other. We would break up get back together and he would sexually touch me when I didn’t ask him too. I would also verbally abuse him too. I also had horrible grades in high school I never did any of my work. I was bullied a lot all throughout school. After I graduated high school I left that all behind me. I changed a lot as a person. I got a job that I really love working with animals. I started to go to college and making really good grades. I have a 3.5 gpa now. I left the guy I was dating and 8 months later I started dating someone else. My current relationship is great we get along super well both very happy in the relationship. It feels like a real relationship. I love him very much, he’s showed me how to live a beautiful life. I also cut off my toxic friendships from high school. Their pretty pissed at me for it, but I’m really glad their gone. I feel weight lifted off of me. One of my old friends and my Ex bf are going around spreading rumors about me saying stuff that I never did/said. Not all my friendships in high school were toxic. Some of my friends we just drifted apart, because we had not a whole lot in common anymore. I still love them dearly haven’t talked to them in a really long time. I’m still really good friends with one girl. We have a lot in common and we been friends since middle school. She’s super sweet we hangout a good amount. Life has gotten better after high school. Just one thing is I can’t let the past go. I’m obsessed with thinking about the past. I think about it all the time. I get flash backs of things I did that were horrible or horrible things that happened to me. I’m so embarrassed in myself, because of it. It makes me extremely depressed, even having thoughts of hurting myself. Every time see someone from my past out in public I get really nervous, because they will remember from what I was like back then. I feel very guilty in what I have done to people in high school. I hate myself for my past I knew I was a asshole back then. I don’t know whats wrong with me. I work on myself all the time. I’m in therapy right know, but had to stop due to quarantine. I really want to work in the mental health felid in the future and help teens. I’m just scared I won’t be able to handle it, because once I hear something similar about my past I get all shaken up about it. I don’t know what to do?"

As a kid I used to fantasize about running away. I used to research the fuck out of it and I got into bushcraft and basic survival skills as a result. I've never felt like I really belonged somewhere. 

One of my earliest memories is saying to my dad that I wanted to run away. I remember just sitting with him while he watched tv. He acknowledged me but just didn't seem to care. I don't know if it's just me though.

Up until recently I'd forgotten that I'd written a suicide/running away note that I kept hidden in my room when I was a kid.

I just don't get it. I've always wanted to just leave home and get as far away as I can. To escape from my family. But they care about me, we live in a decent house, we aren't poor. I hate it though. 

I feel like some spoiled piece of shit.

I've had issues with my family since being a teenager. Especially with my dad. I think he was emotionally abusive but how do I know I'm not the one in the wrong?

I've never been able to take myself seriously. 

My sister seems fine though, she really loves my parents and is quite close to them. I can't understand it though. 

Why do I feel estranged from them? Why do I want to leave and forget I ever belonged to this family? Why has this tormented me for my entire life?


I'm 22 and stuck with my parents during this pandemic and I can't deal with it. I'm so depressed most of the time. I can hardly function. 

I try anything to try and have a good day but I just want to get as far away from everyone and everything as possible. My parents always find a way to make me feel ashamed of myself or make me feel like some false version of me. Like I'm some pathetic imitation of a person and everything I do is stupid.

I can hardly interact with my dad because my level of distrust towards him is so great. I struggle to be in the same room as him, but he just wants to do things with me.

One of my few escapes was music. I play guitar to deal with things, but now they've invaded that space. They've invaded all the space I have and not even my mind feels like it's private. They're always listening and passing judgement and trying to make me someone that I'm not.

My dad wants me to teach him to play guitar, but I really don't want to. It's like the last thing that I have control over. The last thing I have that is mine.

My mum always micromanges me and keeps tabs on what I'm doing and how much I'm eating. She always tells me I'm doing this or that wrong or not enough.

I don't know if I'm being ungrateful and shitty. My mum just cares about me and my dad wants to spend time with me but I just don't want that. I want to get as far away as possible.

I know there has to be more to it but I don't know what. Why has this just defined my life?

There's a lot I'm not sure about. I don't feel much enjoyment anymore.

I just wish I could feel like a normal human being and enjoy all the normal things that other people enjoy. Like a family that I feel like I belong to, functional long term relationships, friendship groups I feel like I can belong to, not having to gamble my future to feel like I have meaning.

I feel like my experience of being human is so unlike what it's supposed to be like. 

There's so much I haven't covered but I'd be here all day."
670,I think it is time I should say this.,"I often think about my life in third-person unintentionally (like from out of mind/body perspective).

This has led me to feel like I am not what I am supposed to be.

This has also led me to feel as if my personality has been lost and it is isolated/lost in my own brain.

Almost like I have lost control of my own personality thoughts but not my own emotions and not my own general thoughts and feelings."
671,I slept for 12hrs straight after having a panic attack and throwing up twice.,"Like the title says, I'm so stresses right now I cant even fucking keep my food down. Thanks to this lockdown shit I havent been able to see my therapist, which means I cant continue my meds, which ive been off of for three weeks now.

Before this happened I felt like I finally had things under control, like I climbed out of a deep rutt in my life and was on my way to normal again.

Got myself a job, worked not even a week, and then got furloughed. Floridas unemployment website is a fucking mess and a majority of people have yet to even file for it because of it.

So now I'm just laying in my room for days at a time doing nothing but self loathing and sleeping. I hate this shit. I hate me."
672,Wow.,"For some reason today I feel randomly content, happy, not worried. It's scary."
673,Anyone willing to read a pretty long story and give advice?? I’d appreciate it!,"If so, comment and I’ll dm you! No pressure to anyone,  and I really don’t want to be a bother! Just if you could I’d appreciate it. I really need someone to talk to.."
674,Just an old man tossing his words to a wall...,"  My mental state has not been good for a while I don't know why I'm reaching out to random strangers in order to seek clarity perhaps it's the anonymity so I feel not as judged as I would if I were to reach out to people I know.

I'm a 34 years old man will be 35 in two months I feel old disconnected worthless I feel like I am no longer at that point in my life in which things can change in which I can see new adventures I'm supposed to be at that point which everything is day to day and happy about it but I’m not.

I'm single don't have any kids work a job that I hate and it just feels like this is just the rest of my life like I can't start something new or I'm too old and people want someone young full of energy whereas I'm not out of energy but I don't have that spunk I used to. I see these younger people who are just starting their lives and all I can feel is envy and desire to be that age again to be in a position where if I were to screw up, I could rebound easier.

I also can't help but feel a bit jealous seeing a younger generation enjoy things without being ostracized like gaming as well as DnD and overall geek culture stuff that when I was their age generally made you an outcast from public is now considered the social norm and only thing going through my head is I had only been born a little bit later maybe I would have had a group to hang out with when I was younger. Part of me understands the only reason that's normal now is cause my generation grew up and made it the norm we didn't want people to go through the same pains we did from being shunned but at the same token I still can't help but feel jealous about it.

Throughout my entire life I've always been a late bloomer I didn't even have friends until I was 26 It feels like I'm behind age wise by a good ten years but I should be feeling now is something I’m not going to feel till I'm 44 And I don't know what to do about it I feel like I'm trapped torn between What I want to versus the knowledge to know I'm too old to be doing it that it is not my place to be there that it is not right for me to join such things.

It is always felt like I've been in a war with my emotions versus my brain I desire to be versus my desire to know as if I've never really fit sorry if this went on too long I just felt like maybe putting it out there somewhere would make me feel better."
675,Need help right now,I'm at odds with my alt and it's really tearing me apart I just need someone to talk to.
676,I cant for the life of me reach out for help,"Its like it makes me sick or something i dont know , ive been trying too get online therapy but its really exspensive and i need too save my money right now , and i cant think of anything else too help me . im really fucking low and it just sucks right now , i just want too feel loved and happy but its like my mind wont let me."
677,Trust,"Do any of you guys feel like you could trust somebody else more than you trust yourself? I honestly feel like whether it’s family or friends I can trust them more than I could trust myself not to say that I’m am a bad person or anything but I am somewhat unpredictable and I have a hard time truly understanding where I come from sometimes, and what my motives are."
678,I constantly feel watched,"I can’t do anything alone without thinking “I probably look so stupid right now”
“What would ______ think if they could see me now?”
“I bet _____ is making fun of me right now”

Is there a specific name for this?"
679,I’m sorry I keep posting on here...I’m struggling right now,I just really need someone willing to listen to me explain a situation and offer advice.
680,Live in a mental health facility?,"I’m trying to find out if it’s possible to basically live as full time patient in a mental health facility. I’m at the point with my mental illnesses where’d I’d like to throw in the towel and give up. I have no intention of harming myself so suicide is out of the question, therefore, I’d like to waste away in a hospital on my own terms. I feel burnt out and hollow, I have nothing to offer anyone, no life plan or even hopes of what one might be. Is this something I can realistically do or am I seriously stuck being a cog in a shit world?"

682,How do I tell my boss I'm going to be gone for 3-4 months to get ED treatment?,"I already did the intake for ED PHP and agreed to the program 2 weeks ago without telling her. The program is 8 hours a day so I will have to go on state disability. I am starting Monday afternoon. I tried to tell my boss yesterday during our Skype call but she immediately started talking about her own medical issues and I got really nervous and didnt say anything. Today all I could think to do was IM her that I am doing an intake for a therapy program I might do to help my anxiety and insomnia (she knows I have those issues, not the ED). So now I dont know how to tell her I am doing it, and am leaving despite me not finishing major projects that need to get done. Any advice?"
683,I hate happy endings,"I watch a lot of glmv because a: I'm into anime and b: why does it matter? I watch a lot of one's with depressing songs or songs about being insane mostly because I feel I can relate to them. Well in songs related to suicide such as miss wanna die, I find I get mad or upset when the person doesn't die. I get so upset because they got a happy ending. And on the flip side, I smile and giggle pratically crying in happiness when they die or just snap.

I have no plans I want to carry out but I have thought over suicide a lot. Is this normal when your heavily depressed? Therapy is not available as my mom can't afford it and I'm pretty sure doctors won't see me because mental illness isn't worth getting corona. My streak of no self harm ended a couple days ago when I got really mad. I thought i was getting better when I started losing all my negative emotions but now they are coming back like an avalanche.

I'm honestly just stuck at the moment. Idk what to do."
684,I hate my friends,"I am my friend groups verbal punching bag. I hate it but I’m more scared of being alone. I literally haven’t been able to sleep because overthinking everything they say, I didn’t know where else to put this."
685,feeling bored w life,[deleted]
686,What are some of your favorite self care activities during quarantine? My depression is very bad right now. I live alone and really just want a hug. All ideas welcome.,I’m very depressed. I’m on medication for anxiety and depression. I’m numb to everything. I need suggestions to not be numb.
687,pls give me coping mechanisms,"TW
I wanna rip out my hair i hate the feeling of it on my skin i cant cut it bc my mom will literally disown me so thats out of the question my skin feels like it shouldn’t be on my body and it hurts i wanna rip myself out of my body how do i make it stop pls pls pls i cant do this anymore"
688,What the fuck is the point?,"Ugh. I don't even know where to begin. I'm just so overwhelmed right now. I was doing good for the last couple of weeks going outside in nature and stuff to keep me sane but the weather where I live has been horrible and I haven't gone outside in a week. I live in Michigan, which is one of the strictest states for stay at home orders in the country. I guess I'll give a bit of backstory or something, idk.

I graduated high school last year, June of 2019. I was 17 (18 now), and excited for the world ahead of me. I had commited to join the US Navy and was really excited for it. I knew it was going to be hard and probably suck for most of the way through, but I knew that it was my opprotunity to make a big impact on SOMEBODY's life. Summer came and went, it was the best summer of my life. I saw the country, got to spend a lot of time with friends. Just simple, good, carefree fun.

September came, time to go to bootcamp. I went, stayed there for 3 months, it sucked but that's the whole point. I made it to the last week, before failing my final run. I got seperated the day after Christmas. At this point I was pretty bummed out, but I at least knew I tried my best.

Few weeks pass, looking for a job, etc. Can't find one. More time passes, I am feeling more down but remain optimistic. I eventually find a job a few states over at an amusement park, something I always thought would be fun to do during college or something, and thought fuck it I'm 18 why not. Things started to look less bleak.

And then coronavirus happened. My whole life felt like it got put on pause. Stay at home orders were issued, and I slowly watched the world around me go into a state of fear and suffering. I had to stay inside a lot now. No more seeing friends. I was ok for a couple weeks, but eventually my thoughts caught up with me. I got really existential. The more I thought about it the more I realized how fucked up the society we live in is. It didn't help that the leader of our country blew the whole thing over. I feel terified. I feel like our government should be in a state of assuring us that we will be ok, yet I felt the opposite. Their actions made me for fearful.

I started to think to myself, what even is the point of all of this? Of life? I realized how meaningless life is, and it just seems like we are all born to suffer. Fuck. I was so happy and carefree just a few months ago, are we all really so stupid and vulnerable that we let things like this take us over so quickly?

Idk where I'm going with this. I guess I just wanted to type out my feelings. I need guidance. Please."
689,Anger management,"Hello , just writing a question because I’ve been talking to my friend lately and she says she’s been coping with anger problems and it’s getting to the point where she feels like no one likes her anymore. She was also saying this all happened after she had an abusive incident with her dad. If u could tell me what I should say to her would help a lot."
690,I just don't know what to do anymore,"I just broke up with me girlfriend of 2 years. Every day she made life worth living. I'm not saying I'm suicidal, I'm just saying I do t have the motivation left in me. I work hard, very hard. She always talked about how I never spent enough time with her and I always told her I was doing my best. I work nights and I would sometimes force myself to stay up the next day to be with her. I constantly bought her things and if she needed something I had no problem handing over my card. I held her through all her bad moments and pushed aside my own troubles just for her. I feel like I did my best. But thats all you can do, right?"
691,I don't know what's wrong with me,"No matter what I do I can't cry or feel good or anything. I've lost interest in all of my favorite activities. I don't want to be alive anymore, all I want to do is sleep and never wake up. There's nothing bad happening in my life (I felt like that before quarantine and all this shit) or anything that could cause this."
692,"Rarely Brush My Teeth, Clean or basically live. I'm living a life where I'm barely functioning even WITH meds, therapy and other stuff. Not sure what else to do. I just don't want to feel alone","Basically like the title says. A lot of stems from an abusive home life that I finally got away from. I was used to making myself ""disappear"" or stay as still and quiet as possible. If I wasn't noticed, I wasn't hurt. 

Even now, years later, I have a hard time actually moving or doing anything out of a fear of something randomly happening. Back at home, if I was doing something ""wrong"" if the birth givers eyes, she would suddenly start slapping me and verbally abusing me. 

I'm on meds that work well. They keep the worst of it at bay. I've had a cocktail of different medications through the years and these seem to help the most. So I'm not wanting to change them just yet. I have a therapist (behavioral health specialist) and a psychologist that I see. I even do YOGA and try to eat right. I eat mostly rice with veggies, don't drink or smoke.

My teeth are ruined from the lack of care. I KNOW it's gross. I think a part of my brain just shut down and stopped seeing them, and honestly, for the first few years they were fine. It's only been in the last year that they've literally started chipping away looking worse than Gollom's set of teeth. There's almost an aversion to brushing. Sometimes I can trick myself when I take a shower to do it, but I'm still down to only brushing once a week, maybe a little more. 

I just want to be free of this. What's so wrong with these chemicals in my brain that keep me from being able to live?"
693,Anger,Hope everyone’s holding up well. I need some advice on how to deal with stored up anger. I’ve been working diligently on bettering my mental health over the Past year and a half but I think there’s an underlying layer of anger that I need to let loose before I can truly move forward. I’ve been pretty active in the gym on and off for a good 7 years and it helps temporarily but not completely. And I find myself overcompensating by trying to be too nice and too kind even when I  really want to tell people to fuck off. So I probably come across as fake or at least not sincere because I can’t express that later deep down. How can I get this off my shoulders without just lashing out because I feel like I’m almost at that point.
694,This coronavirus quarantine is starting to cause increase in suicidal thoughts again.,I dont know anymore. Ive lived all my life with a narcissist and i always used to use college and work as an escape to get away from the negative environment in my place of living. During this quarantine ive been forced to be around my narcissistic abuser more and i cant deal with the verbal abuse anymore. Im not gonna even bother writing my whole story here. I just wanted to emphasize how tough this quarantine has been. I cant escape. I dont know. Its saturday and i have to be up in the morning knowing that ill have the whole day with verbal abuse again and i wont be able ro concentrate on my college stuff. All i keep thinking about is suicide. I want to but im not strong enough to go ahead and do it. i rather be dead right now. I really do.
695,"I’m terrible at being honest with my therapist, how can I tell her I have a suicide plan?","I know I need help, but I’m too scared to get it. What should I do? How could I tell her? I always chicken out. (I always chicken out of sending an email before as well)"
696,My head,"I don’t know if this has ever happened to any of you people but most of the time now since the quarantine my head has been filled with negative thoughts and negative memories just filling up my brain. Probably because I can’t get out it’s effecting my mental health but honestly I don’t know how to stop it it’s like when I’m not busy I get a random thought and it’s always negative and I’m like why?, why? Do I think like this. I was actually thinking of buying a diary to write my feeling and thoughts but haven’t got round to it. Has this ever happened to any of you guys? It’s either negative thoughts of what what’s happened in the past i tend to listen to music to distract me but never always works since it just happened even talking about this is hard. Idk if it’s a sign of illness I ain’t sure what do u think ?"
697,Not doing too well and don’t have the proper support,I wish I had someone to go to but this will do. My mental health hasn’t been doing very good and I’ve been thinking I need to talk to someone or at least do something. But I don’t know what to do. Anytime I’ve tried to talk to my mother (single parent) about how I’m feeling she just assumes when I say I don’t feel good I’m depressed and or want to kill myself. I’m turning 18 in a week or so and I’m just lost. Any advice is appreciated.
698,Taking everything to not try and OD. Huge TW,"I know covid and quarantining is getting to everyone, so I just feel like I’m being dramatic.

But I constantly fantasize about suicide and it’s gotten exceptionally worse during all of this. I did have an attempt in 2018, obvi didn’t work bc here I am.

I can’t admit it to my therapist bc i just can’t say the words out loud. But I have a massive amount of sleeping pills I’ve just been hoarding and picking up monthly and barely taking them as well as some Xanax- I still do take those though. All I can think about is just swallowing them all with vodka. The thoughts are always there but they’re getting so much louder and worse. I cannot do it right now bc I would never want to overwhelm the hospital with one more thing with all of this going on. But, I feel like with all of this time at home I can just keep fantasizing and maybe when this pandemic is over I can just get it over with. 

I just wish I knew how to not feel like this and not have so many of my thoughts preoccupied with this. I just needed to share somewhere because I have no one I can tell. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m 27, I haven’t accomplished nearly anything and I just feel like I never will. I’m not “depressed” per say but I’m severely unhappy with myself and have had a very hard life that never seems to get better. I just want the thoughts to stop or I just want it to all end alrdy. I wish I could tell my therapist but I just don’t think I can. I’m not sure if it’s something she could send me away for. Idk what to do anymore. Thanks if anyone reads this."
699,I’m freaking out,I’m like paranoid I’m scared to get out of this chair I keep thinking that someone is after me or something and I don’t know what to do I’m fucking freaking out
700,How to get rid of Brain Fogginess(Latest Brain Fog Research) 2020," Brain fog is actually a symptom not a disease and is defined as the inability to have a sharp memory or to lack a sharp focus. You just really feel like you're not yourself and you're unable to think clearly this is called mental fogginess or what we call subsyndromal delirium or for short SSD.

702,I have an extremely bad reaction time for my age.,"I'm 18 and my reaction time is really slow (I hit 400ms on human benchmark with a best of 260)

I'm also particularly slow to processing what people say, usually I have to think of something to say for a bit. 

One last bit is that I think I have dyslexia, I read letters in a different order about 30% of every time I read a passage the length of a paragraph.

Is there a causal link here? Should I ask my doctor?"
703,Sometimes I feel nothing.,"Sometimes when I get really really upset on the verge of another breakdown I stop feeling all emotions. I hate it. It’s like I can’t do anything, I can’t even think straight. I just shut down.
I’m going through it right now and I just don’t understand."
704,Flashback - The healing power of poetry,"The act of writing is itself therapeutic, it is a release valve from the pressure of trauma long past. 

In this instance, writing saved my life. I was able to express tumult of my mind, to observe it, to accept it and ultimately to let it go.

Revisiting and sharing it brings it’s own pain. The raw vulnerability of presenting such a thing to the world borders upon the unbearable. Yet I persist, not because I think the poem itself is worth sharing, but because its worth comes by the way of example.

I hope that it will inspire people to release their inner demons, and to push through that inner voice that fears the words that are being put on the page.

Write, and write, and write some more. Write until it is all gone. Until you are empty. Then you will be free to be filled with beauty and love and life.

**Flashback**

There’s nowhere you can run to,   
Nowhere you can hide,   
Not when your problems   
Are coming from inside.  
   
You cannot escape them,   
You cannot leave,  
Now that blood is   
Running down your sleeve.  
   
Don’t try to face me,   
Don’t try to hide,  
Mummy, Daddy,   
Why weren’t you by my side?  
   
Do I want to sober up,   
Or do I want to die?   
Blank memories. Pain.   
Watching his hand touch up my thigh.  
   
I couldn’t say no,   
I couldn’t flee,  
Nothing I tried   
Broke his hold of me.  
   
Years have passed,   
But his grip remains,  
He took my body,   
My soul, my brains.  
   
So now I’m sitting here,   
Stoned and alone,  
Trying to remember   
If I have ever felt at home."
705,My [30M] Live in Girlfriend [26F] has been sleeping...A LOT and I’m worried about her..,"Backstory : My GF is 26 and wonderful, we actually have a great relationship, never really argue and certainly never fight or anything like that. She lost her mom back when she was in college (before we met) and that made a pretty significant and understandable dent in her mental health I think. Then before she and I hooked up she was dating a guy who put his hands on her a lot which (I think) has caused her to completely freak out and cower in fear from ME in situations where things are otherwise normal 

example : once we took a day trip up to the top of a mountain and her cars radiator busted on the way up, I pulled off and made a phone call to get a tow, she got out of the car and sat down beside it, as I’m hanging up the phone I’m walking towards her to tell her “tow trucks 20 min out love” and she completely freaked out and screamed like I was going to kick her in the face or something. I comforted her and told her everything was ok of course but later I asked her ya know “what the f*ck babe?” She said she has no idea what happened, I looked like a “dark figure” and her ear started to hurt really bad. This sort of thing has happened about bi monthly since we’ve been together. Thankfully never in a crowded place where people would CERTAINLY think I actively beat the shit out of her. 

Throughout our relationship she has had bouts with panic attacks, and maybe unrelated but worth mentioning she has chronic sinusitis and uses Affrin nasal spray sometimes 10-12x per day. She even wakes up in the middle of the night to take a hit of Affrin and then go back to sleep... that concerns me also. But may be for a different post. 

When she moved in with me that meant giving up her career at one of the bigger gyms in America, to move to a different state to be with me. She came here and her panic and anxiety seemed to vanish, she stopped having daily panic attacks and was happy and full of life, she found a job at another gym here in town and was eager and climbed from the ground up to a salaried position with a title in under 90 days, but now in the midst of covid 19 shut down she is the only employee still working. The gym has been shut down for weeks but they still make her go there everyday to take phone calls and do things that are arbitrary and pedantic imo. She is there from 8am - 5pm 6 days a week even though the gym is closed. I stop by sometimes as I’m an outdoor contractor and she’s just sitting in a gym that the owners won’t let her turn the lights or AC on inside, so it’s DARK and pretty uncomfortable in there. Anyway to get to the point here, she works from 8-5 then comes home and is asleep before 8pm every night. Then she sleeps all through the night until 7am then goes to work and sits in that box with the lights out for no reason... and I truthfully think it’s causing her to be seriously depressed. When she is home and is awake, she’s cold or doesn’t feel good, tired, complains of her chest hurting again... is working at gyms bad for my girlfriend? 

Upon her request, I had a talk with her gyms owner two days ago and asked him if they could forward the gyms calls to her cellphone and let her work from home since she has a work laptop with access to their intranet system. And he quickly declined stating “somebody has to be here to accept deliveries” although deliveries have not come since the shutdown, so that’s just not true. So I told him that and he said “somebody has got to be here” I said OKAY well how about since you gave 29 other employees temporary unemployment, you give it to her too? And he agreed. Next thing I know she’s calling me up saying she’s bombarded with emails from the owners with a laundry list of busy work tasks,  along with the “but if you want to be furloughed I guess that’s what we’ll do” basically guilt tripping her into being the only employee at work... sigh 

I genuinely think this is causing her to fall into a depression because all she does is go to work and sleep and not feel good when she’s awake. Meanwhile I have two careers and am building her dream car (old mustang) for her in my spare time, trying to spend any time with her is cut very short by her falling asleep the second she sits down at home. 

I’ve talked to her about everything I’ve mentioned here a few times and her answers are always “I don’t know what’s going on” but damnit somethings going on. Something is causing her to feel like garbage and be so tired and I want to try to help any way I can. I don’t expect her to be like me and be able to run off 5hr sleep every night and go full throttle everyday, but 11-13hr of sleep everyday is not only unusual for her, but seems unhealthy to me. Any advice on how I can help her would be appreciated. Thank you. 

[[TL:DR - My GF has had bouts of anxiety throughout our relationship, has a job that I think is causing her to be depressed because she is constantly sleeping when she’s home and sleeps for a long time. Basically work - sleep - repeat - talked to her about it, her response “I don’t know what’s going on” any advice on how I can help or what I can do for her appreciated. Thank you.]]"
706,Anyone else?,"So is anybody else here tired of fighting it? Thinking it’s gone “hey I’m having a good day” then something in the slightest will set you off and you’re flooded with the hopelessness once again that nothing will ever last long enough for it to get any better. This is a dangerous place to be but personally, I’m waiting for the last straw until I physically can’t deal with it anymore I’ll end it. I’m tired, I have zero motivation to try to find something to live for. So... Anyone else?"
707,Messed up Sleeping Pattern,"During this quarantine, I messed up my sleeping pattern. I sleep for 4am then wake up before 12. Then sleep again for 1-3pm, and the cycle repeats. I just feel so tired and unmotivated even though I have work to do. Does anyone have an advice on how will ai get back my sleeping pattern?"
708,Antidepressants,Do you have to see psychologists to be able to have antidepressants? Literally been through two psychs and hated them because they make things worse or try their hardest not to give you the pills. It’s rubbish. Why can’t I just ask for them?
709,Starting to realise my mental health has me living in a cocoon,"There's something very strange about mental.health, you don't particularly feel depressed but you don't feel good either , your stuck on auto pilot , but your not really living . 

Your mental health and deprivation of any form of happiness and normality forms behaviours that only keep you stuck there.

It's only when you start to expand those limits that you start to recognise how.

Part of the issue is most of the time I'm completely on my own these days . I'm in and out of work . Lost contact with all old freinds , and am far from being in a position to want anything that resembles a relationship.

Most of my time is online .
You begin to forget what a fulfilling conversation actually feels like, when you feel alive , 

There's something about mental health , and unrecognised depression your always trying to avoid people and conversation .

Youl never get out of this cycle by pushing people away or avoiding them. Because you only stunt your own self and personality . Before you know it you forget what anything meaningful actually feels like because you are completely out of tune .

Wether you realise it or not or are on autopilot there is always a dark cloud over head , and it just continues to distort perception. 

I've realised that when I can come out of it which is very rarely I start seeing people differently . There personality is more vibrant .

Having a dark cloud always hanging overhead you don't really see people and you pretty much live like a ghost .

How the fuck do you correct this damage to your brain

It's like there has been so much dysfunction ontop of dysfunction ontop of dysfunction I have no clear understanding anymore what caused what , and how my functioning has and is deviated from a happy alive person , all there is is brain fog"
710,My (24M) mental health discovery,"I have gone to several doctors to try and figure out what is wrong/going on in my head. I started by going to a psychologist and after 2 sections he told me to talk to my family doctor about ADHD. So I got to my doctor and she said it may be depression but could be ADHD. Recommended I get another opinion. She said that she could give me a prescription for depression and/or ADHD but I told her no because I didn't want to dilute the pool. So she sends me to the hospital for a 3rd opinion. The guy at the hospital told me to go to counseling for anger issues. Now I have a appointment on Tuesday for counseling. I have looked into depression, anxiety and not likely but could still be bipolar (as several family members have it).

My problems have been restlessness, excessive fidgeting, always on the edge of emotions (mostly anger/frustration), constantly being bored, lack of energy, sort attention span, emotional highs and lows but mostly lows, always stressed.

It has caused problems in the relationship with my GF. She blames herself for the stress I have and it could possibly be but I always tell her it's not her at all.

I am looking forward to figuring all this out but it's still going to be a while I feel."
711,What does it mean when my clinical Psychologist is also a Consultant Psychologist? Is this good? Just noticed on my next appointment letter,Confused
712,"Need advice, I hate taking my medication...","I can't understand why, I just hate taking them.. I have about 4 different medications to take in the morning and at night but I always forget.. 

I think about this a lot, but I can't find 1n explanation why I hate them so much. Maybe it's because I don't feel' normal' having to take them to basically live. 

Generally, I take them everyday for two month then suddenly stop them and let the situation become worse until I just can take it anymore and begin to take them again. 
I've done this like 10 times... But this time I don't want to. I want to really be better. 

I've you got any suggestions on how to remind myself about them or why I seems to really hate them?"
713,What are some ways to recover from trauma?,How can someone recover from trauma/PTSD (self-diagnosed)? Can't see a psychologist right now so I need things I can do by myself. Thanks.
714,I'm afraid that I might be a danger to myself,"The title is a little bit of a lie. I know I am. I don't know what to do about it anymore

none of my friends are able to help me anymore. I've thought about admitting myself to a hospital or something similar but i'm afraid that something's gonna go wrong. I don't know what do do with myself anymore and I have a bad feeling that if I don't do something things aren't gonna go well for me very soon.

I come seeking advice. I don't have any friends to talk to anymore, I don't have a good enough relationship with my parents to feel comfortable talking to them about it, and I don't have anyone else in my family within a 2,500 mile radius. I feel like I'm out of options."
715,why have i never had good therapist?,"kinda weird, but the first time i went to a therapist, i believe i was 8, and she was also my brother's therapist, but for some reason neither of us liked her at all.

the second therapist i had was the school counselor who told my parents everything, even if i said specifically not to tell them.

the third therapist was fine at first, but as i got more comfortable around her she started saying that the panic attacks i was constantly having weren't really anxiety and that i was faking it? she also wouldn't let me have a session without my parents at a certain point, even though i thoroughly stated it made me uncomfortable, and would try to explain to my mom about how i was feeling and what my thoughts were, even though they weren't my thoughts/ feelings, and when i tried to say that, she started saying how it was making my mom upset? 

the fourth therapist i had was from my old school. she didnt work for the school, she was just the only person in the area who would drive there. i hated her ever since she started being my therapist because she had an annoying voice and would treat me like i was a baby, and then keep giving me the same advice for everything, every single time, even after i tried to tell her i tried it and it didn't work. and she would push me to talk about things i didn't want to, to the point where i would have panic attacks.

the fifth therapist i've had is the one i have currently, and is like a school counselor. i'm fine talking to her, but whenever i do i kind of shut off my emotions, and one time my braces broke, and instead of listening to me when i was just trying to say ""hey my braces broke"" and not asking for help. she then proceeded to tell me it would hurt my teeth (it didn't, i could've been able to fix it on my own) and that i needed to go to the school nurses. she was talking over me the entire time as i was trying to explain that i had it under control, and it had happened before, so i shut down. and instead of trying to help or care about what was going on, she said i was wasting her time, and she had better things to do than deal with me. she then forced me to go to the nurse, which made me miss class the next day and got me behind on work.

i don't know why this keeps happening, and my parents keep saying its because i don't like when people know too much about me or that i just have a negative view that affects my experience. 

i guess what i'm trying to ask is how can i find a good therapist?"
716,I hate my brain.,Like literally I can't pay attention or do anything for more than an hour unless I'm doing something else and it makes me so pissed off at myself cause I just want to do something for more than an hour but I get bored and I'm switching between things so often and then my brain will make it seem like the thing I just stopped doing wasn't actually boring so I do it again and then I just rinse and repeat. It makes me so annoyed and just mad at myself .
717,Why do I feel like this,"I can say there are some days where I’m happy, but for the most part I feel empty and depressed . I feel like I’m behind in life wasting time while my peers are pursuing dreams. Ever since I was a kid I’ve felt like others lives are more important than mine. I don’t know if any of you guys can relate, but I just wanted to get this off my chest"
718,I finally got on some mood stabilizers!!!,"I fell of the wagon with meds a year ago after two  different failed SSRI attempts. I felt hopeless and like I would never live a normal life. After a few borderline hypomanic episodes, and some time to kill due to covid, I finally got a doctor to suggest that a mood stabilizer might be for me. I’m cautiously optimistic because she is having me work up to a full dosage over the course of two months, but I really hope that this does more for me. I’m ready after 4 different med attempts to find something that works for me. And if it fails, then I know that something else might be it. I’ve just been secretly wanting to try a mood stabilizer for so long and I’m curious to see how this goes! Wish me luck!"
719,What happened to me today? Did I snap?,"I've been struggling with depression my entire adult life. Lately my boss has been miserable, and has been taking it out on me in passive aggressive ways, tearing me down for the slightest mistakes, purposefully saying things ""under breath"" loud enough for me to hear, then pretending it wasn't bait. This has been grinding away at me and making me bitter. I get depressive episodes more often than ever lately, and I've been having half-assed suicidal thoughts (note: No, I'm not going to commit suicide).

Today, during one of these episodes, I had a common nihilistic thought that NORMALLY makes me even sadder. 

""None of this bullshit matters anyway, in 100 years literally no-one will remember either my boss or me, and no one will ever look back at what a painfully average person I am, and even those who do after my death won't matter because I won't exist to experience their judgement."" 

But this time, instead of sadness, this unnatural feeling of joy and catharsis filled me, coupled with a temporary lack of care for literally anyone else around me. It's like I became a pure nihilistic sociopath for a short time, and what scares me is that it felt like the 'rightest' thing I'd felt in a long time. I knew it was wrong fundamentally, but my body kept sending chemicals into my brain telling me it was right. When I said ""this is wrong"" I was struggling not to smile and it was just empty words. Suddenly all of the employees and my boss were just annoying noises and colors, which is very fucked up because I've known my boss for many years and am extremely close with them. I continued my job like normal, wondering if this would pass, and not wanting to make a mistake that would cost me once my inhibitions came back.

The feeling passed, but it was like I was high or something, I've never felt that way before, and in retrospect it scares me. What happened to induce this weird nihilistic catharsis?"
720,everything feels hazy? literally don't know what's wrong with me.,"i don't know what to do. wtf i just feel exhausted, time feels weird and i can't focus, can't concentrate on anything. it's like a fog has just came over me and left me with no energy. migraines? also, i keep procrastinating. it's like i want to do thing, but i cant do thing even though i'm internally yelling at myself to do the thing. like what? 

at the same time, i can't sleep properly. caffeine / chocolate cravings are up a stupid amount. sex drive is up by a stupid amount. usually am a lot more extroverted, don't feel like seeing people irl much at all. i'm not depressed. yo, like, i just feel stupid, i can't seem to cry, but i feel guilty for not crying because of recent events going on. lmao none of this is logical."
721,I've been crying every single day since quarantine started,"For me that was 8th of March. I'm exhausted, my eyes have a permanent post-crying sting. I cry a lot in general but not like this: every single day at least 3 times for long periods of time.

I feel like a horrible person and a bad friend, I just want to die.

I hate this so much, none of my close friends talk to me, one of them promised they'll call me at least once each week and they haven't even texted me, another one lied to me to avoid me for a week and I found out in the stupidest way possible.

I hate my body and myself so much I can't do this anymore, I didn't want to be part of any of this. I hate how no one will ever care about me the same way I care about them, not even myself. I hate how I know nothing will become of me and my entire life will be horrible but I have to be positive so that I don't drag my friends with me into this. I hate that I can't be a ""normal"" person with normal ups and downs, it's just down down down down

I've been volunteering to help around but I hate that too, I hate it because I don't feel any happiness when helping people even though everyone tells me what a good job I'm doing. I don't want to do it anymore, but at the same time there's not enough volunteers and I can't make myself leave those people because I've seen the situations they're in. 

I've never been suicidal before and I hate that too, I just wish my head would go silent for a minute. Not even in my sleep do I have peace. I broke my 2-month clean streak in the beginning of April and haven't stopped self-harming since then."
722,"I submitted a half assed important assignment due to not starting early enough, and I'm pretty numb and disappointed right now :(","I had an assignment worth 14% of my grade due at 6pm today. I submitted mine at 5:57pm. Really only had the motivation to focus 100% at around 4pm.

It's weird. I'm disappointed in myself, yet I feel okay with it at the same time like it doesn't really matter. Still pretty shocked though.

It's really my fault. We had ample time. I always procrastinate. I should be freaking out as anyone else would. Why am I not caring enough???

I was a straight A student in HS taking all the APs available. I got into a prestigious university. Now I have a 1.7 GPA."
723,Request for info on evaluation without insurance in the U.S.,"I'm searching for info on how to receive a mental evaluation from a trained professional when I have no money to pay for it and no insurance.

This didn't come from abuse or physical trauma or anything like that. I believe my situation is just a product of my circumstances and past decisions.

If anybody can point me in the right direction I would much appreciate it. 

Also please spare me the self harm and suicide info. That's not a symptom or concern I have. My fear rests more in my mental health directly effecting my physical health. To put it clearly, my chest and stomach hurt when my mind wanders, whether I am driving trying to sleep or anytime my mind is not actively engaged.

 No I'm not on drugs, I quit drinking in January (unrelated as I had a cold and have just been drinking hot tea ever since and never really drank much to begin with. At most 2 beers a night right before going to bed) 

I thought I could handle this alone like I do anything else but it's become worse as I try to fight it."
724,"I haven't slept and I feel fucking great. I cant cry and I feel myself deteriorating bit by bit I'm slowly losing it, I'm over the edge","It Could honestly be nothing but I'm not being able to sleep and I'm super energised, but I'll crash and be depressed for days on end and not be hygienic or think of living. Just feeling like I'm in an abysmall of shit emotions and thoughts of getting fucked up"
725,I am putting so much pressure on myself to figure out my life that it is giving me headaches and really stressing me out at times. Any advice?,"I have a ton of interests and I love learning. For years, I have absolutely struggled with picking 1 career or being able to do 1 thing for life. I did a premed track (biology) and cs in undergrad. I am going into software. I enjoy tech and learning about it. However, I feel that is not enough. I want to do something bio/med related. However, medicine is way too limiting for my liking. I feel like any other route would be cutting myself short. I have other interests too. I am not really sure how to balance all of my interests. I love learning and working hard but it really burns me out. My mind races with this stuff. I am struggling with finding balance and my purpose, tying everything together. Can I have some advice?"
726,I just had a huge breakdown,Ive been nonstop crying about all of the things that have been bothering me. Ive kept all those feelings locked inside of me but now they all just came crashing down. I cried for almost an hour and usually when i cry i feel better afterwards but i still feel sad...i also feel so pathetic for crying and feel like i should be stronger :/ but i also feel relieved for finally feeling something since this whole day ive been just feeling soo numb and even thought about cutting myself again but i stopped myself.
727,Has anybodys anxiety made them feel like they cant talk to women or arent as interested in talking to them as much as they were before the anxiety started? Does it get better and will it return to normal?,"My intrusive thoughts and ruminations have made me feel so caught up in my head and such and it just seems like since I started experiencing this anxiety is December that I'm not as interested or going out of way to talk to females right now because I'm so fixated on trying to feel back to myself and normal! Is this common? Does it get better? I'm a 20-year-old male who always enjoyed flirting and chasing women, I've started taking Fluvoxamine 200mg recently and didn't know if maybe that's a cause or not, it also seems like since this anxiety started I'm not as in the mood for watching porn or getting off like I used to be, I'm a 20 year old college male, but I just seem like I'm way to fixated on trying to get over this anxiety and feeling and thinking like my old self! Is all this normal??? Any advice is appreciated!"
728,I've been having hallucinatory encounters with a threatening voice and I don't know what to make of it.,"I've been having infrequent, random ""visits"" from a singular voice lately.  This voice comes at times when I'm most vulnerable, and immediately starts communicate very directly.  He always commands me to harm myself, and whenever I don't comply he screams, and it's one of the most chilling sounds I've ever heard.  During these episodes, I feel very frightened and almost lose control of my body, slipping away into a trance or pulling my hair and acting in sheer panic.  While I can definitely make out the tone of voice of this apparition in my mind, this hallucination doesn't manifest in a traditional sense.  I don't perceive his words like I would any other sound, but I still hear his voice and the sentences he's conveying to me.

I don't know exactly what this could mean, but I am very worried.  I am refraining from self diagnosing, but I still want some background as to what these experiences could mean, and if they're indicative of a disorder.  I do have a history of mental illness in my family, as my grandpa was bipolar.  I'm unsure whether this is psychosis or not, because I'm not experiencing multiple voices all at once, just one.  It's been the same person the last two times. Also, I'm not undergoing any delusions.  What could this possibly mean, and should I seek help?"
729,My Mental Health was getting better,"Before COVID-9 hit hard near me, I was feeling great. I wasn’t calling off of work, I wasn’t cancelling social obligations, I was trying to get in shape, and I was keeping the house and myself clean.
Now my anxiety is so bad I’m making myself physically ill. I have generalized anxiety disorder which is a bitch and a half on a normal day. My normal coping mechanisms aren’t working because I can’t pass my thoughts off as irrational anymore. There’s real fucking danger. My anxiety kicks up my depression, so now I feel fucked. If I get worse and feel suicidal I’m afraid to go to the hospital."
730,Constant obsessive thoughts with no resolve,"So I don't know what I'm really going for here, as I know that you are all strangers on the internet. But here I go.

I guess to start, I'll say that I've been dealing with what I believe to be severe anxiety since I was about 13 years old. I have never once been to a medical professional regarding my mental health and I don't see that as an option for the foreseeable future, and that alone scares me. Having not done that, I have always had a hard time describing how I feel in regards to my mental health issues. Recently I've realized that the way my brain operates is what I would describe as extremely obsessive.

It takes hardly ANYTHING to set me off and to more or less ruin my entire day. Whenever I am alone (I live with my S/O and we have both been out of work for about a month) I pace, nonstop and repeat things in my head or out loud over and over, as if I'm trying to come to a conclusion about these thoughts but I never come to a real conclusion. These thoughts are almost always completely trivial, or at least blown completely out of proportion within my head. They generally relate to something I have said or done at some point in the day, something I have to do, something I want to do, something I feel I've done wrong or fucked up, and the like. If my S/O is around me, I often get overwhelmed by my thoughts and have to retreat to the bathroom to repeat things and pace. There's never any sort of resolve. This has been something I've done for as long as I can remember. 

Once again I don't quite know what i am trying to do here other than vent, or maybe just relate with some of you guys. I don't know what's wrong with me, I don't know if seeking help is worth it or not, I feel as if nothing can help me. This is all extremely unbearable."
731,People here would probably benefit....,"from being less whiny, dramatic and histrionic"
732,Mental Harassment that I can't really speak up about.,"I'm (22F) was about to graduate this May 2020, this being last year of my graduation degree and given the quarantine I'm going through and figuring out a lot of shit, I've been trying to ignore and subside for my mental health sake. 
It all started with second semester into college, I was shamed for leaving my long term high school boyfriend whom i dated for around 2 years. Soon after I got into a relationship with a guy (now 22M) let's call him X, for a short while, this guy didn't use to show up on dates, get handsy with his female friend and talk very low about me in front of others. I left him soon after I got know all these. 
The next semester (third semester) X spent all the time talking shit about me and saying that i cheated on him with my ex. Sad thing is a lot of my close female friends also participated. 
At the end of third semester, one of my classmate (now 23M) let's call him Z, showed up and use to care about me a lot. I had hit rock bottom with all that shit going on. My mental health was all time low, my mother didn't talk to me much and I was getting bad grades. Bad thing is nobody except this guy, actually listened to my side of story. 
Fourth semester of college, I was happy with Z, when shit started getting worse. He was being fed the old shit by X and his friends. Both X and Z, use to live in same hostel and were my college mate. Z defended me for a long time, while all the other people started treating us very bad. Other college mates, formed a block against both of us, talk shit to me publicly and the list is endless. 
Meanwhile, I started getting to know Z better, we started dating, but after few months Z started getting violent. I tried managing this relationship, but it ended up getting more abusive (mentally, verbally and physically). He use to call me slut and how I suck around every guys dick. This went up till a point, where he stealth while having sex and denied cumming inside me. He said he'll rape one of female friends, while we were discussing something she had done wrong with me. He would try every way to control me and get me back into the relationship, but I felt so horribly violated I never went back. 
Z would tell people that I left him alone and use to hold my hand in public forcefully. While all the other people around us kept quite. And later started asking me, ""Why have I left Z?"" 
So last two semester of college (this is tenth semester) , I've been out pursuing my internship in another city, away from such toxic environment. Meanwhile Z, has gotten scholarship for pursuing PhD degree, has done very well in studies and topped the last (ninth) semester. So, all the teachers are all praise for him. As I have been out of that place, I have started healing very well and fast. Got many supportive people around. Still struggling to get back into studying, but I have secured a good position in an research institute to continue my higher studies. 
So,  last four years of constant mental harassment in an relationship by such people, by college mate and also by teachers because of bad grades has reduced me into a pea. I have a very fragile self esteem and confidence in myself. But I'm still working hard to get into Grad school. I'm having a very bad time dealing with so much of mental harassment alone, I have no way let such things out. Let alone ask for help. I just want to break free of this loop and live my life to the fullest and pursue my dream career of scientific research. I have consulted psychologist and resorted to medication also, but that didn't really help much. I use to feel distant while telling all this to my therapist and would end up feeling kicked at the end of the session. It didn't help."
733,Can't take it anymore.,
734,Mental disorders?,"Im definitely not sure but I believe i have the following: bipolar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, psychotic disorder, and anxiety. I really don't want to ask for help irl as i did a while ago but it  only lead to more problems but  I'm also not sure if i should just leave it. Also I don't feel sad nor happy more just neutral but a lot of the time it switches to weird feelings. I also have very strong urges to cut myself and just thinking about it makes me feel tingly and numb on parts of my body, I can't seem to control those feelings. What should i do and should i feel worried? Again I'm not 100% sure i have all of those above.
I live in Canada btw"
735,I'm terrified of death,"I have a really good life, family, freinds, good school, and I never got bored but in lockdown a thought slipped into my head. I can't stop thinking about the fact there is nothing after death and my family will one day be gone. When I'm with my friends or doing something fun I'm fine, but at night trying to sleep or cycling etc. It's always there. I know I should and I will live life to the fullest but I just start panicking and get terrified of it all I just want to think normally again."
736,Why does my self-esteem disappear when I’m in the relationship...,"So I’ve been in my current relationship close to 5 years now. I love him so much, he treats me like an absolute princess and has always supported me, no matter what. Through mental health issues, suicidal ideation, and everything in between, he always tries to make me feel beautiful, smart and special. 

Problem is I pick myself apart constantly, I’m almost 25, and over the years my confidence seems to be slipping more and more. It’s at the point where I can’t stand to have my photo taken, I hate my body no matter what, I think I’m stupid and all my ambitions and goals I once had feel like an impossibility; now that I have no self-confidence. I don’t believe anything I do is good, no matter what anyone says I just don’t think I’m good enough, or talented, and feel like I have to embrace a life of mediocrity - which is saddening. 

Now, I went to drama school to get a qualification so this hasn’t always been the case for me. I obviously never used to have any of these fears, and I truly believed I could achieve anything I put my mind to. I literally dropped out of high school because I was that confident my audition would get me accepted, before I even heard back! I’ve recently come to the realization that every time I get in a long term relationship my self-esteem and confidence starts to dip into oblivion. It happened in my first long term relo, that lasted 3 1/2 years, and he also was very kind to me, never insulted me or anything like that, but it wasn’t until I was single again that I regained my confidence. 

This is the only common denominator I can see, but I can’t understand how being in a relationship, with someone so great, can be such a self-esteem killer?! I don’t want to have to be single to be confident. 

Has anyone else found this? What did you do to Combat it? I seriously can’t live my life with no confidence, it’s horrible for my mental health and it really stops me living my best life. :("
737,I'm 16 stone and eat to feel happy.,"I am a 22 year old female and have struggled with my weight all my life. Currently I am 5 foot 2 inches and just under 16 stone. I have no self confidence and don't want to leave the house. I have suffered with depression and anxiety since I was 15 and put on the pounds since then. I find that food is the only thing that brings me joy and I cant help my self but eat i desperately want to lose weight but simply don't know how. 

In the past I have self harmed and tried to end it all but I honestly think that I have just given up on everything. I just hide inside my house eating and when I have to go out (work) I try and hide myself away as much as possible and talk to no one as I am embarrassed. 

I want help and to be rid of this I just dont know how."
738,Productivity during the lockdown.,"I see a lot of posts where people have been asked to utilise this period well, given tips on how to build some skills, muscle, planning your life and a lot of other things that basically include a lot of discipline. 
Now, utilising your time during the lockdown or in general, is obviously a good thing to do.

However, a lot of you feel pressurised to do something worthwhile and if you fail at it, you end up feeling lost and depressed because you're not part of a rat race which you did not sign up for.

Taking a break is one of the most underrated skill in the world. Know that it's completely okay to do nothing for a while. Your mind and body needs some rest. Am I asking you to be complacent? No, never. But it's genuinely okay you aren't getting those abs or if you haven't set your life plans after the lockdown.

You don't have to compare your journey with anybody else. Your life is just gonna be a series of experiences, it's not a race. Everyone has a different story to tell.

Do not freak out if you're unable to do anything productive right now. You're only human.
While you're at it, there is absolutely no need to hold anything against the ones who are using this time to do the things they love.

Remember you can absolutely do nothing and still stay happy, it's all about acceptance and not worrying. 
Don't fall into the loop of feeling guilty. Rather just embrace your existence and move along your life at your own pace. 

TL;DR : Do whatever you wish to do. Do not judge anybody for what they do. Keep a check on your mental health.


Love y'all :)"
739,Wellness: Video on how to survive the lockdown...,"[https://youtu.be/-GZZnuC5koI](https://youtu.be/-GZZnuC5koI)

Are you jealous of those who seem to have blasted through getting shit done since the lockdown has started? Don't worry! I still don't have a six pack, Mari Kondo is still waiting in my closet and I have certainly not done 30 YouTube videos like I said I would.  No you are not useless! You just haven't dealt with current reality yet. In this video, I show you my 3 steps to go from Procrastinator to Lockdown surfer.  I always say that a breakdown is an opportunity for a breakthrough! And Covid-19 is no exception to the rule.

Please share this video with those you think would benefit!"
740,I can feel,"I’ve seen so many people suffering through this coronavirus pandemic, not being able to see their friends and family. I know it’s a tough situation but I’d like to see more people talk about positive progress towards their mental heath, even if it’s small. 

Ever since this happened. I’ve been more stressed, constantly thinking about the future, worried about my friends and family, wishing there was something to do...

Wait. 
Thinking about the future? Worried about people other than my self? A desire to take action?

These are things I’ve never really felt before. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression before the Coronavirus hit. I was having panic attacks at work and was suicidal. But these past few weeks I’ve been focusing less on me.

What really helped me clear my mind was focusing more on those who are perhaps experiencing anxiety and panic when they never really have, or depression from staying indoors and not seeing people for a long time. It kinda broke that cycle of repetitive negative thoughts and feeling sorry for myself. Not to say my problems are less important, but it’s nice to be that person who’s needed instead of being needy. It’s not like I’m cured, I’ve had good days and bad days. But I’ve been able to find peace more times these past few weeks than I ever had in months. 

I don’t know how long this positivity will last but I’m happy to feel it again."
741,It is hard not to see my breakup as being caused by my mental health collapse,"About two years ago my mental health started falling apart. My old medications stopped working for me and it took me a year after that to get on medications that didn't have side effects that put me in the hospital. My long-distance boyfriend and I stopped talking less because of our conflicting schedules when my medication completely ruined my sleep schedule. I also had nothing going for me, I had to drop out of school and that impeded on my time to be able to visit (and eventually move in with) him. When he broke up with me he swore to me that it had nothing to do with my mental health issues, but that's all I can see it as. We had stopped talking less when my mental health got worse. It's as simple as that to me, except that the distance made things worse. The distance sucked before but did not make it impossible for us to talk to each other.  It's just really hard to have my depression ruin everything for me, I even lost the love of my life. We would've been together for four years next month. I feel like I will never be happy again."
742,I just want to help a friend (she maybe has PTSD?),"**TLDR**: My gf has something close to PTSD, I don't know what to do and I need help to help her.

**HER BACKGROUND/CONTEXT**

I have recently started dating this girl (well quarantine is a bit in the way) and I think that she has some kind of not very strong PTSD. I already knew that she had some kind mental illness due to something during her childhood before I started dating her and I want to help her. I'll be 17 in June and she is 17 (she is 1 grade up, last year high school here so she is pretty stressed out). She had what I believe was her traumatic event when she was 5 and, well, her cousin that was 13 or so sexually harassed her, for all I know it has only happened once. She has told me that her cousin kept giving her ""the looks"" until she entered adolescence (maybe it was the time around when her cousin started getting conscious of his actions). Her father wasn't very supportive either and she once feared him, she fears a lot of people that want to get close (specially new). I think that I  managed to surround that because I'm the ""brother"" (not literally, but we are pretty much siblings) of her best friend. Her parents divorced after having their second child (her little sister) when she was around 8, her sister birthed when my friend was 6 or so (there were already problems in within the couple and I think she blames herself of her parent's divorce). Now she gets along with her father pretty well and lives with her grandma, she told me that she doesn't live with her mum because of the fear of what once happened in that house (i have no idea what happened in that house). She has not yet been able to talk to me much about her father or what happened at what once was her home. I didn't dig this all up, I was there for her so that she could tell me anything and I listened (it's what I believe is best, so that she doesn't fell pressured to tell you, she tells you because she wants it and needs it in some shape or another). Her ex doesn't leave her alone with a lot of Instagram accounts. She gets some flashbacks and as we mainly text i don't know what to do, but she seems to be aware of that and gets out of it  on her own (I feel proud of her because she is strong enough to get her out of it, I don't know why I feel proud of her, maybe I just feel happy). She has asked me why someone like me would get close to her if didn't want to harm her, why someone would love her. I do. I think that she has managed to put on a character to stop herself from thinking about that (in the good way, she loves dancing and she mainly puts that on when she is dancing or in a situation close to dancing \[modern dance\]) She is seeing a psychologist and I know that she has either diagnosed something or is suspicious.

**MY BACKGROUND**

My parents also got divorced but wasn't nearly as traumatic and I also had some incest (a couple of french kisses are the only things that I remember) with my cousin when I was 5 i think and she is 6 years older than me. I have no sequels that I can see from that. It is true that I may think that I may have lacked some love, not because I didn't have it but because I didn't want it. Now I have all the love I need, I express it, I give it and I am grateful to her because of that. I will probably see a psychologist in the future. (my mum recommended it to me also)

**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH**

* I need to know if I'm close enough thinking that she has some form of PTSD. For the information that I have searched she's got pretty much all the PTSD symptoms \[a traumatic event, she tends to avoid some things \[new people in particular\], the ""why would people love me?"", low self esteem\].
* I need to find reliable sources of information about PTSD and other mental illnesses. Mainly big sites where I can keep educating myself.
* I need to know how to act, even though she seems to be able to take care of herself. The more supportive I can be the better. I've not been able to find much about that.
* I need to know if what I'm doing is good enough or even positive. (I think I'm helping her)
* I would love to find a sub where people that know someone that has some kind of mental illness and actively tries to help them shares their stories and most importantly , or make it myself. I think that it would be very helpful to people like me because we eat a lot of shit (like you &lt;3) and we don't know what to do \[maybe I am the helper or something like that\]. I would still keep following that because I think it would help a lot of people (the helpers and the helped).

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you a lot, you do an amazing work in this sub.

TLDR:

My gf has something close to PTSD, I don't know what to do and I need help to help her."
743,Sleep paralysis,Hi i used to have cerebral cramp but not in a severe way just lip shivering in a couple of years i experienced sleep paraylsis with a shivering i am a teenager does that relate
744,Cannot open to my girlfriend about my mental health issues..,"Hi .. when I was young I was beaten up by my parents from an early stage for a long period of time.. I found it hard to socialise with people around me..and never had friends. Have been in several relationships which ended up badly because could never find a girl who'd commit &amp; help..

I was also went to a therapist whilst at school..but did not find that very helpful 

Fast-forward several years, I ended up at university in a different country..I came here for love, together with a girl who seemed to be committed and wanting to help but due to my mental problems I have started over-thinking all sorts of weird scenarios and we had an argument over the phone.. ended up in a foreign country (UK) where I barely knew the language, alone ... and fall into a deep depression which I never came out from..

&amp;#x200B;

A year and half later I met this girl who was perfect.. smart, also came from a different country so understood my struggles, we got along well for some times until my mental issues, anxiety &amp; bipolarism.. mood swings came up again..  However, what I felt for this girl and the way she made me feel helped me fight this although it has been mentally draining .. did not want to eat.. I was feeling weak because of this fight I had everyday to try to hide this from her.. We ended up being together until yesterday.. 5 years and 17 days.. as we got through the relationship it got harder for me to fight this so I started over-reacting, over-thinking.. always been in a bad emotional state.. but couldn't ever open about to her about my problems, in fact I was blaming her..

After many fights and arguments she had enough of my bullshit(I don't blame her.. I made her life so difficult) .. but now after she left me it is not worth living for..anything This girl was perfect, out of everyone I met she was the only one who managed to make me want to fight this.. but the burden of not opening up to her about it led to a lot of fights...mean arguments..

I am now worse than any point before.. I even had thoughts of suicide ..but still find it hard to open about my mental health..which I believe started when I was very young..I don't want to lose her but she is now more serious than ever before..I don't want to live anymore I stopped eating and drinking water for past 24h and I am in a terrible mood.."
745,After life,"Recently I’ve been questioning myself a lot about life/reality and what might come after our time on earth has come to an end. Reincarnation, Heaven/Hell, waking up from a simulation and simply nothingness. Its come to the point where its literally all i think about, I’ve come attracted to the thought of death and what might be after it. Please note i am not contemplating suicide or ever have, I am just lost in a loop of questioning my life and everything around me i feel like im going insane questioning what might come after our life and if whats after our time here might be better then whats happening here in my life. I dont know what do to just stop thinking about this, its taking over my life."
746,(M22)y girl(F19)riend is falling seriously hard,"Okay so full disclosure i live in nz we are on our 4th week of lock down because of the virus. She is a nurse for the elderly living in the retirement home to minimise exposures. Most of what im talking about is a direct symptom of this lock down. After talking last night she confessed things have really been going bad she sends this after breaking down:

""I’m so depressed right now. I’m drinking every time I get a chance, I take triple my normal dose of anti depressants, I take some anti agitation pills from work and sleeping pills, Bella has me addicted to weed and when we drink she offers me mdma and I’ve been taking it, I’ve started smoking again. I’m a huge mess rn""

The anti depressant is fluoxetine taking originally 20mg, the Bella she refers to is a friend of hers also in lockdown with her. Before this lockdown she had not tried MD or Weed and her biggest concern was telling me about it.
I've always tried to express that she can come to me with anything but it seems that she doesn't beleive me. I just want to know how address this in a helpful way"
747,Paranoia?,"Whenever I’m walking down a quote street by myself, or I’m alone in the house, or at school. I’m always turning around to check if someone is following me. I’m definitely not the most popular person at my school, I always feel like people are talking about me behind my back, idk if they are tho. Sometimes I’ll hear voices and I won’t know if they’re real or not... I’m 16M. Has anyone experienced anything like this? Would these be some signs of a type of paranoia?"
748,Triggered and I’m rambling nonsense,"I started watching mental hospital tik toks tonight and now I feel upset and panicky, I feel like they’re gonna take me away. That they’re gonna stick needles into me and stuff?? Idk but I hate it i hate it I hate it get it out of my head please 
I want to forget the hospital I never wanna go back EVER AGAIN I hate the hospital I don’t wanna go back please I just wanna be with the dreamfinder rn (this is gonna make no sense), i see him and figment and I think I belong there. I belong with them there, WHY AM I NOT THERE PLEASE LET ME BE THERE I’m crazy but thinking up stories and imagining people being with me has always been a thing for me. Ever since I was little. I don’t know why I feel so strongly about this and I’m probably gonna embarrass myself posting this anyway lol but I need to vent my mind is everywhere rn I’m sorry feel free to ignore me. 
I lost almost all of my friends. I messed up badly with her I love her and I want to be with her I tried apologizing but she doesn’t wanna be friends with me cus I fucked up so badly but I love her so much dreamfinder why are you not here? Why did you go away? I miss you dear please come back."
749,PTSD and hallucination,"I had a break-in in 2017 and ever since my life has changed, I used to be carefree and not worried about getting hurt or attacked but now I'm having a mental breakdown and idk what to do, I'm feeling helpless. After the break-in I moved and sought therapy because I had  panic attacks after I moved in.i had been in therapy for over two years  until  January and  went off my meds in November but now I think I'm having a mental breakdown or relapse of the PTSD. For over a year or so now I been hearing voices in the attic of my apartment building through the vents of my apartment  Idk if what I'm hearing is real or a hallucination. I've had the  apartment manager  check it out with the maintenance worker and he said that there was no one  up there so now either  I'm having hallucinations or the people in the attic very good at going undetected. The voices are bothering me so much that I can't fall asleep tonight every time I try to I hear the voices or other noises up there I'm also seeing lights on the wall while watching TV at night because I watch TV with lights out at night so idk if I actually have a stalker living in the attic or my mind is going insane. Idk what to do I feel like I'm out of options,  TBH I rather the stalker be real then to be having audio and visual hallucinations."
750,Why do I still care so much?,Growing up I was an only child and pretty lonely because of that. Due to that I cared a lot about what other kids thought of me. I wanted them to like me and I was terrified of criticism from them. Terrified to the point where it could be described as obsessive. In middle/high school my friend group used to bully me a lot but I just stuck with them because I was afraid they would   talk about me to others and because I was just so desperate for friends. Now that I’m older I find myself being more of a loner and I should be done caring what others think. But I just can’t get over my anxiety over what others reactions would be if I acted like myself. I’m just so scared and I don’t know how to stop.
751,Boredom - is that a thing?,"I suffer from boredom i dunno if thats a thing, perhaps it is, maybe someone could shed some light or post a link with relevant info thanks"
752,My mental state has taken a nosedive,"At the time of writing i am currently 15, and life for me over the past two years has been painful. I suffer from ADHD, ADD and depression, and have suicidal thoughts, but i just cant bring myself to do anything to myself and how it would effect people who care for me, I have a good family aswell as a good life and friends who seem to care about me... but i just don't want to exist anymore. please help

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for poor grammar at the moment, i'm extremely tired and just want some advice

I don't have much to say besides this."
753,I’m detained under the Mental Health Act and was told that it’s as simple as acting normal to be let out,"I can’t act “normal” which is why I’m here in the first place.

People are quick to criticise things that they don’t understand. Why would you be so determined to make others feel inferior? What’s the point? Is that the only way these dipshits can feel good about themselves?"
754,Saw a vulgar video then Idek what happened after (warning - gruesome details),"Alright be me it’s 5 am I’m on my phone on fb and I keep seeing all this terrible shit about conflict and pedos in power so I’m getting all charged up letting the FB algorithm do it’s trick and I hop on this website that only has shocking content and I see a video titled “dog eats off alleged rapists wangus” and I’m like well he’s a rapist it can’t be that bad but I was grossly mistaken. I was watching looking in his eyes and I started to feel his hopelessness and fear. My heart started to race, and I got the spins. I closed the video but it wouldn’t stop it had just got more intense and I started sweating and my ears were ringing I woke up my gf in a hurry and told her to come outside. I stumbled out the door and fell over. I felt myself like falling in to a dream and I had to fight to stay with reality. I could barley hear my gf talking to me over the ringing in my ears. My skin was glossy and I had sweat drops on my forehead (mind you it’s around 45f outside) but the cold air kinda helped me breathe I started to steady myself and came back inside. This has happened before but I have no idea what it is. I can’t think of anything particular that would make me do that or trigger me to freak out. Idk I’m just here for insight thanks everybody 🙌🏻👍🏻"
755,It's been a tiring journey but my friend has finally decided to open up.,"So it's been some time she's been through some things along her way along with her heart problems and her depression. It's been some time and she agreed to me she'd open up to a therapist. However, because of the events ongoing, it's hard to get a physical therapist. Also, our country does not provide mental health help too good. 
Just want to ask if online help is as good as the physical therapy  and if so, what are some good sites I can access for help."
756,I need a little help please,"Hey there, first of all, sorry if my english isn't that good, it's not my first language.
So, I have a problem I think. Ever since I graduated from I guess the equivalent to highschool last year I did close to nothing. I did try out going to university and dokng an internship at a kindergarten and I've been kind of trying to find something.
I say kind of because I don't do it as actively as i would like to, because I don't have the motivation.
Now I am not someone who likes to talk about my problems and I get really anxious and cannot really talk when I get confronted with my problems, basically I freeze up like a scared animal.
That has led to a rather bad situation in where my parents think I don't trust them and stuff on multiple occasions and the other day, when I tried to talk to my mother, and asked why she didn't involve herself with my problems as much as she used to, she said she can't handle it and doesn't want me to see her crying again. Basically she said she can't handle my Problems either, deal with it yourself. Noe this wouldnt be too bad if there wasnt quarantine and everything, because I was supposed to already get therapy right now.
But now I am stuck at home with a father that doesnt understand why I dont do anything and shouts because of that and a mother who cant handle the situation and acts like nothing is wrong and I am angry because of that and would like to know wheather I should tell her that I want her to help me even if she has to cry, or wheather I should accept it and wait for professional help.

Tldr: My mom can't confront me and acts like everything is fine because she cannot handle the situation (my anxiety) and needs to cry and I want to talk to her but do not know if I should respect her wish not to talk or should be selfish because I need her and am angry at her for not wanting to cry in front of me

Probably not even that big of a problem, but quarantine sure makes it feel big"
757,Confronting Myself about my looks.,"Holy shit this is fucking difficult. Hey everyone, so I’m about 17 years old and I’m insecure af about my looks. Even though I look fucking good. I got green eyes, good hair, great skin there’s honestly no problem I’m pretty fit too but whenever I see my pictures it just makes me hate myself. It is definitely not normal because I can’t take even take selfies I only focus on the bad things about it and it just fucking aches you know I’m tired of it and this point I don’t wanna shave everytime I wanna take a photo and I defo don’t wanna wash my hair like 4 times a day. Its getting out of control and I can’t really talk about it to anyone because these beliefs I hold are not true but they drive me insane so if anyone else is going through this please leave a comment because it is fucking lonely and I need to talk about it to someone and feel good because I don’t know what’s that like. Thank you for reading it means a lot :)"
758,I want to do nothing or everything - there is no between,How to deal with random energy busts and wanting only to be on my phone?
759,16M- how do i tell my parents i have mental health issues with them understanding,"I have 3 mental health issues
1.anxiety 
2.panic disorder
3.antisocial personality disorder e.g. psychopathy 
only one of these is proven by a online therapist, but the others came pretty obvious to me from school life and growing up
i think becuase of my anxiety im scared to tell my parents, afraid of what they will say, i have tried once but they laughed and thought i was just over reacting 
does anyone know how i can tell them with them understanding"
760,Is there a licensed psychiatrist that can help me?,"Due to quarentine and me not having a car I can't go to the nearest psychiatrist (which is 40 min drive away). I've failed to find an online one that accepts insurance. I seriously need a diagnosis, I've talked to therapists for years but never had an actual diagnosis. So I haven't been able to take the correct meds are anything to help my problems. 

I believe I problems are quite common but they just seem to get worse and worse. My anxiety has caused anxiety attacks, I've struggled with depression in the past, scopophobia runs my life, and I've had to deal with a very mean mom who doesn't believe she's mean at all if I try to talk to her about how she acts.

It's been too long since I've talked to an actual therapist and I'd like to be able to vent to someone again"
761,A dating site for mentally ill people: join me there!,"(This is not self promotion, I'm sharing a suggestion)

Just registered to No longer lonely, because I'm feeling bored and wait for it...: alone. I love the concept of this community, we can find people who understand us in our daily struggles and vice versa. 

The problem is that there are only a few people online and I noticed that only a small number of subscribers were recently active, so join me there guys!"
762,I was used and lost my sister and I’m so lost,"The end of last year, December, I reconnected with the girl I had loved for the past 4 years. She finally decided to notice me during this time and led me in a relationship in which I did everything I could to make this one sided relationship maybe work for us, as I struggled to find any way to make us work out together, for the only person that could brighten my days. As she was extremely emotionally neglectful and attempted to disregard the relationship multiple times, I later learned she never loved me and was in a different relationship with the person she loved. Naturally, I was destroyed.

Fast forward a month or two, my sister had been living with myself and my parents for the past year or so, and had demonstrated the attitude and selfishness of a badly behaved elementary school student, hurting my parents as well as myself to extreme emotional levels (me and all my siblings were homeschooled for a large part of our lives, extremely close as a result). We continued to love and support her in positive things and tried to help her. Throughout this time she started seeing a man again that both she herself admitted to disliking, and admitted he really was quite a horrible person. After a long period of hope that she would recover, and pain seeing her dive down, she made her decision to leave our entire family permanently and run away with him, never to talk to us again.

Before my sister I had been able to grieve, to process the pain I felt from my first love, but after she left and I first heard of it, I broke down in a way I never have before. After (regrettably) losing my mind and wailing in pain heh, I haven’t been able to feel much of anything. My body feels like it is rejecting all positive emotion and I get outbursts where the pain leaks and I panic and can’t control my breathing. Other times I sit and struggle to think of anything but disappearing forever. I have tried on a few occasions to put myself into a coma, and failed, clearly. But I don’t know how to go on like this. Even my thoughts and judgement on matters is extremely impaired, I’ve struggled to comprehend complex emotions and scenarios, and I lack much of the will to do many things I used to be so driven to do.

I don’t even understand what to ask for at this point anymore. I know I should look to the light and know it’s not forever, but every day it’s getting harder to find that light. If you guys have any advice, please help me."
763,I do nothing all day but I am stressed due to body dymorphia.,"I am becoming more and more obsessed with how I look. I spend nearly all day with that topic.

I am stressed right now. 

I am rather below average looking. I have some pretty ugly features. (Please no pity telling me how I am fine etc.) But due to that, I am so afraid to go outside, as I fear people judging me.

I also feel like everyone who looks like me is depressed. I feel like I am destined to be sad.

HOW DO I RELAX?"
764,Please read...,"Believe it or not, I know who you are.I know what you’re thinking as you pass a group of guys on your way to class. I know how you feel when you take three hours to pick the perfect outfit for a night out with friends. I know what runs through your head on those sleepless nights when you feel alone and worthless. Girls get the feeling. We all know the feeling. I understand that you don’t think you’re pretty enough, skinny enough or good enough. I understand when your face isn’t clear and your skin isn’t perfect. I understand when your hair just isn’t working out and your makeup isn’t its best.And yes, we glance over at the group of girls that started laughing the minute we walked by them.Oh, and we feel like crying too when they continue to stare at us.The world thinks it's because we are shy or quiet. It’s not that at all. We aren’t the ones with the problem. The world has the problem.It is not okay to say everyone is different, and then have size zero models walk down a runway. It is not okay for stores to only carry up to a size large. It is not okay for the idea of what “a perfect woman” is to be put into the minds of girls because in reality, there is no such thing.So know this. You are beautiful. You are kind. You are caring. You are strong. You make people smile and you have people that love you. You are amazing. You are you.Your skin, your face and your hair do not define you. Your body shape does not define you. Those girls laughing and staring do not define you.

You define you. I love you. &lt;/3"
765,I had a bizarre dream last night,"So, I have dreams that I believe are often symbolic but sometimes, I don’t understand them. Last night, I had a dream that I got pregnant in high school (I’ve graduated), and that I almost had an abortion but I decided to put my baby up for adoption and then I couldn’t stop crying because I missed him. And then I got pregnant again and I almost gave the second baby up as well, but the doctor told me that the baby had a broken leg and that she was suicidal (I know, that’s VERY weird) and that it would be better for me to have an abortion, so I did. And for some reason afterwards, I was still grieving over the baby I gave up but I knew it was for the best. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar depression and I’m on a new combination of meds, including lexapro. Could it have anything to do with that or could it mean something, metaphorically?"
766,My mother is getting a little too worried about me. [Warning mentionings of suicide],"I'm not sure this is the right place for this but...



For context I recently purchased my first firearm this week, nothing special just a double barrel 12 gauge. I thought it was kind of cool and I was pretty excited about it. I took it home, assembled it and wanted to show my parents this cool new thing I bought. 



This is the part in the show where my mother has a break down.


I brought it over in a carrying case and when I opened it up to show them, my mom had an expression as if I had laughed and put the barrel in my mouth, which of course I did not do.


My father thought it was kind of cool since he has a few guns in the safe. However, now my mother is calling and texting much more frequently than is normal and if I don't respond almost IMMEDIATELY she starts to get concerned to a point she starts hyperventilating. I missed a phone call because I was taking a nap and she drove over to my house, let herself in unannounced, was panting sweating, shaking and looked as if she had been crying. 


To her credit, shes my biological mother so that does warrant A LITTLE bit of concern if I wasnt answering my phone. HOWEVER, she has been calling me three times a day and texts me every couple of hours asking how I am or what I'm doing, not too actually talk to me but literally just to make sure I respond.


I have had bouts with depression in the past but I can confidently say that thankfully I am no where near suicidal. I honestly just wanted this shotgun because I think it's cool. Neither my sister, father, nor myself can get her to calm down at all.



TL;DR - my mom calls me, or just appears at my house, three times a day because I bought a shotgun and shes scared beyond reason that I'll turn it on myself. I won't."
767,I hate my life,Fuck my life. I’m so alone and so so unhappy.
768,I hate my fucking mom.,She makes me feel like shit. I can’t wait to move out. She’s a fucking bitch.
769,My plan to get better.,"I've been having issues with my mental health ever since I was 10, I'm 18 now and things have only been getting worse. The two biggest things that make everything harder are school and my household.

School stresses me out so much, it makes me physically ill, i have a lot of trouble starting/working/finishing things due to my lack of motivation and difficulty to concentrate on anything besides suicide.

This got me get stuck in this endless cycle of: having trouble doing work &gt; getting stressed &gt; getting sick &gt; missing school &gt; missing more work &gt; losing motivation &gt; ... and everything all over again.

My household and ""family"" are even worse, they are incredibly toxic, they see ""weakness"" as one of the worse possible thing and don't see mental illnesses as real. (I'm not going to get in to many details about them right here but i hope you get the point) Their lack of support and insults towards my ""weaknesses"" have been pushing my limits for a while now.

I've always thought i had to do everything thing at once, move out, get a job, study and get better, but I've realise that that's going to be really hard, probably impossible for me
So here is what i hope i can do:

1. Finish school.

2. Get help from social aid (don't know if that's the right term in English) to get out of this house as fast as possible, hopefully they'll understand my situation and provide me with a place to stay and food as I'm probably unable to hold a job for over a week. Any tips would be really nice. (I live in Belgium, social aid and similar things are pretty big and usually pretty helpfull here)

3. Finally be able to get the medical attention that I've needed for years like therapy, a diagnosis, meds maybe and even for physical issues like new glasses, getting my teeth fixed, getting my legs issues fixed. (universal healthcare)

4. When i managed to cope with my issues, I'll get a job (part time if i can) provide for myself and start learning about what i really want to (maybe university)

5. Become independent (the dream) but if i can't hopefully I'll be fine with my job and do freelance on the side or get a job in that field.

6. Be okay with life.

Oh god this i long, i don't even really know why I'm posting this, probably just for myself. I'm a little fearful at the possibility that i have bipolar personality disorder and that these 'ideas' are just some mild mania delusions or maybe that's what my depressive thoughts are trying to make me think, either way I'm probably overthinking here. I'm lucky to be born in my country, there's a lot of help at my disposition and unlike my parents taught me, i shouldn't be afraid/ashamed to ask for it.

What ever happens hopefully one day I'll be able to look back at this, smile and say that I'm okay with life."
770,im a pathological liar,"ive been aware of my skills to lie ever since i was a kid. i dont mean to brag but i am also aware that i am quite intelligent, understanding complicated and complex situations that also started in a very young age. i also can analyze and deeply comprehend people's behavior and mindset thus, putting me into the advantage of knowing their weaknesses and soft spots in order to help me pull off a great lie. this has been going on for years and i just realized recently how serious this actually is and that ive gone too far. i get stupid and dumb when it comes to assessing myself. what do i about this? i want to get better."
771,I had a severe mental breakdown - I got erratic and I started hitting things,"My dad had a conversation with me this morning about the future.  Im in school for cyber security. He told me that i need to find a job for the summer, the problem is that I want to find an internship in my field. However, it’s been really hard to do so because of the coronavirus. Last place I want to work is in retail or fast food because I had nothing but bad experiences working there and i really want to advance myself. I don’t want to be that person going for a degree in cyber security and have a min wage job at a retail store, I feel to ashamed doing so.

I’ve tried so hard to find an internship but no luck so far. That’s to be expected since internships are hard to find and jobs in cyber security are hard to find in an entry level. I had a mental breakdown because of the argument that happened between me and my dad over the subject matter. I’ve been having mental breakdowns at least once a week because of my stress levels.

My mental breakdown was so bad. I screamed erratically, I began hitting things, I began kicking. You may ask why I did this, and this is why:

Im so sick of the pressure of having to be perfect. To be the best student, do get an internship, To have a perfect body. I can’t handle all this pressure. I have so many built up emotions, and it’s gotten worse since I’ve had to stay inside. All those emotions just came out all at once. I hate myself for everything. I can’t see any reason to be happy again. I got off my meds because they weren’t doing it for me anymore. I feel like i don’t belong in my major despite me being very passionate about it and getting A’s and B’s in my classes.  I get that there are idiots in every job but I don’t want to carry the shame of working in retail when I could do something in my field to advance myself.

How can I handle this? And how do I prevent myself from having mental breakdowns?"
772,Quarantine has me (accidentally) off my antidepressants and I feel wrong,"I don’t know if this is the right place but I felt a strong inner persuasion to reach out. I’m 26, F, was taking sertraline for about a year and a half and not leaving my apartment for a few weeks has thrown off everything. My sleep schedule is backwards and mainly non existent. My hygiene routine is also basically non existent with maybe 1 shower a week. I’ve just mainly forgotten due to sleeping through the day to take my medication and I’m starting to feel...weird. I’ve had a long, long battle with mental health and feel I didn’t start to become a self aware and functioning human until I was 24? 25? I don’t have much consciousness of my life before and have struggled with, mainly mentally, abusive parent(s) growing up, jumped into a three year hell hole of an abusive relationship, jumped in to an even worse one with r*pe, and then finally started to fix my life and start down a path of self discovery and spirituality. I felt like I was finally meeting myself for the first time. Life was going good for once. Recently with the pandemic, I haven’t been working. The past three weeks was voluntary off of work because I’ve been stressed and was going to take a week of vacation at this time anyways just because I needed a break and my job couldn’t afford to give hours to people. Losing my routine has messed so many things up. In the past few hours I’ve gone on a journey back into my past, dug up some memories, and I guess started not identifying with myself anymore, feel like a stranger. And I’m confused and a little scared. I feel like I’m in a dangerous place, on the edge of a spiral. I have no actual friends or valid connections to reach out to. Over the past year I have prided myself on my independence and how strong I have been and happy I have been going being alone and not needing anyone, but I think right now that’s all back firing on me. I feel so lost and confused. I need back on track."
773,I need help with my mental health,"Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing well during these trying times.
Well first let me tell you about myself 
My name is Reece, I am 19 and I’m from Ireland
I’m a college student.
Now on to the problems I have been having 
Well for starters my mental state isn’t the best, I live in a nice household but my parents are sorta mentally and verbally abusive, and the environment I live in isn’t really helping me at all.Most days I feel down for reason at all and it’s really annoying me and getting to me.My online friends are really concerned about me and told me not to talk to them until I receive the help I need and come back as a changed man, and that’s hurting me.
I would also like to mention that I was verbally bullied in high school for 6 years and it was really bad at one point out I was having suicidal thoughts, but lucky enough got rid of them.
Recently with online friends I have been get angry and pissed off because my sense of humour is well not the best , I am very sensitive and defensive person and sometimes lash out at people when I shouldn’t, but I am a very supportive and caring person and I like to help and talk to people when they are in need.
Thanks for reading, and any help and advice will be really helpful 
You can either comment or pm me, thanks !!"
774,Weird feeling,"So I’ve been dealing with this feeling for years now, (Like about 5-6 years i believe), and I don’t know how to describe it properly to make myself and others understand. The symptoms I’ve been feeling are:
• feeling useless
• numb feeling
• head feels light
• feeling as though I’m not real
• not caring if anything bad happens to me
• constant sadness for no reason

I’ve been searching up a few disorders but theres only a few that can semi describe how I feel. I have so many things that I can do and look forward to yet I always find myself feeling down. I haven’t seen a doctor yet since I can’t describe or give a name to how I feel. 

Has anyone ever felt like this? Do you have any solutions or a name for how I’m feeling?"
775,"Being rejected isn't the best, but i actually feel good","So I kinda tried to talk to this person who I thought might be cool to talk to, anyway so it doesn't seem like the are interested in talking, i'll try one more message later on, but the thing is I was kinda anxious and nervous cause of the anticipation, although right now I actually feel ok, like idk, so like I actually kind feel goodish, so I don't have a ton of irl friends so I generally people i text who are irl make me nervous, and I kinda get clingy to their attention, although I to make it enjoyable, but the thing is like tbh I doubt the whole friend thing is gonna work with this person, but it made me feel kinda independent I guess, its hard to describe, and being independent feels a good bit better then needing peoples attention, so I like independence, although I kinda seesaw between that and dependence, its probably cause I don't really have any relationships that are adequately giving me what I need, and when I come to a realisation I go solo, then as time goes by I think about people more and more, and the cycle repeats, its interesting stuff"
776,I feel bad for no reason and I can't handle my stress,"I have been feeling extremely bad for like 4 months (November-february) because I had obsessive thoughts about death and I couldn't stop thinking about it, and it was terrible, I felt like I had lost control over my life.

Now I feel pretty chill about all of that, but these last weeks I feel bad for no reason. Is like a feeling deep inside me, I try to feel fine but I am always worrying about something. And I feel like I cant handle stress or anxiety situations and my answer to them is very disproportionate. I think I'm having some anger issues again. It maybe is because of what has happened to me these last months, and I don't feel calm anymore."
777,I feel like I can't do anything,"Does it ever happen to you, when approaching a task (it might be technical, it might be talking to someone or just doing  hores around the house) that you just feel **OVERWHELMED**?

It's just like, feeling there's no chance I'd succeed doing whatever it is, and there's no point and I should just quit before i start.

You know.. like feeling completely unable.. like I can't do anything. And this feeling accumulates. I just avoid doing mostly anything and have a general feeling of incompetence."
778,feel like i can’t do this,My anxiety and depression are so bad.  I guess it’s stress but i’m always dizzy and that triggers my hypochondria and it’s like I can’t do anything anymore !!  My mom doesn’t want anything to do with me because of all this(which is fine because she’s always been abusive towards me anyways lol) and my dad doesn’t know how to help me.  It’s so bad today and idk what to do because i’m home alone and I can’t afford to go to the doctor again....... I used to get episodes like this in the past but I could always just shrug them off but the past 6 months it’s like I can’t anymore ???  Like there’s no off switch.  Any advice ?  I’m very depressed and dizzy rn and I need help lol
779,Anyone wanna make friends?,"So I’ve got to the point of lockdown where I’m struggling, don’t talk to loads of people and needing some motivation back in my life. Does anyone know any good online games or platforms to find new friends, just wanna laugh and enjoy myself a bit more!"
780,How to hide fresh self harm cuts?,I just cut my left arm around 20 times and I have no idea of how I’m gonna hide this from my family... Any suggestions?
781,I have anger issues and some sort of extreme self hatred. I am so tired of this and it causes harm to me. I’m 17 and i have been to this therapist since i was 14. I recently opened up about my anger issues. I got disappointed by her reply,"She said «the next time you get mad, try counting to ten or inhale» but the thing is, it’s so explosive i can’t control it. I really need help with it but she doesn’t see it or when i explain it to her she does not understand. Or so it seems. I’m gonna explain this. Okay so i was going to take the bus today, but i missed them both because i’m so fucking messy and have no order whatsoever. Can’t plan for shit. I got so frustrated with myself and i got so mad and this anger just exploded. It was directed towards me and my messy side. I slapped myself repeatedly and really hard. I snapped out of it and threw myself towards the bed and screamed inside a pillow. I noticed i snapped my neck muscles after those hard slaps. I started crying because i want help with this and i’m so tired of living with this and i don’t think it’s normal. What should i do? FYI: i have a past of self harm and cutting. Might explaining some things."
782,Cognitive troubles and recognition,"Hello.

And also i accept any advice on how yo cope. Cognitive troubles have altered my life and functioning for years, what do i do now ?"
783,Rationality + Empathy = Reasoning,"Rationality: Cogito ergo sum.

+

Empathy: Life is suffering.


=&gt; Reasoning: Cog ergo Victoria.

---

Note:

""Life is suffering."" is not about rationality and therefore easy to process incorrectly.

""Cogito ergo sum."" is not about empathy and therefore easy to use incorrectly.

People who cannot follow this argument either lack rationality or empathy and therefore lack reasoning capability.

What should we do about this?"
784,"PSA: In this time where mental health is very important, be kind to your therapists/mental health services. They are people and are also affected by this stressful time.","As someone who has a healthcare worker in the family who is doing telemedicine for mental health, their phone is ringing off the hook, and they feel obligated to take calls at all hours of the day/night and weekends. This is really hurting their own mental health, and although they could simply not pick up the calls, they deem this unethical/denying someone in need. 

Blessings to everyone and be safe"
785,Alternatives to talk therapy,Who else feels like therapy just triggers a lot of bad memories and they don’t wanna do it? Because I know that in therapy I talk about the worst things that I could think of that have happened to me for an hour and while I’m still in my thought process my therapist will say “ OK your session is done time to go home “ but I’m still fully upset about what we’ve been talking about like how are you just gonna make me upset by making me talk about a subject that is very hard and then send me home for the week? My family always noticed that therapy days and the day after were the worst days because it put a focus on my issues and traumas. I know the whole point is to talk about it but what do you do when you spent three years talking about it and you still don’t feel relieved? It’s not like I feel distressed with a lot of things but it’s almost like something that my therapist will say is traumatic it’s like nothing to me so I guess maybe they’re concerned that I’m not having the emotional reaction I’m supposed to be having to these events but either way why would I make myself upset about something I’m not upset about? I  don’t think I liked talk therapy that much so what are some alternatives? I know they say that talking about things help but I don’t want to talk about it I want to move on I spent three years in therapy talking about it all they ever did was trigger me not help me
786,Something is happening during panic attacks (etc) and idk what it's called - any help?,"Hey y'all!

Recently, when I have a panic/anxiety/dysphoria/etc attack, this thing will happen where I'll kinda freeze in place, space out completely, and feel like I'm not experiencing what's going on (but from within my own body - I just don't feel the bad feelings that I would normally feel in this situation, I simply notice them happening).

This has come alongside these attacks happening more often and usually more severely than before (probably due to self-isolation).

I plan to discuss this with a mental health professional soon, but, to get me started on the right foot, would anyone simply be able to tell me if there's an official/medical word for what I'm describing here?

I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, just a vague idea I can take to my therapist so that we can discuss it in more detail and talk about strategies or solutions.

Thanks in advance! :)"
787,"I puke when stressed out, is this normal?",If it's relationship or friendship problems or just stress in general I feel extremely nauseous and have to run to the bathroom to throw up. As soon as I'm done puking all of my stress goes away and I can go back to doing what i was doing. Is this normal?
788,Does anyone remember Laura lejeune,There was a youtuber who made lgbt and mental health support videos around 2013-2016.  I used to be huge fan but then all her contacting and social media was removed.  Does anyone know what happened and why she made that decision? I really hope she’s doing well.
789,"I tried running in order to improve my mental health, because everyone said exercise makes you feel better. Somehow it’s caused me to have a big dip in my mood.","I apologize that this is long and pessimistic, I just need to get it off my chest.

I’ve been running for over a month at least 3-4 times a week and I have tried to remain positive and optimistic and I felt alright about it at the start but now, even when I go out positive and happy to be doing it, I return feeling terrible. I hate people seeing me, I try and remain happy about my progress even though it’s little to non, but as soon as I get back I feel embarrassed and terrible. On top of everything I struggle to get ready some days because I don’t like seeing myself in the mirror, so just getting ready for a run really bothers me. I  really have tried my best to remain positive and happy, but it feels like my brain has engulfed running and turned it into something to feel self conscious about and stress about. The times I have pushed myself to go out when I really don’t feel good, I have ended up crying in public and feeling beyond embarrassed. I really don’t know what to do to make this better because I started running to improve my mental and physical health, but it appears like my mental health has defeated running instead. It’s now something I feel like I’ve latched onto to feel worse because it’s making me think about my body more than ever and instead of just having a lazy day and feeling ok, I feel like a failure and pathetic for not going out. 

The clear solution seems to be that I should just stop, but I felt so happy and positive about getting good at something and being healthier because i was ashamed I didn’t exercise, but my brain just won’t let me. I really cannot stress I have tried so hard to remain positive and resilient, but as I said I just embarrass myself in public when I’ve tried to push myself."
790,I wish I was older.,"I can’t do anything I want to cause my parents are stopping me. I want to start going to the gym but my dad just says that it’s not good for your mind, and something about how everybody who goes to the gym are weight and body obsessed. I can’t workout at home since we don’t have any tools to use and I lack the motivation to workout at home.

I haven’t exercised in a year.

I hate where I live. It’s always so cold and dark, and it’s making my mood so much worse. I want to leave my country so I can move to some place warmer, maybe the southern parts of America or southern Italy/Spain. I would do that if I was able to, but again, my parents are stopping me. 

Life is so fucking boring. I have nothing to look forward to, and nothing to live for. 3 years is too much time. 

Nothing ever feels real. I don’t know what the fuck I’m supposed to do. Help."
791,I'm stressing about schoolwork cause I'm failing all my classes,"Since December, I started feeling depressed. I come from a very conservative family and they don't believe in therapy at all, so that sucks. I used to be a straight A student but I started sleeping in class, I stopped paying attention, I barely studied, and my grades are slipping. The past few weeks I didn't do shit for school and I have exams in a month and 2 weeks, and I don't study for anything. remember those are 10 exams and I already don't understand anything. 

I feel so useless and stupid. Because I'm a straight a student (or I used to be) people have really high expectations of me. I'm gonna let everyone down and I just wanna die. 


The worst part is I can't even bring myself up to study. I can't concentrate and I have ZERO motivation. Not even one bit. I just lay in my bed all day."

796,Reddit vs other social media platforms on mental health .,"Hi guys.  I am writing this paper for one of my classes where I am effectively arguing that Reddit is easier on mental health than other social media platforms given there are no faces/profile pictures, no emphasis on looking skinny and having nice clothes and being an influencer in that way like Instagram/Twitter... instead it is more about the content one produces.  I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!  Let me know down below!"

798,Friends seeking a therapist please please remember: there will always be those that graduated at the bottom of their class. Don’t give up your search.,"I’ve been through several therapists personally over the last 15 years. I could tell a couple of them weren’t right from the beginning. I didn’t feel like they truly understood what I was saying. They listened well enough, and nodded along, but I knew they weren’t getting it. There were two over the years that I met with for about 4 months each. They were both so nice, so warm. But, that was about it - they were friendly, but we weren’t getting anywhere. Therapy takes time, sure, but after 4 months I was leaving sessions feeling not even the slightest bit of...”hey! We made progress today!” 

Last year, I decided to try phone sessions with a therapist in another state. In all honesty, she’s technically a “coach”. She came highly regarded and recommended to me on Reddit, actually! After one phone session - just one - I hung up and bawled my eyes out like a baby. Like...embarrassing heaving sobs. In just 50 minutes, she GOT me. She GOT IT. She listened, and responded, and responded well. One time we had a conversation that was particularly draining. So much so that it kind of made me feel down all week, just because it was heavy and had been weighing on me and now it was at the surface. This happens in intense therapy but I still just had a blah week. The following week when I called for our session, the first words out of her mouth were “so how was your week? We left off on some heaviness and I was thinking about you and imagining it probably sat with you for a while.” She already knew how it affected me. That’s a good therapist. They’re not all good. If you’re paying for someone to help you, make it worth it. Keep looking until someone feels right. If after a few months you’re still not feeling progress, thank them and move on. There are several kinds of therapists, too. There are psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, coaches. Don’t limit your search. Please don’t give up on yourself. You’re not “unhealable”. You’re not destined to suffer. You’re just not matched right yet. 

Like my title says, there will always be those who graduated at the bottom of their class. Someone has to, right? Just like any other profession - they have the certificates and diplomas on their walls but real life execution of their job? They might not be so good at it. Please keep searching until someone gets you and gives you hope. 

Good luck on your journeys. ❤️"
799,Anxious Mess,"I started remembering my life while i was watching a Reddit Reading video, and there was a post about a woman who'd got a tank of fake LED jellyfish in order to help her anxiety and her Boyfriend had got mad because he felt her Girlfriend had been scammed because she purchased a piece of junk.  (Post was the POV of the Boyfriend)

I understand his point, but he clearly didn't understand what anxiety is what so ever.  
Tank Of Jellyfish is pretty bullshit in my opinion.   
BUT Thats how you cure anxiety, If you can trick yourself into feeling comfortable, your body will soon learn to be comfortable everywhere and forget about anxiety.   


My Life's never been so bad. I've never been Abused By Family, Kidnapped or Raped anything awful or traumatic like that. But I just think I've not been very strong minded, and Its ruined me. 

I myself Have had anxiety for pretty much my whole life, even as a little kid i'd always be scared and nervous going places and usually resulted in me soiling my pants because I'd be stressed and unable to reach a bathroom, The problem is like IBS, It comes on suddenly while I'm anxious or stressed and If i can't get to a bathroom it causes me emence psysical pain, This goes all the way back to when i was a toddler at a nursery school, I asked the workers / carers if i could use the bathroom and they said no, I was very little and the Nursery lasted afew hours, Kids aren't good with their bathroom stuff the best of times, I'd begged the woman to let me go to the bathroom and i said 'But theres one over there' And she said 'No No That Bathroom Is For Adults Only' this resulted in my pooping my pants and having to wait an hour or so for my Mum to come pick me up, Because we didn't have mobile phones back then our family was too poor to afford them, Once my Mum come to pick me up the workers lectured my Mum about how I'd poo'd myself and how it 'Really Smelled' I feel this may be whats sort of left mental scaring, Because even to this day, If I'm outside / not in my house and need the bathroom I get intense stomach pains and instant panicking to use the bathroom,  I'm 20 currently so as you'd think this is extremely embarassing and prevents me from living normally, I spend most of my time in the house, only going out on rare days to see my dad at lunch times while he's at work, My Mum since quit her job out of misery and to help me. These 'Toilet Buisiness' Which is what i used to call it as a child over the years has caused alot of stress for my parents and myself, When i was little my Mum used to think i was acting up or being naughty for attension she had no idea I had mental problems, I used to pee the bed until i was around 12 - 13 years old too... I've got no idea why, What caused it, If i just slept too heavily or have never had a sound night of sleep and things were just wrong, I used to have to wear teenager nappies and I'd pee so much they'd leak through and go all over my Pajamas and all over my sheets, duvet, and matteress, My matteress used to stink and have huge yellow brown pee marks all over it... So we had to get rid of it and get a rubber topped matteress, And it was the most horrible uncomfortable matteress I'd ever slept on in my life. Sleeping on the floor was more comfortable than that matteress. I spent a good few months or so sleeping on the floor before my parents found out. And luckily by then the Night Wetting had completely stopped by that point, So we got rid of the.. Pee Rubber Matteress and got a Super Comfy Amazing Memory Foam Matteress for my bed. It was luxury. I think i was in high school by the time i stopped. I'd never been ultra adept in school, It was so hard to focus because i was so so tired all the time. I got ilnesses so easily and spent so much time out of school because i had all kinds of sicknesses. Nothing Major just blocked Sinuses, Awful Coughs, Sore Throat, Vomiting, Diarrhea. So so often. Stomach Bugs and such from School. In Primary School (Marlbrough) I'd often need to use the bathroom during class because of stress, It was once so bad my arsehole bled from using horrible sand paper toilet paper that I cried and having people laughing at me while using the bathroom. Awful awful memories stick like this in my head forever, The bad memories overweigh any good ones. Not forgetting the fact I'd always be bullied in every school I'd ever been in. There'd always be some little fucker who'd take great pleasure out of making me feel miserable or hurting me. I once (Knypersley) got pushed along the floor that it sliced my forehead open bad.. And the wound when it dried... Was like a Piece of peperoni on my head. Jack Wetherall that name will always stick with me the rest of my life. I'd move school to avoid this shit, and Followed me to that school. He moved school aswell. I couldn't beleive it. By then my family was moving to a new town, I think it was about 2007 so luckily I'd got away from this kid, ( Marlborough) Wasn't so bad. I'd still had to use the bathroom, have night wetting, be bullied, I'd often cry under the table because I didn't understand things in lessons.. People would laugh at me. But It wasn't completely unbarable. I did have some nice times and I also had a teacher i feel might have understand me he was always my favorite teacher Mr Rob Dyson.   


A little side note all my talking is all sort of muddled up, Everything isn't in order its rather random as it comes to me... and I remember..  


I'd gone to this useless company called 'CAMHS' Countless times during that period and I didn't know what to do. I'd always had trouble learning in school, and I'd pee the bed bla bla bla.. But I'd go to CAMHS and they'd ask me what up.. And I didn't understand or know what to do.. I'd say 'I'm Alright' Bare in mind you'd have to wait Months and Months to get an appointment with CAMHS, and when i said 'I'm Alright' I was discharged the next day and said i was fine. I WAS NOT FUCKING FINE. I didn't know what to say or do.. I never understood what was wrong. School would often refer me back to CAMHS and every time I'd be Discharged. And I'd always just be extrmely nervous before going worrying about the toilet.  


But anyway I'd finished (Marlborough) and moved to (Tytherington) High School and the issues grew worse, I had to be given a toilet pass, a Piece of laminated paper which allowed me to use the bathroom, People think you'd use this card to abuse and go and smoke or some shit. But I'd truly use its true purpose because I'd need the bathroom because of anxiety. At this point of high school I had no idea I had any sort of Anxiety or anything. I'd just have to use the toilet so often. It was rediculous.  
There was hundreds if not thousands of incidents in Primary (Marlborough) and High (Tytherington) I could literally go on all DAY talking about the different awful things that happened.

I'd been refered to CAMHS in highschool too, The same shit over and over, They never suggested anything was wrong with me, I never understood what to say was wrong. Even while 13 in High School. By this point I'd started to get an inner rage hate for life and others. AND UNQUENCED ANGER but I't had never truly showed its self until in 2011 my family moved back to the Origional Town i went to Primary School before moving (Knypersley) But as the town was different they had a Primary, Middle and Secondary (High) Schools, Where as the  (Marlborough) town had Primary and Secondary (High) School. So going back to the (Knypersley) Town was almost like a weird step down, From being in High School, to a Middle School which was more like a Primary School. and was just rather odd.  
Middle School was (James Bateman) on the very first day of the new term, I flipped the fuck out, I was already given shit by some asshole named Jake Dodds, And before the term decided I wasn't going to take anymore shit off anyone. That was a Mistake. I'd been seen by Girls and Boys alike as the Mental Spacker Freak Out Kid, On my first day. I'd always been mad and angry from that day forward. I'd focus on being angry and hating the world than I did work. Like i said earlier. I'd never been good at anything. I'd never had skills or talents. I'd never been good at spelling or maths. Languages or science. I'd always been in the bottom lowest possible class. Where all the scum kids were who didn't give a shit abut learning was. So I never got a chance to concentrate on work. I'd always be so stressed and upset all the time. I'd did have odd occasional friends. but they always had extended friends who took a disliking to me. These friends would be really nice and cool 1 to 1 but if there was ever a group. I'd get bullied or forgotten.. I'd just walk around following a group. I'd be the kid who sits with everyones coats while the others play. I had an Xbox too in (Marlborough) And If there was a game like Call Of Duty MW2 or World At War / Halo Reach where it required 4 players to play something on a team, or zombies, or Story Mode. I'd be able to play, Until someone better came along and I'd be kicked from the game, kicked from the party and everyone would ignore me. This happened so often all the way through primary, high and what ever. I once instead of seeing my grandparents stayed to play Xbox with my 'FRIENDS' And they said they were playing that day, My Mum and Dad set off and I stayed behind. And all those bastards were suddenly busy. and couldn't play. It was too late to get my parents to come back.. Quite soon later my Grandfathther Terrance.. Who I loved dearly Died... He wasn't a great man he was rather old fashioned and mean to my Grandma and Auntie Pauline. But He was still my Grandad. I loved him... He'd let me ride on his Mobility scooter with him to the shops. and He'd always play His Electric Organ for me... Put his glasses on and turn the bright light on the keys.. and Play  I do like to be beside the seaside, and my Favorite Eine Kleine Nachtmusik he'd often miss keys like Les Dawson (Not On Purpose) But I still loved it anyway.. When he died I always wanted one of or all of his Smoking Pipes.. Not to smoke but to keep.. Grandad always Smoked a Pipe like Mr Bouncer from Beatrix Potter books. And I'd always remember that. But sadly Grandma threw them all out as if they were Garbage.. She didn't know I had an attachment to them... But I did and I'll never get to see or touch them... Luckily I did get his Brass Toilet Ashtray which always made me laugh as a Kid. But i lost the piece of brass that attaches the toilet seat to the base. But i had a Dalek Plunger from Character Building which fit in the gap perfectly. and Is there to this day.  


Anyway back to (James Bateman) basically I had to receive another 'Bathroom Card' from a Teacher Called Miss Higginbottom and Boy, Was she a Bitch. She gave me a Bathroom Card and I used it as normal. And one day my Anxiety was pretty bad. And basically had to use it every lesson. And it came to her lesson and i got a Pang of stress and had to use the bathroom. And I ask her if i can use the bathroom and she looks at me MAD 'ARE YOU GOING TO USE THAT CARD FOR EVERY LESSON TODAY' In front of the whole FUCKING CLASS, Everyone starting at me. and some laughing or smiling. So i ask her 'So can i please use the bathroom' she ignores me. I start panicking and say 'Can I please use' YES She blurts out with. And i get up and go. Stressing to the bathroom. Yeah thanks you bitch.  


Again I'd gone to CAMHS at least 3 times during my Stay at (James Bateman) With same results having appointments MONTHS to wait, and having them cancelled because theres 'Someone More Important' or 'A Patient has tried to kill themselves' Honnestly I'm not fucking supprised. If most had to wait that Long I'd fucking kill myself too. CAMHS is a fucking disgusting money starved Child / Adolessent Mental Health service in england, and its fucking shit. It could possibly be better if they had reasonable funding. BUT THEY DON'T What a suprised yay torie government every time they are up for election they fool the masses into thinking they'll improve the country. and anything thats gone wrong or is bad is blamed on the Labour Government from the 1970's 'labour had put the country into a bad positon' Oh yeah the same bad position its been in for all these years under torie rule ? Starved Mental Health. Starved NHS. Starved Councils. Where does all the Tax Money Go ? Why is the country Borrowing all the time. Most poor places got funding from the European union because our governement didn't give a shit. Where does all the money for taxes go Tories ? In your big fat greedy pockets ? I don't know. Because it sure doesn't get spent on Roads, Health Care, Public Support and Facilities. I'm sorry to have got political but what other reason is all the United Kingdoms services starved. Why does Scotland get Free Perscriptions but not England ? things like that.  


So (James Bateman) Went to Highschool (Biddulph) and James Batemen quite possibly was the worst years of my life, from the Arsehole Peers to the Arsehole Teachers Mr Sadler Fucking Bastard. More like Mr Saddo Creepy Lame Bastard. At least I wasn't pissing myself at night.  


Biddulph High wasn't much better it was the same people as bateman apart from new teachers, and more punishement. I'd often be sent out of lessons, I didn't have as toilet pass for this school, But i can assure you. It was as bad and I received detensions for needing the bathroom because of anxiety. 'If you walk out of this lesson to go to the bathroom you'll have to go to detention. And guess what I went to after school or lunchtime detentions often. I never did my homework, School was the most miserable thing in my life, I never had energy ever because it took me up completly. and I never even did that well in any subject. So the last thing i wanted to do when i got home was more of the shit work that got me nowhere. So i just  played video games or watched tv with my family. I'd be constantly punished for this, Infact I prefered after school punishments so i didn't have to walk home surrounded by loud assholes, I also walked out of Detentions in the past to go home and that resulted in Isolations, I had many many Isolations which was me alone or maybe 2 others in a room all day doing work from teacher that we were doing that day in normal class, being supervised by some teaching assistant. I mostly just played games on my Phone or DS pretending to work and ocasionally scribble some shit on the paper.   


Its not that I didn't want to learn or work  but normal classes were unbarably loud in the scum class with the most disgusting troll you'd ever see in your life ever Courtney Mason most obnoxious gobshite person in the world. She always gave me crap in (James Bateman) Too and i was stuck with her for the first year of Biddulph High, Don't get me wrong I don't think I can do amazing at work. But I'm deffinetly not Thick As Shit. I can understand 'things' and am Polite when needed. But fuck she made lessons unbarable. Now Biddulph High had a Camhs (I think) Rep come to school and talk to the troubled or troublesome kids. I was both.  


Cathy Cooper. Now she was an extremely nice person to talk to she seemed to genuinely give a shit and wanted me to to well.. Which was weird because no one ever really give a shit and saw me as trouble. I started seeing Cathy after an outburst in form room where someone was pissing me off and giving me shit silently while the form tutor Miss Tracey Condliffe was reading the register and notices. I never liked her, The 'boys' always thought she was attractive, But i always saw her as some Dance Class Millenial bitch who wasn't remotely attractive in the slightest. But I got mad burst out with swearing and shouting and told him to fucking tell me if he had a problem. To which he started shrugging and the Condliffe says 'Wes your scaring us' So i just got my bag said fuck you then and went home, And so it bagan.  If i ever got any shit of anyone I'd get up and leave go home and do what ever while feeling mad until the rest of the day. Until my Parents got home and i burst out crying because of all my anger and rage. Sadly I'd often have a go at my Parents... Making them feel down too because I was so upset about school. When ever i had a cold or a stomach bug in high school I'd wang it out for as long as possible.. I hated going to school... I think i had about 60% attendance. They once had a snow day because the snow was that bad teachers couldn't get in. I and others were told to show up. And we got marked in for the morning. then they told us to go home as only 10% of the teachers could make it in. And they maked EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL Absent for the day. Resulting in everyone loosing attendance. not that it mattered for me. But i found that utter horse shit.  


After the Outburst i was no longer welcome at the form room. I don't remember what happened after that, I know someone was giving me abuse and calling me fat in the dining hall, It had been going on for months and I'd had enough, I went upto him and whacked him with a plastic chair, And left and went home, He at a later date started doing it again. Grinding me further and further to anger and misery, So one day i walked upto him and kicked him square in the face and everyone was freaking out, I told him to fuck himself, and tried to leave, And a fucking Mincey teacher grabbed me to stop me from leaving, So i broke his grip easily and left and went home. Bla bla you know the rest, I was suspended from school for about 2 weeks, Its funny that because in schools the people who get punished worse are the people either defending themselves, or someone who's been psysically and mentally abused and had their state grinded and grinded until you don't want to live anymore, But i used anger instead and lashed out, After that I talked with Cathy Cooper often. And eventually I was put in a seperate building to the school which was called the 'PLC' Personal Learning Center I'm not sure when it was established. but basically it was locally known as the 'Spack House' And i wasn't so keen on going because I was scared i was going to be mocked even worse, But basically I was forced. That wasn't great, But i suppose it was more peaceful than the main school, Teachers would come over for a lesson in the day. Maths teachers, ICT and such. Aswell as bullshit lessons to waste time because they couldn't get enough free lessons, Like Gardening and Work Experience. Work experience resulted in me and Tim (The Local School Idiot, Who'd often stress me the fuck out on purpose to laugh at me when i got mad) Told by the 'Caretakers' Of the school to pick up litter. I think it was just an excuse for the Caretakers to do less work than they do already the fuckwits. Gary the fucking pick, Tim the twat was pissing me off on purpose, so I threw a fucking spanner on the floor and said fuck it and left. Later he comes round saying i almost broke a £2000 projector screen which was mounted on the ceiling. Which was no way fucking near where i threw the spanner. The stupid fuckwit. So again. I left and went home. This happened often because By this point i give little to no FUCKS anymore. I was miserable, I was contemplating suicide. I'd often carve shit into my leg or arm with a knife because i was so pissed off, I'd always had leech friends online I'd played minecraft with teenagers similar to me talking about how they want to end their life and how they cut them selves. That I'm sick of. I've had at least 4 i can count friends who act like this online. And i truly beleive that there's just so much teenage anxt. Which made me feel even worse, Because i put all my effort into trying to make them feel better. It was degrading and waring on me. I always tried so hard to be a nice lovely person. But people would abuse or misuse that or would say I'm an awful person and I've always been an awful person, Because I was fed up for One Fucking Day.   


The PLC wasn't fucking great, I had literally nobody there. the people who ran it. One an Ex Police officer Miss Bolton.. She wasn't bad. I did hate the fact she'd always punish me because I'd tell Tim to stop trying to piss me off. Or I forgot my stuff or something. She'd Give Me Isolations and Detentions like nobodys bloody buisiness. But at least she wasn't as bad as the other one Karen fucking Taylor. Now she was a massive bitch, The best way to describe her is Delores Umbridge from Harry Potter. around authority she'd be high pitched nice as pie, but you could just tell she gave off massive bitch vibes. Once she was talking to my Mum about How I. I. Was 'Bulling Tim' by telling him to please leave me fucking alone while I'm trying to do work. He'd trying and talk crap and make noises while I'm trying to do work. Its like Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2 when they're in the Carridge on their way to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's Parents. Making annoying fucking noises and chatting shit.  


And to no supprise I saw more of CAMHS specifically with someone called Terri Anne, Now she seemed okay at first, But she fucking suddenly grew to piss me the fuck off. Always disreguarding my worries and anxieties, She might think she was helping trying to help me feel like what i worry about is silly, And I agree my Body is stupid, But i literally can't help it. My Anxiety doesn't have an On or Off switch. I truly didn't like my Worries being rationalised. And the next time i refused to talk to her. and said I didn't fucking care. and She was annoyed by the fact I'd sworn. Yet her previous role was mental health in prisons, Grow the fuck up. Are you telling me, Me saying fuck is worse than anything she's seen in prisons. Bullshit. But by that time I'd become over 16 and was passed onto the equally useless adult mental health services equally starved of funding by the same government who starves all over facilities.   


I was completely and utterly pissed off and mad with the services from CAMHS, and One of my later visits to CAMHS I'd met this trainee psychiatrist called James who spoke to me like I was 5. Really slow but up beat as If i didn't understand english. After that I was so pissed off i kicked the air and my shoe flew at least 30 foot in the air. I broke down screaming and crying. I didn't hit someones car luckily.  


Another story of CAMHS is i once met a woman who was also a Trainee like that 'James' And she wanted to shove a Camera in my face to record her performance as a Mental Health person. aka a group of people would watch back the footage of me trying to open up to some robotic woman who couldn't get a true emotional response from a rock.   


Basically i started going to the Ashcombe Centre which I'd always be extremely nervous for... I'd ask my Mum to not tell me.. Because I'd get so anxous i couldn't sleep the night before because i so badly didn't want to go.. Because of the first woman I met.. She was awful she seemed so disrespectful for the lack of a better word... She seemed like a total and utter psychopath, I don't know what was wrong with her, But talking with her was extremely unpleasant and made me really uncomfortable. She also had this assistant who'd right down stuff on a clipboard, The second time i went i couldn't handle it, And swore alot due to stress. Then the clipboard person started shaking and crying. and the Psychiatrist or should i say Psychopath said 'Please save these vulgar words for outside your mum wont want to hear this and your upsetting... I can't remember her name, So i got up and said, RIGHT FUCK YOU, I'M SICK OF THE WAY YOU ACT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. (I know this seems extremely unreasonable, But i was really stressed and It had built up over a while. She was always really rude and sarcastic. So i got up, left the room, the Door slammed on the way out. I walked into a locked door and then pressed the green button to release it. And went straight out of the door (3 Green Button Doors Later) Anyway.. The next time my Appointment was booked on a ... Wednesday or Thursday.. I can't remember, And guess what day that was... Schizophrenic medication day. and Holy fuck was I terrified. Not to be cruel to people with Schizophrenia but they're absolutely terrifying... Especially with anxiety... What if for some reason a person took a disliking to you.. They were just really on edge and scary... I couldn't wait to be called in.. I was already anxious that day, and that made it worse. I went in to see the same 'Psychopath' Woman. And I sit down and the first thing she says. 'Wesley If we get a repeat of last time we will have to call the police to restrain you and lock you up if you get agressive and violent and damage property like you did before.'  
I got up and said 'Okay Then' Extremely calmly. Made sure the door didn't slam on the way out, My Mum followed with me.  


Its funny because i feel most people who work in Mental Health. Need Mental Health treatment themselves.  


Basically my Parents had to write a letter asking them about why that happened. And about a week or so after that we received a letter saying that she will no longer be working there anymore and moving to a different branch. (Clearly she must have had multiple complaints) She was just really really awful.  


But after that it was about Half a year or so before we got any further contact from the ashcombe centre. But we got a letter saying we're having an appointment with the big boss psychiatrist man. I was really nervous... I'd chilled out abit because we'd not had to go for so long. And basically in the appointments I was planning to be really defensive and speak as less as possible as not to cause trouble for me or my parents. But anyway this guy Dr Darren Carr. Supprisingly enough he seemed to know what he was talking about. I Loved his brutal honnesty. He seemed like the first person I've ever met who knew anything about Mental Health. Instead of sounding like he was reading off a script (Like all the others) I think he seemed to truly understand what he was talking about. He did suggest I could possibly have 'Selective Mutism' Which I don't think it true. I was just really nervous and didn't want to speak to avoid me getting angry or getting into law trouble. I was just really scared and didn't know how to open up properly. But he told me that basically there's not alot that can be done. Mental Health is one of the worst brands of Medical things out there. Its so hard to help or stop Mental Health issues. The only things that seem to work is, Medication, CBT and Talking. and I'm not good at talking about my feelings or writing a diary.. And i was too scared to try CBT because i knew it wouldn't work and it would all be for nothing... But I loved his brutal honnesty. It truly spoke to me.  


I have felt sometimes i want to try CBT but its so much effort to set it up. And it wont be with Him It'll be some other random nurse... And its hard to get to know strangers like that... They aren't your friend, they are there to get paid and do work. I suppose it is their job to help you and thats what they get paid for.. But Its like opening up to the T-800 from terminator... It doesn't feel right to me.   
And also don't forget there would be group sessions with other people... And I couldn't handle that... It would be Awful. I can force myself to talk to people if i need to.. But it wares me out, stresses me out and I can't do it for very long... I'm on Support Benefits, Which I often feel bad for because its so so hard to get them. The DWP's job is to deny as many people as possible because there's so many who abuse the system. and the People who abuse the system always seem to get it. Where as the people who really need it and go thousands into debt with a bank don't. Its really disgusting. I don't like to think of myself as Mental and Uncapable of work.. But If I'm brutally honnest.. I can't I'm a danger to myself and others sometimes. And I'd get way too stressed doing some crappy work like a shop worker. I couldn't handle people, And I couldn't do further education.. I'd want to in an Ideal world. Retake my GCSE's and Get a REAL education... But I'd apply.. Spend Hundreds on it... Then either Give up or Flip Out.   


I've never been able to cure my Anxiety, Depression, or Any Other Mental Issues I Don't Know About, Because I'm such a Cynical and Pesimistic Arsehole It seems Impossible for me to find something that helps my anxiety, Pills and Medication can only do so much your mental health, It isn't easily as cured as most Physical Health It requires so much mental work. Therapists can't do anything for me, All a therapist can do is talk to you, suggest strategies that could help you, perscribe you pills. The only thing that was suggested to me is CBT which they try and teach your brain not to be anxious. But I was either too scared to try or shrugged it off as bullshit. I think if you truly beleive that something will help you (Which is hard) I've tried to beleive that something will help me, but I've just faked it to myself and it didn't work.  Sadly I and my Brain truly beleive that If i get into a true meaningful relationship with someone, It'll help me grow up and become a proper adult and stop this Anxiety crap. But you can't force people to like you, and I don't want to be in a fake relationship, I want someone who loves me as much as i Love them. and I find it so easy to fall for people, and then they realise they don't like my body, appearance or personality, Which is understandable but its always a big blow, I've not once had a relationship past the age of 11, I had a little kid relationship that ended when i moved away, Since that time I've managed to realise what life is and what relationships are for. I never understood it as a kid, I may not now but i truly think I've discovered it. I just feel that If i work on caring about someone and living life, That I'll push that shit away. Especially with the person i like, She's super strong and wouldn't have any tolerance for my weakness which i feel could be a really good thing i've been left to myself for about 5 years now, left to my own thoughs and its no good.   


Every time i think about the person It makes me feel Like I want to clean myself up... Some how... How would i cure my Anxiety to make myself a better person.   


Whats... Odd is how I Discovered this Video by H3H3 and basically he talks about how he had a similar struggle to what I do.. and His Girlfriend (Now Wife) 'Cleaned his ass up' Meaning stopped him from being a failure as he wanted to better himself for her."
800,Is there a good mental health based discord server anyone recommends?,I just don't have anyone to talk to.
801,First time putting an animal to sleep,Okay so my mom had way too much emotionally going on so I said I would take my Cat in. How exactly do you get over it / cope with the experience? The whole idea of holding a little cat while it goes (peacefully which is nice) is kind of scarring in the sense that I’ve never had anything die near or around me. I disassociated before and after was a mess during and now I just keep jumping between numb and losing my shit and don’t know how to properly handle the entire experience.

807,Need help getting my life back together,"Hey all, first time poster here. I usually don't go online for personal help but I am lost and need any help I could get. 

I feel like I need to give some background first before I can explain what I've been going through. I have to travel a lot throughout my life because of my parents job. For this reason I moved to NYC for 6 years and lived there from 12 to 18 years old graduating high school in the process. In my final year I lived with a friend because my parents had to move away. Since I'm an EU citizen we decided early on that I would attend college in the EU mainly because of outrageous international fees in the U.S. I've always wanted to stay in the U.S so more or less behind my parents back I applied to some U.S schools and got into some public and private schools which ranged in between 10k to 50k in pricing some were simply unaffordable but some worked. At the same time I got into a really good U.K school and ended up coming here for college much to my disappointment. I was extremely happy during the last few years in high school. I've been with a girl I love since I was 16 and I had an amazing group of friends. When I found out I was going to move to the UK I was really sad that I would have to give up seeing my friends and girlfriend so much but I understood that I am not American and it's what made the most sense. Despite my feelings I tried to be keep my hopes up that I would enjoy London and moving back in with my family. 

Which brings me to why I'm here reaching out for help. I hate my life right now. I found it really hard to adapt to college life. I have two days of classes per week and it's been really tough to make friends as I had no friends coming in and barely attend school. I quickly lost hope after I didn't make many friends and entered a vicious cycle where I sleep between 4 and 7 am. My american friends all know this and as much as they can give words of encouragement I feel stuck like everything is so hard. My grades are barely passing, I feel alone and have no aspirations. I'm doing a politics and international relations course that I have grown to really despise. I've always had an interest in these subjects but not anymore. I barely sleep or do work I mostly just sit at home playing video games and smoking. I gave up smoking during the summer between high school (2019) and college but quickly picked it back up again when I got here. My girlfriend moved to California and right now we are on a break because she's tired of waiting for me to get my life back together. I don't blame her she tried to help me over the course of many months but I feel as though everything is so hard.. I care about school and I rely on friends a lot but I've lost hope. I can't find a way out of this cycle of playing games all day and sleeping late and it's been hurting my american friendships and girlfriend, grades, family relationships. I don't know what I want to do in life and I just feel like I have no vision for my future and no way out. I don't know if moving to the U.S would magically resolve all these issues but I just feel alone. I've argued with my parents countless times about college and where I live and they constantly try to tell me that I just have to try harder. I'm a shy person but once i warm up I'm very open and relaxed but I can't find the motivation for anything. Now that quarantine hit it's basically the end of the school year and I feel like I just wasted an entire year. I didn't exactly learn much and i feel as though my maturity and individuality moved backwards. I once again rely on my family for things like food and money which at 19 years old isn't the end of the world but it's not like I'm improving while i rely on them. I'd like to end this post by just saying that for a while now I've felt as though I shouldn't be feeling this way. In theory, I have a family, a decent living (financially) and a girlfriend (even-though we're long distance and she's been having doubts about us) so i almost feel like there's so many people who've got it worse than me which means I shouldn't feel this way but i do and it makes me feel guilty."
808,I’m tired of people telling me my mental disorder is all in my head!,"I need to let this out because I swear it’s driving me mad but my pet peeve is people telling me “it’s all in you’re head” or “it’s all in you’re mind” every time I voice anything I’m struggling with or talk about my mental illnesses some of the people I confine in are quick to just tell me it’s all in my head and not to think about it. Its extremely dismissive behavior and it’s invalidating it just makes me not want to talk about what I’m going through mentally at all. I know they mean no harm but it’s just please be more careful with you’re wording. The reason why it gets under my skin so much is because when anyone says “it’s all in you’re mind” i feel like they’re suggesting it’s psychosomatic. My symptoms are real my illness is real trust me if anyone with a mental illness could just say maybe it is all in my head and be cured we all would be fine!!  
I have bipolar disorder and DDD and I have been getting these comments from my friends who also have diagnosis of depression,OCD, anxiety and sleep disorder. I just don’t understand why they don’t understand how harmful comments like these are I know my hallucinations, delusions, and mood swings is my brain toying with me I understand that but In that moment those hallucinations are my reality I can’t just say hey it’s all in my head and it goes away. 

I just needed to let all this out I wanna find a way to talk to my friends and family without sounding rude or mean or insensitive but this is something I want to address what do you guys think? Have you experience anything similar? Or what are you’re opinions on it? :)"
809,How Can People Talk About Stuff So Easily?,[deleted]
810,I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not,"So I have been feeling like shit the past three weeks, and today I feel like I have hit a new low. I haven't been feeling great, I'm so stressed and anxious. I work from home and things being so terrible.  
I have applied for another job when life was normal, and yesterday I got a replay from them saying that they are sorry and stuff, and I was so sad about it because I kind of wanted this job, you know? Before that I asked one of my closest friends about something related to work, and I needed her opinion about it, but she read it and didn't replay!! And I got angry because I always reply to her I know that no one asked me to! When the news about the job came in I sent her their messages and she told me like it's their loss and everything. She was quite supportive about it. Then she asked me about something a problem at her work, and she needed my opinion. And I was quite an asshole with her! She was obviously under a lot of stress about that problem and she probably wanted some support.  I gave her my opinion but it was not as usual, it was bland. I went to bed and I kept thinking about what I did to her so at three in the morning I texted her saying I'm sorry I was not supportive enough.  I do care about you but I wasn't having the best day. Let's talk about it again when you wake up. Then she replied when she woke up I'm assuming: ""you don't have to be sad about it because you did nothing wrong, chill."" 
And her words annoyed me so much and I don't know why!! So I wanted to start a conversation with her but her answers were short, and she didn't replay to some of my questions which she normally would!! 

That happend like 6 hours ago, and know I'm feeling very very sad, very angry and irritated!! Have I done something wrong? 
She know about my situation and everything at least she could have said how are you, how are you feeling?  
I feel so terrible and worthless."
811,sick of instagram people,"I run a decent sized spam page on Instagram, 1000 followers with close to 200 likes on each post, and I (had) ""pro-police"" in my bio, which I knew was probably going to piss people off and I only put it there so people who were against the police would just stay away and leave me alone, I got a comment about ""acab"" (all cops are bastards/bad) and it pissed me off so I posted it because my account is just my complaints, and I got even more hate and I blocked most of the people posting it because it made me upset and I didn't wanna deal with it, and then I had people who I thought I was good with do the same shit, then the final straw was when someone sent me a post from someone whose posts I enjoyed looking at, even though I knew they were against the police but they left me alone so I didn't really mind them, that showed a small screenshot of my bio and they started going off on me for just simply being passionate about law enforcement and I finally got pissed off and sent them a message on their tellonym (since they had blocked me) saying who I was and that they had no right to harass me for what I'm passionate about since they get pissed when people harass them about what they get passionate about and now I'm upset and deleted all my posts and got rid of my girlfriend's name and everything from my account so they wouldn't go harass her for being with me and she's trying to help me and give me love but I don't wanna talk to her about it and feel like a stupid over-reacting dumbass, even though I know she wouldn't think of me that way, it's just how I would feel and it would make me feel worse, so please don't try and suggest I talk to her about it because I don't want to, I talk to her about a lot of things and she doesn't help me that much because she doesn't know how, which is completely fine. I Just want to go off on the people and harass them for what they like, because I also have strong opinions and some opinions are highly against what they are into but I feel like if I did that I'd be stooping to their level and I don't want to do that.

I don't know how to feel, life's been pretty rough lately and this shit is just making it worse."
812,I feel worthless for being autistic,"I was diagnosed with aspergers which is a form of autism as a kid, and throughout my whole life I've been insecure about it due to bullying as well as the stigma surrounding it. There's a huge stigma that people with autism are ""creepy"" or ""toxic"" or ""cringey"" or what not, and it makes me feel so heartbroken. I feel like I don't deserve to live due to harassment I've faced in the past regarding my diagnosis. I just feel so hopeless right now even though my friends love me for the way I am."
813,My anxiety makes me really struggle to breath. What can I do to loosen up my chest? Besides exercise and sleep etc.,"It makes my chest, back and stomach soo tight I can barely expand my lungs enough.

It's on and off but over the last 7 months I've had more time where I can't breath easily than time I can, often I spend a week without breathing fully or easily.

It's making general life very difficult, and it's messing with my sleep and body badly, and my exercise,(I get out of breath easily (and that's not like me, I used to be able to run 5 miles in like 30 -40 minutes, and I have no underlying health problems (checked with doctor))).

I also can't yawn probably 8/10 times I try to. 

I also can't run or walk up the stairs without feeling a panic attack or some kind of flight or right response, infact the other night I got up to go to the toilet, which is on the same floor, and I almost had a panic attack just from walking 4 metres.

The things I do at the moment that help, are daily (almost) exercise, getting massages from family, and focusing on sleep, but it's not enough.

What else can I do? Or what else has worked for those who recovered from this extreme tightness?"

816,Bipolar? Or something else...,"Ever since I was a young girl, my parents have told me I was bipolar. I distinctly remember my Dad telling me that he saw it in me ever since I was around the age of eight. They would tell me that I was manic. For years, I thought that this was my lot in life, and to be quite honest, it could be. I just wish my folks had taken me to see someone when I was a child to help me, but because I'm in my early 20's, it is now up to me to find out what's wrong with my brain. When I examine the criteria for bipolar disorder, I really don't fit the criteria for bipolar one or two. I've never had a manic episode or depressive episode. I've never had extreme highs or lows; the only thing I can really relate to is maybe the racing thoughts. When I was a child, I was very hyper...still am. I've always struggled in school, but I got relatively good grades so no one really worried. Being in college, I realize how much help I required. College is killing me. My focus is shot; I'll walk out of class just because I need to move.  I get bored easily. My mind will zone out and think about something completely different. I'm forgetful. I have terrible perception of time. I get frustrated easily. I feel like I'm working harder than everyone and only getting 10% of what everyone else gets. It's hard to explain. This has me doubting I'll ever reach my goals. I know what I have to do (find a psychiatrist) but I just felt like ranting. Quarantine has really made me think my life through. I want to be a mental health counselor, and I need to figure myself out before I help someone else."
817,Mood swings,I keep having extreme mood swings. Yesterday I was really happy and I was dancing and just having a really good time and I’m 5 minutes I cut off everyone I loved and tried to kill myself. I keep doing this and I feel like I’m emotionally draining my loved ones.
818,I don’t know how my future is going to fare as a mentally-ill individual,[deleted]
819,The world is ugly. Literally.,"Throwaway account.

These last 2-3 years I’ve been having a serious issue. No matter where I go, I get anxious and an existential crisis due to how ugly my brain perceives everything to be, even when I know it’s objectively beautiful. 

For example, I used to love hiking and being in nature, but I don’t know what happened, and nowadays I hate being outside my apartment because everything is so ugly and depressing. I’ve been to forests, mountains, beaches, cities and everything is so ugly to me. Another example, I was in Barcelona for 2 weeks for work, and I just felt the need to get out the entire time, even though I think nobody would say Barcelona is ugly. Lovely city, but I hated it. Krakow? Lovely city, hated it. Hamburg? Lovely city, hated it.

I can’t do tasks downtown without getting an existential crisis because it’s so ugly. So here I am in my apartment never going out anymore, except for work. (Or well, before the whole corona thing at least..)

Interestingly I’m not really depressed in general. I have a lovely girlfriend, a stable job I like, a stable living situation and no traumatic experiences in the past. I don’t think I’m a very unhappy person. I just can’t go outside anymore without feeling sad. And as an extroverted person, that drives me insane.

The only times I’ve felt happy outside is when I’ve been to work trips to northern Norway and in the Utrecht-area, and when I’m drunk.

Is there some psychological phenomenon for this? I just want to see and feel beauty again."
820,Extremely anxious,"Rn I feel extremely anxious and I don’t know what to do and I just can’t breathe. What helps you because I don’t know what to do anymore?

In January I suddenly felt unable to breathe and bc I'm hypochondriac I 've been to the doctors and they said there’s nothing wrong with my lungs but I must go to a psychiatrist. And well I didn’t go bc psychiatrists and psychologists make me feel paranoid and they never really helped me. But my state improved and I really became happy and pleased with my life and my hypochondria kinda disappeared but I constantly feel like I can't breathe enough air but I got used to it. 
Every time I feel anxious I feel like suffocating and this is one of my greatest fears tho, and breathing exercises only do worse. And I just want to make it end"
821,Flashbacks of embarassing memories brings me so much anxiety and disgust. I am so ashamed of myself how I acted around my crush a while ago.,"
Hi, 

It’s true when we dont care about how someone sees us, we act normal or even rude sometimes. Few months ago, my crush and I were just dormmates. I didnt even think of her at all. I was being “over comfortable” with things that I think embarassing now. However, whenever I remember those memories or have flashbacks I feel so disgusted with myself. Ashamed. And somewhat anxious of “what if she remembers how I acted and that formed in her head forever?” 
How do I even erase that image of me that had formed in her head? 

Whenever I remember those moments, I get pain in my chest and face cringes. Its like all the blood rushes to my face in shame. 
I like her and I want to look as attractive in her eyes. Just as she ever wanted. I wanted to be her potential someone. My crush is really pretty. She takes good care of herself. She smells good and dresses up nice. I like her even with her flaws. Her sense of humor. Her softness and feminity. 

Would anyone please help me get over those disgusting flashbacks that bring anxiety. 

Thank you,"

824,hello i feel like a fucking burden,"Like many I'm sure, the lockdown is doing a right number on my anxiety + depression (I have other conditions too but I these are the most pertinent). I was diagnosed with these btw. However that's a bit bye the bye. I'm currently waiting on an ambulance (not from self harm but admitted to hospital because of coronavirus symptoms) .

&amp;#x200B;

I was chatting to my best friend - we met at University, she's from Taiwan, I'm from UK -  and she's worried about me, recorded a little voice message etc. But then I replied and...all of a sudden that old demon of feeling like ""You shouldn't bother. You're annoying. Nobody likes you, or likes hearing from you. Just be quiet and die quietly"" came roaring back. Long time no see &gt;\_&gt;

When I did CBT, the lady I was talking to mentioned using a One Minute Rule, time to suit the individual. If you need to, think about the situation. Think ""Is there a reason Person X would feel this way about me? Is there any evidence?"" etc. But once that mental timer is up, push it out of mind.

But its not working. Like. The sum of my reply was the equivalent of ""Thank you! This helps &amp; means a lot. Love you, talk soon"" (we say love a lot) but idk. Its that inescapable weight round your neck, something weighing you down.

Still waiting for ambulance but hopefully  feel better mentally at least."
825,Made this film on gaslighting and emotional abuse after I saw what happened to my friend.,"Hey guys! I'm Tatjana and I'm a film maker. Last year I've decided to make a film on gaslighting, because a close friend of mine experienced a terrible emotionally destructive relationship with her ex which, took her a long time to recover from. I really hope to raise awareness on gaslighting with this film and hope to help the victims recognise its signs early on.   
The film won a few awards, so I decided to put it up on vimeo on demand and try to raise some money for a domestic abuse charity, since they've really been struggling with an overwhelming amount of cases during the lockdown.   
I really hope the film can make a difference: [Your Reality](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/yourreality)"
826,I have come to a terrifying understanding of our world and I feel I’ve gone from a happy productive person to someone who doesn’t believe they are even alive,"We are all made of neutrons and protons. Just atoms floating together making proteins which make dna which make us. Our minds are just slow evolution to solve problems. Everything is physical. It’s terrifying. When I look outside at the plants, all I see is matter and I don’t see that they are “alive,” just proteins working in chemical and electric impulses. Even my fucking mother who I’ve loved all my life, now seems just like a collection of atoms. Love doesn’t seem real it’s just evolution. I feel this may be the end of me and I’m not even in my 20’s. I just wish I could stop but maybe it’s too late"
827,how do i accept that my parents aren’t going to understand my mental health,i’m 19 so it’s not like i really need their permission to see a therapist but i just can’t it out of my head that they will just never fully understand it. i just want to accept it and make peace with it so i can move on because it’s really putting a strain on my relationship with them.
828,Calling myself out on my toxicity,"So I just realized that I have a really bad coping skill of stirring the pot about issues I haven’t dealt with yet when I’m really anxious or triggered. And it happens in ways that the root issues don’t appear all that obviously to me right away. Which sucks, because it doesn’t actually make me feel better at all to react so strongly or drag others into it, all it does is make me feel less alone in my misery. Which now I can also recognize that this coping skill is something I’ve learned from my grandmother who raised me, which equally sucks. 

No wonder my SO is miserable with me. Of course I haven’t been really aware of it when I’m doing it, until recently. The issues I’m having which I’m using this coping skill for are largely out of my control, and finding acceptance with that and letting it go is so difficult. 

I definitely try to cling to the familiarity that comes with emotional chaos, because without it I kinda have face myself and see how much I’m hurting and how much of the hurt is due to things that were done to me in the past. Those things are totally beyond my control now. All the childhood abuse and neglect and the things I never knew were all that wrong, which now take so much effort to function through in my adulthood. The hurt from it isn’t something I want to face, subconsciously I would prefer to take myself back to the time where all the pain still felt comfortable and normal. 

I know I’m probably making myself sound like a really bad person, but I don’t enjoy being this way. I’m in therapy, on meds, really trying to improve myself and now I can see that this is part of why my progress has been stunted these past few months. 

Anyone relate or have any advice for me??"
829,Is this the right place to post this?,"I find it really hard to let go

My friends are really nice people and I cherish their company but GOD FORBID them having me as an attorney as they are tried after death. The thing is that I find it really hard to let go of seemingly small things that happen now and then and keep having these awful relapses where I suddenly remember all the evil things humanity has done to me ever.

For example once in boarding school I had no lunch and was hungry, so I asked my friend to order a pizza for me (for my money and in exchange for a slice) as I did not know the pizza delivery address at the time. My other “friend” however noticed only the giving a slice to the other friend bit and so asked if he could have some too. Me, seeing this as an opportunity to strengthen our friendship, agreed. The only problem is that when the pizza arrived, HE TOOK HALF THE F*CKING THING AND RAN OFF. As a result I only had 2 small slices left and was left hungry for the rest of the day.

The other example happened during a paintball match we had for the pizza stealing friend’s birthday. Me and my group had to storm an enemy fortification and I reckoned that of all 5 of us attack at the same time from different sides, we would be able to take it. The only problem is that those bastards betrayed me at the last second as I charged, leaving me to be pounded with some 25-30 pellets to the torso and knees. To add insult to injury, they started laughing as I laid there, shocked with fury and pain. THEN to add more injury and insults into the fire, one of my “friends” that was in the fort, decided to make sure I was dead by firing a volley at my knees just as I was recovering. We ended up losing the match anyway and the best they had to offer to me after the fact was that they called me a “champ”

Yeah, I guess I need help as these memories surface up from time to time and make me very upset"
830,[Canada] Any suggestions for online counselling available in Canada? Apps like Better Health and Talkspace are American and do not have registered Canadian providers.,"The apps seems great because you can text, email, call, video whatever is best at the time and not have to wait for, set and keep appointments.

You also pay a monthly subscription fee instead of by the hour. 


I have benefits that will help with the cost if they are a “Registered Psychologist or counselor with MSW registres with their provincial regulatory body.”

Whenever I hear about illnesses or perverted fetishes, I can't stop thinking that I'm might have them myself. Over and over again. No logical argumention helps. It's just a vicious train of thoughts and anxiety.

I also think that I might be autistic (many symptoms overlap). I am socially awkward, rarely feel empathy, constantly do repetitive moves like pacing around the room while daydreaming (I can do this for hours with music or the same movie trailers), etc. Maladaptive dreaming is linked to OCD. 

On top of that, I suffer from a very strong libido. I constantly have an urge to masturbate, which makes me think that I'm an addict. My addiction leads to kinky fetishes (for example, I really enjoy verbal degradation). I've read one study, which states that people with autism are more prone to that. 

I am in the middle of a severe depression. I try to watch movies, read books in my free time to distract myself from my obtrusive, but nothing helps.

(I won't get too much into how I feel about it, because it's complex and I'm working with my psychologist on it, making progress) (Symptom disclosure: dissociation and compartmentalization makes things more complicated)

When I get up in the morning. Then what?? How do I decide between doing this or that? How do some people decide so easily? Do I then commit to doing that every day? For how long do I do each thing? What is leisure time supposed to look like, and when, and for how long? How do I do it when I'm the one setting it arbitrarily? How do I compensate for days when I'm less capable? How do I keep it going? How does a person decide when to adapt or change their days or plans????

Seriously, I'm at a loss."
850,Feeling like a different person because I can’t relate to myself,"TLDR - I get so happy and so depressed sometimes that when looking back I’m convinced I’m faking. How do I convince myself it was genuine? 

I go throw mood swings, where about a week a month I’m depressed af and a week a month I’m on top of the world. I don’t have any help or diagnosis at the moment, so I’m trying to put up with them, but I’m finding it so hard to believe that I’m sick because I spend half the time feeling fine and am really struggling to believe myself

Whenever I’m up or down, I’m an entirely different person. I dress differently, listen to different music, different hobbies, eating habits, I have different opinions of people and views of topics (eg, smoking, drinking, drugs, skipping college - not that I do all that, I just view the subject entirely differently when up or down), and I have a totally different thought process. I can’t ever picture myself vaping or self harming, but I’ve done both because at the time it was all I wanted, even if I hate the concept of both and have said I’d never do it again. 

There’s such a strong disconnect that I struggle believing that I even did those things; it’s like my brain won’t accept that was genuine. Sometimes I’m convinced I’m faking because rn I would never do it. I must have been attention seeking or playing it up. I never actually felt that bad. I was trying to act cocky in front of people. I’m not embarrassed of the things I’ve done, I just feel like a fraud. 

Logically I know that’s what I wanted at the time, but I can’t get myself to stop thinking I’m faking. I’ve tried journaling through these moods but reading back through them feels like pages of lies. I can’t convince myself that what I was writing was genuine. 

Anyone any advice on how to limit this disconnect?"

853,just another stupid vent,"just a stupid vent

ughh i can’t cope I can’t cope I cannot fucking cope. I have one (1) blade and it’s so dull and shit so all I have is a bunch of stupid cat scratches and it’s not like I can even go buy more because of fucking corona. Also, I can’t even go see camhs/ totally fall apart because it’s inconvenient. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. I was discharged from ip way way too soon because of the corona situation so even though I told them I was going to try and c0mm1t su1c1d3 as soon as I left they still let me leave. Then when I attempted 2 days later my camhs team were like “wHy dIdnT yOu rEaCh oUt.!1!1!!!1” like hoe I tried but you didn’t fucking listen as usual. Anyway I got ignored by the mh team at general because of corona and sent home again. I cried for 2 days straight and then I had to get my shit together, at least on the outside because I had to get my parents off my back. Since then I’ve been hardcore relapsing w my ed, so low restricting for a few days then b/p ing non stop. I’ve even started smoking again ffs. I am already falling apart on the inside but if this shit lasts too much longer I don’t fucking know what I’m going to do. I can’t attempt rn. I just can’t. It’s too fucking inconvenient. Fuck this. I cannot do this for much longer. I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t."

855,I am terrified of being abandoned,"Hey there, so I was away from my phone for a few minutes, I wanted to try and calm down and write down my thoughts, atm there is one person I want to talk to that seems cool, although I don't think that's gonna happen, also there is this other person who I've talked to a lot who's very cool who hasn't texted in a few days, those were kinda freaking me out, and I kinda felt freaked out and kinda a little bit physically ill, so I ran to my room and picked up my phone to scroll around, and I think I did feel relief there, although the cool guy I mentioned seems to have actually texted, but feeling abandoned is still relevant cause I was terrified why we weren't talking as much recently, especially seeing as quarantine is going on so he should have plenty of time. I've thought about maybe telling him I kinda get super anxious when I don't know why he's gone, although it sounds manipulative to say that 

I think I might know why I feel this way, so as a child my dad worked overseas most of the time, and when he was home he wasn't the best, when I was 13 or so my dad stopped working which caused my mom to attack him, cause of that I dropped out of school and lost my friends and became isolated from my parents, my dad starts working abroad, during this time my sister was in Canada, she came back, and she hated living in the house cause it was a mess, and during that time I told her the reason I left school was cause of my mom, my sister said she that she would be there for me, but she wasn't, she went back to  Canada. During that time my dad came back to try and get a job in the country, although my mom moved out of the house and left us with him, and I remember arguing with him a lot cause he would drink a lot, then I move back into living with my mom, at this point my parents had broken up cause of my mom cheating, although while I was living with my dad my mom became accustomed to living with her BF, so she didn't actually live in the house with us despite being our guardian, anyway so my dad could still come by and he came into the house, and he wasn't leaving ,but there wasn't anyone around and I didn't want to leave the room cause he'd start snooping around, anyway, so I threw a tennis ball at his direction, and he became furious and walked up to me and threatened me, tbh in that moment I wanted to hit him, i'm not sure if I thought I could take him, but I thought it would make something happen, and I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore. Anyway I didn't, but after that I blocked him on my phone and stopped contacting him, he wasn't allowed to come by after that, which leads us to now, i live with my younger brother, older sister and uncle, my mom still doesn't live here and hasn't lived in the house for years. anyway, so atm I don't really have any friends, don't really have any family, don't really have any formal education, idk, I just don't seem to have a ton of stuff and the things I do I get pretty scared to lose"

861,Abandonment Fears with phone Do Not Disturb,Is it just me who turns on Do Not Disturb to shield myself from feeling abandoned?
862,Hiding my worries from everyone,"I wish I could be honest with everyone and I suppose for many people it wouldn't be such a great deal, but I find myself unable to admit to anyone I know, to friends nor family, that I am really just scared  of being seen as a complete failure. I feel like adults are supposed to have their s*** together and they'll see me as someone who is being irrational. Humans don't understand irrational things, so why would they understand what I am going through? It's like I'm hiding a big secret and I can't even talk to anyone because even the smallest hints could lead to my demise. 

I think I'd rather be seen as a lazy person than a coward, even if it's the truth. I feel like I'm broken. Like I'm not functioning the way I should and no one understands this because my fears just make no sense. It's always easier to say ""you do it"" but you haven't worn my skin for 20 years. 

I'm so afraid of making mistakes. My whole existence is a mistake and I wish people would just finally give up on me."
863,part of my brain likes it when people insult me/express their dislike for me,"i think this is probably just a coping mechanism since im naturally pretty sensitive to criticism of any kind, but whenever someone tells me they hate me i feel kinda happy for some reason. its weird because part of me feels really sad that they dont like me when i try so hard to be liked, but part of me really enjoys it. im not a masochist or anything, i guess i just like when people are honest with how they feel about me? tbh idek why im like this. its the reason why i constantly get stuck in toxic relationships and i actively try to be friends with people who i know are toxic even though i know its bad for me. one time a teacher shouted at me and i cried because it was very unexpected and im rlly sensitive, but after it happened my brain kept thinking of it because, even though i was really sad, it made me kinda happy. my brain keeps thinking about all the ways i could make them like me again, and how even though i try so hard to do it ill always be seen as weird and annoying to them (even if i know they dont think of me that way). i guess im a bit of a people pleaser and when it all goes wrong it makes me oddly happy."

865,Why do I always feel so conspired against and why does it cause such a strong reaction?,It took me awhile to realize it but one of the reasons I have relationship issues/mentally in general is because of this. Whenever a person or a small group meets in private or without me I begin to think of all the things they are saying that they don't want anything to do with me that's why there doing it. That they don't want me to be apart of something or only when they want to. That I am doing something wrong not wanted or am considered lesser than.  It makes me very anxious it makes me paranoid depressed a little suicideal and angry all at once. It feels like a betrayal. Is this a sign of anything specific? I know it sounds rather petty And it makes me feel that way but it's like an explosion of emotions and it drives me insane and leaves me in a terrible state.
866,"Serious advice needed. My little sister has come out to me that she has suffered from a complex mental disorder for most of her life. (Warning, very long.)","For this post, I'm going to call my sister Kim. I am currently 18 and she is a year or two younger than me. Not going into detail on us. I'll also preface that she knows about this post since I asked her permission to ask you guys, to which she agreed to. So if you want to speak to her directly in your answers, then that's fine. 

Oh, where do I even begin? This is going to be a long one. 

She recently messaged me, saying that she had something she wanted to tell me but didn't want to talk to me face-to-face about. I egged her on pretty harshly about it as I was dying from curiosity. That was until she sent me a multiple page PowerPoint presentation explaining that she realized that she may be suffering from DID ( Dissociative identity disorder) and/or OSDD ( Other Specified Dissociative Disorders). I'm not going to share this PowerPoint with you guys due to anonymity reasons. 

Before I continue on, let me also preface that I have suffered from depression, paranoia, rare reoccurring random sounds and voices in my head, and some pretty creepy episodes of physical hallucinations in the past (I saw a therapist about my problems and am now fine.) I don't know anything about psychology, but this has me thinking that we lost the genetic lottery. 

Now then, moving on. Kim has told me that she has suffered from the symptoms I'm about to list since the second grade, but hasn't told anyone about it because she didn't want them to think that she was crazy. She has only talked to her closest friends and also me about it. Kim has emphasized that she refuses to let our family find out about it since she believes that they would doubt and alienate her. 

She claims to:

* Have around nine alters within her head. They all have different appearances and personalities, and she has also given each of them a name. 
* Kim said that one of them is always ""fronting"" but I don't really understand what she means by this. To me, she has always seemed like the same Kim. I'll admit that she has random bouts of unexplainable anger and hate towards me, which could support this.
*  She also says that she has a little amnesia based on who is fronting. In the past, I have noticed that her memory is very bad. We both watch a bit of anime and it is common for her to forget entire plots and character casts a year after watching it while I remember most things from anime that I watched years ago. 
* She says that she hears random sentences and monologues of her alters in her head. An example she gave was from last night when she was trying to sleep. One of her alters commented something like ""Okay tictok is so great."" Another one then said ""Mmm no, ever baked a pie."" She experiences random monologues like this in her head throughout the day. 
* The voices are definitely coming from her head. I asked her specifically that. 
* She has begun to refer to herself as ""we"" and this worries me immensely. 

A quote from her that I don't really know how to paraphrase: "" We've got like this inner world place, look the more I talk about it the more I feel insane an overthink it. Just know I've already researched everything and I would tell u I have osdd if I wasnt absolutely sure. However theres this one alter who is constantly doubting it, and its frustration lmao"".

I asked her many questions about her experience in order to figure it out the best for myself. I shall present this upcoming section in a Q&amp;A format. 

**Q:**  ""Are one of the alters violent or give you violent thoughts, tendencies, etcetera?"" 

**A:**  ""Eh we still figuring everyone out. I know we've got a gatekeeper, 2 host, a protector, and a little. Ur talking about a persecutor, then yeah we've got him too, but he's not very active and hes the most disconnected from the host""

**Q:**  ""Can you define these terms? Gatekeeper, host, protector, and little?"" 

**A:**  ""Yaaa so gatekeeper keeps and decides who's allowed to front, host are people who front the most for the longest time. Core is the person who identifies with the body and holds the farthest back memories. Protector is an alter made for like stress. Someone who tries to protect the system and stuff. Like only fronts when triggered by a situation where the system would need to be protected? Then little is a very young alter, ours is like 10. Persecutor is an alter made for like stress relief and basic spends most their time making bad decisions and influencing other alters lol.  We're still figuring out everyone's roles, but ik alters are made and developed for certain reasonsss.""

I have not asked any more questions. What I have decided for the time being and told her is that:

""Right now I'm planning to speak to my therapist and make a deal. I'll refer him to you under the circumstance that he does not speak of any of it to our family. He will agree to that, but if you speak about anything physically threatening or harmful to yourself or your surroundings, then he will be forced to tell people.""

She responded with:

""That's okay, I'm not a threat to myself or anyone. All things considered I think we have it pretty under control. I told my councilor I had a friend and explained some things to her, pretending it was a friend not me. She said we should see a physiatrist who takes our health insurance. Anyways maybe try to see if he understand did first? I hear some people dont believe in it and I dont wanna end up in a situation where someone tries to tell me I dont exist.""

Where do I go from here? I'm taking this very seriously. Mental health is no joke. I know that, especially after going through some bad episodes in the past. Since I trust her, I'm assuming that she's not messing with me or doing this for attention. 

On a side note, after this conversation was over, she told me:

""Okay dont overthink it. I wasnt really planning for u to go detective mode lmao.  I'm just vibin with my new self.""

This whole thing has got me a little thrown off. I'm going to treat her the same as always though."
867,"Haven’t been this depressed in a long time, almost forgot what it felt like.",I texted my friend that exact same sentence. I was gonna tell her a suicide joke about shooting myself but not without first cleaning the bullet with Lysol but jokes like that are too much for people who care about us. Plus my jokes are only funny to me anyway.

869,"My friend was sent to a mental hospital, and it makes me feel terrible","My friend attempted before we met, he told me about his attempt recently, I asked him. I knew that he has been sent to a mental hospital before, but I didn’t know if it was just because of his parents bursting in on him cutting or an actual attempt.

I had my first attempts in fifth grade, out situations are pretty similar, however, with mine, everyone just seemed to watch me tear up my arm and no one did anything. My friend was sent to the hospital and got a therapist, medication, everything that could possibly help you, however, when I think back to my first attempt, it makes me wonder.

Does anyone really care? Do I really have any issues? Why does the fact that my friend is taking medication makes me feel terrible?

I was never sent anywhere, I never got any help, no one ever asked how I felt, no one ever seems to care about little old me. Here I am, 5 years later, on the edge, again. No one seems to care at all.

Why does this upset me so much? How do I get rid of this?

Right now, the only way to get rid of this feeling is by Suicide."

871,Years After some things my brain has almost forgotten I having trouble with understanding the type and depth of my emotion and struggling with bipolar like up and down cycles with internet addiction mixed there.,"So I had some horrible things happened to me as a kid.  Almost died a few times, drowning, getting run over and so on. But all that gave me the strength to try to be a better &amp; a normal person and try to help people as much as I can growing up. I also got a morale boost when I realized I could help change some of the horrible things I COULD control, but that took me years to realize.

Meanwhile, I learned to fall in love, and then eventually broke her heart, which eventually broke mine.  Even that was so traumatic to me as a kid that, after my family moved, and when I came back to the same town a few years later temporarily, I realized how much she had to go through because I broke her heart and some other actions. I realized how much I had forgotten about the things that used to matter.

I realized then, that my brain tends to forget emotionally upsetting things like this, it tries to keep them in the deepest darkest recesses of my mind, barely letting me remember them. Helping me make the same mistakes again and again.

So I tried to move on as much as I could, I was in my early teens. I made new friends, eventually fallen in love. Many other things that I would like to forget happened before, after and in-between. But things were happy enough for me at the time, but I made some stupid decisions. 

I was a high school senior &amp; I pushed away my girlfriend I was in a relationship with for a year, the love of my life. And some times later, the guys, my friend circle for 5-6 years broke up over something stupid and despite my best efforts. And all these made my grades fall really low and things got bad at home after I graduated with a lower grade which is important in where I live and even more important for my parents.

It took me years to get over all this, and I eventually did but many other things happened before, after and in-between.  I took a year off before starting college which although didn't bother me at first, is starting to bother me now, seeing falling behind my friends.

Sometimes ago, many of those things my brain tried to forget came to haunt me like ghosts from the past. As those NDEs made me feel more for people and much deeply, that backfired, as the slightest recollection of things would leave me with anxiety or panic even attacks.

I couldn't tell anybody about it at the time and didn't want to. It took me some time, but when I came out of this tunnel, I wasn't feeling the anxiety anymore nor the panic attacks. I eventually realized I wasn't sure If I feeling anything good or bad, barely anymore.

Before all this, I remember playing video games felt fun, so I kept playing video games more and more even though I wasn't sure If I was having as much fun. I used to love those facts or trivia videos on YouTube but never as much to the extent as I watch them now and I find some if not most of them not fun or even boring.

All these attempts of me to try to understand my feelings started to affect my grades. At some point, I could barely focus for more than 10-15 minutes. And massively hamper my productivity. The tradition of where I live in, is usually children stay with their parents, many before marriage, many even after.

I am taking 6-7 years to get my undergraduate degree that is supposed to be done in 3-4 years. My grades are appalling despite my efforts. No Matter how good a semester starts, it's like a bipolar cycle that I get a low productivity time once or twice in every 4 moth semester. Some for a few days, some for weeks. I haven't had any relationship for all this time. My social life suffers every time I'm in a low cycle. 

And my financial situation isn't helping much either. Too afraid to get even a part-time job risking my grades even more and letting people down at my job when a  bad cycle hits and I don't feel like going out of my room for weeks.

I'm old enough now, and many of my friends are getting married, which is gradually is starting to be worrying, me still not finishing my undergrad, no job, no relationship, barely any long term friends since after starting college for all this time, and my mental and emotional mess with bio-polar like ups and downs cycle which at this point feels more like bipolar syndrome to me.

Things are getting even worse with me not being able to understand the depth of the emotion that I'm feeling. I know If I don't properly finish the work I'm given, I will probably fail this semester. I don't feel as stressed as I once would have, but I hardly feel any stress at all, to the point that I don't even feel the motivation to finish my projects and assignments.This is just one example in studying. I have been doing similar things in my social life, even with my family, parents and siblings who tried again and again to help and many times needed help.  

If I would do a self-analysis, just from this, I would say that I have, 

\- Bipolar disorder

\- Internet addiction

\- Gaming Addiction

\- PTSD

\- Memory problems

\- Emotional depth problem and lack of motivation

\- Lack of time management

And that's just off the top of my head from this. Some of these problems can't be helped since I'm studying Computer Science and I am glued to my computer most of the time for one reason or another.

After all this, I wanted to ask something, and I wasn't sure which reddit to go to so I'm asking here,   
1. Is my self-analysis is erroneous in any way?

2. Am I truly having problems with understanding the types or depth of my emotions? If not, what else is it from what I've written here?

3. How can I lessen my internet and gaming addiction and be more productive for my particular case while studying computer engineering?

4. How can I be more social and productive when those downturns hit me and make me all depressed and waste more and more time and opportunities?"

873,Huge Struggle Even After Getting What I Wanted...,"2018-2019 were really rough for me for many reasons and I felt like I just couldn’t get a break. I felt like I was an ant and god was like a child pointing a magnifying glass on me, aiming it so that the sun would burn and kill me. That’s how all of the last two years felt for me. 

I kept saying to everyone, “I just need one win, just one and then I’ll be okay and able to snowball happiness from that one win”. I convinced myself of this, so I waited and waited.

Finally at the beginning of this year I got two of the things I was working so hard for - I bought a condo and moved out of toxic family environment to live on my own and I attained a destination I worked really hard for.

Initially, I felt amazing. I couldn’t believe it and it almost didn’t feel real after all the shit I went through. 

But eventually I was like “is that it?”. I kept feeling like wait, wasn’t this supposed to change everything for me? Wasn’t this supposed to be my ticket to happiness?

Surprise, surprise, it wasn’t. This is not to say things haven’t improved for me and that I’m not grateful for what I have. This just says that I’m finally realizing that maybe even getting what I want isn’t going to fix me. 

I decided, okay maybe it’s because I’m taking all this for granted so I try to actively practice gratitude daily but it still doesn’t help me. If anything, I’m getting worse! I’m stuck in this utter spiral of self-hatred, body dysmorphia, imposter syndrome, loneliness, sadness and frustration. 

What will it take for me to be happy? I don’t even know anymore. I can’t get the courage to see a doctor. I’m so afraid."

I loved maths and got an amazing grade, i just loved every single bit of it ( I’m telling you this because i will use it later.) i have an Engineering Diploma, i am also told that i am very smart although I don’t see it personally but the reason why I’m naming all this is because i am not uneducated or lazy or anything. Anyway let me explain what I’m having trouble with... i am having trouble with remembering things, learning new things and just using ‘common sense’. I’m a gamer and even that is hard for me now, for a while now I can’t even play a game without doing really bad. More and more i notice that I’m having trouble with stuff. For example, i just became a manager at my work, I’ve had trouble remembering everything to do with that role, and now I’m having trouble counting stupid money although thats what i enjoy. Counting!  I have £10,£20 and £5 notes and I can’t even count them correctly to £200 at the end of the shift. I seem to do things different than others and i end up doing them the hard and wrong way.

880,I (23f) came out as bi,"So a lot has happened in my life in the past year. A lot has changed including how I felt about my sexuality. 

Last week I came out to the person who I trusted the most with how I felt. 

Yesterday morning I came out to a few other friends and publicly to strangers on twitter. Then last night I came out to my friends and family on Facebook. 

Every single person who saw my posts have done nothing but say nice things, congratulate me and support me. 

Coming out to everyone has helped lift a huge weight off my shoulders and I've been thinking clearly, not constantly worrying about it. 

I'll be honest, I was scared to death. It was a huge step for me. 

Over the last week I've been building up the confidence to come out. In the end I remembered that I don't care what people think of me. So to put it bluntly and straight to the point I posted ""I'm coming out as bi, if you don't like it you can kindly fuck off"" 

Every single person in my life has come out to support me. 

I'm currently looking for my first girlfriend and maybe the love of my life. 

I haven't been this happy in so long. Being honest with myself and everyone around me has made me feel so confident. 

I feel like this is a step in the right direction to helping my mental health because it's one less thing I have to worry about. 

Don't be scared about coming out. If you want to talk to me about it I'm open and always here for anyone who needs it. I don't judge anyone and I like to think I'm easy going and kind. Don't be shy if you need someone to talk to about this. 

It doesn't matter what your gender is, your sexuality or how you identify. I'll always accept you and love you."
881,How to deal with constant failure in things you really enjoy?,"To give a bit of context, i'm massively into music. I've played guitar for 14 years, been in a band and have supported some pretty large bands, have toured uk and am releasing a new album/solo album soon, so essentially music is my entire life, but i cannot make a career out of it. I also suffer badly with depression and anxiety, as well as BPD and ADHD

I've fully accepted the fact that it's near impossible to make it big and live off of the music i make, due to the state of the industry and the genre we play (metalcore,) so i've made many attempts to get a more commercially viable job in the music industry.

I went to university to pursue music production, came out with a 2:1 (2nd highest grade achievable) and attempted to pursue a career in production, but quickly realised that i not only did have the money or talent to do it. The vocalist of my band who is entirely self taught is miles better than me and is producing my solo EP, which made me think that i'm not good enough for it, justifying it by how many people are already out there doing it.

I then tried to get into live sound, and was shot down multiple times by other live sound engineers or venues, even when i ask to shadow the sound guy unpaid one day a week or anything, just to get some experience. 

The thing i discovered recently, is that i'm really not bad at woodworking. I've built 2 guitars now, one of them works perfectly, but the second time i've tried to build the neck and i'm over 15 attempts in to the neck, wasted so much money and had really put me into a depressive state when i've been improving so much over the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl/dr; i keep failing at the things i love no matter how hard i try, how do i deal with this cause i feel like shit."
882,Have you ever had a therapist with a disability? Are you a therapist with a disability? I would like to discuss your experience with you for a class project.,"

The title pretty much covers it. If you are a therapist with a disability, or you are someone who has or once had a therapist with a disability, I'd like to discuss your experience with you. It can be by phone, Skype or online and can be as anonymous as you like. Comment here or DM me if interested. I am on a tight deadline so this would be sooner rather than later."
883,Genuinely don't enjoy anything or anyone.,"I don't enjoy any pass-time. I stopped my passion of concept art because I can't be damned to draw for longer than an hour at a time like once a week. Any of my smaller hobbies I realized are just distractions that I don't look back on fondly; when I watch youtube sometimes I find myself just staring at the homepage, refreshing for minutes at a time. 

Even doing activities with friends, I get bored really easily. But I think that's because I stopped enjoying the company of people as well. Whether it be family im really close to, close friends, not as close friends, or just new people i'm meeting, i find that as of late, I really couldn't care less about interacting with them. I get this feeling of being bored and drained at the same time. 

And lately, I've felt that way about my significant other as well. We've been together for upwards of 5 years. Sometimes I catch myself feeling tired or bored of their company. Like I can't think of much to say, and I don't really want to hear much of it anyway. 

I don't want to come across like im just expecting the people in my life to entertain me. I know it takes two to tango. It just feels like, despite my efforts, I grow tired of their company. 

I know IM the problem here. But due to the current restrictions on travel and distancing, I can't seek the mental help i need. It feels like im just slowly aging while sitting around, being displeased with everything. 

It sucks so much because no matter what I try, lifestyle changes, trying new hobbies, there's always that moment where something clicks in my mind and i can hear myself thinking ""yeah... but this isn't even that enjoyable"". and efforts I make to try to make things enjoyable just fall flat. 

I'm probably coming across as a major downer here. But I don't know what else to do with myself in this current hour, so I thought i'd reflect to the anonymous public."
884,I need help,"How do you even begin therapy/counselling, when you can’t even open up to friends and family? The very thought of talking to a stranger about my feelings makes me very anxious. How do you get help when you’re too afraid to even ask? Self hatred and the feeling of worthlessness is becoming daily occurrences, it’s suffocating. What do I do?"
885,Emotional running?,"(F 20)  don't know what it is but whenever I run whether it's the treadmill or just outside I get very emotional and like people always talk about how running is supposed to calm your mind but instead I feel like it's almost like venting and I just feel like crying afterwards or during really, I go through like every stressing thought that's in my head and all I could think about. I almost get angry, but the sad angsty kind. it's hard to describe. I think about I like proving people that have wronged me wrong and wanting to get better and blah blah blah its prideful stuff. I don't know why and if it's part of one of my mental illnesses, I can't even really pinpoint which one that would be cause I have quite a but wrong with me but I'm starting to notice this now. Does anyone else do this or feel like this?"
886,Anyone else have characters and an inside world in their head?,"About a year ago, two characters “came to life” in my head. I didn’t need to think too hard about who they were, what they looked like or what their names were; I just kinda knew. From there on, more characters were developed and I became aware of a “inner house”. At first there was only a downstairs area, but one of the characters took me upstairs and showed me around. I can see it very clearly in my mind and it’s quite developed. 

The characters each have their own “role”. One of them is the soother, that says nice things to me when I’m anxious. One of them is the “keeper”; he wears a key around his neck which unlocks the basement where memories and thoughts are organised and kept. One of them (and this one is pretty bizarre) is the twin sister of the “soother”. She’s a giant dog-raven hybrid and she’s the “physical soother”; If I feel anxious I can crawl under her wing and feel safe and protected. 

Does anyone else have an “inner world” or “inner people”?  I haven’t told people in my real life about it, as it does sound pretty odd. I’m sure a lot of people would think i’m experiencing a psychotic episode. But it’s not like that at all; my people don’t hinder my life, they are actually very helpful."
887,"My ex I dated for 7 years told me he wasn't happy with me for years, he just stayed because he loved me.","Honestly I feel so broken, I don't know how to deal with this information. I feel like such a worthless screw up. He was literally the only person I had in my life and honestly I feel so alone right now. I have no idea how to cope. I've literally been staring at my ceiling crying all day."
888,"What personality traits, disorders do you think Kellyanne Conway possesses?",I'm just curious to know the opinions of therapists about her because it'll be good to study and understand the different disorders when directly seeing a person perform with those disorders/traits.
889,Does this sound like PPD?,"I found old documents of my first ever psychiatrist visit at 12 or 13 years old. One of the things the psychiatrist highlighted in her observations was that I seemed to always think everyone is out to harm me, and any situation is potentially dangerous.

Looking at myself now, I'm not that different. I still think anyone I walk past on the street is hiding a knife and will stab me as soon as we get close so I walk by people really fast. I refuse to go out when it's dark because someone will attack me. 

My bedroom windows make me really fucking paranoid, they're high up so you cant actually see anything, and I always picture in my head suddenly seeing something stare at me through the windows. I always feel watched and vulnerable. I feel like that all the time but it's worse when it's dark. Every single night is terrifying, I try to fall asleep facing the wall and hiding under my blanket and repeating ""dont turn around dont turn around dont turn around"" in my head. I also feel like everyone is lying to me all the time, and I can't trust anyone.

I already have OCD so I dont know if this is just another form of obsessive and irrational thinking or straight up paranoia."
890,A video I came across that helped me w anxiety by taking cold showers. Has anyone else tried this?,https://youtu.be/EIe5eSczVFY
891,I hate feeling so intensely or nothing at all,"There is no in-between. I feel in violent waves of emotion — one moment I am ecstatic over something silly and trivial, and then the next I would love nothing more than to die right then and there. I hate how much my emotions control me. I hate how much a simple ignore from someone can completely skew my sense of self and throw me into a suicidal thought spiral. If I’m not drowning in emotion, then I am feeling little to nothing at all. As if every emotion has been used up and I am left empty; devoid of all feeling. That is of course until something suddenly triggers me and I am thrown into yet another episode of emotional combustion, only for it to abruptly end soon thereafter and it’s back to nothingness. It is so exhausting. I just want to be normal."
892,Past Abuse PTSD and Self Hatred/Depression/Axniety - WTF. It’s some fuckery.,"So as I’ve kinda prefaced in the title, I was a victim of abuse for most of my childhood. I can honestly say I’m in a better place right now, (I am in my early thirties at this point) but I still deal with some major issues regarding my self hated sometimes. Sounds pretty harsh but it’s a real thing. I’ve struggled with my mental issues for my entire adult life so at this point I am pretty self aware, and I am able to connect the dots so to speak childhood have triggered my severe depression and anxiety at some times. 

My depression and anxiety are so bad because I have low self esteem, and I have low self esteem because of I am really hard on myself to be perfect a 100% of the time. 

This has created the most turmoil for me most of my adulthood. Legal issues, financial issues, confidence, and a depressing and congruently irritating feeling of being stuck has felt like a constant rain storm mental health wise speaking.

Has anyone ever felt like this? Or deals with a similar issue? I know this is kinda super personal, but I stand in solidarity with all those who suffer from the horrors of mental illness. 

Thank you."
893,Every single day I feel like I’m declining,[deleted]
894,I might have anti-social personality disorder,"Disclaimer : I have no interest in to making someone with this feel upset I'm not self diagnosing myself I just want help from someone who have it and discuss with me

Since I was 9 years old I've always seen the good side of life even if I was surrounded by a country in a war my mother still tried to make us happy while my father was in Sweden trying to get us out of the misery. Perhaps it's because I saw my surroundings and a bomb explode from my window perhaps that's when it started. When we came to Sweden that's when the real misery started because that's how I learnt to manupilate by my father since I saw him do it many times and even to me I was to young of course to understand what that was but I learnt it and soon I started to manupilate people.

I was a happy child and never got angry that's what my parents told me but I knew that was because when I was angry at someone the only thing that would calm me down was the thought of murdering the person using a knife and slit thier throat or use a hammer and crush them and strangling them or even rip off thier eyes while they were dead. That's when I got calmer and calmer.

 When my classmates would cry about something or even when I heard someone passing away I never cared it was never my problem even now I can just think of a handful of those who I will feel sorry for when they die. I never fit in school so I got bullied for about 6 years until I fell into depression and was thinking of killing myself but luckily my mom noticed something was wrong I never cried because I thought that would make me weak but when I cried in front of my mom was the first time I felt that everything was gonna be alright and it did get better I started to do things I love and even get new friends since we already moved.

Moving was the best decision ever because I finally smiled but I still didn't feel empathy or sympathy for no one but since I was a child I knew that I need to learn it because it didn't seem normal and the only way to live in this society was to be normal so I started to anylize anything any expression my friends had when they were showing empty and I started to do the same but I would never feel it.

I can say that I think big of myself and killing someone is dirty because it's to much work and you need to clean after yourself and even if you did that there is a small change that you will get arestted and your life is over because for one body or more depends on who you are. So no murdering someone isn't in my mind because when someone makes me angry I just ruin them from the inside but they need to go through my 3 strikes because when they pass the third one even if they were dying I wouldn't even blink an eye for them. I have manupilated people before never felt bad for it because they were in my way.

The only reason I'm asking about anti social personality disorder is because one day I thought about doing a sociopath test because I wanted to know and the results were anti social personality disorder so I Googles it and everything seems to discribe me and so I did every psychology test on the internet and they all said the same thing. 

The thing about imaging murdering the person that makes me angry stopped when I was 13 years old but it's starting to come back now and I know that if I don't get help I might actually murder someone and ruin my life so I need your thoughts

I have been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, but this (to me) feels more serious. My mood changes are one thing, but to think of multiple things in one way at a certain point then five minutes later feel as if I am a completely different person is starting to way me down a lot. I’m not sure how anyone could help, but anything will."
897,Situational Depression,"My very wise sister said to me once that I had tried every medication on the market, at what point do I admit it’s a situational problem and change my life. She was right. Sometimes therapy and drugs can’t fix everything. You have to dig deep and decide what you want. I wanted to move back to be near my friends we had moved away from. I wanted to be where I felt wanted and appreciated. I didn’t want my husband to refuse to move and try to keep our son. Funny thing is, when I finally just told him why it meant so much to me, he got on board. I’m moving in a few months. I’ll let you know if this works. Sometimes I think I cause many of my problems by not being brave enough to just say what I want."

That was my way of dealing with being a social failure. Being autistic. Being single. Being rejected. Now Im non stop reminded of all the people having sex with this corona boom. I'm done. Leave me alone. I'm king myself. My life I is getting worse as time goes on. My life has been a waste of time. Good bye.
899,How do I take a compliment?,"Most of the time when I recieve a compliment I feel like I don't appreciate it or acknowledge it as much as I would like to.

I'll get a compliment and on the inside I'll be like ""yeah whatever"" ""yeah I get it"" ""I know"" ""whatever"" ""okay"" ""oh a compliment okay""

I hear about people making realizations in therapy, that has never happened to me. As I've gotten older I've made a lot of really big realizations about my mental health but none of them were in therapy and I feel like therapy just hasn't been helpful to me. I feel like my current therapist is a good fit and sometimes it's nice to talk to her but I just don't know if it's helping me."

It’s how it happened.,"If you moved away I’d miss you, but with us still in the same city and with the same interests that brought us together, it hurts more that I’ve fallen into enemy status with you four. This grief haunts me every day and every hour with no sign of letting up. Suicide is the only medicine to get rid of the pain at this point. I’m sorry for my mental health collapsing last year due to finances, work and school stress. I never want any of you to feel at fault. I’m sorry that I isolated myself and was more snide than usual. I love you and you brought joy to my life and it breaks my heart that I’ve ended up getting you to borderline despise me and not be able to stand my presence. I never meant for reaching out to you to make you feel pressured. I didn’t expect after a year that your emotions towards me would get more negative. You and the group might want to punch me in the face for pissing you off but I’ve never felt that desire with any of you."

I was diagnosed with GAD back in November and prescribed this medication and I currently want to get off of it. I do not like how it makes me feel and it's restrictive in a lot of ways.

It's like having one big hangover after being on cloud 9 and it sucks. I was started on Lexapro for the depression then put on Abilify that made me sick.

Idk if I should just revert back to keeping things for myself and to not be open.","Overview: I have bulimia and depression for almost a decade. Every time my depression relapses, the magnitude of my suicidal tendencies were getting worse. Last year, I’m ready to jump off a building many times before my birthday, during the time I was waiting for my psychiatrist, etc. People I met online talked me through it and they kept asking me what I’m feeling. When my suicidal tendencies stopped, I had some realizations and I’ve been more aware with depression. I never wanted anyone to feel alone. I want them to acknowledge that their feelings are valid and important. I got comfortable opening up with others about my mental health and I thought I wanted to advocate its awareness. 

Fast forward to 2020, I was talking with several people and some of them mentioned that I should stop being open about it as they don’t wanna listen to my ‘problems’ or ‘drama’. As a sensitive person, I always ended up with self pitying — it’s my defense mechanism. When I’m self pitying, they told me I’m emotionally manipulating them by making them feel bad about themselves. It was never my intention to make anyone feel bad as I was making MYSELF feel bad — not them. 

 Now, I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should trust people. I already lost trust with people in real life that I barely talked with them. Should I just keep things to myself again? Should I never speak up about my mental health struggles as people say I’m manipulating them for being open with it despite not being my intention? 

I just wanted to stay in my bed forever. I’m losing interest with anything again. Idk what to do."

Also

If it is true, in what context do they refer to as untreated? Surely it wouldnt be inferring the need for anti depressant and/or anti anxiety medication as the type of treatment that would stave off brain damage. Benzos are extremely bad for the mind and body, and i dont know too much about the negatives in regards to long term usage of anti depressants but i cant imagine itd be more beneficial than detrimental.

917,Repetitive movements and thoughts/rumination advice,"Hello, my name's Tytus and I'm 16 years old. For years now I've struggled with repetitive movements and thoughts -- though the movements are only when I'm very anxious, and the repetitive thoughts seem to be almost constant.

I've heard of the term rumination, but the repetitive thoughts aren't negative so I'm not sure if that's the correct term. It seems like I repeat anything I think (negative or otherwise) over and over in my head like a broken record until it feels 'right' (for lack of a better description) If I don't do this I get really antsy and irritated. I tend to repeat the thought with different speeds, emotions, and general cadence until I feel happy with it. 

My main issues with it is the awful anxiety that I feel when I DON'T repeat the thoughts, and the fact that when I try to write (essays, assignments, and even texts) It will take me 3x the amount of time because of this loop I get stuck in.

I also find that repeating certain movements/phrases help me to calm down. E.g. counting, snapping my fingers, and jerking my head. Ive been diagnosed with a slew of things, but anxiety seems to be the only thing relevant to this issue. 

Any advice would be super helpful.

Thanks x"
918,I think i have some sort of trauma,"And idk how to deal with it.

So, i live with my parents and my sister in a small house. By small, i mean that i can literally hear whatever they said from outside their bedroom unless they whispering. A few months ago, they were fighting in their bedroom. He accused mom cheating because my mom doesn't want to show her phone to him.

I admit what she did is super suspicious. Both me and my sis aren't allowed to go and break the fight, but their arguments is making me scared. Until i heard sound that makes my heart drop, i rushes to the bedroom and finds my mom being pushed pretty harshly. The rest are hazy, but i remember him saying nasty things and choking my mom which makes me really scared and begging him to stop.

In the end turns out she didn't cheat, he apologize to mom and me and sis. He said he isn't violent yet i treat him as if he's going to kill out of rage - which i really think he's capable of doing - and is feeling sad about it. He bought my mom new phone because in the end her phone got broken in the middle of the fight.

Nowadays i feel worked up if i saw them in the bedroom and the door closes. I feel tense if they whispers to themselves or if they jokingly fight. Heck, i feel tense if they talk normally as well. I feel tense and scared when i can't see what they're doing and i heard sounds. Even tiniest sounds makes me think of that fight. I even dreamt about it a few times. It makes my heart and head hurts. Can't go to seek some help because i don't have money, and if i go, they'll know and i'll get scolded. What should i do? I'm tired.

Sorry if the grammars seems weird, i just woke up from a terrible dream that makes me decide that i should post this."
919,I actually managed to have a decent night tonight. I wasn’t down like normal. If only it would last.,"I have a decent time tonight. As soon as I was alone again, I’m back to feeling like crap. I feel bad too. Guilty. I don’t even know if I should.

See, the thing is, when my parents were informed by another adult I’m somewhat close with that they thought I needed a therapist, my parents didn’t do anything. They said they were looking whenever I asked them about it. They never did anything. All they did was get my hopes up. Made me think maybe I could actually get better. Then they made me lose my hope again. I don’t want to go to them again about my mental health. I can’t deal with that again.

Then tonight like I said I had a decent time. I was more myself. As soon as it’s over I’m back to how I was. Now, I was considering reaching out to that one adult again, because I do trust them. They’ve helped me a lot. I’m worried I just annoy them though and I don’t want to bother them. They have more important things to worry about. Also, I’m worried that if I go straight to them instead of my parents, my parents will be mad or something because I’d be going behind their backs. Should I even feel guilty though? I mean they didn’t follow through the first time and actually just made me more upset. I can’t even talk to them about anything personal. It’s the worst for me. 

I feel like since they didn’t do anything the first time, i shouldn’t feel guilty but I don’t know."
920,Mental Health and Disability?,"I had a quick question that i was hoping some people could answer. I have mental health issues, that will not allow me to work, they are to a point where i dont even get out of the house much. I have no source of income and ive only ever worked for 3-4 months, excluding a family owned business which i received no income from. 

How would i be able to have an income?

I dont meet the requirements for Disability because of lack of working. In hopes someone will have an answer to this."
921,Genuine question about suicide,"What have you done to help you not go through it?

I am at a point in life where everything is shit (especially what's happening right now)
As time goes by, it's harder for me not to do anything reckless."
922,I talk to myself but not to myself,"For as long as I can remember, I’ve been talking to things that aren’t there. My Mom said that before I could talk, I would speak gibberish to things that weren’t there. I’ve had a pact with the monsters that live in my room for a while, I’m 13 now. I talk to them about everything, like they’re real.

They’re not. I know that. But I just can’t seem to stop talking to them. I tried to give one a name one time, but I didn’t like it. Luke. He didn’t like it either.

I know there’s nothing there. I still feel like there is. The pact I’ve had with them is that if they’re the nice monsters, protect me from the evil ones. I’m nice to them, I vent to them. They understand me.

They listen to me. They’re great listeners.

I just don’t know if this is healthy. Is this okay to do this? Is there a way to fix this? Or should I not fix this? I don’t talk to them around other people, and I don’t even talk to them anymore, I whisper or have them read my lips, so no one can hear me."
923,Anyone have trouble keeping up with brushing teeth? Any tips?,"Once I get up to do all the ""normal stuff"" I just want to get back to my room as fast as possible. Antidepressants make my mouth so dry, I've noticed all kinds of problems with my teeth come up after starting to take them."
924,"i’m not stable, i think it’s because of my sister. how do i tell my parents?","so. i am a teenager, i’ve been put on the pill bc of my mental issues, therapy was suppose to happen but covid happened. my sister, we’ll call her a, is 20 months older then me. shes always been athletic, has a loving boyfriend, and has good enough grades. this is important. fyi, i am not a lesbian! my entire fam is homophobic, while i’m not i’m an ally. i live in wisconsin. it’s a small town, so i will just say 45 mile radius of oshkosh.

cast-
me-op/me
a-sister
mom-my amazing mother

a: you’ve never had a boyfriend, have you?

me: nope. don’t want one.

a: i think you’re a lesbian. ew.

me: nope, i’m not a lesbian.

a: yes you are!! mom!! op is a lesbian!

mind you, i have severe anxiety, shy, acne, and body dysmorphia. it’s been a long road because i never told my parents. i just got diagnosed back in february.

mom: really? i’m not surprised.

at this point, i’m tearing up. 

me: i’m not a lesbian.

mom: i don’t know about that, op. you’re nickname is (insert my intials of my 1st and mid name). thats a boy name.

i’ve had enough of this and go into my *shared* room with a.

i’ve never really had a boyfriend. just talking to guys and not really liking them or seeing them as a friend. i’m 90% sure i’m not attractive to girls, either. i had 1 crush, and that was on a boy.

i tried to listen to some music with the door closed, volume low, trying not to cry. then a bursts in and i leave our room. what’s annoying is my mother knows i am not stable. she allows my sister to do this. my mom has sorta told my sister to stop, but as she is an essential worker, my sister still says i’m a lesbian when shes gone. i can’t stand her. shes always been the ‘perfect’ daughter. 

i tend to go to my grandparents, a lot. i love my grandma and (step)grandpa. it’s a relaxation from my sister and from my dad. lets move onto my dad.

he claims he was an angel, while my grandma told me when he was 18 he blew away the $2,000 he had from his father (died when he was 17). he came home drunk, late, after curfew. he constantly complains i don’t have good grades. yeah, i’m stressed and can’t handle it. he doesn’t know about my diagnosis. according to him, since i’m less sporty i should try and get straight a’s so i can take care of him when he’s old. at this rate, my sister and i will take our mom in but not our dad.

mom-take (insert dog name) outside quick.

me-ok i’ll do it in a minute when the show is over.

dad-you f*****g do it now! when your mother tells you to do a simple chore, jump and sprint! 

dad wasn’t really punished @ his mom’s, as she didn’t find my grandfather until her mid 50’s. he expects us to do everything he asks us to without batting our eyes. sure, he had to do a lot of chores because it was just his mother. he expects wayyyy to much out of me, and too harsh. mind you, he set a time limit on my phone because i was on it too much. when i was doing a sport, mondays, tuesdays, thursdays i was on my phone for under 20 minutes. 

he is also an essential worker, working 15 hour shifts and he needs surgery once this all blows over. then again, he also says that children are for doing things and thats why he had us. sir, you didn’t wrap it before you tapped it. neither my sister or i were planned, after my sister i wasn’t suppose to happen until a was 5, at least.

tl;dr- my sister is sorta verbally abusive, punches me, and is calling me a lesbian, adding to my issues w/stability. my dad ‘had children so we could do chores’, expects too much, set a limit on my phone, and doesn’t understand that i’m not stable. 

please give me advice, fyi i’m typing this on my phone so sorry for errors/format."
925,A friend is being abused by a family member and I dont know how to help,"Sorry if this isnt the right Reddit but I dont know where else to turn.

A friend just brought up in casual conversation that their uncle regularly strangles them, I immediately freaked out with worry and started asking in about it and trying to talk about what the heck is going on. My friend went on to try and make a ton of excuses for their uncle as to why his behavior is okay, including statements such as ""it doesnt give any permanent damage"" and saying its just playful. Specifically they described the action as "" He wraps his hands around my throat and throttles me a bit "" and that was after they started sending panicked excuses on their uncles behalf which leads me to believe its watered down. They eventually insisted to stop talking about it so I dropped it after just asking them to think about it.

They live across the world from me so there's no way I can help in person and I dont know what to do as they seem so dedicated to not acknowledging that its a problem."
926,Jesus christ i just realized how brave i was for coming onto reddit :8,Which means everyone else who is posting on here is courageous enough to do so as well. One act of bravery is one step closer to change. Good night.
927,Mental health inpatient / rehab suggestions,"Hi (I’m sorry this is my first reddit post idk if I’m doing it right)
I’m 19 years old (turning 20 in a month) and I really need help in terms of my mental health.
I hate listing this but I need real recommendations so this is what I’m diagnosed with:
I have panic disorder/general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder and  dermatillomania (a form of OCD) 
I left college on medical leave to focus on getting better, but I truly think I need to go to an inpatient care (my parents agree and they are both very supportive!!) 
My mom suggested paradigm Malibu. Does anyone know about this place? Or have any other recommendations???!!!
All ideas are welcome !!! Pls suggest"
928,Today’s my birthday but I am sad because...,"Today is my birthday and I am feeling so sad because my friends greeted me without feelings. I think they just greeted me like I’m another day to pass nothing special. Its probably I expected more from them that’s why I’m like this but I cannot help myself to compare my birthday greetings to the ones they had during their birthdays. We got the same group of friends btw. Is it just me or is my feelings correct, that they don’t value me as much as I thought they do? Any advice or insights will do."
929,I am diagnosed with MDD and I found out that my batchmates called me suicidal behind my back,"My mental disorder is not something I am ashamed of. I actively talk about mental health to spread awareness to the people who knows me. So, my depression is not a secret to my batchmates. I am not super sensitive about it as long as they approach me in a respectful manner. I actually would be more than happy if they want to engage in a conversation with me about my disorder.

However, I found out a couple of months ago that my batchmates actually talked about my MDD and me in a negative manner. I was super hurt and I can not get over it until today. I am not sure if it was a one-time event or not. But, I felt really suicidal when I was made aware of it. Did you have any experience like this? If so, what can I do to stop myself from feeling depressive whenever I remember it? I just thought my batchmates were my friends or at least something."
930,I've been having nightmares about a thing I have no control over in real life. How do I stop them?,"Something happened a while back that was traumatic in my life. I know I am powerless to do anything about it and for the most part while I am awake, I have learnt to deal with it.

However, I had that dream again, and it was just agonizing me, that feeling of powerlessness. I am fine now that I am awake, but how do I stop these nightmares?"
931,"Music, Depression and Suicide","Hi Folks. Im writing a research paper on the positive connection between music, depression and suicide. I was inspired to research this topic after reading youtube comments of people saying that a certain song or album had saved their life. If music has had an impact on your depression, Id love to hear your story. Please share anything you feel comfortable sharing in the comments below."
932,Self harm relapse after probably 15+ years. Not in a great place. Help.,"This is going to be a long one. I am in a queer poly relationship, if you aren't cool with that please move along.

My background: I'm a lesbian. My parents weren't cool with it growing up and were physically abusive at times. I had a rough upbringing. Turned to self harm to cope as a teen. Currently 33. Just left a 9 year relationship that wasnt working, just moved provinces for the first time in my life.

Met a girl on tinder about 7 months ago. Got talking 24/7, really just clicked. Turns out shes poly and is married. Not really something I was looking for but ended up deciding to give it a go because I was really into this girl. Decide to move for a lot of reasons but rush it to see this girl because things are pretty great. As I'm sorting out moving, her wife gets diagnosed with cancer. Girl obviously wants to pause things between us, which is fine, all things considered. Move anyways. We meet, wanting to just be friends at this point but the chemistry is.... a lot. With a lot of discussion and figuring things out we decide to make things more official and actually date despite everything (her wife wants that. Wants her to be happy. Wants things to carry on as if she wasnt sick. Shes legit a great person). Things were finally going great after a lot of rough patches. 

And then corona hits. We cant see each other because her wife is immunocompromised. Which is okay. We've been making it work as best we can. Helping each other (at a distance) with errands, etc.

All of this (plus other mental health things on her end) are finally starting to wear on her. Things are starting to fall apart on her end.

I just moved. Left all my friends and family. Left a great job, a sport I loved (that was my life for years). Left a gym that was important to me. Now with corona I have none of that. And no opportunity to rebuild like I had planned. The last couple months I have been pouring my all into being supportive and loving to her. Because I do love her. And it has been great. I feel like shes the last good thing I have left right now. And her whole life is falling apart and understandably shes struggling. I feel like our relationship is starting to feel the strain with everything going on.

I got into a headspace of just feeling worthless tonight. Just so down and hopeless and lost. I daydream about suicide often lately. I dont think I'd actually follow through but it seems comforting in a fucked up way to have an ""out"".

I cut myself tonight. I havent done that since I was a teenager. Maybe 15. I feel like I'm in a hard place. And I also feel like I cant tell my girlfriend because she already has way too much to worry about on her plate and is barely functioning as is.

I know some of you wont understand this type of relationship, and I wouldn't have either. But when things are working it is so great. I feel loved and safe and fulfilled, so please no judgement on that front.

I just really love her. And I have given my all into this. Like every ounce I have to give to be supportive. Feel like I've put my own needs aside to make sure I'm doing everything I can for someone I love in a really fucked up time in her life. Like I go above and beyond when I love someone, and especially right now with everything happening I've just been trying my best. She deserves that right now. 

It's my birthday the end of this month. I'm going to spend it alone because of corona. And I'm just going to be a whole mess. Was just going to be a day about me when I've been putting myself aside for so long. And now I feel like I'm barely going to be able to get myself out of bed. Past years I usually throw a big party with lots of friends, and now nothing.

I feel like I'm losing sight of who I was. I knew who I was before I moved. I had an identity. Now I feel like I dont know who I am or what I I stand for. 

I feel like I lack coping skills. When things get hard I just shut down or turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms.

Things just suck real hard right now. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far. Not in a place where I want to kill myself, so no worries on that front. Just feeling awful."
933,Scared to start losing weight,"So I have had some problems with eating disorders in my past. I lost 70 pounds in a very short period of time and became unhealthy. After I started dating my boyfriend we talked about it and he helped me through it and gradually got me eating healthy portions without punishing myself or getting sick. However I have gained a bit of extra weight and even though I'm not very confident right now I'm scared to start dieting or any weight loss activities because I don't want to relapse.

What should I do? Any advice would be appreciated"
934,How do I recover?,"I think I’ve figured things out. So my bf broke up with me in the midst of all this chaos. I have had an extremely hard time. My eating problems have began to arise again, my self harm methods have become worse, and I am purposely depriving myself of sleep. I am struggling both mentally, socially, and physically from all this stuff. But yet I think he’s doing ok while I’m not. And I think I found out why. Freedom. Freedom to play games instead of worrying ab texting me. Freedom to watch explicit things without me getting mad. While I still am left with the guilt that I did so many things wrong to end my relationship. Are all breakups like this? Why am I struggling so much? Why can’t I just move on and enjoy myself like it seems like he has? How do I move past this all?"
935,Why do I have no emotions,"I'm a (16M) and I don't feel anything. I haven't felt any emotions in a long time and I find it really hard to do anything because of it. I don't have any fun when I'm with friends, or family. I have no future dreams or aspirations, I  have no drive to do anything. I don't get mad or sad, and I'm can't express any empathy to anyone or anything. Is there anything I can do."
936,"This self-care stuff doesn’t do anything for me, feeling nothing at all doing it","Hey,

So I used to be clinically depressed which improved when I started a great degree and met the most kind people. Now I am socially distancing from them and I feel just as isolated as I did back then. I completely lost my ease and light-heartedness. Yoga or journaling don’t do anything for me, I really don’t feel anything during and after it. Painting bores me and so do video games. I try to exercise on most days, go for a run or a bike ride in the forest, then I feel super isolated not having seen a single human for an hour.

I miss the hugs from my colleagues and friends, the casual touches, having a chat with the bus driver or the employees at the bakery, seeing other humans on public transport, the coffee breaks with my colleagues, the group projects in uni, hearing someone breathe in my office or the chewing sounds during lunch break. Now I’m stuck with my parents who are basically strangers to me, emotionally unavailable. I now watch concerts all the time to see and hear humans."
937,Confused about where I am with my mental health,"I am definitely a lot mentally healthier than this time a year ago. This is probably the most mentally healthy I’ve been in my life and I know that. I do a lot of things to help myself (especially during lockdown) such as journaling gratitude and self reflections, exercise regularly, eat fairly healthy, sleep fairly well and so on. I have always had mood swings but lately they have been quiet often. They’re not as intense as they used to be but they’re still big enough for me to feel like a completely different person. When I’m happy I’m usually quiet energetic and dance around or clean, I try to stay active but when I’m sad I just mope around and cry on and I will switch like that in minutes, hours, days or even weeks. I feel like I’m in such a different state for each mood I’m in that it just doesn’t feel like I can connect say a sad me to happy me. My memory is quiet bad also, when I’m happy I don’t remember a lot of things from when I’m sad and vice versa. These days my lows are usually only for a couple days or so and my highs tend to last at least a good 5 days but I have a couple days a week usually when it’s almost every hour during a day. I can’t tell if this is me going into a manic phase or if I am actually happy? I don’t feel so “gotta fucking zoom” I just have energy to be productive and maybe a little more, but not crazy I’m gonna all of a sudden go for a 3 k run. I find my mind isn’t racing as much but then the smallest thing can set me off and I’ll think I’ll be moving on from a traumatic situation and start thinking about it only to get upset about it. I can’t tell if this is me processing the trauma or if I’m just getting stuck and dwelling on it. Just wanted to express how I feel somewhere, if anyone could be kind enough to give me any sort of advice even though this is a lot to unpack. 

P.s. I hope you’re all safe during lockdown, stay safe and stay home"
938,I don’t get why I should live,"I’m confused of why I should live if everybody wants me to die and hates me and I genuinely don’t understand why I should stay alive or why people say that I shouldn’t just kill myself, can anybody explain what the actual upsides of staying alive are?"
939,recently i’ve been feeling very off,ever since around march and the corona outbreak everything in my mind has changed.I feel like the days are going by so fast and that i’m wasting my time. I am fearful that I will waste my life without any accomplishments. I keep having these weird feelings that i’m in a dream or that life isn’t real and just barrel roll into negative thoughts.It all started after I stopped using marijuana but that was a while ago and these feelings are different then the withdrawal
940,bad trip,"I had a bad trip yesterday I felt like I was going crazy no way back.... still not feeling well I cant sleep
any help? this is a nightmare
(please just advice and positive things or im gonna cry) 
I've created a new reddit acount cause I cant remember my user I've lost all my braincells i know it"
941,Daydreaming &amp; Imaginary Conversations,"So I realise I've always been daydreaming when I'm doing things, and I like to conjure up imaginary conversations with others whom I trust and care about. I waste a lot of time doing this, to the extent that I can spend hours in front of my textbook not flipping a page and wasting the whole day. Is there a certain disorder for this or is it related to anything? I feel like asking my psychiatrist about it but I feel it might not be serious enough."
942,Can’t motivate myself to do simple tasks,"I have a hard time motivating myself to do really simple tasks.  For example, I slept a couple days w/o bed sheets because I didn’t want to put new sheets on. I let my laundry go unwashed for weeks at a time, can’t put things back where they belong, etc. For the longest time I thought I was the laziest person alive and it just sent me into a spiral of guilt and shame.  I didn’t even realize it might be depression until my parents once came to visit a new apartment I had just moved into and we’re shocked about how nothing was put away or set up and that I had lost a decent amount of weight since they last saw me (from not eating regularly). The worst part is that I know I feel so much better when I’m able to complete these tasks yet I still don’t do them and it makes me feel so useless, lazy and embarrassed. I was starting to get a lot better and got on a really good schedule before we had to be under quarantine.  But now that I’m staying at home all the time it’s gotten bad again."
943,When is a good time to talk about Mental Health with a S/O?,"Hello! I've recently entered a relationship which is extraordinarily exciting for me. I'm thrilled for whats to come. That being said, I struggle with mental health issues, and would like to discuss how they affect me with her because I feel that they could potentially get in the way, or come off as me being careless or neglectful(?). This wouldn't come as a shock to her because we've briefly talked about social anxiety and depression and body dysphoria, but never anything in depth. I have a bad habit of unloading my problems into relationships and leaning too hard on the support I receive from a partner. Relationships take time and patience and a lot of effort but I feel like I'm in a good spot to do that, but at the same time I know that I'll be struggling with my own issues regardless of my relationship status. I am on medication, I see a therapist and a psych (not recently due to COVID), and am being evaluated for bi-polar or some other mood disorders. Sometimes I can seem totally enthusiastic about something and then the next second I'm dropping into a weird depression for no reason. Around my good friends that's alright because they know me, but I'm worried about coming off as fake to my partner because I try and mask that topsy-turviness.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR How can I go about discussing my mental health issues with my partner in a way that isn't overbearing and is considerate of how they deserve to be treated in a relationship?"
944,fractured memories/dreams making me feel sick,"this is pretty weird. since yesterday i've been having intermittent thoughts that i just can't place from memory but feel like they happened or i dreamt them. every 30 minutes or so. when it happens i get a feeling of confusion and dread, start to feel nauseous and begin sweating.

it's incredibly uncomfortable both physically and mentally, and i have no idea what is actually going on.

I take mirtazapine 30mg and seroquel 200mg every night before bed and have had no issues with this for 2 years. as far as i'm aware i'm not withdrawing from anything. 

I will be speaking with my psychiatrist about this as soon as possible but that's pretty far away, does anyone know what's going on with this?"
945,does anyone else like jump from thing to thing?,"so that title made no sense, but i have no idea how to put it in words. basically almost everything i do, i have a change of heart on it. For example, i was just obsessed with euphoria for like a month but now idk anymore. like deadass just today or yesterday i looked at the cover of it and i didn't feel that strong love and obsession i had for it, just days ago. another example is i play on the basketball team, but the entire season, i didn't even like basketball. i loved football. though, i just recently started to like basketball again and dont really care for football anymore. its hard to find more specific examples but the best way ive found to put it is I have a change of heart on a lot of things in my life. I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and depression just fyi. so am i being a hormonal teen or is something actually going on."
946,My Friend With Munchausens,"So, I have a friend who seems like he has Munchausens. I'm not a doctor but ... He's convinced he's dying of organ failure. He has been seen at UCLA, Cedars-Sinai, USC, &amp; The Mayo Clinic. He refuses to believe that he is okay and he has been taken to the psych unit at UCLA as well as the Mayo Clinic in the past 30 days. The thing is he has mental health knowledge so he knows what to say to get out of the psych unit and immediately goes back to to being ""physically ill."" It's all very disturbing and came out of nowhere. It's been going on for only a month too. His friends and family are deeply concerned and it's really difficult right now. Is there anything we can do to help him? We're deathly worried."
947,I can’t stop obsessing over people/things,"Whether it’s a special interest (usually a macabre topic which involves violence of some kind), or a person whom of which I don’t even have to know, but nonetheless become completely fascinated with and will religiously check on them/see what they’re posting every hour of every day. They have to be interesting in order for me to do this, and it becomes a bit of a project for me. It’s not even in a “I care for them and want to see if they’re doing okay” kind of way, it’s more of in a possessive kind of way. No I do not physically stalk people, that would be creepy. It’s just online. I like studying their thought processes. It has no emotion attached to it, but I become very fixated on them so much so that it honestly scares me a bit. It can’t be healthy but it’s the only thing that (temporarily) cures my boredom. It’s either fixating on people or violent criminals/cases. I’m not sure what this could mean but I just felt like sharing for some reason."
948,"I like to buy things when I’m sad. But, the things I buy aren’t for myself, they’re for my loved ones.","If I can at least brighten their day, that’s good enough."
949,Am I even living life the right way?,"It's 2:00 am and I felt empty. I started reading a bit to calm my nerves and go to sleep. I just finished the book. It's over, but finishing the book perfectly captured this emotions that I've been feeling for the past few days perfectly: am I living life right? 

I'm 20 years old living with my parents at home studying math, but is that what I'm supposed to be doing? 
Shouldn't I be doing more? Should I be going in a different direction? What about this way that I'm heading means something to me? And whats the point? If I don't marry, if I don't procreate, was my life meaningful? Who will come to my funeral? Does it matter? Will I feel empty when I die?

Am I a good son? Am I going the right way? Will the gaping hole at the center of my core every be filled? Am I destined to carry this longing for meaning my whole life?  Am I destined to feel empty forever? When will I feel full? 

I keep having dreams of my loved ones getting murdered, or killed in horribly slow deaths, so I haven't gotten much sleep. A notable one was two nights ago where I had to sit with my mother, whose neck was completely shattered by a car accident. I had to comfort her as she burned up and died. I was helpless. I was so scared I'm actually tearing up as I write this because I hadn't let the emotions hit me until right now. I feel so helpless. 

Does my life mean anything really? Am I worth anything at all?"
950,I finally burned out and now I feel empty,"So I've been working from home for the past month during quarantine. Work has been extremely stressful. They're overworking us to the bone and taking advantage of the fact that we're at home by making us work crazy hours. I'm also working a second job online just to stay afloat and so I've been working 14 hour days. And besides the fact that I'm working almost all the time They decided to add 2 extra unpaid working days per week for us at my job which was essentially the final nail in the coffin. And I finally cracked. I finished my shift just past midnight the other day and I was completely disassociated. I didn't want to do anything that used to bring me joy before. I didn't feel like doing anything. I love video games but now they feel pointless. I love binge watching series but that felt unnecessary. I thought it would be just that night but I've been feeling that way ever since. Nothing feels worthwhile anymore. Like... what's the point? What am I even fighting for? I work and work and work for a less than minimum wage job, struggling to make ends meet and for what? I don't see a way out anymore. Especially not now. I know the whole world's in disarray and I'm sorry if I sound like I'm whining when a lot of people have lost their jobs :( but I'm just so exhausted."
951,I've been told my scars make me unattractive and I'm starting to think I should cover them and just never let them show again.,"About two years back (I was 16) I had some suicidal thoughts and had a major self harm addiction. Like I couldn't go through the day without it. I wa also dealing with anorexia, depression, mood disorders, anxiety etc. I was kicked out of my family home. I was hospitalized too many times to count for stitches and procedures and had a couple inpatient stays as well. I basically lost everyone in my life because of my mental health or lack of mental health.

This left me with scars. A ton of scars that are heavy concentrated on my inner for arms and upper arms but also on my thighs, chest and side. 

During my struggles (or the thick of it) I covered everything up as I often had stitches in my arms but as I began to recover I began wearing shorts and short sleeves again, comfortably. However people have always looked at me like I'm insane and tell me they make me really ugly and how no one will ever care about me with a body like mine, that I ruined it etc.

I was normally able to ignore it but now that I'm going away to college I'm thinking I should try to hide my past, my medication and the way my body looks especially my arms. I guess what I'm asking or saying is should I cover my arms? Are they gross or scary?

Sorry that was a long rambling post."
952,It’s not comforting to know that I’m not alone in the way I feel.,"I know people always say oh you’re not alone there’s so many other people who feel the same way you aren’t abnormal or alone or whatever for feeling this way and be being so depressed and somehow that’s supposed to be a comforting thought, but it’s really not.

How is it any different to me that thousands of people are suffering just like me when my suffering doesn’t care regardless whether I’m the only person in the world who feels like this or if everyone in the world feels like this. I’m not alone, so what?? I am alone it doesn’t matter if someone else feels the same way. If anything that’s even more terrifying a thought that we are all so cumulatively helpless and that if so many people are suffering the same way then there’s no real hope. Just a thought."
953,At a loss and very confused,"I hate me. Now I’m sure everyone feels this way. So please let me explain.

My childhood was robbed from me (25F) by alcoholism with my single parent. I became very self sufficient at a very young age and very mature way too fast for my own good (hind sight is always 20/20). I watched for years as my parent was abused verbally and physically until of course I grew of age. 

I began dating and I thought it was a grand idea to get engaged at 20 little to no surprise we ended things. I moved home ya da,ya da  and then started to a guy. I’ve been seeing him for almost three years now. We are both toxic and fight and argue. He has emotionally cheated on me and despite (it not being “real” cheating) that I feel so insecure always I guess. He is GLUED to his phone. Which concerns me reasonably but what has really got me lately is the lack of romance. nothing short of Sahara dry. 

We used to be explorative in BDSM and foreplay but nothing now. I chalk it up to I’m a bitch and he hates me bc I’m bipolar, or he just doesn’t have a drive. He claims no drive due to...the list could go forever. But it’s me bottom line. I’m the problem. My mood swings. My constant insecurity and my constant new found annoyance with his phone. Some days I tell myself I want out and others I say no bc I’m the problem and I can fix myself. However I don’t think I can change. The trust is gone and I’m just left always feeling mad. He is a great guy and though we are some times toxic toward one another we care and love truly for one another. I just feel he would be more beneficial if he dated others because I can see how much he is frustrated and hates being by my side. Understandable. I have so much bullshit damage that I truly cannot be a normal human. I can’t talk without sounding like I’m a customer service robot, I’m constantly cleaning frantically, and worst of all my word vomit is through the roof. Things just foam out and I can’t shut myself up. I despise how not in control I am anymore and how much of a twat I’ve grown into. I seek to date a girl but who am I kidding? They will hate my mentally ill self just as much as my current does now. It’s just me and I’m the problem. I’m u lovable and can’t love anyone else properly. I love at first and then it fills into hate. 
I want control back of my mind and mouth. 
I want to be calm and elegant. 
I want to be pretty. I want to feel pretty. 

I just want to see and be enough for me. 

I’m such a big piece of shit. And that’s all for today."
954,Life is confusing and I feel like I’m slipping into bad habits,"Background: 18F adhd
 So I’ve been smooth sailing for a while now (few months) on my current mess and feeling pretty good. Of course what’s happening globally has effected that in ways that I don’t really understand? I’m super introverted and an artist with not too many friends and I like it that way. I’m used to being home a lot and by myself and I’m perfectly comfortable like that, obviously I still went out way more so this is still a huge adjustment. Overall, I saw the quarantine and being home as a positive for personal growth and I was trying to make the best of it and do things I don’t usually have time for. Anyways, I’m about a month in now and I’ve realized that when I take my meds I’m actually getting way too wired and my “drive” to be productive is almost too high...I can’t focus on anything and I end up making lists and planning all day and getting sidetracked but never completing things. I’m having trouble finding my focus. I want to do everything all at once. At the same time i’m procrastinating a project I’ve been working on for 2 years that is due mid-may for my AP testing. I’m terrified I won’t finish and I end up getting so mad at myself whenever I don’t work on it...which is almost every day. The thing is I feel (or at least i felt) really good, I was so motivated and positive and I just am so overwhelmed and confused now about how to get back to that place. At the beginning of quarantine I was working out every day and super confident and it’s been so hard to keep up with my routines because they take so much time and I end up procrastinating and things take all day. I’ve been having trouble sleeping which makes some days really gross and I just don’t feel good. I seriously have SO MANY things I’d love to do. I’ve started just about every different project or hobby I can at my house and I can’t focus on all these things. But, I just keep doing new things to distract myself from how much I need to do. I’ve never had issues with food before and I naturally eat super healthy with no problem just because I like to. But since Easter, we got lots of candy in the house and sweets are my weakness lol. I’ve never beat myself up about it so much though. I don’t stop eating all day, I always have something to snack on and I’m not even hungry. But I can’t stop. And then I just do it to self-destruct and I end up getting mad that I’ve done it again. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for listening haha i’m sorry if that was hella disorganized. if anyone feels similar or has advice or anything pls comment i’d love to talk to anybody about this lol."
955,Advice and help,"Hello people of this page just doing my first post ever and it would be about me needing some help and advice for what I go through lol. Anyways some background about myself I am 17 years of age and a senior in high school trying to live life the best I can and enjoy it. I have been what seems to be anxiety and I would like to know if I have improved and for any help I could get.

I have experienced anxiety attacks and feel disconnected from myself and my surroundings. When I first figured out what happend to me was when I got up too fast and I tried walking, at first I felt dizzy and tried to play it off and keep walking but I had to grab on to sometime and felt like I wasn't in my body. Luckily I didn't fall and I was able to hold on to something and for about 5 seconds I felt like I was in a dream and I tried to tell my sister and niece and I felt they thought I was crazy. That same day I just couldn't let go of the thought of that feeling I got and I was super scared and decided that it was best for me to go to the hospital, we went and they checked me and even checked my heart and everything was fine. 

The next time (approximately 2-3 weeks later) I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt oh I just woke up randomly ill just go back to sleep and all of a sudden I just thought to myself wait I can't breathe. So I just suddenly felt I wasn't able to breath and I started panicking and I was so nervous and scared I felt reality change into a dream and I thought this is over this is how I got. I went to my moms room and woke her up to explain how I was feeling and from me just telling her made me feel like I was still here and I just got this little hope in me and I started to feel better but I still felt I was going to die and I couldn't breath. So my mom calmed me down and said she gets like that too and that she sometimes feel she can't breathe but she just calms down and relaxes. So little by little I started calming down trying to relax my self but I am still nervous and shaking. So I just felt it was safer to sleep with her just incase anything happens to me and I get the same feeling again.

Still confused as I am thinking about those two events I never really thought about it too much. The 3rd time this happened to me I was watching the Irish men on my computer and I just got this warm feeling on my arms and I was like oh well I just got warm its fine. Then I thought to myself wait im I dreaming or is this real life and I felt my body was like changing and I was getting out of it just a weird feeling right away I went to my mom and told her of how I feel like I'm getting the same feeling again and she says let's go for a walk. We go and i start to feel calm and safer but I got really nervous thinking about what I felt. Later on that night my mom explains to me and says my sister used to get like this and its perhaps anxiety. So I call my sister and talk to her and explain what I felt and she said yea I probably have anxiety. 

After these events over the course of 4 months I would get these feelings of me getting disconnected from myseld and surroundings and get the so called anxiety attacks. There has even been times were i felt like ive broken down and cried because I feel like im going to go insane and lose myself. So far the way I feel safer is by telling my girlfriend right away of how I'm feeling and just by I feel like I'm still here and im safe. When I get anxiety attacks I always feel I can't breathe and something is wrong and I'm going to die and I feel disconnected from my surroundings and nothing is real and I'm in a dream. I feel I've improved from when I first got it to now as I dont panic or try to over think as much when I get them. 

Sometimes I passively feel disconnected from myself and surroundings. I feel like I also lose my emotions as well and I don't feel like I could laugh or anything. Recently I've felt that my anxiety comes from me always overthinking everything, even tiny little things that don't really matter too much. Since the end of March to now I've been to the hospital 3 times due to me thinking I can't breathe or swallow. All times they said I'm fine even xrayed me and said I was fine and getting 100 percent oxygen and they say I have anxiety. During this time I would be at home thinking about me breathing and swallowing and I'm always in manual breathing mode (sorry for if I turned anyone to manual mode) and I couldn't stop thinking about breathing and swallowing. Anytime when I felt I cant swallow I would get scared and think something is wrong with me.

Today I feel like ive improved but at the same time I feel like i haven't. The last time I got an anxiety attack or felt disconnected was last week and last week I had about 3 of them becasue I felt i couldn't swallow or breathe. Now I have tried to distract myself and I know I could swallow and breathe and try not to think of it too much. I still feel disconnected from my surroundings but i feel distracting myself and not thinking about that makes me feel like myself again. It still scares me when I think about how I am living and if this is actually real life and I feel that I'm so used to being disconnected from myself I don't know how it is to truly feel like myself. I also sometimes feel I forget things easily now and this also scares me.

So that will be the end of this post I would appreciate and advice or feed back to me. Sorry I find it hard for me to explain this and I feel I would jump on to different topics and this post would be all over the place. Thank you for taking your time and I would be open to answer any questions you guys have and I will try to respond asap. Thank you and have a wonderful day/or night."
956,you ever push everyone you used to cherish out of your life because you overthink what that thing they said means when it really doesn't mean that and your anxiety creates false narratives of situations resulting in self destruction?,"because same, it's lonely over here."
957,what to do instead of self harm ?,"my family is so fucking dysfunctional and it doesn’t help i have anxiety and depression but i have these strong intense desires to just cut or even kill myself when i’m in a low point. they come and go tho and i would never commit suicide because i’m a pussy but i want to self harm but i know i’ll end up regretting it later because i always do. i’ve become aware of this, but the intense desire to harm myself to release stress is killing me and idk what to do."
958,my (29F) boyfriend (29) thinks people are watching him,"hello! this is my first post in this sub and i'm on mobile so sorry if it formats weird. this is a long one and i apologise but i'm desperate for answers and i figured a bit of history would help layout the timeline of his symptoms.

jumping right in, about 4 years ago we split and went our separate ways. he's always been an odd guy, we're both on the spectrum so we do things a bit differently. it wasn't until 2 years ago that we got back in touch and he had such a grandeur story to tell. people were stalking him at work, they were in the ceiling and tracking him from room to room at the senior care home he worked at. then it turned into them following him home and suddenly all of his lotions and soaps were contaminated or a different texture. then his food was being messed with. 

i drove out into the mountains in the middle of nowhere to pick him up because he had thought hiking a trail to over two states away would be a good cover and a grand adventure for him. he last a week and a half and when i picked him up he was starving and deathly sick but he was still going on about being watched. he said that the water where he lived last had animal hair in it, like flowing from the faucet that way and that there were drones following him now so he had to run again and ended up here. 

he stayed with me for a year, i live in a rural area right by the ocean. we had a guard dog and i went to extra lengths to make him feel secure. life was good for a while, we reconnected and strengthened our relationship. he still had to pack certain food items around for safety and would buy bottled water to drink instead of using the reverse osmosis filter we had.


eventually the fishing job he had here died down and we were getting strapped for cash. a fellow fisherman offered to pay his way to Alaska and a spot on his boat and we both agreed it was best. he would make good money and eventually i would follow him up with our son. he was very stable and happy through all of this, he barely ever spoke of people acting strange to him or feeling like he's being watched. everything was pretty good.

about 6 months ago, after the fishing died down, he found work as a welder and steelworker. he was happy, getting good pay and enjoying his work but all of a sudden he started bringing up odd things that would happen to him or that he thinks someone has something against him. it's turned into him building a Faraday cage in his home to sleep in and has messed with his phone so much trying to get VPNs and private browsers that he's killed it or given it a virus and now he's convinced they're watching and limiting what he does on it. he barely calls and when he does he rambles but he won't get into specifics because, of course, our conversation is monitored by them.

i've begged him to see a doctor or therapist and he said he has but they didn't have anything to say to him. he says he knows that all of this sounds crazy, he's very aware that his thoughts and actions are not normal. he hallucinatinates, i do believe, but its not anything too outlandish. he's very adamant that he knows he sounds crazy and that he feels crazy but he thinks this must all be real. i don't know how to handle this at all, i want to be with him so badly but he won't see a doctor and he wont tell me about things that 'happen'. i have loved him very much and pushed through all those moments where i wanted to cry and give up. he is so sweet and kindhearted, i just want to settle down finally but how do i handle this? we can't raise our child around this, we can't tell him why dad is hiding in the basement with a tinfoil helmet. and yes, that's happened but thankfully little dude is too young to understand. i really want our relationship and love to work out. i'm very willing to battle this with him but we need appropriate tools to help. i myself struggle with depression and other mental hurdles so dealing with this on top of my own needs is difficult, especially being autistic and having to carefully balance myself mentally every day.

does anyone have experience with something like this? is this schizophrenia? can he be crazy if he's that self aware of his bad thoughts and feelings? i have to apologise again for the giant wall of text but if you've read this far, thanks. it's at least nice to know that some of this is off my chest. i greatly appreciate any advice or maybe a chat if you've gone through something similar ❤️"
959,My Anxiety and Depression are Making me Hate Myself Deeply.,"I've been formally diagnosed for going on 5 years now and I've tried medications but they've all made me too numb. Which is considerably worse because I lack a lot of empathy when I get that numb and lack a filter with my words so I have been on none for a long time. I lost some friendships even during that time. 

Now I've learned some coping mechanisms and have tried to make myself exercise more and surround myself with good company. Including my wonderful boyfriend of almost 4 years now, but my depression has come back full force to where I just cry sometimes and I don't know why. I could even be happy a majority of the day and it just hits like a wall and I can't stop it. Or my anxiety kicks in and I get I swear almost a fight or flight response when having to socialize outside my boyfriend, even with online friends. I know it is miserable for him and he tries to be understanding but I straight up hate myself after every time and find myself apologizing profusely. 

At this point I don't know what to do and I'm seeking advice, medication deeply worries me and I'd prefer to steer clear of it. The apathetic feeling I get on it and with-drawl of nearly all my emotions makes me scared and uncomfortable in a different way. 

I am just really lost, and sad, and deeply resenting myself at this point."
960,Driving myself crazy!!,"‼️SELF HARM WARNING‼️


Alright so i’m young. 13 to be exact (i don’t mind people knowing my age its fine) And i have both depression and anxiety, i take medicine for seeing and hearing things as well, and everyday. it gets so hard not to harm myself in some way...i’m itching to harm. but i can’t because my mom has locked everything away. Sometimes i cry and bite myself but i’m afraid to bite because i’ll get sent away. My mom threatens to send me away to a mental ward if i don’t get myself under control. I have self harmed about three or four times but every time i did it, it felt so good...like a release of something bad inside me. I loved to watch the blood drip down my arm or my thigh. I’ve lied to people about my scars. i have two predominant ones on my wrist and one on the back of my hand. Recently i tried using scissors but i couldn’t press down hard enough for blood to come out. I feel like i’m being suffocated when i can’t harm myself and i want to. None of my friends understand. and the thing is that i lie to people around me often because. honestly. i don’t know who i am anymore. i don’t know what my favorite things are. i feel no emotions except anger and hate. I find myself talking to things that aren’t there in my room. I need an escape. and cutting is the only way out for me. Someone please help me"

963,Quality teletherapy recommendations?,"I've been looking off and on for a therapist via video conference for a while, and it occurred to me that the present global crisis may have improved the resources and anecdotes out there for finding such a thing.

The only service I know about is betterhelp but I heard some pretty mixed feedback and read some things about them employing people with no training or unequipped social workers and passing them off as trained therapists.

I don't have health insurance but I've never had luck the times I've sought help through health insurance anyway. I can pay a reasonably priced professional out of pocket.

Are there outlets or services online that people can recommend that worked well for them in getting therapy remotely for depression?"
964,I have hypnic jerk and can’t stop!,Right now I can’t sleep and it’s been three hours since I’ve been in bed. I do not have anxieties or feel like I’m panicking but for some reason my body keeps jerking when I am drifting off to go to sleep. Does anyone know what to do?
965,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I have a hard time talking about mental health because I'm scared of the reaction. But I had to get this off my chest.
I'm a 21F and my mental health has been taking a toll on me. Especially these past few days. 
My sister turned 17 a few days ago and as a gift, my mom got her a 5 month old puppy. Technically he's my sister's but I love him so much. But I keep having this worrying feeling that either 1)She's going to end up giving him away or 2) Something bad will happen to him. I never had my own dog before, but my grandmother had a dog when I stayed with her one summer when I was about 9 and she had puppies. They gave two away and the other was hit by a car and died. I guess this is where my fear comes from, but that was so long ago. I even almost cried the other night when I was thinking about it.
That's not the only reason I'm worried, I also want to cry at random times especially at night when I'm supposed to sleep. I also get cheats pains sometimes (like a squeezing feeling),  I can sleep a long time without getting tired (my parents just think I'm lazy), I don't even feel like showering or being productive sometimes, and I can't ever enjoy myself because I have a ""gut feeling"" something bad will happen, but most times nothing happens. 
I'm actually trying my best to be happy, I'm supposed to go to university in August and finally get my own apartment and car soon but I can't stop these awful thoughts and worries that everything is gonna go to shit (and its not because of coronavirus, I was having these feelings back in January/February). 
This has been happening for a while (on and off since my parents divorced when I was 14) but it's been so bad lately, especially with my new family member. I'm sorry if this is all over the place, I'm almost crying reading this, I just don't like talking about it to my family and friends because I'm scared they'll think low of me for some reason."
966,-LOST- 🌄🏞️,"I feel so lost, confused &amp; numb in life. I thought I'd have my shit together by now, 25.... But I clearly don't, I can't seem to find support/or the leg up to do so. It feels like when I met requirements for things in life, the other party don't deliver. For some reason I've found myself NEEDING HELP. A leg up, for some reason I never had the opportunity to go out &amp; do it on my own for myself. I'd ALWAYS have to have the help of someone else? Having to rely on people 🤷🏽‍♀️😭 it's embarrassing, why. I never had the actual help &amp; support through life to 'set me up' for the big world, my parents didn't get there lives together until my LATE TEENS. so know help &amp; support, yes friends are good but they have their own lives. I wonder why I was even born?"
967,How do I tell my boyfriend I want to kill myself,"Trigger warning: suicide, suicidal thoughts

I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts ever since I was 11 &amp; I’m 22 now. I have opened up about my depression &amp; anxiety with my current boyfriend &amp; he has been supportive 100%. He knows when I’m having my really bad days &amp; also encourages me to talk about how I’m feeling if I’m up for it. However, lately it has been extremely hard &amp; I simply don’t want to be here anymore. I have lost all motivation for things I used to enjoy &amp; I stopped taking care of myself. I just don’t want to hurt my boyfriend, but I’m hurting more."
968,"Need advice, I think I have a disassociation disorder","I'd like to preface this by saying I understand things like this need to be diagnosed by a licensed professional

So I (19M) have been having a hard time piecing some things together recently. I've noticed and remembered a lot of times where I've disassociated, most of the time it's a few minutes, sometimes it's an hour or two, and on one occassion I zoned in and out of conciousness for an entire week before it stopped. When these things happened, even though I have no memory of anything that happened and to me it seemed like blinking and opening my eyes in a different place, I was functioning normally. I would have conversations, drive, take tests, everything. No one noticed anything, and I panicked. I ignored it for a long time and chalked it up to not paying attention. I brought this up with my therapist who told me it's nothing to worry about because I havent gotten hurt or done anything reckless when I'm in a disassociated state, and I'm probably so deep in thought that I go into autopilot. Which, yes I understand, but it doesnt change the fact that I'm freaking out. I cant remember anything. And ontop of that sometimes when I get into that weird headspace I suddenly switch and feel I've taken a whole new personality. I feel like a different person on the inside. What I like, how I want to act, how I want to speak. And I've learned about D.I.D, but i dont believe it's this because i dont have any alters, in these states I'm still the same person, I just.... i have no idea how to explain it. I am me, I am aware I am me, I have all my memories, but everything else changes. And I dont understand. This happens when I get overstimulated or stressed, or if I'm in a really good mood. That coupled with the dissociation just makes me so paranoid about myself. It feels like none of this actually aligns with an actual illness or explanation so I feel like I have impostor syndrome and am making everything up even though it feels so real to me."
969,Just writing stuff so I can keep myself sane,"My relation with my parents aren't good enough. They are gonna separate very soon. Now I have been   forced to make a decision to make a choice bw them. I'm with my mom rn so she's telling her own side of the story while my dad calls me and explain his. I have grown up seeing how they have always behaved so I really don't need any explanation. 
But now, what do I do. I'm not financially stable still want to live away from them. 
I don't know much and I'm really confused. But i don't want to live with any. That's for sure. Kindly help me to deal with this shit. I'm already done. Can't handle more."
970,Lonely and struggling,"I've been struggling a bit lately.. especially since corona lockdown began. What I'm about to talk about happened before the lockdown but it's heightened. I feel super lonely, even talking to friends/family and getting in daily exercise is starting to not make much of a difference. (lonely in the sense that I crave another person's love but I don't have it.. Basically I'm single af and am struggling).

I've always been someone who develops feelings for people quite easily, especially, for people I know I can't be with (i.e celebrities, musicians, etc). Lately however, I feel like I can't be happy without watching videos/seeing photos of a specific person that's on my mind.

I also have this 'fantasy world' that I use as a coping mechanism to make myself happy, where I will have conversations/make up scenarios in my head where I am friends with/dating people. I feel like it's a very unhealthy way of living but I really don't know what to do because I feel so much joy from it all. 

I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am also medicated (just for some background information). I tend to overthink a lot, which is also not helping much. I'm just a huge mess and am struggling a lot. Does anyone else feel this way or is it just me? Advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks guys :)"
971,Am I the problem?,"I don't really like to make excuses, but a brief summary leading up to why I am the way I am stems from being punished physically as a kid for doing small things kids do, being constantly compared to other outstanding students who were good at academics (even though I was always top of the class in languages and sport), being compared to billionaires as a gauge of whether i'm 'successful' or not and basically being the only person in the family that my mother relied on to vent her hatred towards my father by waking me up randomly on school nights crying and begging to die, then one day when going on a family trip she didn't show up at the airport, called me and told me 'don't tell anyone but when you guys get home I won't be there anymore' so I kept that to myself too. Not to mention shortly after the divorce she poisoned my mind to get me to hate my father which worked for years until I grew up enough to see for myself.  


These above are all reasons I feel I am the way I am. The way I am is that i'm very emotional and sensitive. Every emotion I feel, I feel it fully without holding back. When i'm happy, i'm extremely happy and excited. When i'm angry, I become the cuntiest person to be around because I can't contain it. Even if it's over small things. I don't expect anything from anyone other than to allow me to feel the way I feel and to let me do what I want to do.  


I always feel like i'm not good enough for what everyone else wants me to be. I have plenty of great friends that I call my brothers, have successfully built my own IT business, always excelled in sports throughout my life and I live to make others happy. The one thing that fucks me off is when people spring things onto me last minute and I feel 'forced' into the situation because I always say yes. The moment I say no, i'm the ultimate villain and it's as if i've never once been good EVER. I really don't know how to get across to my family especially that I just want to be left alone to make my own decisions, work a job that I want to work and do activities I want to do.  


I don't suffer from depression for sure, I just feel like maybe I need some form of anger management. I've tried talking to my mother about the things that bother me from the divorce over 15 years ago but she won't have any of it, and ends up blaming me for it instead. I always thought i'd never consider suicide or anything like that ever, but there are times where I literally feel like the only way anyone will learn to appreciate me or let me be myself without trying to control my life is if I disappeared."
972,How to stop being a bad person.,"I hate myself so much, why cant I just stop feeling jealous and angry. But everyone is so much better than me and I cant take it I dont know I always act like im better than everyone else but in reality im so much worst and Im just too scared to let anyone else know.

It makes me so angry when people are better than me, I hate it when people talk to my friends, I hate it when im left out. I try to not be angry but I cant it justs comes off as passive aggressive at best and highly irritated at worst.

I want to be better but I cant why is this so hard, my best friend constantly tries to better herself and shes so much nicer, more interesting and prettier than me, All I want to be is a better person but ill never be as good as her. I dont care if she says she is not good because everyone likes her more im just something at the side.

All my friends I introduce her too eventually become closer to her than to me and im so scared of it happening but if I dont introduce them to her maybe she would think im being selfish idk.

I know she is a good person but I really feel so much hate for her whenever she just is a better friend than me to my OWN FRIENDS idk im so fucking bitter and jealous I hate myself."
973,I can't take it anymore,"I vent alot here on reddit and I feel like a drama queen but I really can't stand anything. I'm fed up of life, my family are making me live in hell. They are so abusive and i can't move out it's not a thing in my country. But i really can't handle this sh*t I swear. I cry everyday when i wake up, because here's a long day ahead me that will destroy me again, my only happy time is when I'm asleep. I wake up with a heavy heart like something is on my chest. I tried killing myself again but it didn't work. My family know that my mental health is the worst and that I'm suicidal and they just dont care. My friends aren't there for me either. I have no one at all. I don't need solutions because there isn't i just wanted to vent. Thanks for whoever took the time to read this,  please pray for me"
974,I need help,"I think I am going through a mental crisis the last two days I have had way worse physical symptoms for depression and anxiety, I started to harm myself and tried to strangle me. I am scared to call any help like because I don’t want my parents to find out, or my school. I am lost, should I call my mental health crisis line/emergency services. Or should I wait it out."
975,When ever I'm at my mum's place my mental health is going down hill,"The past two weeks I was staying at the place of my friends, only going to my mom's place when I needed fresh clothes and such. When I'm at my friends I feel so much lighter and happier, and as soon as I spend a day at home my depression comes back.  I don't know for sure why, my mom is a lovely person and I have a decent relationship with my siblings. So it's not caused by them, I feel like I should be happy here, after all it's my family, but I just want to pack my things and go right back to my friends."
976,Loss of focus | More breakdowns | Getting panicked,"Hi guys,
I'm 22yo working, idk why i can't focus in my work anymore. I feel like leaving every thing at this moment . I'm not able to take decision anymore i get panicked even taking a small step always thinking about the negative part. I'm procrastinating too much this is really affecting my health life as well as professional life .
How to overcome this phase!"
977,I feel like I'm going crazy,"I can't stop crying, I'm hyperventilating, I'm having the worst intrusive thoughts about children and my family similar to ones people with OCD talk about but I've never been diagnosed with anything. Last night I was so scared I couldn't move, I walked into a chair in my dark hallway and instantly an image of a woman came to my mind and now she won't go away. I heard paper rustling in my room last night which I have no explanation for but I knew it was her. She watches me sleep, she looks human but she's not, she's a chair but she's sentient, she is eternal. I don't know why this is happening and I've been dissociated all day. When I look at the curtains in my room it looks like a stomach and I honestly don't know how to explain any of this because it feels so real but  I know it's not and yet I can't explain it so I sway back and forth because it's not real but it's not fake. If anyone has any advice on how to get read of intrusive thoughts or how to deal with this woman chair thing and all this dissociating that would be great."
978,I'm starting to find self harming more and more appealing,"There was an ELI5 asking ""Why do people self harm?"", and reading the comments about how the endorphins drown out negative emotions gave me the ""urge"" (not a strong urge, but more of a curious interest) to try it.

I'm too scared to use a blade, but I have a lighter and I'm thinking of slightly burning myself when those emotions come.

I totally see that this is a dangerous path I'm going down, and that every addiction starts out small. However, I just...DONT SEE a better alternative to managing the emotions. I feel like nothing else matches the effectiveness of self harm.

I don't exactly know why I posted this. Does anyone have anything to say to me? Advice? Guidance? Words of wisdom/encouragement?"
979,Is lying bad?,"I’ve been lying online about things from getting my first social media account. 

Lying makes me feel like the life i want to live really exists and the support i get from people dealing with my “problems” just feels really good. 

I don’t feel bad about hurting/using people afterwards but i also don’t necessarily want to hurt or use them, i want to stop lying but I don’t know what else could make me feel perfect other then this tbh. 

Is this alarming behavior?"
980,Reddit is anti-mentally disabled,"There are all these rules and functions that only neurotypicals understand. Upvoting and popularity are key elements of the website, something that only normals can engage in."
981,"Struggling to cope by myself, three family members sick, alone in isolation.","Normally I don't struggle being by myself but I am finding this very difficult. I am still working from home which I guess is keeping me a little distracted but I am really struggling to focus on working at the same time.

Up until last week, my grandad has been very poorly and was admitted to hospital and tested positive for coronavirus. He is so sick and I am terrified for him. My mum is also a nurse and has caught corona. She is the sickest I have ever heard her. 

On top of this, my other grandad had a stroke on Thursday, he's in a very bad way and I don't think he's going to make it. I am super close to my grandparents, probably closer than I am to my parents which is why this is hitting me so hard. The fact we can't visit makes everything a million times worse and the thought of them being in hospital by themselves, not knowing what is going on breaks my heart.

I'm on the edge of tears all the time, I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to, obviously my parents are both super worried because their parents are sick. I have my best friend but I don't want to burden her because she has her own family and I realise we are ALL going through a hard time, which is why I feel so guilty making this about me. 

I am going for a walk everyday but I need fresh air. I live in a one bed flat and I feel suffocated.

I just don't know what to do, I have told work about my situation as I'm worried my work is suffering and I don't want them to think I am being lazy when working from home, but obviously they don't really care about how I actually feel. I'm considering booking a few days holiday just to try and relax without the stress of work on top of everything else. 

I don't know, I feel mentally exhausted. 😔"
982,"Anyone have a service dog for their PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression? I am scared that I cannot go on 😢","I got hurt at work last year and had to get emergency surgery on my right shoulder where I ended up getting a rare condition called Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome.

Over the last year I have been close to taking my own life, finally I went to the hospital as my pain and mental health was uncontrollable, was in the hospital for a week then sent home due to Covid 19 and the influx of patients coming to the hospital. 

Since my surgery I have lost almost all feeling and function in my right side and I walk with a cane full time, I am still losing more function and feeling and now spreading to my left side. The doctors are looking at ALS but I need more tests done. 

I have been approved for a service dog through WCB and I hope this really helps with my mental health and mobility.

I just want my normal life back, I'm only 29"
983,Why does isolation feel so satisfying?,"I know I'm introverted but shouldn't I be a bit worried if isolating myself from literally everyone I love and genuinely like being around makes me feel accomplished and satisfied? 


It's as if I feel like I'm getting what I deserve when I watch others have fun while I deliberately sit aside - or when all my friends slowly forget me and stop talking to me."
984,"I think the lockdown is increasing the suicide rate for those with MDD, BD, and BPD.","I don't have any proof, but anecdotally I think I have seen some stuff that makes me think that people suffering from diagnoses where depression and or suicidality are a component of their disorder are attempting and completing suicide more often now due to the increased stress we're all facing now.   I wonder what you guys think and have you seen anyone legitimately comment or report on this and have some numbers to back it up?  Basically looking for news articles, print or video, that backup up this theory.   What do you think we should do about it if it's true?"

Everyday there’s something that pops into my head and I think it over a million times. No one reaches out to me. I write, I talk, I sing, I paint, I ask questions. I’m more talkative now than I ever was and it’s just not working.

I hate my life. I hate the person I look at in the mirror. This fragile, weak person. I hate myself. I can’t do anything right. My whole life is a mess.

Please help me how to stop the feeling"
989,It finally happened. My husband kicked me out.,"I’ve been emotionally detached for quite a while now. I think it’s finally done. I’m tired of everything being challenged and then having criticism attached. 

My daughter loves puzzles. While helping her with one today I said to my husband “it drives me nuts that I lost a piece to this. I try to keep everything together because growing up, my dad never let me lose the small pieces to anything and i eventually appreciates that enough to keep track of things on my own.”

This was not taken well, somehow. He responded with “you really think a 3 year old is responsible enough to keep track of toys? And I doubt your shitty father cared enough about you to organize your toys but *name* is never wrong”.

I didn’t say I expected my kid to be organized. I said I want to be organized for her so she has all her toys. And yes, my dad wasn’t the greatest dad but he was anal about everything and my toys were always organized. Idk how what I said could have possibly been twisted into an arguement. 

Long story short, he told me to leave and “do what I need to do” (insinuating I can go ahead and kill myself). He wouldn’t let me say by to the kids because pushing me out the door. I have no where to do so I’m sitting in a parking lot wondering how the fuck I would ever be able to afford an apartment. Maybe I’ll never see my kids again. I don’t have a job because I stay home with the kids so my husband can advance his career, get raises, and maintain relationships."
990,Please help I possibly have D.I.D and in an abusive family and don’t know what to do,"I am going to turn 15 in August and inly recently at around 14 I realized I as well as my family were different I don’t know for sure but not to long ago my mum and dad were fighting and my mum hit my dad he also called scizthophrenic (sorry for spelling) I don’t know if my mum is or not I’m to scared to ask.I do know my sister seems like he most normal but I can’t talk to her either as I don’t want to stop her from achieving her goals as I know I’d be a obstacle for her if I tried to talk to her. My dad has gone down because of my mums abuse he used to always be happy and now it’s all gone and gets mad really easy.
I also believe I have D.I.D or multiple personalities disorder I feel this way as I don’t understand or remember a lot of things I do for one I’m told I hit myself I do know this it’s almost like I’m a passenger in my own body I feel like I can’t be self sufficient and need someone to constantly help me with everyday tasks like brushing my teeth I don’t know why I hit myself but I only feel the pain when I wake up the next morning. The only time I truly feel safe and happy is either when my family is in a good mood or when I’m playing video games.
I don’t know why but I feel I can’t talk to anyone I don’t feel brave enough and I do love my family and don’t want to see them get arrested as sometimes they do grab me and are very emotionally and mentally abusive but sometimes get physical 
Any help in the comments would be appreciated"
991,I feel scared 24/24h,"A few days ago I got a video about slaughtering human body parts from an unknown number, it made me so afraid, I was shaking and crying. After that, everything makes me scared and I cry for no reason especially that I get phone calls from numbers I don't know and when I answer no one replies. I need help, how can I stop feeling anxious and scared the whole time. I am quarantined at home so clearly no one can hurt me but I still feel so scared."
992,I have a sex addiction,"I (18 F) was sexually abused when I was 13 by a 40 Y/O family ""friend"". A few other things have happened that aren't to do with him, but he's the main reason that I have a warped relationship with sex.
I had trauma therapy to help me come to terms with what happened, and help me stop blaming myself. My trauma therapist added everything together, and diagnosed me with a borderline sex addiction.
It is not how it is portrayed in the movies. I don't fuck a new person everyday. I have a partner (21 M) that usually helps me out when I'm struggling.

When I'm struggling, I get this hot, tingling feeling in my pubic area and lower abdomen. It's really intense. It feels like when you're about to cum, and you get that hot pressure building up inside of you that makes you just yearn for the release. This is almost constant for me, and I call it my ""itch that I need to scratch"". Nothing gets rid of it other than sex. 

So, this is my problem. I've been in quarantine for 7 weeks now, and this pressure is getting worse and worse. Obviously, I can't go to my partner to help me out, so I've been trying every way possible that could at least calm me down a little bit, and whatever I do just ends with me crying in frustration. 
I live in a rehabilitation facility, and I'm the only female here. Everybody else is in their 30s-40s and male. I love my partner with all of my heart, and I'd never cheat on him just to get my fix, but being surrounded by men that are all around the same age as the man that abused me is making everything 10× more difficult. 

I'm going insane. I don't know what to do. I just want this feeling to go away. I don't want to break, and do something that I shouldn't do."
993,I jump between feeling great and feeling worthless all the time,"So, I'm a 20 year old female and I have Asperger's syndrome and hypothyroidism. I have days (or maybe more like hours) when I feel like I can do anything, I'm great and I own it. And then, even if nothing happens, I can suddenly feel like I'm worthless and I'll never achieve anything in my life. I also have a strange need to have a child, but I know I'm too young - and most importantly, my boyfriend doesn't want to have a kid yet. Are those mood swings normal?"
994,I just saw this Adam Sandler movie called Punch Drunk Love and I never related to a character so much before.,"I just watched Punch Drunk Love and it was a wonderful and emotional movie. I think it has a positive message about that everyone is capable of finding love. The film doesn't explicitly state it but if you tend to know certain quirks that he has you can tell he is in the Autistic spectrum or has Asperger's syndrome. Barry is the main character and his struggle is that he knows there is something wrong with him in terms that he doesn't feel right about himself. His family is judgemental about his social awkwardness and I also loved the fact that Adam Sandler's performance captures the mannerisms that certain people who are in the Autistic spectrum including me have. Like for example I tend to swing my head back and forth and fidget my fingers whenever I talk to someone. I'm really glad that I saw this film and I want to recommend to anyone that feels as if they might never find love or they are judged by the people who they love about their mental disabilities. I know it's just a movie but i felt hope watching this that I may truly find love in life. Which again, is why I am recommending this movie to people who feel hopelessly lonely or tend to feel socially awkward. Stay safe and stay hopeful y'all."
995,Is suicide selfish during the coronavirus outbreak?,"I feel like I can't be bothered to go through with this anymore but then I feel racked with guilt and shame when I think of the implications of going through with a suicide attempt. The fact that the doctors will have to spend time trying to help me after I've overdosed when they could be treating someone with the virus. I feel like we're all just expected to push through this pandemic but I don't think that's realistic for anyone , particularly those of us with pre existing mental health conditions . No one recognizes how difficult it is to be honest"
996,"Dampened emotions, negativity and pure elation","I've been doing a lot of work on my mental health throughout the past 6 months, and I've uncovered so much- but that definitely leaves more questions.

The most annoying recently is my mood, I've noticed that throughout every day life i feel somewhat blank.  This is somewhat long sorry.

Emotions blend together, sometimes indistiguishable, but I can feel them on a small scale- it's just hard to recognise. I feel happiness, sadness, anxiousness, but sometimes its so dulled down I have no name to distinguish it. I know its there in the group, I just can't... pick it?

But when emotions are strong, I can't control it- and a lot of the time there is not starting point. -Anger takes over me to the point I can't function at times, and it'll build and build until I can't handle it and curl up to stop myself from hurting me or others.
-Pure elation and extacy comes in, I can't control it. Like anger, it starts for no reason and either spirals out of control, or when I catch it, I can force it back enough- but also like anger, these instances start for absolutely no reason.
-Lately, as of c*rona, I've been having depressive stages that also come for no reason- sure I do have depression, I've been diagnosed, but it's pretty high functioning and over the past several years I've hardly ever felt repulsed by the things I love. Now, a wave of pure sadness starts to come over for absolutely no reason, I can't do anything, sometimes getting out of bed is impossible.

The latter, yes may just be from the v*rus, but as I said, throughout years of myself having depression, I've never had it to where I can't physically do the things i love- let alone getting out of bed. Its.. different, and with the other emotional factors going on it concerns me.

Does anyone have any idea if I should ask my psychologist to look in to something, or if any of the above could relate to a different mental health issue? If the last point doesn't fit, that can be taken out- i wouldnt be surprised if it is from self isolating, but it's a factor I didnt want to miss just in case."
997,Why does this happen when I’m angry?,[removed]
998,Today I woke up to an angry girlfriend. I apparently woke up during the night and shouted at her.,"Is this normal? I mean, obviously, it's not ""normal"" normal, but should I be worried that there's some underlying condition?

How do I explain that I literally can't recall anything? She just says that it's ""very convenient"" that I don't remember anything."
999,My friend told my dad that I cut...,"I was trying to vent to a close friend of mine, I was saying about how I feel that “life is futile” and “sometimes I wish I was dead”. I also told him about how I have been cutting my arm. He misinterpreted this and thought that I was going to kill myself so he called my dad as well as sent him screenshots from our conversation. Now my dad expects me to give him answers, but I find it difficult talking to family about these issues. Any advice as to what I should do?"
1000,My Work = My Worth and I Hate It,"I’ve noticed a pattern over the last few years and I’m just wondering if anyone else has overcame this or not. I’ve been told I’m an extremely hard worker my entire life- great work ethic yada yada. I care so much about whatever job I’m working as if my life depends on it. From coffee shops to sales jobs to marketing jobs, my work literally equates to my worth as a human being and it’s beginning to tear me apart. If I have a less than positive eval or anyone expressed displeasure in my work I truly spiral into massive panic attacks and depression. I feel worthless, as if I am not who I thought I was, as if I can’t go on, I must run away/am not good enough, etc. 

I visit a therapist bi-weekly and have been off my medication now for over a year (big accomplishment!) 

Trying to face this for what it really is - am I just placing my worth in the wrong place? I care about this part of my character, but when is enough? When and how do I push through this? So often I tell myself, It’s just a job, but even as the words leave my mouth my heart and brain can never catch up. I am young (26), so all of these jobs will likely never by my “forever” career. 

I’m a creative, and hope one day to be able to live solely off my own creations in video/photography.. but until then- how do I do this? how do I cope?

Any and all advice would be really appreciated. I’m ready to truly work through this and not let my jobs control my emotions."
1001,"New here, looking for a subreddit that can tell me if punching my forehead out of anger is the reason for my bad short term memory",Also how are you guys dealing with frustration?
1002,How do I deal with these freak outs or whatever they are?,I’ve been having like freak outs I guess lately thinking that people are after me and seeing things that probably aren’t there and sometimes hearing things and I can’t take it. I don’t know how to properly deal with it and I don’t know if it’s schizophrenia or something and I doubt my therapist could tell me if it is or not so how do I deal with this in the meantime?

1004,"I'm a mess, help","20y old (m), suicidal, hello there, I don't really know how to put it, I'm probably going to sound crazy / dumb but IL take a shot, I feel like I'm 2 different people all the time, I know we normally have a inner voice that we talk to and what ever but mine is aggressive, it makes me wanna hurt people around me and it makes me think about suicide, when I get these taughts in my head I clench my teeth tightly and rub my head dismissing the taught, but 1 year ago from now (or maybe 2) I stopped self harm and about 1 month ago I was in bed and got up and went to the bathroom to cut myself and I had no emotional at all, it didn't feel like me, after 2 deep cuts I stopped and looked at them and it took me some time to realize what I did, I felt sick and scared.
I feel like I don't wanna live anymore, I have been hurt emotionally soo much by people I trusted, I have cried nights on end and I can't control my feelings anymore, I just don't know, I don't even make sense here, you are probably thinking I'm just confused or overwhelmed or something, I just don't know anymore, it Is too much to write, I'm sorry for wasting your time person reading, hope you have a nice day"
1005,Too sacred to talk to any adults about possibly being depressed.,"I'm not completely sure, but I think I might be depressed. My friend said that the only way to find out is by talking to (for example) our school councelor. But I'm just too afraid to talk about it with an adult. What should I do?"
1006,Sometimes I wish I had someone to reach out to,"I wish I had a friend I could reach out to. My mental health has been deteriorating for a long time and I just want support from someone who cares. I dont have any friends  and it's  just weird venting to your family about how you're borderline suicidal. I don't even want to talk about how shit my mental health is, I just want someone to be there. 

It sucks when people give advice about depression and their main bit of advice is ""talk to a trusted  friend."" Well, not everyone has one......"
1007,How do you get over the sadness in this world? How do you cope with the idea that there are so many bad things happening right now?,"I think about it a lot. Everytime I see anything sad or disappointing I get angry and furious and sad and I wonder why is it like this. I cannot think of all the people that are abused and all the people who've been through war and the fact that there are still wars and viruses and illnesses. I get very sad everytime I hear bad news and I start crying.
I have been crying for the past hour and I don't really know how to get better, how to not be affected this much because of the negative things going on. I don't want to ignore them, but I feel like I can't be happy because of how much I think of what is bad around. Do you have any experience with this? Do you also have this feeling?"
1008,Tired of hearing exercise braggarts brag during quarantine,"I can take most of their bragging sometimes, but their constant need to rub how productive they are really gets to me. I know it shouldn't. I have a lot of things that I need to do in a day and that includes trying to work, read a book, or even do some art. I feel like I need to exercise too, but I just can't push myself to enough. Then I see these people, who are mostly one dimensional - saying this because I know them personally. All they do is seek attention. Flaunt their bodies and workout routine. Brag about how they are crushing it and how all their pain is paying off. Once they get their share of complements, they completely ignore everyone else and don't bother listening to how someone else's day was or something interesting that someone else did that day. Their ""me me me"" attitude is toxic. I'm not sure how to stay away from them. Especially if you're stuck in close friends circle social media groups or WhatsApp groups. It's taking a huge toll on my mental health. Sigh."
1009,Mental Health discord servers for adults?,"Almost all of the ones I've managed to find are populated vastly by teenagers. I applaud the inclusivity of those servers and encourage anyone whose tastes match such places, but I'd feel much more comfortable sharing my mental health problems with adults. 

My depression, which had for a while now remained mild and dormant, is starting to grow more severe. Without going into detail, I'm am not at all well and need a place where I can share and talk to people about my problems (preferably adults) 

Are there any mental health discords for adults that you know of? 

Any response will be appreciated"
1010,Am I screwed indefinitely (9 reasons inside; 31M)?,"All my life I was a popular, successful, intellectual, beloved, active in society, I had friends, worked and developed and progressed in life and although I came from a poor family, then came the last two years and the following troubles:


1. I have been unemployed for two and a half years after completing my bachelor's degree with honors
2. I live with my father who is a realy ill and needs daily help.
3. I am treated with testosterone injections once every three months (about a year already) after a benign brain tumor was discovered - this fact hurting my sense of masculinity
4. I am diagnosed with depression and social anxiety (and afraid that being there in my medical record will hurt me in the future and another mistake I made is that I told a psychiatrist and he wrote in the medical record that I smoked cannabis in the past)
4. I suffer from eye floaters and deteriorating vision (doctors do not diagnose the problem)
5. I am lonely, anxious and isolated
6. I am single and afraid that I will never have a wife who will love me with all the troubles I have
7. After surgery for gynecomastia (male breasts) that left scars and scars on me, the surgical clinic closed but I have no money to fix the defects.
8. I developed technology anxiety; In the past I was very active on the social network and today every post I upload I delete, every email and phone call.
9. I changed my last name 3 times during 31 years of my life (I was born with my biological father's last name, at 20 I changed to a surname I loved then and at 29 I changed to my stepfather's family who raised me - this is my father that I take care of). All my diplomas carries a different name (even my BA degree) and it makes me anxious.

How to live with all this? Can a person like me succeed in this? I feel like the universe is laughing at me."
1011,How I became an Asshole (and hate it),"Hello guys ...

&amp;#x200B;

Since I can remember I was bullied in school; the worst happened between grade 1-8; changed school once, everything got worse and I ended up refusing to go to school with suicidal thoughts almost daily (weekly these days); changed school again with less bullying yet almost no friends.  Have one buddy from school days with whom I talk once every 1-2 years but that's it. Less than a handful of friends to this day total; countless false friends along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Couldn't stand it in Germany after suffering constantly from their ways of screwing me over with their money-inspired rules and regulations (had a crash in a car on my first day after receiving my license (finished with the best possible grade...what a joke) and had to pay 2000 Euros for scratching a tiny tree that's still standing today; completely healed up like nothing happened. Another of countless times I struggled in Germany, the Deutsche Railway Company DB made me pay 60 Euros on two occasions cause they changed their ticketing system while I was abroad (every German district has more or less their own system, it's super confusing and I believe that's how they want it to be; to charge people over and over again). 

&amp;#x200B;

Moved to the UK for four years and left with a massive debt and a degree that didn't get me any proper job yet; also had to sue my landlord to get my deposit back (won - took one year) and ACER, after they sold me a crappy Laptop that kept failing (took 1.5 years to sue them but I also won) ... In retrospective it simply feels like a massive waste of time and lots of bad luck. I also dealt with a few pretty intense and in later days extremely hurting relationships that took me years to get my mind off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially ran off to China; as far away as possible, working as a teacher ... Took me more than 6 months to get the visa, endless trouble and lots of money... Only to get a 6-months work visa that barely made my money back. Plus air pollution there was horrible ...really needed to move on. Ah ...and also trying to sue the airline that got me to China as they did some cheeky last minute charges that were illegal due to EU law (since the flight went from UK to China they need to obey these laws but no one cares; you just can't sue Chinese companies and hence I didn't win, didn't even get a case). Also China cheated me out of my last wage as I was unable to get my money after being paid after having left the country; to this day my money is stuck in China and I'll never see that again for sure - I tried for 1.5 years already and I am tired. A friend once told me that when it comes to big companies messing with you just better give up right away; you waste your time money and sanity and I ultimately did the latter... Sometimes I won but it always felt like something inside of me died.

Vietnam: Had my Camera and brand new phone (my first actual decent phone + 1 month old) stolen after living in the south for a year, one month before I wanted to leave... Leaving with a very bitter taste. 

&amp;#x200B;

Desperatly thought that I finally need a place of peace of mind and since Germany, England and China sucked (and Vietnam was lots of other trouble too) I just wanted to keep moving: bicycle trip from Vietnam to Germany. 

&amp;#x200B;

Several minor but extremely annoying and frequent repairs on the bike later, several times of dealing with bank troubles as my Visa card would not work due to unknown technical difficulties and if it did I had immense, previously undiscussed, charges; nothing but trouble. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently going place to place, always thinking that I just need to get the f out of there; either weird people or constant trouble with the bank, bike and other stuff ...literally today a monkey ate my saddle (no joke + the saddle was expensive and brand new). 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me started about Corona ....broke out 2 weeks after I quit my job and moved out of Vietnam ...I was already in the road and all I had was on the bike. I know it's a stupid coincidence but I was really trying to try something new before going completely insane and now the entire world has turned insane, nationalist and hostile. 'Stay at home'; funny ... My home is my bike; Germany has never been my home, J don't feel home anywhere, I can't stay in one place for longer than a few days before going crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I approached this journey with decent saving, much of that money has already been eaten by ... Repairs, theft, and other garbage. I am certainly not having much fun, not that I ever did. And here is the point: EVERY time when I tried to relax lately and many times in the past, starting with Vietnam, bad stuff happens... I was tenting with a friend when my camera was stolen ... After months of struggling with a bad job, just needed a break. 

Today is another example. I struggled for weeks with fixing my bike and just generally being tense and charged and now that it's finally running again and I had ONE day to relax a monkey chews off my seat and handlebar. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could bring up loads of other examples, a lot of them I luckely already mentally pushed far far away yet I come more and more to the conclusion that every time I am having a good day or trying to be nice to people, bad stuff happens ... I simply can't keep my guard down anymore and started to seriously get pissed at everyone around me and assume the worst constantly - and surprisingly when I do, people finally leave me alone; they back off ... I don't want them to be close anyways, yet when I am relaxed crap is happening again. Did I mention that the room-service from my current (crap) hotel 'accidentially' stole some stuff from my room a few days ago. It got recovered in the end but it's just another thing. I am just so sick of everything. I even tried Vipasana meditation last year just to not be so angry and disappointed anymore yet I keep finding myself constantly being on edge which makes me pissed at people around me. I just don't have any trust anymore. Speaking of disappointment - J don't even expect anything of people, I just want them to not screw with me all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 years old, travelled 1/4 of the globe and yet find nothing but garbage and people I can not trust. I know I am not treating people right but I treat as I am treated and I feel beaten to the ground almost daily. Trying to be nice is getting harder by the day.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing is that it's never anything mayor like a broken bone or a shitty illness, it's these little things that happen constantly; sueing people; money issues all the time and people messing with me constantly ... Those things grind me every day. 

Sometimes I wish I could live in a cave far away from everyone but I already know that there will always be someone who already 'ownes' the places that will surely kick me around again.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting to sympathise with all these assholes and criminals out there: this world is sick and it made me sick, so sick. Sometimes I wonder if I am doing this trip only so that I can say one day 'I have seen it all, yet there is nothing out there' and justify jumping of a bridge finally, but I haven't convinced myself yet that there truly isn't anything... At least to this point I haven't found a lot that makes me want to keep going in any way, just so drained and full of anger lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just can't stand this anymore ... I want things to be better for once, I would love to have some proper friends or anyone I can rely in, yet I keep coming back to what I figured as a child, something that held true to this day: Everytime you rely on someone, rely in being disappointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the depressing read. Not even sure why I'm posting about this stuff. 'Everyone has their issues' .... Why would mine matter. They never did anyways."
1012,Inability to speak in certain situations,"Does anyone else experience this? It’s as if my throat locks up and I can’t say the words I’m trying to say. I can’t even open my mouth sometimes. If I manage to force myself to speak I can only mutter a weak yes/no or grunting noises. 

Is there a name for this phenomenon? I want to know what it is because it’s really frustrating and it mostly happens when I talk to other people about something really sensitive or personal. Like, say my parents approach me to talk about what I fucked up in school or why I’ve been so sad for the past couple days - my voice just vanishes. There have been times where I’ve (unintentionally) made my parents wait for _hours_  because I couldn’t get anything to come out my mouth. Or sometimes I’m presenting something in front of class and I start stiffening up and stuttering like crazy. Sometimes while we’re having a beer a friend starts asking personal questions and I just go blank and I have to look away.

It sucks. I hate it. I can’t say simple things like “I’m sorry” or “You hurt me” face to face. It’s almost impossible to open up and speak to other people. It’s really hurting the important relationships I have because my voice locks up and I act like a wall and no one can read me or understand."
1013,I have to control and at least triple check everything. Don't know what to do about it.,"This problem goes on for quite a while now and increased over the past few months.
It startet with checking if I turned off the oven and the coffee machine, before I left the house. Seemed quite normal to me. But over time, checking once wasn't enough. I have to check multiple times until I am sure everything is turned off, no lights are on, all the windows are closed, the door is really locked. That costs a lot of time. And sometimes, when I left the house, I have to go back to check again, because I am not sure anymore. I really have to go back, because if I don't, my mind just starts spinning around all the possible bad scenarios that could happen if I didn't turn out the oven/the lights.
When I drive with the car, I sometimes have to turn around to make sure, I didn't run somebody over.
Needless to say, that every time I check, everything is turned off and I have never hit anybody with my car. I know that most of my thoughts are completely unrealistic and exaggerated, but I can't help it.
I tried to call some therapists, but I wasn't lucky yet. And I am quite sure that all of them will have a long waiting list.

1017,How to stop hoping for things that probably won't happen,"With this virus going on, and the talks of stimulus checks in the US, I was excited, hoping that I could get some money. My parents said I could have any of the money that comes in for me. (Like how kids get 500 or the new bill going through Congress that says people 16 and up get 2000 a month) I've gotten my hopes up because my family is poor and I thought maybe this could help me buy the film equipment I want so that I can try to build a career off of film before I leave high school. With my mental health the way it is, I don't think I could handle the stress of working part time my senior year. But the information coming out tells me that it's unlikely that we get ANY money until late this year, if at all. Part of me still hopes that this isn't true. How do I kill this hope since it's unlikely that these wishes will come true?"

After some deep reflection i noticed that i'm not looking forward to do anything in life. Like nothing. I just live. I don't feel bad but everything is mundane at this point. As a kid i was pumped to get out of school to pop in my newest game and play but nowadays i heavily neglet doing my household chores and i just vegetate through the days of worklife. I play games and talk to friends but more out of habit. Most of the stuff i could be interested in like hobbies or games feel like work, a hustle which needs a big time investment with very low outcome. Everything needs to have an endproduct to be usefull at this point. I haven't done something in forever just because i want to do it. X cost y amount of time and then i need to go to work and had no ""free time"" even tho said free time was filled with the hobby in theory.

&amp;#x200B;

1021,How to bring up mental issues delicately with a psychiatrist?,"Hey everyone, first time post here and throwaway account for reasons which may be obvious soon.

Long story short, after being diagnosed with severe depression, psychosis, and ADD, I started a regiment of medicine which is working for me (60mg of Vyvanse and 300mg of wellbutrin daily, taken in the morning). 

However, there have always been other issues that I have dealt with for my entire life. I am scared to bring them up though because of how my psychiatrist may react. I would like to maybe give him small doses and work into the more extreme, but if I'm being completely honest I'm scared that they might consider me a danger to myself and/or others and want to commit me. 

The other half of this is I have no idea what psychiatrists deal with on a daily basis. Maybe my issues are tame compared to other people they interact with? I'm not sure.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation? I'd like to focus on bringing the issues up and not the issues themselves, but if it is entirely necessary I can explain below."
1022,I feel like there is someone in my head.,"This has happened to me maybe 3 times. I feel like there is someone in my head. I don't hear any voices but I can feel it. Sometimes I just stare blankly at the wall (or the ceiling or else) and I feel like someone is ""possessing"" me. I lose my strength but my hand keep moving. I grab a paper and start writing but I am not the one in control (also, my hand writes in a strange handwritting that isn't mine)... I feel like someone is controlling me from the inside. Then I get a strong pain in my head, as if my head was a room and someone was punching or pushing the walls. Also, I blink uncontrollably and my eyes roll to the back of my head. In those moments, I want to scream but I can't control my body and my mouth is sealed.

It probably sound stupid...  Has anyone ever experienced something similar? I am lost.

\[Sorry for any mistakes. English is not my first language.\]"
1023,"What happened to me recently, did I snap?","I've been struggling with depression my entire adult life. Lately my boss has been miserable, and has been taking it out on me in passive aggressive ways, tearing me down for the slightest mistakes, purposefully saying things ""under breath"" loud enough for me to hear, then pretending it wasn't bait. This has been grinding away at me and making me bitter. I get depressive episodes more often than ever lately, and I've been having half-assed suicidal thoughts (note: No, I'm not going to commit suicide).

Recently, during one of these episodes, I had a common nihilistic thought that NORMALLY makes me even sadder.

""None of this bullshit matters anyway, in 100 years literally no-one will remember either my boss or me, and no one will ever look back at what a painfully average person I am, and even those who do after my death won't matter because I won't exist to experience their judgement.""

But this time, instead of sadness, this unnatural feeling of joy and catharsis filled me, coupled with a temporary lack of care for literally anyone else around me. It's like I became a pure nihilistic sociopath for a short time, and what scares me is that it felt like the 'rightest' thing I'd felt in a long time. I knew it was wrong fundamentally, but my body kept sending chemicals into my brain telling me it was right. When I said ""this is wrong"" I was struggling not to smile and it was just empty words. Suddenly all of the employees and my boss were just annoying noises and colors, which is very fucked up because I've known my boss for many years and am extremely close with them. I continued my job like normal, wondering if this would pass, and not wanting to make a mistake that would cost me once my inhibitions came back.

The feeling passed, but it was like I was high or something, I've never felt that way before, and in retrospect it scares me. What happened to induce this weird nihilistic catharsis?"

1025,"i don’t know what the hell is going on with me. please, help","i need advice with a problem that is going on for a long time; i don’t really know when exactly it has begun, i think a year ago more or less, and it’s about a lot of bad thoughts that are against me. 
they started as little thoughts when i was in middle school (11-14 years old) and they exploded two years ago with the sudden death of my father when i was 18 years old. 
those thoughts are recurrent and they pop up every time i make a mistake, regardless of whether it is big or small; i start to panic and those thoughts start blame myself in a hard way, saying that i don’t deserve anything because of what i’ve done and making me feel guilty, followed by other thoughts like “you are useless”, “you are stupid”, “you can’t do anything”... 
these situations last from 30 minutes to a maximum of several hours like for 5/6 hours (in particular cases also half a day) and the only way i‘ve found to get rid of them as fast as possible is to cry for 20 minutes more or less, until the panic isn’t gone. most of the times i also have to continue to cry a little bit later in the day because of the remaining sadness.

these situations happen also if there’s no reason to feel guilty but they are more powerful if i do something “wrong” (‘cause my thoughts try to make me believe i did something wrong and it IS my fault but i don’t believe any of this) against my friends, my boyfriend or a family member (sometimes also with strangers, but it’s more rare) and they happen at least once or twice a week. 
this is why i try to make everything perfect but if i can’t do it, thoughts come and it’s the same story as usual. 
i have to say that i don’t EVER believe what my thoughts say and i always feel bad they pop up in my mind (and this is why i also cry) ‘cause i don’t want them and the random-guilt is too much for me. 

so i’ve tried to improve myself with this problem, i try to control those thoughts and to not cry when they appear. but every time, the same thoughts always try to stop me from doing it and it can finish in two ways: i can control them and belittle them, or they control me and they take me down. obviously, in the second ending i cry every time and i continue until thoughts aren’t gone. 
i also hurt me physically BUT lightly and it doesn’t happen a lot, like i bite my hand/fingers or i scratch my skin while i’m crying. 

this situation has worried me when i found that i often don’t notice when i have those toxic thoughts against me and i go along with them, like if i’m used to them. 
it worried me also when the other day during a crisis the thought “are you sure you want to continue with this life?” appeared in my mind for the first time in my life. i think that it’s the worst thought i’ve ever had and i hope that it never reappears in my mind. 

i’m not looking for a diagnosis, but for some clarity to understand what the hell is going on with me and how i can improve more myself to... you know, live happily or at least survive. 

thanks for reading this far. 

P.S. i can’t go to therapy atm and for the next months but i will in the future."

TW: discussions of assault, depression, disordered eating, guilt and grief

Hi.

This is my first post, and I’m not sure what I’m even asking. I guess I just want to put it out there and see if anyone can relate or offer advice. 

Quarantine has allowed me time to experience my emotions and process traumas that I’ve yet to overcome. My partner is overwhelmingly supportive-encourages me to speak to my therapist, listens without judgement, respects my need for physical space when triggered- but I’m not sure what the next step is. 

In college, I was assaulted by my best friends boyfriend. I’m not going to describe the night. I don’t blame myself for his actions, but there’s a part of me that feels unclean. Following that event, I coped by finding every possible distraction. I fell into heavy drinking, I withdrew into myself and became a puppet that blended in with my peers, I resented my family and my southern/Christian upbringing that fueled my self-loathing (that’s a whole different post). My only grandparent died in front of me and I stopped existing in this world. I stopped eating and found relief only when alcohol flooded my veins. This went on for 3 years. 

Eventually, I found myself again. I went to rehab, I surrounded myself with friends who loved me fiercely and without stipulations, I moved and found a partner who loved me for ME.  

But now, as I’m here in quarantine the whispers of my past have been creeping up my spine. The tendrils of pain wrap around my throat and it is unbearable. 

How can I move forward? I don’t need to forget, I just need to scrub off the guilt and learn to breathe again. 

Thanks for reading."

1031,Is this really reason enough to go to the psychologist?,"I (17) often tell myself to die out loud. I otherwise feel pretty good. After years of bullying in primary school, I finally feel included and have lots of friends that care about me. My life seems happy, and I don't have any reason to do this. I don't think this is related. I just think it's a weird quirk I developed for some strange reason, but my girlfriend keeps insisting I should tell my mother and go to the psychologist. She wanted to tell my mother about it, but I asked her to give me a chance to stop doing it. She gave me three days to try not saying it for a whole day. This is my second day. I failed yesterday after my brother smashed a plate to the floor and today in the shower. I felt good today, so I don't know why I said it.

I don't think it's related (everyone has problems, mine are not that big) but I'll include a little bit of background anyways. My mother divorced my father two years ago, after eighteen years of abuse and violence. He was pretty violent, but since my mother reported him eight years ago, he calmed down a little bit, but he continued being pretty aggressive. After the report, while we were at school, and my mother at her job, he would clean the house. It was very gross. He used the same dishwashing sponge to clean everything, from the floor to the dishes. And when my mother would throw it away, he'd just take it from the trash and continue to use it. We had to hide a clean sponge and clean everything again. When my mother arrived from work, he would usually go downstairs and spend the rest of the day in his room listening to the radio. My brother could be having another anger attack, breaking stuff and hurt my mother and he would just stay in his room.

Any conversation we had with him felt distant and disconnected. He doesn't really know us. After he left, after some time, he started to message me on WhatsApp. Usually once a month, and every time I forced myself to answer because I felt guilty. But for some reason, every time he answered, I got very anxious, and sometimes I didn't even open his messages.  I don't know why usually his messages were ok.

My brother started to have anger attacks about four years ago. He gets angry for very insignificant things and starts throwing dishes, food to the floor. Once he threw the TV on the floor or our Christmas dinner. Every time he does it I start repeating myself I wanna kill myself. He also constantly tells everyone about their weird physical traits and reminds them constantly. Every time he sees my feet he says they're so ugly and weird, my nose, he constantly says it's so weird because it has hair. Things like that, all the time. I feel so insecure around him.

I don't know what's the point of this post. I got a little bit carried away writing some things. I guess what I want to know is if my girlfriend is right. Is telling myself to die, out loud (sometimes I even do it in front of people without even realizing it, lucky I say it in my mother tongue and they don't understand it) enough reason to go to the psychologist?"
1032,It's so hard to not compare,"I have undiagnosed mild depression, my lover has schizophrenia and anxiety. Perhaps because my problems are rarely acknowledged by others, and my depression has always been in the level of ""you may or may not have it, the label doesn't matter"", it just makes me keep comparing my problem with others. It becomes even more problematic then depression itself. When it is my bad day, I feel bad when my lover talks about his past and struggles, because it makes me feel unimportant. But it is worse when it is his bad day, because I simply can't accept that his problems beat mine, I have somehow overlooked them and didn't realized, I can't do anything to help him, and it simply makes me feel bad that the one who's suffering is him, not me.

It makes me feel bad whenever he is weak, whenever we talk about medicine, or shorter lifespan for patients like him, or whenever he stays awake or falls asleep, even his breaths and sighs makes me feel bad. I must have been a bad lover.

I have this urge to take away the suffering from him, and from other people, but it is impossible. It soothes me a bit when he tells me his battle with his illness shaped him into a better person, but it doesn't stop me from thinking that it would be better if he didn't have to know this suffer at all. Ironically it seems the closest to a conclusion I have is that, no matter how I compare, I will never ""win"", I may as well give up.

I know I shouldn't compare, mental illnesses are not to be compared, but it's so hard. I need to suffer more than others in order to have attention and care ""allocated"" to me, I need to suffer more than others in order to see others as happier than I am, so that I won't feel guilty. And I know, this kind of thought doesn't help with my mental health either. I have little will to heal and get better. However my life has been overall so lucky, and I want to mess it up, I want to hurt myself AND YET... I can't do it in a way without hurting my lover, or without giving him less attention.

I am just stuck in the middle of nowhere. I wish I had a superpower that allows me to suffer and at the same time make others happy."
1033,"Wondering if ""therapy centers"" like in my book exist","Hi all.
Since about a year now, I have been dealing with psychological issues. I had an internship which was beyond dreadful. Since then, I  suffer from brain fog, concentration problems, sleeping problems and I feel generally ""lost"" in life. 
I thought I had it all planned out, but turns out the path I had paved for myself does not satisfy me at all. Instead, I have become restless and panicking about what other path to take. I have many interests but don't feel I excel in one to make a living out of it.
I have been on and off therapy since 2013. However, lately I feel like I need a break *from life.* 
I recently started reading Norwegian Wood. In this book, one of the main characters is also in psychological therapy, but it's very laid back. She has time to paint/read/to community work, while all the while working on her mental issues.
I do know how the book ends, but nevertheless, I was wondering if this kind of therapy actually also exists (in Europie) and what it is called.
I can't go on with my life anymore. I feels like I am juggling with 8 porcelain plates at onces."
1034,"Between lockdown and post PEP appointment after sexual assault, I'm scared to decompensate","I'm pretty much stable. I went through *a lot*. But I'm still on my feet. Meanwhile, I have a checkup tomorrow and STD/STI bloodworkds and I'm just so panicked. 

I know how it gonna go, they'll ask me if I handled the treatment (to reduce risk of contamination by HIV) well, any side effects, and drow some blood. Then tell me to come back in a few days. 

I know it should be okay, but I'm just so stressed and took a lot of pregabaline to try to handle it. I took 500mg (Max is 600mg so it's kinda a lot), and I'm just lying on my bed playing video game not to think. 

I handle my mental health great, but it's a lot right now. At least with lockdown I'm not scared to go outside and run into my psychotic ex with murderous tendencies. That's something.

It will be fine. It's just hard now."

The youngest just sits around sad all day. Does not want to watch anything, eat, play or talk. If I ask her whats wrong she just shrugs her shoulders.

I have two questions:
1) How can I make her happier?
2) In the case that their dad passes away (which doctors said is very likely in the next few weeks) how do I communicate with them? Is there anything I can do or say at that time that will help them grieve? Or is there anything I can say now to prepars them? I ask because their mom is torn between running their business, looking after her husband, and coming home to her girls. So shes very overwhelmed mentally.

Thank you in advance"

1037,"Advice needed: ""being present""","Hi folks, first time posting here and hopefully not the last.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: I'm struggling with being ""present"" and don't even really understand the meaning of it. Wondering how to be better at it. More info below:**

&amp;#x200B;

I just got out of a treatment program where I was diagnosed with a list of things, all stemming from childhood trauma -- the primary diagnoses I got were PTSD/BPD and a slew of others.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I've been working with therapists during this isolation and she has been trying to get me to squish some of my core beliefs about myself, and that has been really hard to do so instead, during my last appointment with her 2 weeks ago, she suggested that my primary focus right now should be ""being present""

&amp;#x200B;

She suggested that I try to focus on my body, how things feel, like my breath, my feet during a walk, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my problem: I have no clue how to be present. I don't even think I fully understand what being present means other than living in the moment? For example, if I'm watching a TV show and focused on it, is that being present? Or does external stimulus have to be gone and it's just me living in the moment?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have found it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to be ""present"" for more than 2-3 seconds. For example, today I was on a walk and I kept trying to focus on my feet hitting the ground and other parts of my body, but my mind would just drift off into some thoughts about the past or some about the future, and during a 40-minute walk I can at best say 2-3 minutes of it were devoted to me living in the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I've been doing this for a couple of months now and I don't feel like I'm making any progress in being present, how long does it take to become better at this, how much do I need to practice to become better, and more important: what is the BEST thing to do to become more present?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you."
1038,Slowly picking myself up.,"I opened my laptop today to write. I only managed to add a little notion to the first draft of my novel to edit later. Not what I planned, but least I made the leap and set out with the intent to do something. Counts as something, right? 


I haven't turned to food for comfort in two days. I made a proper, healthy meal yesterday *and* today. I also didn't starve myself even though I felt bad about my body. I exercised and didn't overwork myself because my back was aching.


I haven't been reading a lot lately but now I've started listening to audiobooks again. For weeks I've been trying to psych myself up to start a proper art project but ended up simply doodling today. That's ok, I guess. At least it was something.


I'm trying to learn to be a bit more lenient towards myself. As someone who's always been perfectionistic and valued productivity, it's really hard to deal with lethargy and lack of motivation. But I'm starting slow. I don't have to be perfect overnight. 


The biggest accomplishment right now is that by and by I'm starting to ease into life again, getting at least something done and trying to find the joy in everyday activities. Just wanted to write down all this to try to assure myself that it's okay to take things slow."
1039,I used to be addicted to meth and after the damage was done suffered a huge dent in my personality. I feel like my life was pure trash for several years until maybe recently. I do not want to remember or be defined by my past as a meth head. Isn't that normal?,"Wouldn't it be more damaging to my mind to relive traumatizing moments or have my self esteem always on an extreme low because I'm constantly reviewing memories when I was a lot trashier and my IQ was probably a lot lower?

A minority of people seem to think I must be some kind of evil piece of shit trying to cover my old evil shitty ways up! &amp; I'm a coward who can't own up to have intentionally evil I am. I've talked about almost every moment of my life with all types of people countless times while they've like interrogated me more or less and it's been a painful experience. I'm kind of about to run into some money or celebrity status at some point, if COVID 19 dies down at least so I feel like some of my previous acquaintances, who are meth people who probably are on a constant withdrawal stage like meth heads are - probably are FUCKING INSANELY PISSED!!! that I'm not still a loser meth head and they have to comprehend my existence as a success without becoming jealous or enraged.

In Oklahoma there are more prisoners per capita than any other state - or country (if OK was a country) in the entire world. So think about all those people who grew up in prison more or less and me moving to Cali to become a pornstar / EDM artist / movie director. The fact that I got it is BURNING THEM THE FUCK UP evidently."
1040,Want to die,So it took awhile but I feel like I don’t want to live anymore. I’m bipolar and for the last few weeks I’ve been cycling through mania and depression within hours. It’s exhausting. None of my normal coping mechanisms are working bc I simply can’t use them during quarantine. I can’t see my friends I can’t go out to parties or concerts. I can’t take my mind off things. I haven’t self harmed since I was 14 but I just think about cutting my arm open and watching the blood spill out I daydream about it. I can’t think well this is only temporary bc it’s fucking not. Nobody knows when things will be normal and everything is fucking canceled anyway. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m living with my fiancé and his parents and I feel I have no space nowhere to be alone. I also hate that they are seeing my bipolar side. I’d like to just die and I don’t see anyway out of these feelings.
1041,Why don't parents try and understand?,"WARNING: RANT INCOMING. I discuss a few issues in this piece. 

I'm a 20 year old man living in Ireland and I've been dealing with mental health issues since 2018 and it makes me feels like every decision I make is the wrong one. I have bad depression and it's been really bad since lockdown began and it gets worse every day. Once lockdown is over I'm going to go back to the doctor and discuss it again and also talk about me possibly having ADHD. 


I have been debating dropping out of college due to my mental health. I feel guilty about discussing this with my parents as my college fees for the year are paid for and I duno what their reaction will be. 

Today my sister gave out to me for eating junk food my family bought the previous day. I struggle with binge eating and emotional eating and find it extremely hard to stop and think if I actually need to eat something or am I reaching for food out of anxiety or out of comfort. I'll literally eat a full packet of any form of junk food and not bat an eyelid.
My sister gave out to me saying I was a fat shit and that I was a selfish prick. My sister is 12 so I didn't really expect that!
This upset me and I told her that I struggle with binge eating and you don't realise how hard that is for me.

My family were in the room at the time and they all laughed and joked that I have no willpower to stop myself or motivate myself to not eat junk food. My dad scoffed when I told him I think Its something I want to look into.

When I went for counselling last year, I felt like my parents cared more about the cost of counselling rather than whether I was improving or not. After a few weeks my mam said to me ""surely you must be better at this stage, sure you look happy a good bit of the time.""

They always make sure to point out that I can't be a responsible functional adult and always say ""an adult would do X or act in X way"" 

I needed to get that off my chest. I don't feel like they understand or listen anymore in the last few years. Yet if it's my sister they'll listen and try to understand her more. I try show my love by doing odd jobs and buying them gifts sometimes when I get paid from work. But no matter what they still find a way to be disappointed in me 😔"
1042,I just felt actually threatened by an extinct giant sloth lemur,"I was looking at pictures of extinct lemur fossils, and i was trying to perceive the size of the animal, as i often do with fossils, by picturing them in my mind inside my room of which i know the measures of the walls so i can make the comparison, but, i dont know how to explain this, my brain passed me this image of the animal actually opening my door and trying to attack me, it's not like an hallucination, it was inside my head i was just imagining it, but it felt so real and threatening that i jumped up grabbed my knife quickly switched it open and stood looking at the door, tense and serious, like it was an actual possible scenario that could have happened, I started laughing out loud as soon as i realized how stupid that was, but now I feel concerned because it isn't the first time in the last few months that i had absolutely weird paranoias and i had to stop for a second to realize how stupid what i was thinking was. I never really had mental problems before and i'm in my early 20s so i was a bit concerned"
1043,Does OCD ever go away/become more manageable ?,"I'm a 20 year old girl dating a 20 year old boy, who probably has OCD, Pure O to be exact. He hasn't been tested yet, but he has a minor hoarding problem, worries about saying prayers ""just right"" and a series of other minor OCD rituals. He has struggled from thinking he might be gay and might not be in the right relationship (he is over them now). Currently he gets random inappropriate sexual thoughts. For context, this guy is the sweetest, the kinda guy that won't even kill a fly, puts my needs first and hates violent or scary movies. These thoughts scare him to no end and he is disgusted. He freaks out that these thoughts must reflect him as a person and he really is a monster, even though such thoughts never occurred to him until he was 19 and in the midst of OCD. 

I'm getting frustrated. I know for sure he is no harm, this is the opposite of him, but I'm getting so frustrated. We've been together 2 years, I want to marry him but I know I can't be with him if he is thinking weird thoughts. I know these don't reflect who he really is, but it scares me to think hes thinking these things nonetheless. Is it possible for this to go away?"
1044,TRIGGER WARNING: I (23f) relapsed self harm after 6 years and I’m scared I’ll do it again.,"I’ve been going through a lot of stuff recently. Not anything particularly bad, I just get overwhelmed by general things in life. Yesterday an accumulation of things (many of which have been ongoing issues) caused a meltdown of such, several things went wrong and being stuck in uni halls with two particularly unpleasant teenage flatmates, miles away from home, friendship drama hitting that morning (causing early morning drinking; I don’t normally cope this way but Quarantine has left me doing this one or two times) relationship problems  and just in general feeling overwhelmed. I reverted back to 17 year old me and self harmed as a feeling of grounding and control. 
Except what it did was cause the opposite. I’m kind of glad. I’ve never harmed myself remotely deep, the wounds tend to be superficial, more like a cluster of scratches done with an instrument. I do it to feel, have something to focus on because it stings/itches and it helps to ground me. That and I know when I get better it’ll fade into something only I can see. 
The issue is, not only do I feel overwhelmingly guilty and upset at myself, but I now have to hide my leg. It’s a quite sizeable section. Being of around 8x4” section on my upper-mid thigh. And I’m scared that during quarantine things may only get worse and I’ll continue on doing it. 
My mental health has been suffering considerably for the last 5 months or so: and my studies have been majorly affected by this. But I’ve been through so many times of being brushed off by mh services or just given links to help etc I’ve learnt to cope very well by myself. I am high functioning, but moments like this scare me. And I can’t talk to anyone around me about this to save their freaking out because I’m already dealing with myself facing my actions.


Long story short; what advice do you have to keep my mental health above the water so I can make it through this very isolating and mentally damaging time without any more hiccups??"
1045,Will we ever go back to school?,"Just found out that my school's trip to New York in November will most likely be canceled. I'm now having one of those days where I just want to curl up and die. This is the one thing I was looking forward to more than  anything else in high school, I could care less about dances or anything of that sort. Will students even return to schools before 2022 now?"
1046,Photographic memory?,"I am a 21 (f) trying to figure out what my type of memory is. I don’t think it’s photographic, or didactic. Maybe I’m just being hyper sensitive? 
But people are constantly asking how I learn and process information so quickly. I also suffer in relationships because I am unable to process negative behaviors. Something I’ve always wondered why other 21 year olds are so emotionally intelligent but I can’t catch on. 

So I can recall information that I’ve looked over once and reapply it for years. Most recent example. I watched a 5 minute video on how to turn old jeans into overalls. In that five minutes I taught myself to sew (on a sewing machine) 
And I am in the 2nd set of recreating  the outfit  with out referring back to the original video. 
When I was 15 I learned sign language from watching switched at birth, (a show that uses sign language frequently with subtitle aid) 
I can also recall text from Shakespeare soliloquies after 5 years of not revisiting them. 

Thoughts on if it’s just possible sensitivity to people’s reactions or general ideas on areas to research greatly appreciated. 

tl;dr-Tryjng to understand the way I process information."
1047,Is my friend a pedophile?!,"
He gets ‘uncomfortable’ whenever I bring up mental health even though he allegedly forgot he promised to be more open about it. I’m wondering it’s possible because...

I do know for a fact a few years ago he called pedophilia a ‘fetish’. Pedophilia is objectively not a fetish. Pedophilia is a paraphilia. 

I could’ve sworn he also brought up pedophilia a couple months ago, but I forget the context, and I think we kind of went:

&gt; Uhhh...."
1048,I'm scared my friends are mad at me for being depressed,"Last Friday I had a mental breakdown where I was venting in my friends' Discord server's vent channel about hating myself and all these awful things about my insecurities, and they all came to support me and say nice things, and they're still my friends, this also isn't the first time they were here for me after something like this. Though I'm scared that they may secretly find me annoying or that they'll stop loving me because I'm sometimes very depressed and hard on myself, even though they've shown that they're here for me. I don't know if anyone else here has felt this way, but if you have any advice I would like to hear it. Thank you."
1049,Dear mentally stable people: I’m not lazy!,"I’m posting this here because I just want to know if anyone else feels this way. I’m not lazy! I know it looks like I’m lazy. I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?

I’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. 

I feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. 

When normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy. I’m just trying to stay afloat."

I'm a psychologist doing a research and I ask you to fill in a super brief questionnaire, Thanks so much.

1051,Why does it bring he so much joy when ppl laugh at me/bully me for the way I dress and the music I listen to?,For some reason I love it when ppl on the street give me weird looks for the way I dress. Why? Is it normal?
1052,I try but I am not able to be grateful,"I have never been a kind of kid who would make unnecessary demands or would want all the fancy things in life like other kids because I was always aware my parents couldn't afford everything and I didn't want to be a burden, this feeling of not being a burden always triggers my anxieties and inferiority complexes. I underachieve things in so many cases. I didn't go to a regular government college because I didn't score extraordinarily and didn't opt for a private college because of the same reason that I didn't want to be a burden. I opted for weekend college and started taking up tuitions to earn some pocket money after my high school was over, so that I don't have to ask my parents for money. I don't live an extraordinary life nor do I wish for. A basic life with some privacy. I am not an ungrateful child, but I feel really bad for a reason when I see other kids' parents. I don't invite my friends over to my house because I don't have the kind of house I would want my friends to come to. There's no privacy at my place. I have had my anxiety troubles and there are times when I need some space and not get irritated. Where I want to have my own space to do things that I want to without disturbing someone else. It really disturbs my peace knowing how limited I am becoming by all these factors. I don't like to limited but when the situations like this arise, I just can't keep up with my spirit and can't help and be ungrateful about my life."
1053,I’m an idiot.,"So I’ve lost a lot of motivation to do most things. I also get distracted really easily. For example after I picked out my clothes today, I got distracted and ended up not even getting dressed for another hour. 

Anyway, school is hard for me now. I can barely get up the motivation to do work, so the work I got assigned like Tuesday, which is due tonight at 11:59, I didn’t even start the majority of it until today. I’m already mentally exhausted and I still have a good amount to do. I have work due Wednesday too, which I’m pretty sure I’m not doing because again, I don’t have the motivation and I don’t even care that much anymore. It’s not even just because school is online. Though I haven’t showed up to any of my online classes (they aren’t mandatory, but teachers do want you there if you are available) for the past week, and am not planning on joining any this week.

The week or two before, I was more involved. I showed up to one of my classes that met twice that week. Both times. Now I’m just choosing not to go, I haven’t turned it the work for that class due last week, and like I said this week it probably isn’t getting done either. 

I keep zoning out when I try to work. I have music in (instrumental so that I won’t get distracted by lyrics), which usually helps me focus, but I also use it to block out noise in my house. I already feel pretty tired (it’s only 5:03 pm) and I couldn’t even get myself out of bed until 12. I’m already thinking about which assignments I could get away with not doing. Ones that’ll have the least effect on my grades. Even though I still have roughly 7 hours until things are due.  My teachers must think I’m just being lazy, but in reality thats not the case."
1054,What’s your neighbor’s reaction when you have a breakdown or if police got involved—involuntary committed?,"I just talk to my close friend and she confided to me her sister was recently discharge for involuntary psychiatric hold due to severe mental illness with anger outburst. She said that her family is so ashamed because neighbors had to get involved. She cannot handle her at that time, so she asked help to her neighbors. She’s thinking that their neighbors are laughing at them and now they know her sister is mentally ill. Her family is worried about the stigma. They are renting an apartment and she’s worried that the landlord will treat them badly because of it and if neighbors will complain about them. One of her neighbor told her it was fine and she shouldn’t be ashamed to ask for help. She mentioned that this is not the first time that her sister is involuntary committed. Her sister has no job and depends on her and their mother. They don’t want 

She’s still worried and it’s affecting her own mental health. They always keep her sisters condition behind closed doors. 

Her mom is a single mother who has her own mental health issues. She is so stressed and I can’t do anything except to listen and be there whenever she need someone to talk to.

What is your experience in dealing with your mentally ill family? 

What can I do to help her?"
1055,inability to cry when im sad,"I have never ever cried in my life because of sadness even though there are a lot of things in my life people would cry about. 
The only time I cry is when my mom screams  at me and then I can’t stop crying and more and more thoughts are coming into my head increasing my tears. 
Maybe I am putting too much thoughts into this but I would love to just cry so that I can get a feeling of relief. 

English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry if there is any grammar mistakes."
1056,My mental illness is ruining my life,I’m so sick and tired of it. I’ve been such a bother to everyone I’m around and I can’t handle myself or my emotions I’m tired of it I hate it
1057,Favorite Movies depicting mental disorders?,"I just watched girl interrupted and it blew my mind. What are your recommendations for movies containing one or more mentally ill characters? I want to talk about  movies in which a disorder is not (!) evil, cliché‘d or condemned, but rather relatable."
1058,Anxiety to live up in the tech industry,"I’m a middle school student interested in game design. It’s a career I have been trying to follow for a little bit now, but I’m already scared I won’t be able to live up to the professionals. To get further in my education, I have been learning programing languages that will (supposedly) help me on my way. I use several resources (duh) including a Udemy class to educate myself. I spend a large amount of my time planning out what I’m going to learn and how I will study. Hard and focused grinding on my Udemy course is usually what I opt for when I’m studying. Once I have a plan I fall asleep assured that I will learn well. Everything is fine from then on until I actually start studying. I‘ve always known the importance of quality work so it’s easy for me to start, but once I’ve listened to several lectures I question my ability to go on. What makes it even worse is when I have to look at the solution in order to understand the course material. I back myself away from the computer, but I feel ashamed. I feel bad if I do it and I feel bad if I don’t. Breaks drive me into a screeching halt and then a detour into watching dozens of videos from people in the tech industry. I get warped and wrapped up into thinking about how much they worked to get where they’re at and in what amount of time. I see videos about 14 year olds working at flagship software companies. I wonder how much did they grind (in an educational sense) to get that far? I feel like I’m not learning enough in the amount of time that I give myself. Sometimes I try to reassure myself by realizing I’m just in middle school, and I’ll probably be far in high school, but will I really? I‘ve seen people much younger than me much farther. My parents and friends try to reassure me. They say they’re proud of me and to not get overworked. But they‘re outsiders looking in, and they probably think I’ll be well off anyways because I have good grades. Please, somebody who’s not an outsider, tell me what to do.   


TL;DR (For those of you who don’t want to help) I don’t know what amount of time I should use for studying to live up to the professionals."
1059,Intro To The Community And My Story,"Hi everyone! My name is Brandon Kohl and I'm one of the founders of Affirmation Hacks ([https://affirmationhacks.com](https://affirmationhacks.com)), which is a company that creates mental health products to help people master their mindset and emotions so they can be more confident and live life fully! All in all to stay more POSITIVE!  I'm super excited to be a part of this group and hopefully I bring value so we can all grow and progress in our mental health together. 

Just so everyone can know a bit about me... (: 

I'm incredibly passionate about people chasing their dreams and passions. And I  believe ANYONE can do ANYTHING they put their mind to. My life is living proof of that perspective. But sometimes it can be far from easy. For example, when I was younger I was diagnosed with multiple disorders (dyslexia, turrets, ADHD, severe OCD) and my family and I were actually told that I would need to be on assisted living for my entire life. I was made fun of severely in high school for being fat, ugly, stupid, and the list goes on. I would say I had a rough life as a kid and I came from a very broken family.  It it weren't for my Mom who; 

\- Consistently spoke life into me

\- Told me I could do anything I put my mind to. 

\- Made me say affirmations and do positive self talk, 

\- Believed that what she fed into my subconscious would eventually outweigh anything coming into my conscious, 

\- And did everything she could to make sure I could chase every one one of my dreams

I would 100% not be where I'm at today if it weren't for those things my mom did for me. I went from being LABELED as I said above by professionals and individuals, to now having sold 3 companies, being able to work and befriend some of the wealthiest and influential people in the world, and to now, chasing my dream and passion full-time, which is to help people have better mental health and positivity so they to can live life to the fullest and chase their dreams.  I very STRONGLY believe if it weren't for what my Mom had me do and my self action with mental health, I would most definitely not be where I'm at today, or may not even be here today.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to to get plugged into this community, bring as much value as I can and if anyone relates to my story or wants to personally talk to me, PLEASE reach out. You all have potential, you all are amazing, and you have a uniqueness in you that no one else has. You all are AMAZING!"
1060,My wife left me,"My wife left me last night while I was at work.

I am broken and feeling defeated and lost.

Completely blindsided me. Everything was going great and she decided to leave.

I don’t know how to continue living after this..."
1061,I got sucked into an mlm and it's taking its toll on my mental health. Never wanted to be in. I feel stuck.,"I don't know if it's the best place to post this but since it is affecting my mental health I think it fits.

For those who don't know what an mlm is, multi level marketing (a new name for pyramid schemes to make the ""businesses"" legal). One of my parents is obsessed with mlm's. I always found the idea dodgy but thought ""well, as long as they are not spending more of their income than I'm spending in the pub (they don't drink) it's not really my business, each with their own hoby"". Then, about 3 months ago they were like ""there's this new thing and I want to put you above me so you'll make money off me, I'll pay for your membership and you don't have to do anything, just sign up, join the Facebook group and I'll do everything"". Little, naive, people pleasing me accepted. What could go wrong? Right? It's not my hard earned money and I don't have to do anything. Right?

Well, the first part was true, not my money. The second part tho, not true. I often get invited to online conferences (by relative strangers), tagged on posts on Facebook (by relative strangers) and asked to tell my friends and coworkers about it (by my parent in question). I'm not attending those conferences, I know what they are going to say because it's always the cliche ""if I can do it you can too... don't look at how I started as a millionaire, I was a commoner just like you and look how much I'm making"" and I'm not giving my time to that. I'm not telling my friends about it because I don't want to keep bugging my friends ""hey pal, want a deal?"", it's creepy and I value my few friendships too much and definitely not telling my coworkers, I'm new in the office, I want to be liked. Then there's the Facebook posts which triggered this panic I'm feeling now. Usually I can ignore them but the last one was a bit too big. Basically I had to upgrade to keep the membership (wasn't me who paid for it so I obliged) so there was this post with my picture and ""congrats for the upgrade"" and lots of congrats comments. Not even my profile picture, an older one (because my face isn't really seen in my profile pic), which I find creepy. 

These businesses are against everything I believe in: hard work (although hard work is needed, they are promoted as an ""easy fix"" to people not having money from hard work), proper workers rights, work ethics. And there's the fact that I'm not cut for that. I hate having to persuade people and I lack persuasion. I hate having to trick people. I feel like a hypocrite being in one. And then there's this social media attention. I don't like having this kind of public attention, it's terrifying for me. All I post on Facebook are pics of my cat and one picture of me a year so people I haven't seen in some time know what I look like. All because I don't want social media attention, I'm there for cat pics and to use messenger with the friends who don't have Whatsapp.

So every time I hear of this ""businesses"" I want out. I don't want to tell that parent because I don't want to disappoint or sound ungrateful or unsupportive. Tried to drop hints but they were met with persuasion. And I feel bad they wasted almost 400$ on my fees alone and now I want out. I can't tell the other parent anything about it because they'd fight for me to be out but I don't want them to fight my battles, I'm an adult. And I didn't tell my friends and boyfriend about it because I'm ashamed and because I don't want them to think anything bad about my parent, I love my family and I want them to get along with my boyfriend should we be in a more serious place when they'd meet. It's all taking a toll on my already not great mental health. I feel stuck and really needed to tell someone about it."
1062,"Does Abilify interfere with anyone else ability to do play video games or be a competitive gamer, or also. Hinder my spiritual capabilities, like it does to me?","Can’t really go into details. But I feel like this drug dampens my ability to perform in highly competitive environments, as well as make me completely incapable of being a spiritually invested person, or having a sense of spiritual awareness.

To put it simply.

I feel like I lack awareness than when I do not on Abilify.

Anyone else feel the same way?"
1063,Best treatment/s for jumpyness?,"I am easily startled by sounds or when I see movement out the corner of my eye. I practice mindfulness,  and during the practice am often able to not care about these things. Is there a sort of therapy that can help with this sort of treatment? I have not found CBT very useful. Thanks for any help."
1064,Is it ok to intentionally make myself suffer because I think it’s funny?,"My ideal future would include a being married to a woman who loves me, and maybe a kid or two. But I think it would be funny if I grew old alone and became that weird uncle that hangs out in bars and is always trying to relive the glory days. I find myself pushing towards the latter future purely for the humor. I avoid building relationships and I push people away. Why do I do this? Is it ok to do this? It’s basically the mindset of “it’ll be funny if I become a sad lonely loser”"
1065,I'm really close to self harming,"This coronavirus has absolutely ruined my life. 

I have multiple sclerosis, Im 22, Im a full time student, and I worked at a supermarket for 3+years. 

I had an MS attack early this past February. As a result, I quit my job. I was in the hospital, and in pain. I was just exhausted...

Then all of this coronavirus crap happened. I interviewed at a few places, but no one is hiring. I moved in with my father in february, and have been paying him rent...He said that if I dont pay him, he will kick me out. Im blowing through my savings, with NO light at the end of the tunnel. 

I don't qualify for unemployment, and didn't qualify for the governemnt stimulus check. Im going to have to drop out of school, and end up homeless. 

Im suicidal and depressed. Is this Emergency Money for the Peoples Act real? Will US citizens be receiving money per month?? If not, I don't know what I will do"
1066,Eating Even When You Dont Want To?,"Ever since January I've (19F) been struggling a lot to eat a healthy amount. It started because of a depressive episode and anxiety towards eating alone in a public place after falling out with my friends. This lead to me eating very little if any nutritious food on a daily basis because all I had the energy to do after forcing myself to go to class was lay on the floor and eat whatever packaged food was lying around, usually cookies and chips. 

I have since dropped out of school and am in a much better place mentally, which I thought would lead to me also eating better as well, but that hasn't been the case. I am living with my parents right now who rarely cook since becoming empty nesters and am now back to basically living off of packaged food aside from the occasional grilled protein my dad cooks. Cooking for myself from scratch isn't really an option, as my mom can be quite controlling about what goes on in the kitchen. (Ramen and Mac &amp; Cheese are all I could make) 

Aside from being generally unhealthy, it has made eating even more difficult. Everything that isn't a cooked meal or a raw fruit/vegetable is incredibly unappetizing to the point where it makes me nauseas. I've also been using soda to help fill my stomach when it's unbearably empty, so most days my diet has been something along the lines of 4-6 cuties oranges, a banana, 2 cans of soda, and a small amount of some sort of protein. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? I'm very worried that if I don't change I could develop an eating disorder. Are there steps I can take to treat this myself or is it too late? 

Note: My dad works long hours at a blue-collar labor job and my mom is a stroke survivor, so I am very grateful that they do cook, even if it's not often! I just felt it was important to mention it in the story for context"
1067,I have given up,"Hello,

1068,I'm Loosing Friends,"Got into a quarrel with another person this time,

***Background:***

we both live in the same house and we split the bills.

I've always considered him a friend, even though I consider most of the things he says or does as annoying. He's a IT guy (IOT, agile, Machine learning). I'm a Mechanical guy (CAD, Drawing design, drafting who was pushed into the IT field as a support guy, and i have always been frusturated that i've been forced to this IT things, i'm a Mech guy for godsake I can barely understand how a server works and they want me to do automations).

We work for the same company, even though our jobs are not even in the same book in a library.

We share pretty much everything.

&amp;#x200B;

***Reason for the quarrel:***

The sink in our home is tiny and usually when there is a small amount of waste in the strainer the sink accumulates water.

After waking up today afternoon, I cooked some cauliflower with oil, as some of the food had stuck onto the pan I left it to soak in water.  Meanwhile, I noticed that he already cooked his own food and plates in the sink (sink was almost fully clogged). After me washing the knife it was almost overflowing outside.

But I didn't care as I was hungry, I took the food to my room and was eating it.

He messaged (even though we live in the same house) me saying that the sink had to be cleaned.

I went out my room and said at his door that it's not my fault and the sink had been overflowing because of his heavy cooking which he didn't even make for me &lt;yelling&gt; (paraphrasing)

I've always been defensive when somebody puts their mistake on me, because it happened in school, happened in college and it's happening now.. Now i'm a grown man.. I no longer want somebody else's scape-goat.

He came out and said why are you yelling, i'll punch you so that you can't stand up.

(I'm a lean built person, some doctors would even agree that i'm mal-nourished as per my BMI)

But, that doesn't mean, I would bow-down and let everyone roll over me..

I kept on it in a loud voice phase.. about the mistakes I had noticed about him ever since he moved in this house.. (from leaving the heater on in the bathroom the whole day, not closing the fridge the entire night and most importantly, never cleaning the bathroom/toilet or sink for that matter)

I felt bad in this situation, for everything I do around this house, someone saying that it's my fault that this stupid sink is overflowing..

So.. I took it a notch up.

I dragged the garbagebag out from previous week, kicked it to tear in the hall way and showed proof that i've been eating only apples, bananas and simple cooked vegetables for the past week. (It was really messy, I mean very stinky and messy as my conscious side kept telling me 'what the fuck was I doing' messy)

Then, it went physical. He put hands on my chest, I swatted it out, pushed him away and told him to talk and reason like a proper man and not be a pussy.

So, he goes to his room gets his phone to take picture of the mess, I asked him why he was doing that and he said for FB, ""so that people will know that there are people like you"" (exact words)

Me: Like me? who are emotional and have already told you that my fuse is short when i'm hungry.. you want the world to know that i'm shitty person who can't control emotions.

Him: Yes, people need to see what you do. (with an annoying smile, while i'm yelling my lungs off)

Me: this is just your way of wanking off, getting public validation for every shitty thing, fuck you.. you are a hypocrite, a pussy and a bitch if you take a picture of this.

Me: I clean every part of this house with Ammonia and Ethanol 85%

Him: 85%? why not 84% who told you to do that, which rule is this

Me: coz, that is the one available in the market you can ask the super market about it, but I use chemicals for their purposes not to make a statement.

&lt;then some more yelling of each others throats about what a bullshit he is and what a bullshit i am&gt;  


(gosh, I sounded like a old hag)

After a minute..

Him: When are you going to clean this.

Me: Now (My logic side kicked in and recognizes that I made a shit ton of mess out of this)

&lt;Cleans the entire hall, bathroom, kitchen, with ammonia and ethanol&gt;

Sends the image of the clean places, with before and after; including the sparkling kitchen and i got a reply (clap emoji) and that he never asked me to clean the other stuff

(I'm making a subtle point that i own up my shit and he should do the same for his own mess)

and then a message comes, we should stick to messages and perhaps you should put back that ""Do Not Disturb"" label back on your door.

&amp;#x200B;

After all this, I messaged someone to talk to.. (the one from previous quarrel).. no reply

Messaged friend back home.. no reply (he's probably as sleep)

Noticed that, that there is nobody for me to actually to talk to..

There is probably a picture of the mess I made somewhere in FB (Not like I have a image, i'm not even on Facebook, why should I care)

Guess, I can't really make friends anymore with my character and tendency to burst out..

A few people have always told me that anger will be my downfall.

huh.. a long and lonely life awaits me.."
1069,How do I help my wife.,"My wife suffers from anxiety and depression. Its never been really bad throughout our relationship but for the past few weeks it's been on a level I've never seen before. It's like the light burnt out inside. She sleeps all day. Has trouble sleeping at night, barely eats, and struggles with daily routine tasks. When I talk to her it's like I'm bothering her. She's told me that she's embarrassed to talk to me about it, and I understand. I just don't know how to help her. The doctors upped her medication and prescribed her a new sleep aid so hopefully that helps. I just want my laugh with my wife again."
1070,I fell like an asshole,"I was always a really extroverted person, a bit shy but extroverted. But I get mentally tired of social interaction easily recently. I got in a long distance relationship a year ago bcs I wanted to like them, and I thought this way I wouldn’t get as drained as with real contact. Didn’t worked, after some time I just don’t wanna talk anymore, I don’t wanna be with people anymore, not only partners, friends, family, everyone. I thought I was good now, started going out with someone, but it started all over again, I get exited to talk to them, to see them, but when we are talking or together, I have this felling that I just wanna run, just wanna hide where no one sees me, were I can just close my eyes and not do anything. I don’t know if I should drag this relationship anymore, but it only started. I don’t wanna regret later. 
I fell like a spoiled brat that want to run from the decisions that I made. But I want to like them, I want to enjoy being with them, I really do, but it hurts me, it get me mentally exhausted just thinking that I need to go through wanting to see them to wanting to go home in just some hours. 
I fell like I’m meant to be alone forever."

1072,I believe I have anxiety and depression,"Especially shining during this quarantine, when I get too much time to think to myself sometimes my heart starts to start racing and my palms get sweaty. I’m not as hungry as I used to be and I really just feel down and just sit in my room. The only time I feel good is when I see my friends or go outside. Please help and how to get better?"
1073,I’ve broken again,"My mind is tearing me apart, I’m working an overnight shift which in turn is making me sleep during the day which in turn isn’t allowing me to get my schoolwork done, which in turn is causing me a lot of stress and I just can’t handle it all. I’m supposed to have two papers written tonight but I have to be at work in less than four hours. I apparently have a test tomorrow to do, I have to make a model before class. I’ve hit a breaking point and relapsed back into self-harm last night. I just want all this to end."
1074,Ex boyfriend still making me feel rejected,"Hi everyone, so I recently broke up with my ex boyfriend but we still live together in a flat with one other person. We have our own rooms so obviously don’t have to share. Basically every conversation I have with him I just end up feeling sad or negative about myself or just something in general. But for some reason I still want to have sex with him, I tried tonight and he’s basically just said “he doesn’t feel comfortable” which I kinda get but I think the word comfortable had just fucked with me a bit. I feel like he never wanted to have sex with me really and I’ve always felt so rejected by him. Honestly I’ve been crying for ages over this so much that I’ve thrown up and he’s not even checked to see if I’m okay. Please can someone help me with what to do, thank you!"
1075,My mental health disorder destroyed my marriage.," 

TLDR ; I dont know if its my fault or my illness, but my marriage sucks and im literally stuck with no options due to being an immigrant. we never talk anymore and were just broken.

My husband and i have been married for 5 years next month, we have a son together, Hes a really good person and father but our marriage sucks.  
Unfortunately my pregnancy resulted in some really bad Post partum depression and anxiety which resulted in round the clock panic disorder, agoraphobia you name it.

I worked really hard going to therapy, trying medications, doing self help, meditations, you think of it you name it ive given 120% effort into trying to ""cure"" me its been almost 4 years since i got diagnoses with treatment resistant anxiety disorder our lives have been really destroyed by it.

But he makes it out to be like its my fault, like i'm not doing anything good enough if i ask for help when i'm having a panic attack he gets annoyed at me and shuts down and tells me he cant do anything and to just take my pills .

I feel like I have no support. i'm trying to be a good mom and wife but it seems like everytime i get up i get hit 10x harder.

Im also an immigrant to the USA from Canada, it hasnt been easy USCIS fucked up a ton of paperwork and delayed my case , so i cant drive here, i only just got permission to leave the country to go back home and the boarders are closed , i only just got a social to work (but theres a pandemic). Its been really really hard being an immigrant with no ability to do anything.

I havent seen my family in years, i miss home. I miss being happy

I cant get a divorce because ive been jobless the last 5 years I have no money, Im still considered mental health issue because we havent found the right medications for my disorder yet . Obviously my husband wouldnt agree to letting me take my son back home, and I dont want him to make me leave and keep our son in america.

Its like.. I have no options. either co-parent for the next 16 some years, attempt a divorce but my husbands family is rich and they will use my mental health against me to win that im ""unstable"" .

We dont talk anymore ever. unless its to parent, we dont touch eachother, were just so beyond broken.we tried therapy.

It feels like I have no options, ,...."
1076,I don't think my mind can be fixed.,"I'm 31.

I was raised lax catholic, in high school I was diagnosed with OCD+Depression+GAD (but probably had at least the OCD before that), and upon graduating I quickly became an extreme evangelical christian.

Mixing that with my disorder fucked me up severely. I avoided certain shows, games, music, even people, for complicated religious reasons that were made more complicated by my disorder.

I lived in constant dread of my loved ones possibly going to hell when they died due to not being proper christians.

A pastor told me that my jewish friend who died in high school went to hell.

A ""friend"" told me my unsaved family were probably in hell, and followed that up with ""praise god for his justice.""

What followed was a very slow and very painful turn from christianity to, somehow, atheism. I finally realized in 2016 that many of my worst fears stemmed from christianity or supernatural topics in general.

While I'm more of a ""free"" person now, things haven't really gotten any better.

During my religious years, I basically stopped growing in a number of ways, from social to sexual. I feel like I'm trying to play catch-up now, and nothing I'm doing is helping.

Meanwhile my disorder still has me in constant fear that even my own anger at a person can somehow cause their soul to end up in hell upon death. Again, it's a complicated OCD thing, and I've told myself trillions of times that ""there is no god, there is no afterlife, so everyone stops existing when they die,"" but it just doesn't stick.

In fact, I tell myself that there is no god or afterlife or anything supernatural in an effort to keep myself sane (it's the only thing that works anymore), but here and now I can admit that I don't know for sure whether or not that's true.

I even spent countless hours attempting to prove christianity false by researching online (I'm no scholar so it hasn't been proper research at all). For a variety of reasons, I can't come to a solid conclusion on that either.

What I do know is that christianity fucked me up, my disorder fucked me up, I now have very few solid friendships due to my sabotaging most of my connections with people, and I just feel very, very lost.

And the worst part is that nobody seems to know how to address this. I've been through many psychs and therapists, as well as a handful of priests and pastors before I went atheist. Nothing has worked.

A few years ago, I spent 6 straight months, every day, doing an imagination exposure therapy guided by my therapist (via a recording most days), imagining myself and my mother in hell.

It didn't work.

Now we're in the middle of a pandemic and the only therapy I get is half-hour phone calls with my current therapist, who is not equipped to handle my complex OCD+religious trauma at all.

I need to know there's no god. I need to know that when we die nothing happens. I need to know that christianity is absolutely false.

But I won't know whether or not there's a god or afterlife for certain til I'm dead. I won't know whether or not christianity is false for certain til I'm dead either, since, my god, that debate can go on for fucking ever, and you have my word on that. As someone who's fought both sides, trying to prove it and trying to disprove it, you can spin in that for literal years.

And, best part, none of that will solve my OCD anyway, since OCD has to be confronted with exposure-response prevention exercises, but none of my therapists have been able to figure out how to apply that to my complex religious OCD.

Here's the kicker: I started a job a few weeks before the pandemic, but I barely worked before that, so I'm on crappy state insurance (I'm in NJ) which does not cover any good therapists, and I do not have the money to pay for good therapy out of pocket.

And even if I did, I can't seem to find a therapist who actually knows how to tackle this.

I feel like I'm fucked.

I am fucked.

I'm really scared. I'm really frustrated. And I don't know what else to do anymore.

If there's anyone out there who can fix this, I can't find them or afford them.

I don't know what to do."
1077,Why do I never take any advice and enjoy being miserable?,"I always disagree with everyone’s advice. I’ll probably do it here. It’s like I enjoy hating myself. I don’t know why, but I do. This is honestly why I think no therapy would ever help me. I will just ignore all of their advice. I’m also really good at lying and hiding my emotions so no one even knows how I actually feel. Anyone know why I do this?"
1078,My friend is on anti-binge medication and her new eating habits are affecting me.,"Trigger warning: Eating Disorders 

I have been struggling with anorexia for a few years now, and it's hard for me not to get triggered when food or weight is being brought up. I have been friends with S for about 4/5 months now. Recently, she was diagnosed with binge-eating disorder and was put on medication to lower her feeling of hungriness. She confided in me to help her keep on track with eating, making sure she doesn't under-eat as its very common for it to happen with that medication. I feel selfish for feeling this way, but I have noticed how worried I am about my weight now. Hearing about how little she eats messes with my brain, and I feel sick thinking about having to eat. I want to be a good friend and help her stay on track, but she has already begun to undereat and doesn't care what I have to say. This is has been really affecting my mental state, but how can I tell her I can't help her? I am her only friend, so she doesn't have anyone else to talk with. Does anyone have any advice to help me? 

Thank you and sorry for the sad topic... I hope everyone is well during these times."
1079,My sister,"My sister is 10F, adopted 3 years and when she got her privileges taken away for the evening for farting in my face (at about 7 PM bedtime 8:30 PM) She started bawling repeatedly screaming and sobbing ""HELLLP"" and ""PLEEASE"" for about more than a half an hour or so. She's also been hyperventilating, coughing, disobeying and flailing limbs around and this has been happening repeatedly for the years she's been with us.

She was taken away from her alcoholic mom at age 3 and was passed through families until age 7.

We think there's something wrong, can I have help?"
1080,"i keep falling deeper and deeper, someone help me","hello. i’m 17 y/o and i’m diagnosed with what seems to be (to my therapist) both severe anxiety and severe depression. that’s all that i know of though. around late august of last year, i started feeling down and unmotivated, but for no apparent reason at all. i had a strong relationship with my girlfriend, i was doing great in school and making new friends, but something just seemed to be sinking inside of me. people always asked me why i seemed so down and depressed but what was making me mad is the fact that i could never put my finger on a solid reason why i feel this way. 

right now, i feel completely void of emotion and i’m having trouble taking care of myself. people around me have been slowly vanishing out of my life because of the way i act and think now, and it just seems like an endless paradox to me. every time i try to explain how i feel to people, i just feel like i sound like an edgy teenager who wants attention and sympathy. i feel lonely when i’m around my friends and i’ve been doing nothing but isolating myself and hiding in my own thoughts. i write my own music, but recently i’ve been throwing away every single idea that comes to mind, and i don’t know why. 

recently, i’ve been getting very little sleep. some nights i would go to bed at 6AM because i’d be laying there, tired, but somehow now able to put myself to sleep. most nights i’ve been getting anywhere from 1-4 hours of sleep and i can’t help it. i’ve taken melatonin and done everything i usually do that helps me sleep. my parents have also noticed i’ve been physically and emotionally exhausted. one other thing is that my eating habits have changed drastically. usually when i’m feeling down, i’d eat a ton, like every 30 minutes i would snack on something. not anymore. in the past 4 days, i’ve probably eaten 3 total meals and i’ve had little desire to eat, because nothing tastes good and sometimes i’ll throw up in my mouth after trying to eat.

every morning, i wake up and feel completely useless and the first thing on my mind is killing myself. i would never kill myself, because i feel that it’s selfish and unfair, but it’s all i can think about. i’m not on any medication and i never have been, and i don’t know if it would help or harm me at this point.

i just want to help fix myself, i’ve done everything i know how to do. i’ve practiced self care, gotten exercise, meditated, gone outside but nothing makes me feel anything. i feel like i’m wasting my life and developing at the wrong pace and if something doesn’t change soon, i’ll be like this for god knows how long.

if anybody has gone through something similar or is going through this currently, how have you been dealing with it? this is my last resort. i have a meeting with my therapist tomorrow and i’m going to talk to her about how i’ve been doing. does anyone think i should tell her any specific details? if so please, please let me know. 

thank you all, stay safe and quarantined."
1081,Need OCD Advice,"So before covid I was supposed to start CBT sessions for OCD. Obviously like everyone else life has been turned upside down.
I just needed some advice on how to manage OCD tenancies, I tend to overthink everyday and night to the point where my sleep is disturbed, that's the main problem - intrusive, unwanted thoughts.

Like many people the lack of mental health help is getting to me. I'm more irritable, emotional and on edge, especially since I was finally getting help for my mental health.

Anyway, thank you for reading, any help would be appreciated. Hope everyone is doing okay."
1082,"Had chronic derealisation for 9 years, anyone else?","I've never taken drugs, it just randomly happened to me when I was 13 and sitting in class. It's been permanent from that time on.

It seems to be getting gradually, slowly getting worse. I've kept telling doctors about it ever since but made almost no progress. They'll either ask me to explain it or suggest some other thing it could be e.g. anhedonia.

I feel like a pretty isolated case, having never had drugs at all and for it to be chronic and for this long. I *have,* though, had extreme social anxiety from an early age and was bullied a fair bit. Though for it to have been triggered when I was doing basically nothing is bewildering. Would be nice to see if anyone else has had a similar experience to me."
1083,Barely any human interaction,"I'm [16m] and I have not had and sort of contact with my friends since the 18th of March. I dont like to text people first and if I ever do, I always feel needy, stupid and like I'm bothering them. What is this?
This means that I haven't had any human interaction with my friends for over a month and I'm starting to think that they dont like me in any way, shape or form. I'm probably overthinking this but its still how I feel."
1084,I want to disappear,"I live in this constant state of wanting to disappear and abandon everything I have. I constantly fear that my boyfriend hates me and only tolerates me because he pities me and I send him lewds/nudes. I think my friends don’t really like me but they let me hang around because they’re too nice to tell me to fuck off. I’m the child my parents like the least and they can’t wait for me to move out for uni this year.

I want to just scream at everyone until they snap and finally realise I’m not worth the pity or time they give me. I want to run away and live a new life as a lonely hermit where I can’t bother anyone anymore. I want my boyfriend to break up with me, my friends to stop talking to me, and for my family to estrange me so I can be as self destructive and horrible as I want without hurting anyone. I want them to openly tell me they hate me so I can at least justify feeling sad and anxious all the time instead of living in paranoia. 

And yet I don’t want any of that at the same time. I love them all so much and I need their love and attention. My family, as dysfunctional as we are, despite how much we fight, still means a lot to me. My friends, even though I don’t trust them and how I’m the most distant out of everyone, still make me feel less lonely and crazy. My boyfriend, bless his heart, is fucking saint who has put up with me for far too long. He’s the only reason I feel motivated enough to get out of bed. He’s been my shoulder to cry on for so long. I don’t want to burden him any longer.

There’s no real point to this ramble really. I just needed to vent. I feel like I’m going to lose my mind. I don’t want to die, I’m too scared to hurt myself that badly, I just have an overwhelming desire to disappear so I can stop being such a pathetic burden on people."

1087,"""Lockdown shows you who really cares about you""","The more I see these posts the more upset it makes me feel. Especially when it's people who I have started to recently lose contact with.

This lockdown is having a massive impact on my own and so so so many others mental health. Either beginning to start pressures or  enhancing them. 

Are people realising this when they share/type/send this stuff for others to see?? 

Mini rant over."
1088,Therapy app idk 😐,"To all mental health professionals, please if you ever wonder how to do something different remember I’ve been doing research on how does online therapy works and it totally sucks. So please if someone out there wants to take on a project think of an app somewhat like skipe where you can actually talk to professionals. Or even better, students who can work for free and make up a little practice idk But PLEASE!"
1089,I think its happening again,"Been reaching out for the past few days in every way I know how and just can't seem to get any responses from anybody. I guess I'm not the easiest person to deal with. I think I've come to the conclusion that I need to either call the crisis number if it gets too bad or try to call my doctor tomorrow to see if I can get back in to see him, but that will take months... Can't believe I'm typing this. I think I know whats coming because I've been through it before. Things were going good. I thought this would get better. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I'm just terrified."
1090,Feel like shit,"Found out my ex is still trying to drag me down after dumping me 2 months ago, a mate of mine is being a two faced twat. Just feel hopeless"
1091,How do I get the courage telling my parents that I think I have a diagnose? It's complicated.,"I am a teen under 18 who has a really complicated relationship with talking about mental health with my parents. 

The situation is so that I am pretty sure from the years of research I've done that I have ADHD, and I do not mean that I googled online ADHD test and got the answers that I do.

 I've been reading on hundreds of forums made by doctors and my differences between me and the rest of my family and friends are basically explained by ADHD, I really think I have it.

How do I tell my parents that I think I have ADHD without making them freak out or get mad at me?

(This is far from everything that has to do with the situation, don't hesitate to ask any questions)"
1092,How is your memory affected?,"As someone who went through A&amp;D, i know that i don't remember some of my memories during that time. It was rather patchy and hazy. My SO would mention an event and i'd have to scan my brain hard to remember, but there's none. It's not that big of a deal for me because i was mostly in school that time and nothing significant really happened. I was wondering, how is it for other people? Was it the same, or worst? Did you get to remember those that you forgot?  

P.S. English is not my first language so i'm sorry."
1093,Thanks Past-Me,"Since my first inpatient stay, I've been conscious of having my suitcase packed incase something suddenly came up. Well it looks like something has not so suddenly came up and, if they've got the beds, I'm going inpatient again because I can't for the life of me find this brain. So thanks Past-Me for having your shit togeather and sorry Future-Me that I am stuck between three doorframes and may have gotten us in serious shit. Also thanks Reddit for being relatively chill. 🤙"
1094,"My family is in crisis and I need support. My wife suffers from mental health issues, became violent, I filed a restraining order to protect me and our child from her, she blames me for her violent episode, I want to reconcile and get her help, she hates me.","I am heartbroken.  I feel like I have had to make impossible decisions and am living an impossible existence.  I feel frustrated that we have never really nailed down a diagnosis (unless my wife has hid that from me which is possible), and we have definitely not found a medication regimen that works well.  It is difficult to help manage her mental health because on her best days she is still stubborn, fearful of being committed (to the hospital), outspoken and unfiltered (a bit rude, really), and afraid of being controlled, abused or taken advantage of.

Alcohol is a contributing factor.  She has been sober for many years and just recently started drinking again.  This quickly led to belligerent behavior, then anger, then an intensely violent and hate fueled rage directed at me.  I was able to get the kids out of the house with a relative.  She called the police in a drunken state to report that I had hidden her wine.  I did not report the violence to the police, but I did leave the house on their recommendation.  After the next day, after she was sober, she still considered the incident to be my fault for antagonizing her.  It is absoutely bizarre to me.  I am not violent, I do not yell, I was not drinking, I try to de-escalate.  I believe that she honestly doesn't remember the events, and can't seem to realize how destructive her behavior is.  I got a temporary restraining order from her and it is in effect now.  She is overcome with hatred for me and can't understand why I would be so terrible as to have her removed from the house.

She knows that alcohol is a problem, but slipped up.  I expect her to stay sober for a long time.  But, over the last couple years when she has not been drinking, there has been a slowly growing attitude of hate towards me and others.  She seems almost obsessed with hating certain politicians, co-workers, family members, etc.  She can't watch TV without feeling real hatred towards fictional characters.  She submerges herself in social media and political news as an escape but it fuels her hatred.

Sometimes she seems delusional and paranoid.  She worries about people having information about her and thinks people are spying on her.  Sometimes she seems to think she is a bigger influence on local and even national politics than I think she is.  She left her first husband under dramatic circumstances that unfortunately parallel what I am seeing now.  She alleged serious abuse, rape and, controlling behavior, but now i question her perspective on those things.

I and my child are safe.  I have a network of family support.  I have a therapist.  She has family (mine and hers) that are there to support her, but she finds it difficult or impossible to trust the people who care about her.  She has access to psychiatric help, but is distrustful.  I am not perfect but I am terribly understanding, apologetic, slow to anger, and just not really that bad.

Can anyone recommend places for support?  My family is good, but they don't have experience with this kind of psychosis.  Her family are supportive, but unfortunately are untrusting of psychiatric medicine and think vitamins and diets are the answer."

1096,Please help me im stuck in my thoughts,"Please help. 

It just seems like like more effort then it’s worth now. But I care about them too much to leave them. I feel so trapped. I just can’t."
1097,hitting a wall?,"i’m not sure how to describe it, but i can be fine all day or maybe even for a couple of days and i’ll hit the wall. my mood drops and i stop talking to everyone. i attempted suicide a couple days ago after i hit the wall, and i don’t want to tell anyone in case they get worried, what is this?"
1098,How do I access therapy?,"I (23F) am from the UK. I have been suffering with mental health issues since I was 16. Since then, I have had phases where I have felt OK and phases where I've felt really down and had suicidal thoughts.

I have tried to access counselling through the NHS countless times. The first time I started having counselling through NHS, they gave me the time of an appointment to attend which didn't suit me, but I wasn't given a number to rearrange, so they took me off the list.

The second time I sought help, they put me in for three group sessions instead of 1to1, which I know wouldn't work for me as I struggle enough to open up 1to1, so a group session would be really daunting.

There have also been a few times where I've not been able to answer their initial assessment call due to being in work, so they then cancel the referral.

On top of this, the waiting list is really long, so I just can't see this working for me. I have been really struggling for the past year and it's just getting worse. I'm in an abusive relationship which doesn't help. I just feel alone and I really don't see things getting any better. 

I need good, regular therapy. However, the question is, where do I look to access this? How do I find a therapist? Is there a site for this? Also, are there any good websites for online therapy?

Thank you."
1099,What do you do with all the painful memories from the past?,"I’m starting exposure therapy (if you can call it that quite yet) because I was almost attacked by a dog once and I remember each bit of it vividly every day (I was very young too) and as a result am traumatized. For therapy homework I had to do something that brought up some bad memories, basically listen to dog collar/key jingling and try to decrease my fear rating.

I told my therapist concern I had with dealing with the memories and she said to try jingling the keys yourself or have another person do that. I don’t see how that would help any and wish I would have asked more but I didn’t. 

How do you deal with the bad memories? Do you try to repress them and stop thinking about them? Or do you let yourself remember then and just let it pass through you?"
1100,Is anyone else experiencing pandemic depression?,This is the most difficult mental task I’ve ever been through. It’s even more difficult because I feel there is nothing to look forward to. I don’t like to vent to family or friends about how this is affecting me but I am trying really hard not to let my suicidal ideation worsen right now. I really worry that the lack of a light at the end of the tunnel is driving me to consider suicide more and more. It’s even more difficult to talk about how this is affecting me mentally because mental health does not seem to be a priority right now. I am just really losing hope right now and wishing for some hope to grab onto because I don’t see myself wanting to live through this for much longer...

1104,I’m spiraling tonight for ridiculous reasons,"Basically the problem is I hate my boobs. There. End of story. And apparently somehow even THAT unchecked means dealing with suicidal ideation because fuck my frickin mind! Just getting it out, so I can hopefully laugh it off in a few. I’ve fallen into suicidal ideation &amp; snapped myself out of it so many times now, I’m already certain all will be well rather quickly.
But fuck my mind for being this way! Even outside of knowing I have a mental illness, I’d still say this bs is weak-minded. I’m so much stronger than that. 
And I know for a fact, despite my many negative traits, I would never hate on someone else over their body like I am about my own right now."

I’ve always been lonley maybe one or two friends at the most, I was always just ok though then the rest started to come in. I eventually broke down awhile ago and I stopped, started cutting and plotting my suicide, then an involuntary inpatient stay. Now I’m here completely alone, on heavy drugs, and nothing to do. Am I alone because I’m an unlikable person? Everyone always talks shit about me in the worst ways. Everyone hates me. I’m not socially awkard or have any social anxiety, so it has to be me being a piece of shit. There’s so much........."
1107,I feel guilty a lot of the time,And I would like for my parents to officially separate so they have the chance to live the lives they want instead of living such toxic lives. It’s something that constantly weights  on me for some reason. I know none of my siblings or me are to blame for their failed marriage but I just want them to both be happy and better people. Don’t we all deserve that?
1108,I need advice on how to take good care of my emotional health by myself(15m),"I have not been doing so well Mentally and it has started to effect me greatly, each class has dropped by atleast 10 points, I only eat the equivalent to like 5 meals a week and often get very nauseous after eating even a tiny amount( my stomach hurts from hunger all the time but I am almost repulsed by the though of eating because how I feel as a result from eating). I do not feel comfortable opening up to anyone ik irl because my reputation is the fun guy. I feel like im constantly on the verge of breaking down and when i do breakdown I hyperventilate and throw up basically until my body is too tired to do it anymore. I desperately need pointers on how to cope/get my life back on track by myself. Edit-Is it possible this is caused by Marfan syndrome, I read that people with Marfans often have a higher risk for mental illness and poor quality of life(I do not have the pronounced Marfans look btw) edit 2- I have also lost all interest in my old hobbies,past time,etc."
1109,What's your milestone today?,"I got to thinking about something lately. It's been a little over a decade since my life changed drastically, with the passing of my mother on December 17th, 2009. This, in turn started a journey which I wasn't to emerge until recently. I had to watch for the rest of the school year (I was a senior in HS as the time) my dad mourn his wife. I went to college, only to find it wasn't the ""best time of my life"" like it is for many, but actually some of the worst years of my life. My sophomore year, I finally stepped into the psychiatrist office at our school, feeling better stepping out than I had in a long time. I was terrified to be on medication, but knew I needed to take it (Citalopram, for those curious).

I was suicidal at the time, but luckily I didn't give in to the voices or images in my head. In about a year or so, I got great news from my psychiatrist-I could start coming off the medication. Even though I feared a relapse more than anything, I endured. For a time, I was really happy, though still living in fear of relapse. I started a relationship that would fail in 3 months, then decided to just have fun in my remaining time in college (at this point, a term or so). Then, I met a woman who would make me wonder how my life got to where it was. About a year into the relationship, she told me she was pregnant. Ignoring some warning signs, I got excited and prepped for a baby which wasn't to come, including my brother and his wife buying me a pickup (which I still drive today). Then, under sketchy circumstances I didn't recognize until WAY too late, she told me and the family the baby was stillborn. I wouldn't find out until later that my family knew she lied. After we broke up, she then told me the baby was aborted. A few months later, my dad passed away after a long health struggle. 

A few years later, I am living with one of my best friends, who has this dog. I am left with him one weekend, and this dumb little Boston Terrier shows me just how bitter I had become. I realized the joy of loving on something, and having them love me back. I had allowed my recent past to make me bitter and I hated that. I sought to change it. Soon, I realized that I was living in the past. I was listening to the same songs, going back to the old emotions I once felt. I was analyzing and living in a past which had no more to teach me (mostly of the days during my depression).  I finally realized that it was time I moved on for good, believing that God had finally showed me this door when he knew I needed to go through it. It took some time and was quite difficult, but I eventually walked through it.

This all leads me to today. I live in beautiful SW Washington, I am healthy, am very close with my family (especially my brother), have a job I love, a fulfilling hobby in writing, and amazing friends. I'm finally renting a house, after years of living in apartments. I can easily say that I am the happiest I have been in years--perhaps even the happiest I've been in a decade. It wasn't easy, it wasn't always fun and there are times it's hard to look back and remember those things did actually happen to me. But it was all worth it, in a way--I love who I am, even with my faults. I wouldn't change a minute of my past, because it's made me who I am. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, to the next decade and whatever it brings, because I've already been through so much that I know I am prepared for tomorrow. 

So, the question I pose to you folks: What is your milestone today? Is it a week without the voices? A day you can get out of bed? A year off medication, or finding the medication that works? Let's celebrate what we've accomplished, small or large. Did you just get married? Have a kid? Close on a home? Let's hear it!"
1110,"For the past month when I've been stuck home, I've done nothing but sit in my bed and watch YouTube/netflix. I have no motivation for classes and I have mental breakdowns every night, what can I do?","I'm really stuck. This isn't me just being depressed, but I don't have anyone to talk to. I haven't texted anyone as no one ever texts me, and it's mentally draining having to keep up friendships that are only 90% me and 10% everyone else anyway.

I've always wanted to see if I didn't next anyone and stopped keeping up friendships would anyone check on me or care? Well, I can safely say no. No one would check up on me.

I haven't been texted first once this entire break, I've only texted a few people asking for homework help.

While it's maybe? a good thing to learn that I really have no good friends, it's really made me a lot more depressed.

I have mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks almost every night and I've been doing nothing but sitting in my bed watching videos and movies and such,

What can I do to break this funk?

I can't work or do anything like that.

I could drive, but like, what's the point if there's no where to go and I'm just wasting gas?"
1111,Left a message for my psychiatrist— I’m stopping the meds whether he likes it or not.,"Literally what I said to the person who supposedly was gonna let him know. I doubt she got it to him because the lady really didn’t sound too confident that she even heard me but whatever. 

I was on Lamactal for a month and a few weeks and the moment they raised me from 50 to 100mgs I got awful stomach cramps, pale diarrhea, nausea, and it felt like I had to consciously tether myself to the present. I was so spacey and it felt awful. Not only that but my mood really hasn’t changed or gotten better; hell, it only makes depression moments last longer. 

I *tried* telling him that my moods were not changing when he called for this months appointment but he kinda brushed it off and asked if I were developing a rash instead...because I was supposed to be raised to 100mgs that day anyways. Idk that kinda irritated me. I’m dreading having to explain to him why I’m not taking the medications anymore and I bet that he’ll say something about my marijuana use (which Jesus H Christ it was the only thing that helped ease the side effects.)

I’m so frustrated with the way my therapy and psychiatric treatment has been going so far. I feel like I have no choice frying my brain mixing all these psych meds that are PAINFUL and unhelpful, and as for therapy? Of course that’s unavailable because of Covid-19. Of fucking course. Can’t go to another facility because I can’t afford anything else."
1112,I'm feeling hopeless from school and for my future.,"As a bit of background I'm in my teens and my mental health has been declining since the last few years. Part of this I feel comes from my grades, but I've been feeling very hopeless about my future as well.

Growing up I've always expected all As from myself which was not difficult to achieve in elementary school. However my new high school is much more difficult and I feel like I'm not good enough compared to my peers.

It's not really because I don't understand the content being taught, I just have very poor self discipline and study skills, and I constantly procrastinate/make excuses so I can do something else more enjoyable. I'll tell myself that I will learn from my experiences and do better the next semester, but I keep on getting worse grades each time. 

I feel like a huge disappointment to myself and my parents, since they expected kind of high of me. Every time I try to go to them for advice, they don't really understand and all they tell me is to study more and work harder. I don't exactly blame them since their school experience and childhood was a lot different from now, and that's probably all they know.

In addition to all of this, I'm growing more and more worried about my future and finding a job/being able to afford things like food and housing. I still have several years (currently in high school) until I really need to care but current events have been making me very worried about what the world will be like by then. 

Any advice? Thanks for your time reading."
1113,ECT experiences?,"So I (21f) was diagnosed with Bipolar 1, PTSD and ADHD just under a year ago. I've been in therapy for 3 years (CBT, EMDR), done residential treatment, seen 6 different psychiatrist and had 7 hospitalizations in the last year, all but one being for suicide attempts/suicidal ideation. I've been on 20+ medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants etc.) over the last year, and none have seemed to work. I struggle mostly with being depressed/suicidal and not so much the mania. Should I consider ECT? I'm just feeling really hopeless and could use some advice?"
1114,I need help,"This is my first post on Reddit and will probably be my last, I'm a bit nervous but I think it's about time I post. I'm 14 and have been having really intense mood swings I could be happy for a minute and then crying the next all it really takes is one tiny thing to ruin my day, today I was in the middle of watching something and got an ad I almost threw my phone across the room in a fit of anger and started crying. I feel pretty embarrassed to talk about this but at this point I couldn't care less."
1115,I have people I care about,"I have more people I care about than I ever have all thanks to the new job I started around 8 months ago. I was very depressed and had more suicidal thoughts than ever before this job. I’ve had a lot of shitty things happen in my life that would take too long to talk about but the main thing was my mom dying unexpectedly 4 years ago and a job that was terrible. I worked at a spectrum call center for billing for 2 years. I got screamed at 80-100 calls a day. If a customer was upset over something completely out of my control (like pricing or technical issues) I would still get in trouble and a bad rating because I couldn’t make them happy WHICH WAS NOT POSSIBLE. Around the end of me working there I cried all the time and even thought of hurting myself to get to be able to leave work. It was just horrible. I had no friends I was close too as I don’t make friends easy. I have a very very dark perverted sense of humor and I’m a girl so I mainly end up being friends with guys. I’m very uncomfortable about emotional things like saying I love you and I don’t like hugs or people touching me. After starting this new job, I have become very good friends with 2 of the guys which ended up letting me become friends with their friends and now I have a group of about 6 guys I’m super close with now and it feels amazing. Especially one guy. He’s 50 years old but definitely has the mentality of a 12 year old and we are literally the same. He has even said that we are kindred spirits. I feel comfortable telling him how much I love him and how much he means to me. We joke around constantly and always laugh non stop around each other. He’s fixed a bunch of things around my house. He reminds me of my dad so much I really wish he’d adopt me lmao. I love his family and he invites me for dinner and I went to his families Christmas party. I just love all of these guys so much and I’ve never been this close to this many people. It feels amazing and my new job is amazing and I haven’t had a suicidal thought in about 5 months now and that’s the longest I think in my entire life. It’s really weird when I think about it because I’ve never been so content with my life before. I’m still depressed definitely but nowhere near what I was and I’m excited every day to go to work and see them and to come home and play Xbox with them every night for hours. Just Saturday me and the one guy stayed up till 2 am playing modern warfare drunk as hell. I just love them all so much and I never thought having friend like this could help my mental health so much and it feels amazing."
1116,"I feel like I'm losing my mind, I just need to let it all out.","Throwaway because I don't want people I know to see how pathetic I am.

I'm F14 so it probably seems like all of this is just bullshit, hell it probably is, but what does it matter, you're all internet strangers anyway.

Edit: This is really just a big depressing story of my life. Its probably really boring.

Okay, when I was 10, I went through a really bad phase. I started an internet page where I did some, well, inappropriate stuff for my age. Not like sexual but like pretending like I was involved with drugs to seem ""cool."" Listening to the kind of music that someone who is ten shouldn't even know about. I was very ""dirty-minded"" around my friends. It was pretty much the typical thing for that age, ""hahaha the yogurt looks like cum lol so funny."" Well, that summer we had my cousin (14M), living with us. He technically wasn't my cousin, he was my mom's boyfriend's nephew. Mom's boyfriend wasn't really the best person, but that doesn't matter atm. Anyway, he was sharing a room with me, and he slept on the bottom bunk on my bed. My mom always saw him as an angel, a super cool person. I was jealous, but I looked up to him too. My mom would always make jokes that I had a crush on him. I didn't, really, I didn't. I don't even know where she got that from its just ugh. I made the same kind of jokes with him that I did with my friends. That was a terrible mistake. He started to return the jokes. Except they weren't quite jokes. I was really uncomfortable, and I started to get filled with regret. One night, he wanted to ""play a game,"" If I lost I would have to suck him off. I really wanted to say no, I swear I did, but I was so fucking stupid and pathetic and scared. I obviously lost...

This continued for weeks. It stopped for a week when he promised me for the second time that this would be the last time. But the day before he would leave my house. The day before I would finally rid myself of him and not have to be afraid anymore. My parents left us home alone. And it happened again. I wanted to say no, but I was too damn scared. This time he didn't just want me to suck it. No, he wanted more. I'm sure you can guess, so I don't see a point in explaining. He left the next day.

I convinced myself that what happened was ok. I brainwashed myself into being happy about what happened, even though I truly wasn't. Two years later, my mom and her boyfriend (who were together for five years) broke up. Now it was never a healthy relationship. Ever since my little sister was born, they were really distant. I had a really bad relationship with both of them, so I would go over to someone else's house to get away. Anyway, now it was just me and my mom living in the house. We didn't get along at all (we still don't) and all we did was argue. We tried getting counseling but it did absolutely nothing. Around this time, I got an account on an online game. (my online account that had the inappropriate stuff was long gone, eg. my mom broke my phone in half.) The people there were really kind. They were my only real friends. As I talked to them, I dropped some of my vulgar traits and started to develop some morals. However, I lied about my age. I mean, It's impossible to be respected on the internet when you're 12, so I said I was 14. I didn't see the harm because I didn't think I was going to become so close to them. Fast forward to January of that year. Someone new joins, let's call him Tony (not his real name). I develop a crush on him, and he obviously does the same. We start talking privately on a different source. And now I have an internet boyfriend. I really enjoyed talking to him, and he changed me a lot, and for the better. My mental health skyrocketed, I've never felt so happy. My parents caught us, and same for him at some point, and for obvious reasons, I was in big trouble. We still continued to talk though.

Fast forward to November of last year. (I'm 13 now but I'm lying and saying that I'm 16.) He can't talk as much anymore because he is really busy. With the temporary high dying off, I start getting really guilty again. I've lied about a lot. I told him about the thing with my cousin (He's the only one I told.) But I changed the story trying to sugarcoat. I felt like absolute shit. I stopped talking to other people in the friend group because I was ""bored of them."" SO THAT MADE ME GUILTY. I literally hate everyone at my school, so I really don't have irl friends. The friends I did had annoyed me more than anything. Now I ghosted my online friends, and I'm too pathetic to try to talk to them again because I'm afraid they'll be mad. Now mid-Febuary of this year hits, and I'm having a mental breakdown. I realized how much of a fucked up piece of shit I am. My boyfriend who is now 17, thinks I'm 16. Things had gotten sexual which I was okay with at first, matter a fact I encouraged it. But now I had regret. I tried to ghost him but failed. But then I finally lost it and cut it. Didn't even say anything. I know that I'm the asshole. And I know that he's definitely hurting. I hate myself for it. The next week, schools close. Yay now I have literally nobody.

This wasn't what this was originally going to be. But what I was trying to throw in there was that I have trouble with my eating and my anger. I've had these issues since the beginning of this wall of text. They're getting worse. I just finished a binge eating episode and I feel so guilty. I don't want to believe I have an eating disorder. I don't want to be the victim. I just wish I could be happy. I'm considering just not eating, that would end the guilt, right? But I know that's bad, and it would just lead to more guilt.  I also find myself lashing out on my little sister. Shes only 5. Why am I doing this? Why am I so fucked up? I want to stop, but I don't know how to. I had one friend left, my cat. But now we have to move and I can't even keep her. 

Theres a lot of other things on my mind. Like how all my mom does is scold me and call me stupid, but then use me for bragging rights. I have to move into my grandma's house, so I won't have to deal with it anymore, I feel like shit for feeling happy about that. I'm pretty much convinced that I am shit. But yeah, if anyone cared enough to read all of that, well good for you I guess. I thought I would feel better by ranting but I only feel worse."
1117,Explosions in chest,"I struggle with a lot of intrusive thoughts and impulses. Normally I don't follow through with them (except for sh) just for the good of the people around me, but I've noticed that they kind of build up in my chest to the point where I can feel the physical energy vestering and building up inside of me. I feel like I'm exploding from the inside. I don't have any way to relieve it because everything I can think of is violent. do any of you experience this kind of sensation and do you know of any ways to use this energy?"
1118,Do you have a recurring nightmare?," I have a nightmare where I dream that I return to my school, I see my old classmates and my feelings of shame and regret reappear, in my dream I always end up crying somewhere far away where nobody can see me and nobody can judge me.  It is a horrible feeling and every time I wake up I end up with a feeling of emptiness and sadness, it may not sound like a nightmare but it is certainly something I do not want to dream about.  He created that I am traumatized with my experiences that I had at school."
1119,"I'm feeling empty, literally. I'm scared..."," 

Today was a weird day. Everything was going good, like the other quarantine days, kinda boring, just doing the same things, until I started feeling literally empty. When I say 'literally', **I really mean it**. I just felt like **my chest was empty**. Something was missing. I just wanted to get in my bed and cry. It's hard to explain...

I had already felt this before once, like 9 months ago, but that time was much **worse**. That time I had this feeling for 4 days, approximately. It was something **awful and scary**.

The only thing that i know that that happened both times before i felt this way, is that I couldn't get something. Let me explain this. I think I get this feeling because I want something and I can't get it, specifically a relationship with someone. I see beautiful people that attract me, and I kinda fall in love with them, and I get sad because I will never have something with them.

I hope you can help me, tell me if you felt this way before, or anything you´d like to tell me. Any comment will be helpful because i struggled with these situations by myself, and I need to talk with someone about this."
1120,Why does my existence feel physically painful in a way I don't know how to explain?(F/25/CAN),"There's just a constant deep emptiness in my chest that is painful in a way people can't seem to relate to. The current world issues absolutely aren't helping.
If you have any tips to combat these feelings, I'd greatly appreciate it"
1121,My personality seems to be gone completely,For some reason for about a year or so I've completely lost the ability to be funny and I feel like I've gotten much less intelligent. Humor has always been one of my only positive character traits so for that to be stripped away from me without any discernible cause has done a number on my mental health and caused me great distress. I was wondering if anybody can offer me some advice or some insight on how something like this can even happen.
1122,I need to move on.,"I need to accept that I might not ever be declared sane again. And I need to accept my current situation in order to cope with it. That's the only way I am going to get better or have a fulfilling life. The question is how do I do it? 

Years ago I was diagnosed with an psychosis and after that my life hasn't been the same as before. But instead of dwelling on what could have been I should try to focus on what I can do to have a better future. I know this because I've managed to go through some hardships in life before my psychosis. I just don't really know how to move on from such a life changing experience."
1123,Can't get motivated,"I've struggled with this for years now but I can't get motivated with anything and I don't know why. I've spent years being yelled at by parents and teachers that I need to try harder but I just can't do it. I think about how psychopaths are incapable of having empathy. I feel like that almost, like the part of my brain that's supposed to be motivated is just missing."
1124,I do not even know what my mental health condition is anymore..,"I tried telling my family about my mental health but they say its just nothing and its all just me overreacting. But its been too much since this happened especially i can't identify what is the condition of my mental health...

I tend to have this frequent panic attacks, hallucinations, don't know the values of life and its meaning, i keep too many secrets from anybody around me so much that i tend to get anxious when they told me regarding about it. I don't even know what to react in most situations since everytime i react, people say that i intervene so much in other people's businesses so i tend to keep neutral or lowkey on everyone and everything.. My excessive perfectionism sometimes ruins my school life so much it tends to make me panic when doing a school activity... 

I tried talking to a friend once but did not understand on what i've been going through right now so no use, i don't know what to do in life now. I do have a social life but sometimes, i just lost my interest doing so"
1125,i feel empty,"
i feel as though i can’t do anything positive i literally get bored of everything really quickly i just want to sleep most of the time i don’t really talk to any one and i feel like nobody except my family would care if i died"
1126,I'm having this killer thoughts in my mind and its been driving me crazy alot..,"Sometimes, when i see people around me, i feel i like i wanna kill them all even though i don't have intnetions of killing them. But its not just there because this killer thoughts sometimes have caused me trouble like accidentally punching a friend out of control, being clumsy that it affects other people so badly, they tend to go off me... I just don't understand this life now. I feel like i wanna be a murderer or serial killer even tho i dont really have plans or intentions  of doing it.."
1127,I got triggered and went into a coma-like state,"I don’t know where else to post this and I’m still a little bit shaken up so sorry if this is messy.

This evening I was watching a tv show that is usually quite lighthearted, and then suddenly a scene happened that seriously triggered me. I didn’t realise it at first it took about 10 or so minutes to kick in, and then I just sort of faded out of reality. I couldn’t focus on the screen I kept looking “through” it and I had to go over to the couch to lie down.

I can’t really explain what happened next, but it felt like I took a load of drugs or something; my thoughts were erratic and non-sensical, I couldn’t move any part of my body except for my eyes and the lighting and shapes in the room kept morphing and changing. It felt like I couldn’t feel anything, and even though my hand was rested on my stomach I couldn’t actually feel it there, nor could I feel my other hand covering my face. 
I thought maybe this had lasted 15 minutes tops, but then I got a snapchat from my brother and my screen lit up on my chest and i could see from the time that I’d actually been there for over an hour, completely unable to move, speak or form a coherent thought. 

This freaked me out and I somehow mustered the strength to move my fingers to lift my phone, but it fell onto the couch beside me, and by the time I was able to move that hand to grab it another 30 minutes had passed. Luckily my housemate came downstairs and I could communicate with her by typing on my phone, but my right thumb was the only thing I could move and I didn’t even have the strength to press the home button (Still got the IPhone 6) and I kept “slipping” from reality. My lips were glued shut and it felt like my jaw had been wired closed. Even moving my eyes to look at her was exhausting. 

It took maybe 40 minutes to get me out of this state but I’m still zoning in and out and I look and feel like I haven’t slept in a week. This was a terrifying experience and I have no idea what it actually was. For context, I have been battling depression and anxiety this past year and am on antidepressants, but I finished CBT last week because I’d made so much improvement and was starting to be happy again. That’s why this was such a shock. 

Does anyone have any insight into what could have happened to me? And why did I go into a coma-like state after being triggered? 

Sorry this is so long but I would appreciate any insight whatsoever x thank you for reading"
1128,Trauma?,"I don't know if im suffering from some type of trauma or not but i've come to realize that i dont like to express my feelings too much. I dont like crying in public because i guess it makes me seem weak and i dont truly express how i feel if someone made me really upset. Growing up i had older siblings that would sometimes make fun of me when i'd cry about something they view as ""stupid"" i was very sensitive when i was little and i guess their teasing got to me. Most people usually sees me as a calm and laid back person on the outside but i feel like somethings wrong with me because i just cant fully express myself. Sorry about the long post."
1129,How do I talk to my university professors about how my mental health effects my work?,"WARNING: self harm mentioned

Some context: I was diagnosed with anxiety (but also displayed symptoms of depression) when I was 15 and never really got any better at dealing with it, but got ""discharged"" (can't think of a better way to put it, but basically my therapist thought I was ready to stop going to therapy and 15 year old me hated confrontation/inconveniencing people so didn't ask to keep going) after going to therapy throughout the summer holidays. Admittedly I was ""better"" but it was mostly because I'd just spent 3 months away from the main source of my anxiety which was school. 

Now I am in my first year of uni and because of a nationwide lockdown all my classes have moved online and students, like me, who lived on campus have had to leave as well. During the lock down my mental health has really deteriorated and I'm struggling to find the motivation to function, I barely eat and I'm pretty sure the only reason I haven't started self harming again is because I've moved back in with my parents and they would notice. I have been trying to think of a way to reach out to my professors about work due over the next two weeks (two 500 word essays, a 1500 word essay and a quiz) for a while now but I have no clue how to start. And to top it off apparently there was an error with my school email, meaning I've missed about a weeks worth of updates (mostly resources we were supposed to read) and the first lecture (classes started online today).

So now I have 3 professors to email and attempt to explain this too, while also asking for help/extensions on my essays and I don't know where to start. Any advice would be appreciated."
1130,Having trouble leaving bed,"Im not sure if this is the right subreddit to go to but i’ll try. Ever since quarantine happened i have been having too much trouble getting out of bed. From what it seems like i dont want to do things, like eat, or interact with my family. Is there any advice on how to overcome this?"
1131,Asking for some help.,"So, for context. I have/had this friend for upwards of a year and a half now. We met online, and always have known each other online. Our relationship peaked last summer, with both of us developing mutual crushes (Although it never got farther than that). But, over time, he changed and we liked each other less.

He eventually blocked me after I lashed out for him ignoring what I sent him about a roleplay server for a week or two; Even after apologizing (as he had problems I didn't know about at the time, relating to school). But, a few days ago, he unblocked me and we became ""friends"" again.

That is, until today. I sent him a 'joke' (Which was disgusting and I do NOT know why I shared it with him after one of my partners sent it to me), he said I made him uncomfortable, that he was done, and blocked me in the message directly after the 'joke'.

I know I fucked up big time. Please, can I have some tips on how I can get over this?

&amp;#x200B;

(Also, this is the joke. CW for Pedophelia.)  
&gt;!""Hey all, Scott here, and oh boy I sure do regret not asking for that girl's age before she asked for my V-card""!&lt;

It's extremely disgusting and idfk how it was funny to me."
1132,Am I depressed?,"It seems I've recently changed completely, dont get me wrong I have my bad days but the past month has just seemed me being sad the whole time... it feels like a heavy feeling all around my body physically and mentally, normally if I'm having a bad day I could easily put a smile on my face and pretend to be happy mainly for others and maybe even turn my day around but recently it's almost like i cant even fake smile I just seem to be having a none expression and look dead in the eyes. I'm also going really quiet too I'm not being social with people like I normally would because I feel like I dont have the energy to. Work is really getting to me too to the point where I'm hoping every day that I get fired for something.

I just dont know where this is coming from but I just feel horrible recently and feel like everyone hates me."
1133,Research Material on Delusional disorder,"Hi, please share authors and titles on delusional disorder. I am writing my experience with the illness in a book and would like to understand the psychology, biological and neurology or anything else that is related to the illness. Thanks"
1134,Break up and depression,I don’t know what to do anymore with my life. i can’t stop the tears from flowing no matter how hard i’m trying. I just vented to my girlfriend about how i wanted to kill myself and how i’m so depressed lately and she decided to break up with me because she was depressed too and didn’t want a boyfriend. There’s nothing left for me anymore. My friends don’t want any part of me and the one person i cherished with everything i had from money to the deepest love i’ve ever given someone shattered me heart when it’s already down. My thoughts of suicide are higher than they ever have been in my life. I don’t know how much more i can take.
1135,I’m on the verge of giving up.,"I’ve been looking for my first job since last summer and I used to not take rejection to heart because I knew I’d find something eventually. That was until my grandfather got into an argument with me, accusing me of still being unemployed because I wasn’t trying. Now, I can’t help but take every rejection as a personal attack because I flashback to that argument. Even after trying my absolute hardest since January, I’ve had almost no luck. It doesn’t help with not only the quarantine, but my uncle is the kind of person who can score three job offers in a week, and I can’t help but compare myself to him and feel inferior. I have no idea what I’m doin or how I can improve my chances. The outdated advice I’ve gotten from family hasn’t helped either. I’m more stressed out than I’ve been in a long time, I feel like a failure."
1136,Can't seem to read my own thoughts lately.,"I'm having trouble being able to tell others what I'm thinking. Like I just genuinely don't know. Like I used to but now I can't. I seem to just feel like I'm floating through everything. I can barely concentrate on schoolwork or complex tasks but I can still do things on my own and function alright. Feels like I'm in a cloud. Is this a possible problem with my anxiety meds, or is it something medication or therapy could help?"
1137,I just saw a video of someone getting beheaded on Instagram. I'm scared and it's running through my head. What should I do?,"I was on Instagram and I saw a video from an online ""friend"" I guess of mine had posted a video. I checked it out and it was a video of someone getting beheaded. They've posted other things like this, so I reported their account. Does anyone have advice on how I should ""deal""  with seeing this?"
1138,Anyone need an ear,I'm feeling well these past several days and wanted to thank the community for all your help over the years. I'll still be here as I heal and as I can help.
1139,Stress and mental illness explained,"I found this very easy description how to explain what stress and mental illness is like

*""You could say that stress our a mental illness forces us to withdraw money from the savings account (energy reserves) to cover an unexpected expense. As long as the savings account is full, we remain healthy. But if we stress or suffer more than we have coverage for, it will have negative health effects that we don't afford.""*"
1140,Helping someone severely depressed?,"This is going to be a weird one, but I really, really need advice on this situation. Recently, this kid from high school I used to talk to reached out after not speaking for over a year. I never really knew him well at all but we had hooked up once and were kind of talking for the few months before that. It always felt like he took it more seriously than I did. After it happened, we never spoke again. 

Until last week when he randomly snapchatted me saying that I ruined his life and I was a bitch. I never answered and just blocked him, but the next day he DMed me on Instagram apologizing and saying that I didn’t do/wasn’t any of those things he said, he’s just really depressed and his family is fucked. I know this is bad, but I just ignored it because I haven’t talked to him since high school and I’m 20 now, a sophomore in college. He kept DMing me since then saying that he just wanted to talk to someone. Then tonight he texts me asking if he should kill himself. 

Now this is where I’m conflicted. Obviously, I don’t want him to do that, but I just feel like he’s forcing his problems on me when I genuinely don’t feel like I know him well enough at all for them to 1) be my problem, as awful as it sounds, and 2) even be able to help him. I would just feel HORRIBLY if he hurt himself but I don’t think I can deal with this since I’m the only person he has talked to within this year that wasn’t his “dysfunctional” family. I’m rambling, but it’s making me nervous that I’m the only person in his life that can apparently help him and if he does something to himself, it’ll be my fault. 

Help please! Urgent! Thank you!"
1141,My anxiety/depression is annoying my friends. What do I do?,"I'm a socially anxious extrovert who is normally home just enough to sleep and clean. I live alone, I have no pets and my normal tricks to relive anxiety/depression will violate isolation restriction laws / are closed. I'm not ok. I'm crying myself to sleep most nights. Crying while working (wfh). Crying while not working.

My mental health has been declining over the last few years related to work, and then also included the breakdown of a romantic relationship. Right now my closest friends are my work friends but they're so annoyed with me.

1. I'm very open and started leaning on them more with the breakdown of my relationship, one friend saw me a little bit like a project to fix, but after years of their ""fixing"" I'm still not ok.
2. Over the last few years I've felt unfairly treated at work, they think I should just stop focusing on that and move on but I'm not and they don't agree with other things I feel about work. They also don't think I do enough to fix my own problems. 
3. I have a tendency to bury my head in the sand and so things that are stressful or overwhelming I procrastinate like mad, which is now starting to affect my deliverables and how I communicate with the customer, which might affect them later. 
4. With some of the work stuff I've found myself putting others down to bring myself up and I cringe afterwards every-time. I feel super shitty about it but it feels like a self defense mechanism, an automatic reflex that I struggle to control. Years ago I took the fall for a lot of shitty work by my friends and colleagues and I'm still paying for it.

My friends aren't perfect but they're genuinely nice people who care. They're right to be annoyed with me but I don't have the energy to fix it. I don't know what to do. I have to just try harder but i'm already trying pretty hard. It feels hopeless. I feel so alone. I'm not a nice person and everyone is finding out right now. I don't have anyone to lean on. I can't find my mental health plan to go see a therapist. The wait is 3 months and I've never had much success talking to therapists anyway."
1142,Combatting burnout during quarantine,"As the title suggests, I'm feeling extremely burnt out at the moment. I work at least 50 hours a week, usually about 7-5:30 in the commerical maintenance sector, which means I still have to go to work as I have not been told to stay at home by the UK government. I have suffered from anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, but pre corrona virus I found ways to cope with it pretty well, favorite activities included gokarting and playing music casually with my band, however since neither of those can be done anymore, and the only thing I seem to do nowdays is work, eat and sleep, I'm exhausted. I coped with the hours before but now I find it so hard to even get out of bed in the morning.
Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can reduce burnout during this time until things (eventually) go back to normal?"
1143,Help with mental illness symptoms,"I just wanted to see if these symptoms I’ve noticed fall in line with anxiety since it’s pretty extreme and I feel like I can’t live life normally.

Usually under stress but pretty much constant since I’m constantly stressed;

• I age regress to ~7 which is right at the age my first traumatic even happened.

• I get extremely moody. I love everyone and feel talkative, think I look good, feel okay, feel secure in my current relationship, eat healthy, shower, exercise, etc. Within the next hour I could feel the exact opposite. The bad usually lasts longer than the good

• The world around me seems fake, my reflection feels like a different person, everything feels like I’m watching a movie or playing a game. No real emotions just empty.

• I become a “different” person by wearing wigs and doing makeup. I’m aware it’s a form of escapism which I also play video games, watch anime, anything that takes me out of real life. I get depressed when I have to stop or when I can’t do those things.

• I get irrationally upset at the smallest things. Crying, screaming, sitting and staring at a wall for hours. The works.

• Extreme insecurity, being very clingy and emotional, always asking if my boyfriend loves me still, not believing and thinking he’s tired of me etc. This is usually followed by feeling like I’m trapped in the relationship, thinking about other people in a sexual way, feeling bored. Which is then usually followed by extreme guilt and sadness. (I love my boyfriend, I know that and do not act on any of my feelings.)

• Nightmares. The first sign I’m reaching my limit is the nightmares come back. These are followed by paranoia and panic attacks. They go away when I start to feel empty and disconnected.

• I feel like I’ve faked my life, my memories don’t feel like mine, I feel like I have no real personality, that Im not “me”. My reflection isn’t “me”.

• Memory loss. Both short term and long term. I can’t remember anything really.

• Existential crisises, dreading being alive

• Getting extremely agitated, confused and annoyed at loud sounds, bright lights, too much movement etc. makes me really jumpy all the time.

• I hold myself to an extremely high standard. I’m an “attractive” person but I am always striving to be perfect in my own head. This has lead to eating disorders, body dismorphia, self hate but also I know I’m attractive to other people so I think I’m gorgeous at the same time?

• In the lowest time of my life I experienced hallucinations and paranoia for about 4 months. Hasn’t happened since but is always a fear in the back of my mind. 

That’s the gist of it. Sorry it’s long. I have a really long history of traumatic events happening in my life from being emotionally neglected from childhood to multiple rapes and molestations. Anxiety and Bi-Polar disorder run in my family and I’ve been diagnosed with Anxiety and PTSD. Is this all a part of anxiety?"
1144,Can anyone help?,My dad is a big asshole. He rarely is nice and always yells at me and my brothers. It has been happening since we were little (around 8 or 9). He would yell at us for small things like breathing to loudly or not understanding a math problem. And it was super harsh too. Calling us little bitches and fucktards and yelling super super loud. It was really really stressful. Also him and my mom would argue a lot too because my dad was a workaholic and would prioritize work over family. Also my mom got super sick and had to be hospitalized for 3 months when I was eleven. Ever since then my body has a hard time with managing with stress and I feel like something was never right. Could I have some sort of trauma or trauma related disorder?
1145,I’m really tired of feeling nothing at all,"There’s not much to say. I wake up in the morning feeling nothing and go about my day. If I do feel anything I’m usually sad or very irritable. There are times when I want so badly to  lay down and cry my eyes out but I still just feel completely empty inside. It’s incredibly frustrating. I don’t really know why I’m posting this,, I guess I just want someone to hear it."
1146,Feeling suffocated and overwhelmed,"It feels like there’s a weight on my chest that I can’t get rid of. Whenever I try to stay positive my mind gets flooded with a million different triggers because that’s all it’s been used to. Why be happy when it’s going to be short lived? I hate where I ended up in life and I can’t help but see myself as a failure. It also doesn’t help that I work in a toxic environment (ex: one coworker took a picture of another coworker to intentionally embarrass and get her in trouble). Aside from work my personal relationships seem to be crumbling and my nervousness around new people is the highest it has ever been. I don’t know if life is always like this, if I’m being overdramatic, or if there’s some hope of getting rid of this heavy burden."
1147,motor ticks in specific situations,"(im not diagnosed with anything (i haven't had anything checked)).

this has appeared relatively recently, but i keep motor ticking when i get annoyed, anxious, or excited.

some ""triggers"" include stressing about school, thumping/knocking sounds, sharing something funny with my friends, and when my brother makes literally any noise.
i dont know how he manages to be so annoying 24/7.

hElp.

but yeah, my annoyance for the noises increase dramatically when i tic because it just adds to the reason why i hate it..."
1148,just a vent,"i used to think my parents’ divorce didn’t affect me much; i was 8-ish when they split, i’m almost 20 now and i don’t remember it at all so i thought i was good.

my dad and i were driving through our state park and i had said something about the fishermen on the riverbanks, and he tells me about how i used to fish when i was little. like, actually fish, and i apparently got upset that i couldn’t gut and eat what i caught (city laws where we lived at the time). i used to be so active when i was a kid. i played soccer, i did taekwondo, i was a cheerleader (not a *real* one i was like 7, it was like if the ymca had cheerleading teams), i ran around in the woods constantly, i had my own little garden next to my mom’s, i was a competitive swimmer (again, like a kid’s league. but i was part of the competitive group, not the participation group). 

i was such an active kid, i had hobbies and played sports and i was happy. and i was even good at some of them! my mom says she can still see tkd stances when i roughhouse with my brother, and despite being overweight and mostly sedentary i’m still the fastest and strongest person in my family. don’t know how, but i am. 

i guess i’m just bitter because when the divorce came around, all those activities stopped. i know that my parents didn’t mean to take that stuff away, it just kinda got pushed to the back burner because they had bigger things to worry about. i lost access to things i loved doing, and while i’m not blaming my depression and ocd on that, i’m sure having long-term hobbies would have helped me cope better. 

i literally don’t do anything. haven’t since i was a kid. i was in marching band in high school, but i joined up for the gym credit and stuck around because it enabled my weird ocd. i didn’t enjoy it, i was obsessed with it and didn’t know the difference. i don’t have any hobbies or interests and i’m trying to fill that void but nothing is clicking and i can’t focus long enough on anything to enjoy what i’m doing and it’s so frustrating. anything that actually keeps my attention is impractical to do, money-wise and space-wise. 

im pissed that i was cut off from everything i enjoyed doing, while my life was literally being split down the middle, and i didn’t have a chance to try to get back to normal before mental illness beat my ass and i was left with literally nothing to help me get through it."
1149,Why do so many sources deem smartphone usage to be harmful to mental health?,"From doing my own research, many websites and articles say that people tend to be lonelier when they use smartphones too much, or are more susceptible to depression and anxiety with too much smartphone usage. But I believe in many cases, people who use smartphones use them to be LESS lonely. They use them more because they don't talk to as many people in real life as they would online. If that online source of social contact were cut off, they would be much more lonely. Some have social anxiety and find it easier to talk to people online than in real life because it causes much less stress. Surely this is more reason to say that smartphones can really be helpful to mental health? Of course, too much of anything is a bad thing, and if you're using your smartphone instead of caring for physical needs it is a bad thing, but perhaps the reason for choosing your smartphone over yourself is actually something else."

Hi! I’ve been struggling with GAD, MDD, ADHD Combined Type, PPA/PPD, C-PTSD, and PTSD for a while. I’ve been on a whole host of different medications and found out earlier this week that I have Treatment Resistant Depression. 
I’d been taking Klonopin .5 3x/day since having my son in Nov. of 2018 for Postpartum Anxiety. I’d tried Klonopin a year before short term and it brought enough relief for me to get comfortable working in my previous job. 
Well, I saw a psychiatrist a few months later and he decided to keep me on the Klonopin because it was helping me so much with functioning. I (a 120 lb woman) was also diagnosed with ADHD and put on 30 mg of Adderall 2x/day (60 mg total starting out, no working my way up). SSRIs had only caused issues in the past so I was put on an SSNRI called Pristiq which I’ve gained a chemical dependency on and which showed no improvement in my depression symptoms. 

Well, my husband deployed and I went to live in a small town with family where I could not find mental health resources near me for the life of me. I was on the same medication for over 10 months.


Fast forward to now...
Moved back to where my previous psychiatrist is (husband returned from deployment) and I had been on the same medications listed above the entire time I was gone. 
I saw my psychiatrist last week for the first time. He took me off of the Adderall because of the extremely difficult side effects I was experiencing (felt high, not afraid of consequences, jittery, anxious all of the time, severe insomnia, reckless behavior, etc.). He kept me on the Klonopin but bumped it down to 2x/day since I had only been taking it as needed (1-2 times a day, rarely the full 3). I was also kept on Pristiq. He prescribed Ambien 10mg for severe insomnia (5mg does nothing for me), and Prozasin for PTSD nightmares. 
That week and a couple of weeks before I had episodes that my therapist has told me are actually considered flashbacks where I’d go into fight, flight, freeze, or fawn mode. I’d experience severe panic attacks and dissociation. 
I’d also been experiencing memory loss, extreme fatigue, feeling “out of it”, feeling numb, etc. and at my most recent appointment with my psychiatrist he told me the Klonopin was the most likely culprit of those symptoms. So he told me to stop taking the Klonopin and he instead prescribed me Xanax 1 mg 3x/day scheduled. 
I’ve done as instructed and searched everywhere for support but can only find detoxing articles and rehab sites about coming off benzodiazepines. I’m looking for advice on starting Xanax. I’ve been experiencing extreme fatigue, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, and all over just feel like I’m a zombie. I’m wondering if these side effects are normal and if they’ll eventually taper off as I get used to Xanax. I’ve just been struggling to adjust and am not sure why. Whether it’s an adjustment to the Xanax, coming off Klonopin, stopping taking 60mg of Adderall daily, or if it’s the Xanax mixing with my other meds (Pristiq, Ambien, Prozasin, as well as Nexplanon and .175 Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism as I have no thyroid). 

Any help or advice would be appreciated!"
1151,I have to rant about mental issues that I have and I don’t know what they mean.,"I have always been called OCD from my mom and just random people about stupid things that I do but I know having my clothes be a certain way isn’t really what OCD is about. I’ve done some research on the topic because of some thoughts I was having that would not get out of my head that I kept having to check for over and over again looking up things on the internet and killing my brain over. This is kind of the first problem that I’ve had for a while and I just want to know if it’s normal.

I hate when people self diagnose so it’s hard for me to tell people about problems that I’m having because I don’t want them to feel pity for me or think I’m trying to make excuses. 

Another thing I’ve realized about myself is that I work so much better when I have some extreme time restriction placed on me. It’s hard for me to focus or not get upset for example on a painting that I have due for class until it’s the night before and I stay up all night working on it. This has really effected my school now that I’m in college and working on complicated art projects that need way more preparation then a binge working session one night. 

I feel like so much is wrong with me and this probably sounds stupid. I feel so thrown off balance by this corona virus thing and I barely can do my work because I’m so stressed about how much work I have to do. WHAT DO I DO. 

Please let me know if this is just something normal."
1152,constant intrusive memories,"i'm 19 and i came home due to the pandemic over a month ago and have been staying with my family. over the past few weeks i have been working through the realization that i was very often emotionally manipulated and gaslighted as i was growing up, and this has obviously led to a lot of difficult feelings as i begin to realize the way that this has irreparably changed me, the way i see myself, and how i interact with others. this is especially difficult to handle as i am currently living with the individual who caused this harm, even though i am an adult now and i am more aware of ways to guard myself from that mental harm. 

i'm seeing a therapist weekly who has been able to help somewhat with processing all of this, along with other traumatic experiences that have been coming to the surface since being back home, but something that has been more troubling is the constant attack of what i can only explain as ""intrusive memories"". many many times throughout the day i will be suddenly hit with a memory that feels incredibly visceral and overwhelming. my body reacts to these and i will feel myself jolt and tense up, and my brain will fill up with thoughts that are loud and fast and uncontrollable. i feel sick to my stomach and i have to close my eyes as tight as i can for 30-60 seconds and focus on my breathing in order to get them to pass. 

i've had intrusive thoughts before, i think everyone has. but these have been debilitating and happening at least 5 times a day, and even after they pass the feelings of mental exhaustion and the exacerbation of the depression i already have continue to stick around. i don't know if this is something that others can even help with, or if i just need to work it out on my own, but if you have any advice or you have experienced anything similar it would really really help. thanks."
1153,So this happened,Soo. Ive been vomiting for like two hrs for no reason. Feeling like a black out coming. Sooo. I wrote my will and testament in case my manager finds me dead at work in 6 hrs.
1154,I feel more depressed than i ever been. And im alone.,I have an extreme sense a dark energy flowing through every part of my body. A sense of emptiness. Ive been in bed all day. I cant listen to music or watch anything. Nothing i wanna do right now. I feel very suicidal right now. I keep having flashes of killing myself. Can someone please talk to me
1155,Losing Purpose,"Has anyone felt like you’re losing your purpose to live? My work can easily find a replacement for me. I am not that significant to my friends. My best friend and lover betrayed me and easily fell in love with someone, days after our breaking up like what we had was nothing. I can feel that my family can go on life easily even without m. It feels like even if I die right now my life is insignificant."
1156,I’ve been having passive suicidal thoughts,"I have PTSD from being groomed and molested when I was 12 and have been having passive suicidal thoughts lately. Nothing really serious, just the thought of the pain going away is comforting."
1157,Someone at my door at midnight,"The dogs started barking at midnight, so I came downstairs. I saw a person through the window and screamed. Then he rang the doorbell. My parents came downstairs and answered it. It was someone who used to be our neighbor.

Some backstory. My sister and this guy used to be friends when they were little. He had autism spectrum disorder (previously called Aspergers). When my sister was a teenager she diagnosed herself with ASD. One day (when she was an adult) she got fed up with us and decided to move to New York without telling us (this was pretty normal for her). I drove her to the airport and she told me she was going to Iceland (we have family in New York and we were able to confirm that she had contacted them to stay with them).

Earlier in the day we had been going through some old stuff in the basement and found a letter the boy wrote to my sister when they were little kids. It said they should get married when they’re adults. My mom thought it was cute and sent a picture of it to his mom. I think that’s what triggered this event.

When my parents answered the door, he told them that my sister was in trouble because she was doing the same thing he did. For a second I was really concerned something had happened to my sister, until I heard more of the conversation. I didn’t hear all of it, but I heard my dad ask if he had driven here, making me think it was a bit of a drive (I don’t remember where he lives. For some context, he’s about 31). He talked about clocks, information entropy, and asked if he could have the love letter back. My dad told him to go home and the guy said he would sleep in his car.

After he left my dad told me he thinks the guy is having a psychotic episode. My mom called his mom and she told us that he was very sick mentally, and that he probably wasn’t even aware of the pandemic.

So I turned on the house alarm (I think he’s harmless, but it makes us feel safer), and right now he’s probably outside our house in his car. Don’t know what his current living situation is, but I’m hoping his mom will be able to convince him to seek help."
1158,"Mental Health, Journaling, &amp; Covid-19 survey for a passion project","Hello! Me and my friends decided to take on a passion project while we're all sheltering in place, and we wanted to focus on mental health and the impact Covid-19 is having.  There's an emphasis on journaling in our survey but we are open to hearing out everyone!

Our goal is to create a product that can hopefully contribute to improving mental health, even if it's a small impact.  

Thanks a bunch! Survey link: https://forms.gle/DZHnrFATbszUXSmX8

side note: this post seemed a bit impersonal so I wanted to say more :) I've personally struggled with a roller coaster of a mental health journey for as long as I can remember.  So I've been there, but I haven't been there during a situation like this.  I really can't fathom what you all are experiencing, but I want to understand so I can help those around me and my community, even if it's only one or two people.  Thank you again for your time, we  really appreciate it! 

and if you have any questions, please feel free to message me!"
1159,I have a friend that is about to suicide. His situation Is delicated and idk what should i do. Help please.,Help me.
1160,Why did I feel powerful after leaving a toxic relationship?,"I got hurt by a crush last February. 

For some reason, I thought it was the beginning of finding something real. Since then, though, I have just been in one long depressive episode. 

Last July, my best friend resigned from work, and we don't live near each other. So now I have no-one. 

I tried talking to girls for about a month after what happened, but I gave up on that. From my heartbreak, I have just been thrown into the deep end. I have to build a life from scratch.

Why do people think that leaving a toxic relationship is a good thing? 

People say that it's a learning experience. Well this experience has taught me everything I need to know... 

Even if my life changes dramatically tomorrow morning, there's no victory in it."
1161,I don’t know what to do and I’m so scared.,"I’ve been feeling suicidal but not to the point where I’m gonna do anything but it’s always in the back of my mind.
I told my therapist and he asked if I think I should get a evaluation in a mental hospital. I’m honestly too scared to go because I’ve been to 2 before in high school and it just made things worse.

I told my therapist I don’t want to be evaluated and that I felt safe. I do feel safe I won’t do anything because of fear of doing so. But lately I’ve been having constant anxiety where I cannot even take deep breaths without my chest hurting or go a day without crying out of no where.

I’m thinking maybe I should go to do a eval but I’m scared it would disappoint my parents and we won’t have money to pay for it..

I just don’t know what to do and my anxiety is getting worse everyday. I dunno."
1162,"When I smoke weed, my inner voice gains total control.",It’s not a good one either. Does anyone else relate?
1163,I don’t know where I am,"I feel like I’m standing in an empty street in a foreign city I don’t know. I know how I got here, but I don’t know where I am. I don’t know where to go. There’s signs everywhere but I can’t read them. Everything is in some language. I could go in all sorts of directions, but I don’t know which one to take. I could ask for directions, but people are all just walking too fast around me in every direction, impossible to flag down. And I don’t think I could speak their language anyway.

And the worst part is that the longer I stay in this city, the more I start to forget what the outside world was like. I knew which directions to go when I was out there, but I don’t know where to go now."
1164,Can you guys please help me out here? This is absolutely killing me.,"Hi. I made this throwaway account to look for help on an issue thats plaguing my mind. I’m 17, a dude, and haven’t been to school in around a month due to the quarantine shutting down schools.

Sometime back in around February, a student got moved from another class into my class with me and all of my friends. He’s not a bully, but he’s extremely cocky, and will basically throw anyone under the bus if he can get away free. He doesn’t do much other than copy and be a nuisance to the people he sits around. He’s an asshole but he doesn’t physically hurt anyone or anything like that. 

Recently, I’ve been having this issue thats been killing me and making my everyday life terrible. You know when you play a song, that used to be your ex’s favorite song? And you can’t stand to listen to it anymore because it reminds you of your ex? This is much similar to the issue I’m having now. Whenever I’m doing something, whether it be watching a show or whatever, If a random thought pops up into my head that reminds me of him, I instantly start hating the show as it consistently reminds me of that asshole. For example, If I’m listening to music and this random thought just happens to trigger, my mind for some reason instantly wants to turn the song off because now it’ll forever be associated with the thought that I’m reminded of this dick.

This overthinking is making me literally hate everything and its making it impossible for me to enjoy anything anymore. For some unknown reason, my mind just does this. It instantly connects whatever I’m doing to me being reminded of this asshole.

Does anyone know how to stop these thoughts? How to stop my brain from doing this unnecessary garbage? Any help would be appreciated. I’m feeling extremely unmotivated and I feel like I hate everything now. I just cant get this asshole out of my head. 

Any help would be appreciated... I’m sorry for the long read. Maybe me saying this will actually help me a little bit, I’m getting it off my chest to someone atleast. Really, any help or support is much appreciated. Schools officially ending soon and maybe the fact that I’ll never see him again will finally stop this torment... but I really, really need some help with those. I feel like a mess. An overthinking mess."
1165,"When I told the first ER I went to that I have General Anxiety Disorder, they dismissed my concerning medical symptoms and missed the fact I have SEVERE BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA from COVID-19","The other day I took a trip to the hospital because I was having BAD  chest pains and concerning symptoms such as: shallow breathing, and intense buzzing and tingling throughout my entire body, and very bad dizziness. I could barely speak or walk when it was at its worst. That whole week I had COVID like symptoms (fever, sore throat, dry cough,  extreme tiredness), but when it reached its peak I had to go the ER.  They asked me originally if I took any medication - so I told them I  took a low dose of an antidepressant for my general anxiety disorder. As soon as I told the nurse this, she left me alone in the room (barely checking on me) when I felt like I was going to collapse. When she came in, I pointed to my vitals with concern - she scoffed and said ""yeah, of  course,  your oxygen is low and your heart rate is 125 bpm. you are  working yourself into a fit!"" I wasn't hyperventilating, I was just  breathing more quickly because every breath I took was shallow. I tried to tell her I was nervous about the buzzing, the buzzing didn't happen after me being nervous. Then the doctor came in and just said: ""you just  had a panic attack you are fine, Do you need us to hook you up with a  therapist?"" I tried to explain to him I never had this bad of chest pain and uncontrollable shaking/tingling in my entire body and my vision blacking out from it. He just smiled and said ""yeah you might have  COVID, stay home, get plenty of rest and remember to try your best not to panic!"" the thing is...I knew chest pain was a serious symptom of COVID,  and I get panic attacks from time to time but never experience burning/stabbing chest pain like that and that WEIRD BODILY SENSATION. I  begged the doctor to not discharge me and stay to look at my vitals.  Because when the nurse left me alone my oxygen saturation got to 76 -  and it supposed to be 92 or higher! I wanted to show him how it fluctuated, but since the last reading said 92 ""I was fine"" I went home and the next day the burning got SO SO bad in my lungs. Every time I  would inhale even lightly I had SHARP, STABBING PAIN, the dizziness got  way worse I couldn't walk, I had a HIGH fever, and genuinely felt like I  was on my death bed. Every time I exhaled there would be a noticeably  loud crackling sound my boyfriend could even hear. I also started to cough up blood. I went to another ER, and I chose to not mention my anxiety diagnosis and they took me SO much more seriously. They decided to actually do detailed testing on me (blood tests, CT scan, urine  tests) not just the old fashioned x-ray and stethoscope. They found an  abnormality in my blood from BACTERIA in my bloodstream. They found my lungs were dangerously very filled with phlegm and fluid in the CT Scan.  They showed me the picture and said it is very clear it is a bad  ""COVID-19 Bacteria Induced Pneumonia Case"" just by seeing how blocked my lungs were I was so terrified. Luckily, immediately after they  instantly put me on VERY STRONG ANTIBIOTICS through an IV to try to help  me as soon as possible. They told me when that tingling happened, my body was reacting to the lack of oxygen from all the gunk in my lungs.  They said it was pretty severe for my age, but they were going to do  what they could to help me. Even now that I am on an inhaler and strong  antibiotics I still have difficulty breathing (but I know that if I  never went back to the hospital and listened to the other ER that said I  was just panicking, it could have been much worse - I could have died)  It makes me so sad how biased those doctors were towards my mental illness. But I just want to say to anyone with scary medical symptoms  (who is not getting taken seriously by doctors due to your anxiety diagnosis) PLEASE keep trying to get help. Not all doctors will dismiss you. If you feel there is something genuinely wrong, don't stop looking for treatment until you get the help you need!!"
1166,I notice being mentally ill seems to be an excuse for shitty behavior. Why? How?,Confused.
1167,I don't know what to do,"As some of you know this is the time that people are being accepted into uni. I'm not one of those people, all five of my offers have turned me down, not because my personal statement was bad or my grades weren't good enough but because courses were full and one uni just didn't want me. Ontop of that there's this whole quarantine, and because of it combine with the stress of being turned down for all my options I missed the deadline for some coursework that was really important. When all of this happened at once I ended up breaking down and going slightly mental to my girlfriend over text (Not mental as in angry but mental as in everything I said didn't make sense) and i havent heard back from her in two days. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to tell my mum because I'm scared she'll  get angry or disappointed in me. I can't explain what's happened to my teachers because they'll just dismiss it as an excuse and won't listen. I had plans for the next decade or so, I'd planned it out and I like to stick to plans cause I'm slightly autistic. It feels like my worlds ending because I can't see a way to recover from this. Only my closest friend and girlfriend know, they say there will be ways around it but honestly, I don't think I have the effort anymore. I've been through a lot and idk thats probably something common you hear on this sub-reddit.  I feel like my problems are small compared to some on here but even so I don't feel like I have the willpower to continue.  

I know this will probably be buried under people with much more important or worse problems than me but if even one person can offer some advice or something idk how I could thank you."
1168,Shielding behaviors versus inner subconscious,"So I’m not sure how to even explain this but I have a bad habit of using outer shielding behaviors in comparison to my nature.

Deep down I am really sensitive, anxious, timid, and someone who wants to be vulnerable and open. But at some point in my childhood in changed.

I began to become very accusatory, insecure, and generally using toxic behaviors cover up all this vulnerability. 

As a child I use to cry a lot, think a lot, and act very shy. I was just a more quiet and and scared person but I also had this confidence and positivity underneath when I felt safe.

So the bottom line is, I don’t understand why I still continue to be negative, and harsh all in an effort to hide how o really feel. I had a hard dad and most of my family bicker a lot and on top of that I had a lot of people push me as an outcast when I was young.

My guess right now is I’ve just been kinda beat down when I was young so I use this as a unhealthy defense mechanism because every time I was vulnerable people shamed me for it because I am suppose to be a manly dude. I am 18 year old semi bulky guy so I think a lot of people were caught off guard with me being so soft ina accordance to my appearance.

But I dont know, it’s really ruins my state of mind and if anyone has any input I would greatly appreciate it.

Tl:dr: I often end up using toxic behaviors to cover up vulnerabilities. Even though I recognize they are toxic and want to express my real self underneath the bad behaviors. Asking for help on what this could be and how to change it."
1169,How would I bring this up to my psychiatrist..,"I want to bring this up to my psychiatrist but I just don’t know how to..

Throughout my entire life, I have always struggled with my weight. I’ve always been under weight but ate normally, but never weighed over 120lbs until just last week. I am happy because I’ve always wanted to gained weight deep down. 

I do eat but it’s very disordered or unorganized. I will admit that. 

However, it is very much extremely disordered at this time..and it’s starting to bother me. I thought I could maybe muster through it but it’s been quite awhile and just doesn’t go away.  

There’s a noticeable problem though, where if I cook..usually large family entrées or testing out recipes (teaching myself how to cook basically and exposing my family to new things at home but it is  some what a stress relief and small passion of mine from my childhood) but I never eat more than maybe a few bites myself because deep down..I’m just not truly hungry and often upset or feel guilty about eating my own food or food in general.

I know that the idea and taste of food sounds good but somehow I mentally talk myself out of eating by considering too many options and not knowing or just convincing myself that maybe I just don’t need to eat and it might be better for me not to.

I’m not sure if anyone else has gone through this but it’s very difficult to explain and a bit hard to bring up to family or friends because no one seems to get it without harsh judgment."
1170,mental health,"i’ve dealt with being bullied since 2nd grade i’m in 8th now suppose to be in 9th and it’s still not clearing up. I’ve done all i can. I’ve ignored them, stood up for myself, blocked them, but it still happens. I’ve went homeschooled and nothing has seen to help. Plus family problems, anxiety, i’m stressing myself out. i haven’t got to my work in a month now i can’t sit down and stay down without breaking down. I’ve been to one therapist but she just said “it’ll get better” and “stop stressing” i can’t help myself at all. I’m off my antidepressant ( well secretly went off because my doctor wouldn’t listen to me ) it caused more nightmares and panic attacks but no one listened. It helped so much but the panic attacks and nightmares were just there and it hurt. I’ve been sick but they can’t find anything wrong with me. I always pass out in stressful moments. I’m not in a good situation.. i don’t know what to do or who to run to."
1171,I’m afraid that It’s too late for me to get help,"I have the worst anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and depression ever. I think it stims from PTSD from a childhood experience. It really scares me. I’m afraid that my mind has gotten to the point that it is, and now it’s irreversible and it’ll be impossible for me to be somewhat normal again."
1172,Tried to admit myself and was denied after being medically cleared to go to a psych hospital,They also prescribed me pills after knowing I wanted to kermit
1173,Has anyone ever been to a mental hospital?," 

So I haven’t had to do this before but a councilor I spoke to mentioned b/c I’m not doing very well mentally I should look into care options like finding a councilor, seeing a psychologist and therapy all that stuff. 

But she also mentioned Mental hospitals and advised me to familiarize myself with all my options not just therapy and I could really use some advice, I would like to hear from people who actually went through a mental hospital or looked into it.

Sorry if what I’m asking is confusing, doing research on my options is apart of my HW.

People who attended mental hospitals even only for a few days or a long time what was it like?

Would you recommend going?

Should I only go if it’s my absolute last resort?

Could I keep my phone? what was I allowed to keep? Would any electronics be ok?

Could I bring a sketch book and pencils?

Am I allowed to see friends or will I be isolated and alone?

If my insurance won’t cover it will I be denied care and what did your stay do to your credit?

How much did it cost and was it worth it? did it help you and are you better?

How does getting discharged work? Will I be allowed to leave? 

I want to hear real life experiences from people and you don’t have to tell me why you went, I just want to know if it honestly helped you and was not as scary and abusive like I’ve seen so many people talk about. 

I’m looks up my own research but hearing from others would really help. 

sorry if this is the wrong place to ask too btw, I don't use reddit very often and a lot of time I don't make posts on it."
1174,"I just need to vent, I'm struggling and very much alone","So, I've been struggling for god knows how many years with my mental health, I've gotten into a really bad state before and I keep getting closer and closer to going back there.
I'm actually at work at the moment, about to start, and I can't stop shaking. The anxiety is making me feel nauseous to the point where I feel like I might pass out. I slept horribly and I was plagued with nightmares all night, just like I have been since about a week before the UK went into lockdown.
At the moment, I've never felt so alone. I truly have no one. Back in September one of my friends randomly cut me off because I was ""mean"" to her, and blocked me on everything without a word. I admit, I was mean, but she didn't give me the chance to redeem myself. Let's call her friend A... Back in highschool and until September, me, friend A and friend B were best friends. We were a trio that people knew, and even stuck together within our larger friend groups. I was part of a friendship group of about 9 people and we all did cosplay and hung out together. One of the girls, lets call her C, got on really well with me, but suddenly she started inviting friends A and B places and not inviting me. Then, before I knew it, they had a group chat together, without me, and friends A and B abandoned the group chat that had me in it. I felt so hurt, they didn't even try to hide it. And I could feel myself being replaced again. 
So of course, when September rolled around and I was with A B and C (they all knew how hurt I was by the way) for the weekend, of course I was tense. So maybe I snapped, maybe I was a bit nippy, but I didn't get the chance to apologise. It's like they saw me at a weak point and decided ""Oh, this is an excuse to get rid of her for good!"". I should also mention that friends A and B were always ""jokingly"" mean to me in the past, especially in high school, and it's something we've argued over before, so I think to cut me off like that was pretty hypocritical.
Since then, it's been tense. That's 7 months now! I'm still ""friends"" with friend B, but she hides that fact, never posting about me or talking to me publicly (twitter, discord etc.). Even on my birthday night she never posted any pictures, she pretended it didn't happen, and in the past couple of weeks she's been flat out ignoring me. This is gonna sound dumb but she hurt me the other day by ignoring my request to ""virtually"" hang out on Animal Crossing and 20 minutes later she was playing AC with friend A and C.
It's been a stressful 7 months, avoiding everyone because I KNOW I'm the black sheep of the group, going to parties yet feeling totally isolated. I even saw friend A at a work night out, she asked me if I was okay because she knows I get anxious in those situations and she said she didn't want to stop being friends with me. She told me to go to friend B's party in December and we could talk then, however when I went she ignored me and friend C followed her around all night glaring at me. It was so upsetting, getting my hopes up for her to hurt me like that. But she acts like what I did was despicable, the worst thing in the world, but she flat out lied to me! I felt sick that night and drank straight vodka for the first time ever. It wasn't pretty.
Now, back to present day, yesterday. Two girls who I thought were still my friends from that big group (and honestly? They talked to me often, commented on my posts, this is all so sudden?) Cut me off and blocked me out of no where. I can't escape this, as soon as I felt better about the whole situation this happened. I noticed at 1am last night because I was struggling to sleep, and this kept me awake until 3am. I left our discord and blocked them back, but I feel sick to my stomach. It's like they waited until I was happy again and tore me right down. All I can think of is them all talking in their group chat and laughing at me,having fun, being friends, hating me, and I can't take it anymore. I'm 21, they're all 19/20, but this feels like high school drama, and I CAN'T TAKE IT. I don't know how to stop feeling anxious about this whole situation, but 3 weeks ago I lost an old friend to suicide, and I've started having darker thoughts again and my mental health is crumbling. There's 3 girls left in that group that are still nice to me, and I am so so thankful for them. 2 of which don't even talk to that group anymore either, they agree that they're petty and hurtful, but they're not my close friends, they've already known each other forever. I don't have any close friends, and I feel so alone.
I have work friends, but none of them know the real me. The depressed, anxious, lowkey bit of a loser me. They don't even know that I'm a lesbian because I'm scared of their reactions. Don't get me wrong, they're all lovely and I'm happy I'm friends with them, but when I am with them I feel like a lost puppy just following them around. 

I can't even talk to my family. I've heard my parents calling me fat and lazy, they've said to my face that I'm disgusting (and it's true, one of my depression habits is a lack of hygiene and I hate it) and they constantly say ""No wonder all your friends left you."" I think my Dad gave me anger issues, so I constantly argue with them, but I'm the devil when I act like that, but my 51 year old Dad can throw tantrums like a child all he likes. I'm sick of it. They're supportive one minute ""You can always talk to us! We struggle with depression too"" but the next its ""Get over yourself, you're supposed to be a lady, you're pathetic."" and I never know what one it's going to be.
We don't talk to the rest of my family, so I can't even vent to an aunt or uncle. I feel so alone. I look forward to my days off work then spend them drowning in anxiety, surrounded by my dark thoughts. I can't take this anymore. It's been 7 months of hell. My antidepressants aren't enough for this but I'm too anxious to go to the doctor as it was a struggle enough getting them to prescribe me them in the first place. I have no one, and I can't even make new friends because of my anxiety. I'm 21 and I don't have any close friends, I've never been kissed, I've never dated, I've never felt truly happy and it's all because of this dumb anxiety and depression. I just can't do this, it's all too much and I feel so so so alone."
1175,"Something Wired In My Brain, Help?","Throwaway account just because...
I need advice because eventually I have to discuss this with my behavioral therapist. 

This might sound crazy, but sometimes I run around my house in a repetitional pattern. Through the hallway and around the kitchen table. I only run this way, I strictly run with music. 

Whenever I run, I get very imaginative. Almost like hallucinating. I think of surreal things that correspond with the song I’m listening too. 
My awareness with the “outside world” is 50/50. I’m often aloof though, which resulted in small injuries. 


Running makes me happy. I don’t feel a fight or flight symptoms. Though it’s a very embarrassing habit. I’m very dependent on it, and sometimes it’s a urge. 
I run 2-4 times a day ranging from 5 to 15 minutes. 

Is this link to a behavioral disorder? I’ve been doing this since I was 8 years old ten years ago. 
I tried mentioning this to a previous therapist but he didn’t believe me. 

What should I say to my newest therapist."
1176,I get seriously anxious whenever something about my school or anything related to it comes up,Over the past month I've been trying to avoid anything related to my school because of a few things happening first I wasn't able to help my friends out for our class project and now they got mad at me when I tried to talk to them (via social media) second I wasn't able to comply to the projects our teachers had given us and now that they've probably recorded the grades I wouldn't be able to pass my work this.This is a big problem for me I don't want to spend my break having to worry about this so if anyone has any suggestions please just tell me. Also it's a huge relief to finally get this off my chest and also thank you in advance.

1178,Im socially awkward,"idk if this is the right subreddit to post this but my im actually rlly mentally affected by my social awkwardness... Whne i was a kid ive always been super awkward (literally only said 1-2 snetences in school each day to my teachers, ate alone during meal times etc). I decided to be more outgoing and social when i changed school but i only came off as awkward? I still manage to make friends that im not awkward around but like when i have to socialise with people outside of my friends (im socially awkward around my family too!) i just clam up. Like i know that there are many socially awkward people and that it sounds like maybe im being overdramatic but im socially awkward to the point where i get panic attacks everytime i make a mistake in front of other people (i will self harm by scratching myself till i bleed during these attacks). I dont know what to do anymore. Im just a living clump or awkwardness and i just feel like im not a human being? Idk does that sound weird?"
1179,Looking for extra ideas!,"Hey all, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe amid the current crisis. During this extra time I have been given I’m really hoping to iron out the things that are holding me back in life. I have been diagnosed with mixed anxiety/depression and PTSD. I undergo psychology sessions once a fortnight, take my meds regularly, exercise, I limit or completely stop my alcohol intake, do art therapy with my boyfriend, I’m learning to play guitar and the drums with the help of my boyfriend and his band. Overall these factors have helped improve my mood. I have zero self-harm, suicidal thoughts or tendencies now. But I still struggle immensely with anger outbursts, temper tantrums and sensory overload. I still find I am quite irritable and sometimes hard to be around. Which is hard for my family when we’re locked up the in house. 
So in order to try and combat the anger in extra ways I am going to implement meditation, mindfulness and gratitude into my morning routine in order to calm myself right at the beginning of the day and hopefully carry that energy throughout the rest of the day. Does anyone have any other useful helpful suggests that could help alleviate excess anger and irritability. There isn’t much I can do about my sensory overload though, but if you have any tips for that too, please let me know!!
Sending positive vibes to everyone at the moment! 💕✌️"

1183,What's happening to me?,"I've been feeling severely suicidally depressed everyday for a year now, not being able to keep up with classes, work, relationships, or even taking care of myself this whole time and it's getting progressively worse. What I find very strange is that I have these sudden, complete mental shifts.

Nearly every day i'll feel absolutely hopeless, suicidal, worthless, and self-loathing. Yet.. a few random days i'll get hit with a fat brick of realization over how overdramatic i'm being. I'll feel genuinely hopeful, and think having a good future could be possible during these rare moments. Then the next day I feel like I should die again. Is this a symptom of something? I feel like i'm missing something here and it's getting exhausting going through this cycle. These two moods are just so drastically different that it's confusing me."
1184,Idk wtf is going on with me,I keep absorbing what I hear anywhere I just cant help stopping it....whenever I hear someone saying anything I just take it for granted and accept it as a fact without even trying to know wtf that ever means...Even whats said in movies
1185,I really don’t know what to title this but this is my vent on how the current situation is affecting me and I need some advice,"‘Small‘ backstory: I’m 17 and last November I got a really late diagnosis of ADD. I also have anxiety that comes into play in this. So two big things happened at the doctors that are a major issue for me

1. The doctor said to me that I have ADD but that i seem to be coping well enough and that they could give me meds but didn’t think I needed them. They asked us (my mum was with me)  what we were thinking and my mum chimes in that she agreed with the doctor. This is where my anxiety came in and was like you can’t disagree with them kinda thing. 

So I have absolutely no support in terms of coping

2. Small little thing that I found highly annoying and confusing I don’t entirely understand how my ADD works and I thought that they’d give me a booklet or something to help me understand or that had links to stuff those kinda things. Well they did but they gave me the ADHD one and so I can’t tell what applies to me and what doesn’t and all that stuff


And now I’m the current situation my brain has just gone into panic mode because I can’t focus on any of my school work. I don’t feel safe telling the person from school who handles all the kids with disabilities about all this because I feel like it’s all going to be on me, my mum has often said to me that I’ve just got to make myself focus and now I probably think that everyone’s gonna act that way to me even though logically I know they’re trying to help me. 

I really don’t have any support, I used to go to a psychiatrist but even if the situation wasn’t the current one my parents stopped taking me a while ago. I don’t know how to go about getting it and I’m kinda just freaking out. 

Any advice would be great ^~^"
1186,"Diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety and an unsupportive husband. In a lockdown.","I made the mistake of telling my husband that I’m taking counselling and on meds, and his reaction to it is “It’s not easy for me”. Someone once said that most people who seek therapy are doing so to deal with people who won’t. This is exactly what my case is. I have given everything to this man, and sacrificed so much for him: but he only acts entitled. It would have been bearable if I wasn’t trapped with him inside these four walls. But his inconsiderate selfish and almost blatant disregard for what I’m going through: to the extent of ignoring me and not even bothering to check on me, whether I’m ok or if I’ve eaten, or when he knows I’ve been crying. He avoids me. And it’s just making me feel worse, and guilty. It’s like he doesn’t care that this could push me to the edge or even over it. How do I cope? How do I survive this? Because I’m really scared."
1187,Tools to improve emotional and mental state?,"My job forced me to take my holidays during quarantine. I've taken all my 6 days of holidays and i'll return to work tomorrow.

* I dread going back. I hate my boss, my colleagues and my job is uninteresting and shit. 
* Plus my dad left my abusive mother and I'm left alone to suffer her abuse. 
* I don't have any friends, I can't go out anymore.

I feel really bad right now. What are good things I can do to improve my emotional and mental state ? 

On the bright side I won't actually GO back to work  because I work from home. 

Sorry if it's not the right subreddit."
1188,Conflicted on discharge,"I want to be discharged, I’ve been avoiding cpn but now theyre saying it’s a possibility and I don’t get why I feel let down by that.  It’s what I’ve wanted for ages, I don’t find it any help and having help involved is just a false sense of change that I don’t need.  I’m pissed at myself though for sabotaging it yet again.  I don’t mean to but I do.  I’ve tried to try but I couldn’t give a shit about much anymore, I’m so tired.  They just need to stop getting involved.  
Does anybody else find themselves in this sort of place? I really don’t want to be wasting their time and I know I should want help but I don’t.  I gave up on that way back.  I’m so pissed at myself.

1190,"How many different media (reading books, watching movies etc) are you able to juggle at once?","Hi reddit, I’m currently recovering from a years-long bout of clinical depression; over the last few years I completely withdrew from all of my hobbies and interests, and as a result my capacity to focus on them diminished. 

My therapist explained that if you spend enough time essentially doing nothing (which is what depression has involved for me), the pathways in your brain that pertain to your interests - e.g gaming - can literally diminish, meaning you have to rebuild them by practicing doing those things again. In other words, you literally have to teach yourself how to enjoy things again.

Currently I’m undertaking this process by playing an hour or two of PS4 a day, as well as watching an episode of an anime and reading a single issue of a comic book daily. My therapist says that because of neuroplasticity, the more I engage in this practice the greater my capacity will become (I can’t get through a novel right now for example, but I’m getting there). My question is: how many different media is it ‘normal’ to consume on a regular basis? 

For example, Are there people who play three different video games at once and somehow follow the story, while also reading a novel and watching a tv series or two at the same time? How many different media properties are you able to enjoy simultaneously? 

**Tl;dr - I forgot how to have fun thanks to depression and I’m trying to learn how again, please help**"
1191,Is it ok to laugh and cry uncontrollably?,"It just like I have described.Sudden random thoughts swarm my mind and I usually start to laugh uncontrollably for hours.Also the same case with crying,it’s just uncontrollable and last at least for an hour.I even don’t have to force that but once it starts it does not stop or I am not able to .Also to that I  talk to myself only.I have been on pscyartic medication but they don’t seem to help much with this.Is it ok or there’s a problem with me?"
1192,Mixed experience with Better Help," I thought some counselling would be beneficial for some personal problems. I’m an emotional person. I find myself crying easily and often. I don’t think I need a psychologist so I subscribed to Better Help. Wasn’t sure how I’d go finding a face to face counsellor with this social isolation anyway.

As many may know, with Better Help you pay by the week but you have to pay for a month in advance.

My first session went well. My second session went well even if what we spoke about was not completely related to the original thing I wanted to speak about. But hey, it all forms part of a bigger picture, right? 

My third session again was off topic. I had a rough week being unsuccessful in a job I really wanted and wanted to talk through that. I got a lot of one word answers and cliche responses. Perhaps I’m being too harsh as cliches and one word answers aren’t necessarily untruthful. And I can be shy. But perhaps my counsellor is bored because what I wanted to talk about doesn’t necessarily fall under her speciality?

Each session is supposed to go for an hour. But I don’t know if it was me struggling to form words or my counsellor but it just felt like maybe she was distracted.

There was about 10 minutes left of our session and she said, ‘That’s all we have time for today - is there anything you want to add?’ There was more I wanted to say but I just said nope. I feel uncomfortable putting people out when they don’t want to help.

My fourth session is booked for this weekend but instead of an hour its only half an hour. Why so short? Perhaps my counsellor believes our therapeutic relationship should come to an end and this will be our wrap-up session. After the session, I guess I do too, now.

Not sure if my expectations are too high, if Better Help isn't suitable for me, or perhaps there's something I'm missing and there's another path I need to follow here."
1193,Hey dudes,"I just have to get this off my chest and im sorry for spelling mistakes.
I have the Problem that im still in Love with my ex and we endend our relationship 4 years ago i Couldnt try another relationship because I couldn’t forget her. I’m still friends with her and we see each other nearly everyday. (  I know that that’s not a good idea and i shouldn’t do that but I just like to be around her because she has an amazing personality) One of my best friends ( who is going trough a bad phase)  told me today that he loves her and that he knows that I still love her. I felt betrayed and really bad. But I thought that I have no right to tell him that he can’t have her because I love her because it’s been 4 years since we ended our relationship and I thought I can’t say shit about it so I told him that he has to look after himself first and do what he has to do to be happy even if that means that he will me together with her. That’s what my head says but my heart said no man what is you saying dude and yeah just wanted to get this off my chest"
1194,Does anybody know what MIGHT be wrong with me?,"I’m a 14 year old girl, and i’m not sure how long this all has been going on, it’s a blur, i just know it’s been getting worse. My vision is constantly fucked up like i’m on acid or something . some times it’s much more intense than other times. I frequently zone out very intensely and everything in my vision becomes extra fucked, like crosshatches, blurriness, lines, etc , and it especially happens in stressful situations i’ll totally freeze and almost leave my physical state and be in my mental state . I feel very weird a lot and a lot of times i feel like i’m on the verge of tripping or becoming high or some type of drug for some reason, even though i don’t/have never taken psychs/drugs and i don’t usually smoke weed. Just earlier tonight I had a very intense “attack” . I walked into my room and turned on the light, immediately felt a little light headed and zoned out on a poster for a good 20 or 30 seconds. I snapped out of it and walked to my couch and everything in the room sort of looked/felt like it was getting bigger and smaller/just moving and I felt very unbalanced and like my body was moving and like, changing shape in a way?? i’m not sure how to describe it well. I sat down and was very anxious and scared. My ears were ringing insanely loud ,my ears ringing is normal(tinnitus) , but it’s was still very intense like a gong was being played in my ear, and my ears felt pressured. The carpet looked very like? cross hatch-ey? I felt like my body was still moving around, and even closing my eyes didnt help because Jt made me feel really paranoid to do so. I just I really hate this all I feel like reality isn’t a real thing anymore I literally have existential crises every single day and i literally feel like i’m not living somewhere normal and i’m not alive and nothing is real"
1195,My attention span,Sometimes my attention span gets so short I can't do anything. I try to look for something to watch but nothing looks interesting. I put on something anyways and I keep hitting the skip forward 10 seconds button. I end up skipping through the whole episode. I look for something else and the same thing happens. I'm restlessly bored but have zero energy and cant focus.
1196,I don't know what to do anymore,"For the majority of my life I didn't really know what I wanted to do but I always was positive about it. I sued to say it's fine I'll figure something out or I'll have a plan by then but now that I'm 19 I just don't know. I'm in university but I had to travel daily which made me hate it and now that we have to stay home I just don't have the mental strength too do anything let alone get up and have food. My mental health has never been great but now more than ever its at its worst. Being at home make me feel like I'm being suffocated. My home life isn't the worst, my parents are just very religious and want me to travel to university. I just wanted to have a normal uni experience, living away, making friends, going out but I've not done any of that.
Being at home has made my mental health horrendous and I haven't been able to help it. I don't even know if I want to continue uni as I just keep falling behind.
I feel like there isn't much I can do at this point. I feel like I'm rolling down an endless rocky hill where each tumble breaks a bone until there's nothing left of me."
1197,I've made it; now what?,"Trying to answer What the title says, in a broad sense.


Basically if I'm someone who has been struggling with mental issues for a long time (a few months to years) and have managed to reach a point in my life that i can and want to continue living, what help/support is available for someone like me? What can i look forward to?


This is a part that's often overlooked (I think), so if it would be good to mention any program or support given (public or private) in the comments.

1198,O.D.D.,Good morning everyone. I just thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has suggestions for a friend (55F) of mine who's son (M under 18) is diagnosed with **oppositional defiant disorder.** They have been having a hard time during the last several weeks since both of them are typically in their home 24/7 together. I am looking for some fun activity recommendations for them. Thanking you in advance for your time.
1199,Does ADHD and drug and alcohol use go hand in hand?,"The guy I’m dating has said he has ADHD and it’s quite clear that he does, he’s almost like Tigger at times. But he smokes weed everyday and drinks alcohol most nights. Could this be because it’s hard for him to live in his head? Or could this be just coincidence that he suffers with both?"
1200,Relaxing methods for quarantine,Do you have any advices how to reduce stress? Since last few weeks I feel very uptight and I can't feel relaxed. It is probably due to isolation (I don't really think about how many people got sick or died and I would say that is doesn't bother me that much) but I feel that if I won't do anything about that I am gonna freak out eventually - I would say that I feel kind of uncomfortable rn. I think it might help others as well
1201,Can't function until I'm recognise by this person I like and other people,"I think that I've maybe liked this girl for more than 2 years. But I've never really thought about her sexually nor romantically like imagining a relationship with her, stuff like that. And I'm definitely not asexual. See we've been texting for quite a while and I just can't but feel so inferior to her and that I don't deserve her and stuff like that. But I can't seem to stop myself from texting her even though I feel like I'm doing it too much like multiple times a day. At this point it feels like I can't even function or just exist until and unless I'm texting with her. Yet at times it feels like I like her because I want to be her and I've absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I'm such a boring and average person that I don't think I can even function until and unless I'm recognised by somebody. I don't even know whether I even like the things that I do in my free time cause it seems like just escapism and a way to pass time until I'm with someone else. And it's not just her, I think I've suffered like this my whole life, that the only reason I should exist is for others not for myself. This lockdown is breaking me and I'm just at a loss as to what to do."
1202,Can abandonment cause trauma?,For more background: like if a parent leaves you when you’re at a young age.
1203,Are premonitions of bad events real?,"I have had a few dreams that appear to predict bad things. A week before my grandma got sick and died I had a dream about her dying. Never had I had one like it before and at the time of the dream she was ok. 

Then another dream was about a really bad car crash that really shook me and put me in a bad mood that next morning. Later in the day whilst at work there was an announcement that a really bad crash had happened close by and people had died. 

When this happened I was really scared because it instantly made me think of the previous nights dream. 

Could this be possible that I have dreams that predict bad things?"
1204,"I think I have what they call ""cabin fever.""","I've struggled with depression/anxiety on and off, but it's been manageable since changing my circumstances (better work environment and healthier relationship). I'm blessed to be able to teach from home and reach out to friends and loved ones through phone or video.

But, I'm having moments of extreme stress/anxiety and need to vent. I just grabbed Antivan which I haven't taken in a long time. I'm inside of my apartment 24-7 for roughly a month now with my mom. She has a health condition, so she's in the risk group. She absolutely does not want to leave the apartment. I don't either. A lot of people still don't wear masks or social distance. We are Asian and friends have reported getting harassed and attacked on the streets. We have all our groceries delivered. 

But there are moments I feel like screaming I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. I love and care about my mom, but obviously we don't get along 100% of the time, and it gets real stressful sometimes. If we're both stressed out, it makes it that much harder to focus on work. I can't even go out to take a deep breath. My desperate need for alone time consists of closing the door to my room.

I have enough meds if needed. I have a therapist. I have a support system. I know things could be much much worse. But, it's starting to get to me and I need to VENT.

The ""new normal"" fucking sucks. That's all I wanted to say."

1206,My friend committed suicide,"I'm now in psych ward because of suidical thoughts. Yesterday I got information that my friend has killed herself. At first I thought that I will not do the same to people close to me, cried a lot thinking of her. Today I feel numb. I can't cry, I'm just dissociating all the time and everything feels like I would be inside some kind of dream. Difference between yesterday and today is that today it feels like nothing matters anymore and that I should die too. This is just too much"
1207,Thank you Tim. I miss you and I owe you,"On the anniversary of Tim's suicide I am feeling a lot.  
I am thinking a lot  
I am hurting  
I am feeling

I think I want to get more public and open about my history with suicide.  
The first time I remember thinking about killing myself was 10th grade.  
I had just been caught cheating on a math test.   
I was always a good student but I was an underachiever. Or I was conditioned to think so. I cared much more about track, having friends and learning than getting good grades.  
My dad would frequently say things like ""you would be so smart if you actually tried"".  
I was advanced but not genius.  
I knew geniuses.   
Kids who had jobs at NASA as high schoolers. Assistant college professors as high schoolers. Kids who had been offered college acceptance as elementary schoolers. National chess champions.  
I was friends with these people, but it was painful to know I was not like them.  
Anyways, I got good grades but never great.  
I thought I was a good, nice person but I knew I had flaws.  
I think the pressure to perform led me to cheat but even that was hardly uncommon.   
Most everyone I knew cheated.  
Regardless, when I got caught cheating, I thought my life was going to end.  
I had never been in real trouble before.  
I was an eagle scout (the youngest on my troops history).  
I was going to rejected from my family.  
The pain was unbearable.  
I thought about taking the bright blue handled pair of scissors and slicing my wrist open.  
Down the street, not across.  
I saw the bright red blood spurting.  
I saw my funeral.  
I saw my parents crying.  
I saw my classmates crying.  
It was calming.  
I think a lot of this came from feeling in control of my emotions.  
I get to decide when this ends.  
I think some of it came from wanting attention.  
To be noticed and validated.

Needless to say my life didn't end that day. My family didn't disown me.  
They were shocked but generally as supportive as they could be considering how much they believed in me.  
Needless to say my dance with suicide also didn't end that day.

That was only the beginning.

The next time I vividly remember thinking about committing suicide was the first time I got dumped.  
I was in the 11th grade.  
A little over a year later.  
It wasn't a real relationship.  
Typical high school relationship.  
Good friends turned awkward. Jealous. Unsure.  
I remember that same image.  
The plastic blue handle of the scissors. The blood. The tears.  
I remember the pain.  
Rejection.  
I remember the cold, dark comfort.  
Control.

After that suicide became more of a regular thought. 

The next specific landmark I remember was an nihilistic crisis during 12th grade.  
Reading Hamlet.  
Deep I know.  
If life had no meaning, there was no reason to suffer. If it got too bad I would just end it. On my terms.   
I was in control.

The timeline gets muddy at this point.

I started drinking.  
I was drinking hard.  
I was a little peacock showing how crazy, fun I could be.   
I gave so little of a shit, I would do anything.  
I got attention and respect.  
I liked that.  
I had an amazing time, I loved it.

But there were the moments where my suicide control mechanism would creep in uninvited.  
I don't have a full psychoanalysis of this time or memory but I was frequently violent.  
I remember the image of laying in the bath tub. Slitting my femoral artery.  
Laying in a pool of blood.  
In control.

I remember the bridge by my house.  
Overlooking the highway.  
I would go there late at night.  
Lay on the sidewalk.  
Listen to the cars flying by underneath.  
Imagine myself diving head first.  
Smashing my head on the ground, then being run over at 70+ mph immediately afterwards.  
In control.

At some point amidst all this I developed an absurd/existential approach to life.  
It seemed like other people enjoyed +/ found meaning in life,  
So I would help others realize their meaning.  
I decided I would be a nurse.  
I found no hypocrisy in wanting to learn a health profession but completely ignore the fact I was sick.

In spite of all this my life was going pretty well.  
I had an amazing, loving, smart, talented girlfriend.  
I got accepted to an Ivy League school.  
We would go together.  
We never said it but we had both decided we were going to be partners for life.  
I might have had a different conception of what that meant than she did.

The next clear image of suicide was freshman year.  
The love of my life joined a sorority.  
I was vehemently against Greek life on principle.  
I knew I would have loved to be a part of it.  
I knew joining would take up a lot of my time.  
Time that would keep us apart.  
It would be betrayal.  
The pain of feeling betrayed, was unbearable but I couldn't talk about it.  
I couldn't see the feelings as thoughts.  
I couldn't find the words to express myself.  
I had this horrible pain.  
And I controlled it the best way I knew how.

I walked miles into the inner city in the middle of the night.  
I laid on the ground.  
I don't have a specific memory of how I wanted to die.  
But I know I was thinking about suicide.

All during college, suicide started to come out when I was drunk.  
I was more forward, violent and virulent.  
I was usually so drunk I would only have pieces of memories.  
I think I used suicide as a way to hurt others.  
To exert power.  
To cope with my feelings that I didn't know how to share.  
To control the thoughts I didn't allow myself to share with the world or allow myself to feel.  
The conversations that did happen in the morning were brushed off.  
""You know how drunk I was. Yes I know it was unacceptable. I won't get that drunk again""  
I did get that drunk again.

I continued to use suicide as my escape.   
My coping method.  
My control.

I didn't think I could look for help.  
Maybe I didn't want to.  
I didn't think I could talk about it.  
I definitely didn't want to.

It wasn't until Tim's death that I got a good look at suicide.  
A clear look into that icy cold abyss.

I always thought suicide was my form of control.  
If I decided I wanted to kill myself I would.  
But I would be sure.  
I wasn't actually sure I wanted to kill myself.  
And that's the only reason I never did.

Tim was the spark that illuminated the disgusting truth.  
Research led me to https://lostallhope.com  
You didn't necessarily have to be sure you wanted to die to kill yourself.  
It could happen when least expected.  
I was playing with fire.  
I had no idea how close I was to getting burned until I saw someone go up in flames.

It was a really hard road.  
I was terrified.  
I was alone.  
It made me want to die even more in some moments because I knew I had to face everything I was avoiding.

It took the fear of dying when I didn't really want to coupled with the vivid image of my wife finding my hanged body, sitting against a door to finally get honest.  
Honest with myself.  
Honest with her.  
Go get help.

I was terrified.  
""What if they lock me up? What if this makes it worse? What can a stranger say to me anyways?""  
Somehow I found the courage.  
I found the thoughts that hid in plain sight.  
I found the words I didn't let myself speak.  
It hurts terribly.  
But I am true  
I am light.

On the anniversary of Tim's death I want to thank him.  
For the beautiful music  
For the inspiring refrains  
For saving my life  
Thank you Tim  
I love you

Thank you Klas and Anki for speaking up in time of tragedy 

I want to open myself up to anyone who wants to talk about suicide.  
Open myself up to anyone who doesn't want to talk but wants company  
Anyone who wants a brother to take on this journey  
I am here for you  
I love you"
1208,"How did I manage my depression, boredom and the feelings of being stuck during Quarantine","I've been battling with depression for many years and the main reason for me suffering this was the horrible feeling of being stuck, especially because I live in Palestine under many different obstacles and challenges and Walls!

But in the last year - year and a half, I decided to take a path of courage and face my demons. Though I am still fighting, I started to feel more empowered and that I have more energy for compassion. The feeling of being locked and helpless is vanishing everyday.

I made a video to share my thoughts and my experience with this issue especially that now lots of people are forced to stay home during the Coronavirus quarantine.

I hope that this can be helpful to anyone having the same feelings and needing some encouraging thoughts.

1210,"Boyfriend (27M) says I (25F) have changed since bicycle accident, I feel scared, sad and hopeless most of the time","
I’m not sure if this is the right place to turn to. Back in August 2019 my boyfriend (27M)and I (25F) went for a bike ride. We were riding out bikes on a narrow road when I heard a car behind me trying to overtake me. Instinctivelly, I moved closer to the side of the road but then my back wheel slid down the asphalt and I fell off my bicycle. My face landed on the egde of the road and as I was falling I must have hit my abdomen with the handlebars. I knocked out 4 of my front teeth completely even with the bone, broke both sides of my jaw and my chin, I sliced my upper lip and chin wide open, and ruptured my eardrum. But the worst thing was that my liver ruptured and started massively bleeding into my stomach. I was taken to a hospital for a quick emergency surgery and spent a few days in the ICU, then had to have another surgery to repair my jaw, and several smaller surgeries to repair my missing bone and teeth. My body can heal quite fast and they sent me home after 8 days (huge infections in the hospital so they decided to let me go home) but I was up and walking 3 days after surgery. 2 weeks after surgery I went for a walk. It’s been 8 months and my liver is okay, jaw is healed but I’m still in the long process of having my teeth done. 

My parents have taken great care of me. My mom helped me with everything I needed and was there for me. My boyfriend was there when it happened and he still has trauma when we mention it sometimes. I always tried to be as positive about everything as possible and never wanted to add to any of their problems by my complaining or not helping out or not doing something with them. I can function as well as I did before and I spent my days cleaning the house, doing some repairs, going for walks with my dogs, cooking, gardening, etc. 

However, my boyfriend has told me multiple times that he feels this accident has f***ed me up and that I am a completely different person since then. It causes huge arguments between us. He is partially right, though. I am much more careful now mainly because I am still in pain most days and it freaks me out a little, but he will suggest things like going ski touring or skiing when it’s icy and I am not that good of a skier. I feel like it’s not even been a year since my liver was torn in half and I am afraid of falling again, so I went with him a few times but other times I just didn’t want to go as the last time we went him and our friends decided to do free skiing in a fresh powder, which is something I have never done and I did not feel confident that I could do. I explained this to him and I told him that I would continue skinning up to the hill and meet them there. He did not understand and told me his friends are going with their girlfriends and why can’t I be like that and why do I always have to be the one that does something differently than the rest of the group. I felt horrible after that. I know how much he loves skiing and I never told him not to go, but I personally did not feel like going. 

It’s like this with everything we do. If I don’t want to go ride his ATV with him, he tells me I was not like that before. If I can’t eat as much as I did before because I feel sick a lot of the times (I was 119lbs before and now I am 110lbs), he will say he just misses who I was before and that someone should just fix me. This morning we ended up having an argument and he told me I got so boring he does not want to be around me, because all I do is go out with the dogs and lie at home. I do feel so bad for him because I know I am not completely okay. I am scared of doing things. I do not have bad dreams or anything like that but now it makes me feel as if something really happened that changed me into a bad person.

Being constantly told how bad I am and what I am doing wrong has really caused me to feel awful about myself most of the time. I know I no longer laugh as much as I used to and I no longer enjoy things as much as I used to. I don’t know whether the accident really has something to do with my mood and if so what should I do about it. I just generally feel bad and my boyfriend’s comments are not helping at all. He told me I was perfect for him before that but now he feels I am not that person anymore. 

TL,DR Got into accident when I was riding my bike, nearly died and spent a few days in the ICU. Boyfriend tells me I have changed since then and that I am boring and he does not want to be around me as much. I feel sad and do not enjoy things as much anymore. Don’t know if it is because of the accident or because my boyfriend’s behavior."

1213,"someone please help, didn't get any feedback in r/bipolar","*Repost from the other day, need some solid advice
please anyone help im suffering really bad

Hey, I'm going to make this as short and simply as possible.

Beginning early january, I began tapering off seroquel, and then successfully quit 4 weeks later. It has been 2.5 months since dosing, until I get to my second story.

I started running into major problems. Depression, and Anxiety came back so hard that it was unbearable. I wouldn't leave my house, as usually. Fear became real. Fast forward to 8 days ago and I stopped smoking weed because I kept having what I thought to be partial seizures. My chest would lock up, muscles would become even more rigid, and a loud ringing in my ears. It was happening every time, and I need marijuana to sleep. Without it I won't get my 5-6 hours sleep that it allows.

I quit and became a zombie. anywhere from 1-3 hours a night of sleep, having nightmares about trauma, and incredibly broken sleep, always waking up. I am a rare case of insomnia beyond what you have seen before, and yesterday night It brought me to my knees. The mental pain was so bad, the physical lethargy was 11/10 although my mind was clearly awake. This has happened to me almost all of my 20s and the only thing that typically helps is seroquel. It slows me down and relaxes me enough to provide at the most around 7 hours per night.

So I caved last night and took about 20mg of seroquel, and almost immediately after felt better. an hour later I ate a pizza like it was nothing and calmed down. I have a history of PTSD, undiagnosed mood disorder, depression, Panic disorder as well as others I can't explain. The level of pain was too high. It was too real, and I couldn't see myself ever functioning with life like that. My suicidal ideation became too strong, it was constant sadness, constant pain when I don't sleep. My brain won't allow it to heal itself. It seems the more overtired I get the harder it is to sleep, too, so it's a never ending cycle. I had to cave, otherwise I probably would have taken my life by now. It was that unbearable, and all of this time I'm thinking through my trauma and drug abuse that brought me to my knees here. Im 25 but my life has not been easy since about 15, the past 10 years have been similar to a night mare, and now I'm liviing it. I'm actually living the life of someone with brain damage beyond true repair, and I'm inquiring to see about getting a SPECT scan done to give me answers. The drugs I have abused likely caused the sleeping issues, but my CNS was out of whack even at 11, when I started having panic attacks. I'm an extremely rare case, I've been having seizures the last 2 months mostly after I smoke, and I suspect because of THC's affinity for dopamine. When I smoke, the first 15 minutes or so, I get extremely anxious and paranoid, even though I tell myself it's ok, don't freak out, you've gotten through it before. No matter how much I tell myself that, my bodies response can be harsh and sometimes it's not even mental. I just feel an overwhelming sense of FEAR, really bad, and then all of a sudden my chest will lock up and I go into convulsions that last anywhere from 1-20 minutes. I would like to get a brain wave scan too, because I spend my life in fear, stress, anxiety, and constant pain. every single day, no days missed. I assume this is due to an increased level of acetylcholine, as I'm constantly stressed even though there are no factors or environmental stressors. I'm tired of suffering, I'm tired of the mental pain, my mental function is poorer than ever, I can't retain anything in my memory and the emotional disregulation is out of control, my body feels like shit every day, I avoid everything out of fear it seems, and if I do give things a try and fail I am destroyed by the effort it took. Its just not a life worth living sometimes.

So here I am. I gave it a harsh 2.5 months unmedicated, but this really brought me to my knees. I most definitely have a damaged brain, and many disorders to go with it. No doctor Ive had has taken me seriously, even last time i went to get my chest pain taken care of he just ignored the request. By the way, I still have chest pain and shortness of breath quite frequently. There is a history of autoimmune disease all over my Dads side of the family, so I fear neurological decline in some way. I'm not exaggerating the symptoms Ive faced. It was a nightmare, today im feeling better but I could easily go manic, as I overthink and stress about everything while sitting stationary. I plan to exercise again, but I tried everything for sleep. Changing my diet, cardio, did not fix this. It is a neurochemical problem within my brain, that is unable to heal itself fast. How can my brain heal if I can't sleep? Should I force myself to go through seizures and convulsions just to get the MAX amount of 6 hours? I don't know what to do, I feel helpless, and at a loss. I wish I could get a labotomy. I noticed my head feels hot inside often, I often think it is toxicity of excitory chemicals like glutamate in my brain. There is hope in research that I can come to the bottom of this, but I promise every one that I'm a rare case. It's a massive combination of mental disorders that have lead me to believe that I'm actually screwed. The whole 2.5 months I tried to tell myself that I didn't have anything, and that I could do this, but I was wrong. I'm going to need medication in my life to function, and that's a hard pill to grasp.

Sorry if this was too long. I just hope for a happy life again. Seroquel works well for anxiety, but keep in mind I also have had ADHD from a young age. Everything I do is disorganized, I can't focus on anything for too long, and when I try to learn something, it's gone from my memory really quickly. I suspect trauma, anxiety, and drug and alcohol abuse lead me here. I was always a jittery person to begin with so I need to get checked. It's just, doctors here have not cared. I got rid of my previous doc, but I have to wait till July before my first appointment. I'm not sure if I can wait that long.."
1214,Should I seek therapy?,"I not sure if I should post this here, but I need advice. My mother suggests I go back to therapy. I guess it's needed to tell you what I have diagnosis wise. I was professionally diagnosed with depression, anxiety, c-ptsd, and paranoia. I was in therapy, but I didn't always tell the truth out of fear of hospitalization. I struggle with my weight, a lot. My body as a whole. So, should I go back to therapy to sort this?"
1215,"If you think that meds have many negatives in the long term, you should consider long term effects of having mental problems.","From google:

""Chronic stress, **anxiety can damage** the **brain**, increase risk of major psychiatric disorders. Summary: ... A scientific review paper warns that people need to find ways to reduce chronic stress and **anxiety** in their lives or they may be at increased risk for developing **depression** and even dementia""

**""Research is still being done on the topic, but studies show that some possible long-term effects of anxiety on the body include:**

* various illnesses from a lowered immune system
* gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome
* memory problems
* frequent migraines

""**Depression Can** Break Your **Heart**.

""Years of untreated **depression** may **lead to** neurodegenerative levels of **brain** inflammation. That's according to a first-of-its-kind study showing evidence of **lasting** biological changes in the **brain** for those suffering with **depression** for more than a decade""

I am annoyed by people that are saying about side effects of meds. Maybe they should consider side effects of depression and anxiety. Some people can't afford therapy or it doesn't work for them."
1216,A little obsession and other doubts,"Hi, I am a 24 year old female who has never been diagnosed with any mental illness. A couple of years back, I was feeling really bad, I stopped going out, the only thing I did was cry and eat, and really couldn't see the point of living. In this case, although I suspect that I had depression, I didn't go to a therapist or doctor of any kind, and eventually going back to classes helped me get better.

Also at the time I used to have these weird obsessions like checking the stoves were off, then the windows, then that all my family members were safe in their beds. Now I only did these a couple of times before going to bed, sometimes only once. But my real obsession was a tendency to go pee like 5 times in two hours. It wasn't even that I needed to go, and many of the times I just sat in the toilet for a few seconds and then went back to bed.

This also went away went I went back to classes and started going out more, and I didn't even notice it. The only weird thing was that after a year or so I started having anxiety, my chest hurt and I felt as if I was a little short of breath. But again, nothing to go to the doctor, in my opinion.

Then this last year I had a couple of anxiety attacks, one of them in which I nearly passed out. This time I did go to the doctor, got some blood work done, she checked that everything was alright with me physically. Then she told me to try to be mindful of what could be the stressor that had caused the attacks in case it happened again and we will go from there. But it didn't.

And now we come to the current lockdown. I have been in my house confined for the past month and a half almost. My family members do all the grocery shopping and they prefer I don't go out since I've had severe bronchitis and bronchial asthma in the past.

And I've started to feel that life is not worth it again. I don't see the point in anything I do, the long run whatever issue I solve now is going to be substituted by another lately. Mind you, I know that this is irrational thinking, yet I can't stop these thoughts from happening now and again. Nothing overbearing but there are days that are bad.

And the obsession with going to the bathroom is back. I feel like I have to go, not because I have to pee, but just to be safe, like, every 15 min. Last night I went three times in ten minutes. I have read symptoms of OCD are similar, but they affect your life to a greater extent so I don't know if it could be it.

Anyway, I know I should be going to the doctor, but right now that is not a possibility I can afford and even if I could, current restrictions wouldn't help. So I just wanted to know what you guys think it could be. Of course, I won't substitute any opinions for a real doctor's advice, but I just want to know your thoughts on it."

1218,How to deal with a bipolar sister?,"Hello everyone!

I decided to shate with you an issue that has been bothering me for a while. My younger sister (20yo) has been diagnosed lately with a bipolar disorder, she had been through some difficult moments during her childhood and teenage years. But after her diagnosis, she started understanding more what's going on in her mind,and working on some of the issues she had.

When I realized this, I started doing my best to be there for her but at the same time give her her own space, since her mood changes are very frequent and fluctueny through the day.

 However, she's being very very susceptible and moody,she would create problems from the most stupid thing just to have an argument over it. 

I understand that she's not at her best self and on most situations I just let it go, but on other times it gets really difficult as my family and I do have our own issues and sometimes can't just deal with everything she comes up with in the most peaceful way.

I came here today to know if there is anybody who had gone through the same experience with their loved ones,and what can I do to keep my calm and at the same time save my relationship with my sister.

Thank you very much in advance for taking time to read and answer me,it would mean a lot to me.

Sum: How to deal with my bipolar sister,on the times when I do not feel at my best self to tolerate every argument she would come up with?"

I have no clear memeories for any of these things but the doubt makes it feel so real.

I was stupid and went to confession subreddits and would vent these concerns to people and now I'm scared people will use this as proof I've actually done these things.

I'm honestly just so scared and on edge all the time I feel like a monster who's trying to hide somthing and I feel like any moment of any day in going to be arrested or found out for these things. I'm scared to go to a therapist and tell them these doubts as unfounded as they are in case she reports me thinking its real."
1221,Emotional numbness in a relationship,"Me and and girlfriend have been dating since this past October and things have been great. We have enough in common to relate to eachother but enough difference to keep things interesting. We felt very comfortable around eachother and admitted our love for one another almost a month into the relationship. One of the things that makes us similar is our difficulties with mental health and suicide. We both fall into ruts where we get emotionally numb, and if we do happen to feel anything it’s anger, anxiety, and jealousy. We’ve talked about this a lot and still feel confused. In the past, when we were both depressed we could still feel joy about having eachother. It seems like every night we spent together we couldn’t stop talking about how much we loved eachother and wanted to be together forever. Now we both feel nothing. It’s not only for one another but neither of us have feelings toward anyone. I know logically I love her but I can’t make my chest feel. We both have no idea what to do and are scared for the future. Has anyone every experienced a similar situation and could impart some advice. Thank you"

1223,I really hate my body,"If I could I would cut off my breast and carve out my thighs with a knife and shave down my pelvis with a grinder. Its driving me insane I want to kill myself. Even though I only eat two meals of mostly veggie a day myself I dont lose any weight. I lift weights, hike, and ride my bike often but I still have massive thighs. I know weightloss wont change my chest so I want surgery to cut them off so I can have a masculine chest but then my stupid fucking ""child bearing"" thighs are even worse of an issue. Someone would seriously have to violently fucking rape me for me to ever have a child and even then I might repeatedly stab myself in the uterus so I wouldnt have it. Bearing a child seems like the most humiliating awful thing that could happen to a person leaving you essentially helpless for someone to do whatever they want to you and then you have to go through the humiliation of breast feeding and caring for a child that will probably fucking hate you when they get older. Who the fuck in the right mind would give their life away to a stupid fucking baby?

Im at university in accommodation and loving it, however my contract is due to end in a months time and I am absolutely dreading going back to my house for a while.

I am hoping to find a good place in the same are for August so I can move back out again but have yet to look online as of yet (I have a reminder set tomorrow to do so).

My home life is awful for me and my mental health, to save time going into it all, my brother is mentally unwell (schizotype personality disorder) which makes him really hard to live with and I can’t stand my dads Nature (pessimistic, short 
fuse, can be critical etc),

 not to mention the house is messy due to no structure being in place ( my dad works a lot and my brother, well, you can guess he’d not exactly be responsible and tidy)

I keep my flat very clean and tidy as I know I can maintain it, cleaning my house myself would be hard as no one would even try to maintain it however I’m planning to do some stuff when I return, as it can’t do no harm

Here in my flat I have no bother, peace and quiet, and access to the city centre easily. There is no chance of me extending my stay before anyone asks. As a result, I know there is nothing I can do about this , but I feel I need to post this to seek some guidance if anyone has been/ is in a similar situation, and or just some reassurance, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this atm.

I have ptsd but I have had that a long long time and don’t think it’s related I don’t know it’s never happened like this before. I’ve never felt this way. It’s weird. 
I don’t know how to stop it nor do I know what is wrong with me. 
Feel like I should book myself in to a psych hospital. 
I am losing it!"
1228,Anyone else feel like they are living in a Twilight Zone?,"Where you feel crazy because everyone around you is so fucked up and you can't tell if you're just surrounded by horrible toxic people or if you're the toxic one? 

Is it me or everyone else?"
1229,What does one do when they feel like this,I know i want help i just cant get it from someone i ask for help
1230,Completely ghosted my uni professors,"I havnt done any work for my university classes for like half of this quarantine and I just cant do anything but lie in bed, I can barely even make myself eat. Idk I feel like ab asshole because I'm wasting so much money and probably ruining my reputation and chance of getting rec letters but I really just want to lie around and kill myself"
1231,My boyfriends dad had a heart attack yesterday and is in the ICU,"He’s been under a lot of stress and collapsed while doing yard work. My boyfriend immediately called 911 and was instructed to start cpr/guided through it but he’s unresponsive. No brain bleed and no broken ribs or anything from the cpr but he does have a hematoma from the compressions. 

I already wasn’t doing well but am trying my best to be strong for him and his family but it’s so hard."
1232,"Someone asked me if I was ok today, and I nearly cried","I was just in my own head listening to music and my sister was staring at me, when I realised I turned to her and she said ""are you okay?"" with a concerned yet jokingly face. I guess I didn't realised the expression I was making, I said ""no, I'm just vibin"" and put my headset back on, but before I knew it my eyes started watering and I felt a pain in my chest. 

These past couple weeks I've been trying to help a friend who's depressed, but no matter what I do they kept pushing me away. It's been hurting me a lot so I decided to talk to them one last time but as always it didn't go well. I ended up getting frustrated and made the decision to tell them that I don't know what to do, and said goodbye. 

I felt an instant feeling of guilt, but also slight relief. I tried to help them so much, I ended up getting jealous and frustrated with myself. Thought it was for the best. I'll try focusing on myself for awhile, though that never ends well."
1233,Forgetful and sluggish,"Recently my mind has been blank and i feel sluggish and extremely forgetful, could it be down to lockdown and barely any social interaction ?"
1234,my mother is the reason i’m taking antidepressants,"my mental health has been pretty bad in the last 3 years and after finally being referred to a psychiatrist i got prescribed an antipsychotic (quetiapine) and things started to really improve. about 4 weeks ago i had to move back in with my parents due to certain circumstances and since then i feel like my mental health is plummeting again. i had a phone session with my physiatrist and she prescribed my some antidepressants also to help (fluoxetine). i’m opposed you taking tablets but i really feel like i would not need these if it wasn’t for my mother. i know she cares about me etc and she’s letting me live with them again otherwise i would be homeless but she is my main stress everyday and i really struggle to make things work with her. i’ve addressed this in the past and she seems to change her attitude for a week or two then things just go back to normal. saving up to get my own place but don’t think i’ll be able to move until lockdown is over. not sure what advice anyone can give me but i’m willing to try anything right now she really does drive me crazy 😭

tl/dr any ideas on how to cope with my mum during lockdown???"
1235,how can i help my depressed sister,"tw: depression, suicide attempt

my (23f) sister (19f) and i both lost our parents 10 years ago, at the time i was almost depressed and really can't remember that time of my life but i think i focused on my grief instead of talking about everything together, she was 8 after all and i was pretty immature too. after they died we moved into our grandmas house and we have been living with her these past 10 years, living with her is not always easy we can argue a lot but overall shes a great grandma but she can be very cold and shes never been the type to comfort us (emotional comfort) so me and my sister formed this really strong bond
shes the person i can count the most in life and i would do anything to see her happy in life but these past years shes been opening up to me about how down shes been feeling, at first we would talk and things would be back to ""normal"", my sister has many friends and she likes to go out a lot so me and my grandma (and anyone really) that would look at her would think that everything seems ok. 
but one day i was in shock when she tried to open her wrists at the bathroom floor i found her and it was the worst scene i ever saw, that day we talked a lot and for a months everything was calm and ~normal until she tried to hurt herself again this past january and i didnt know what to do because she seemed fine, we would talk about everything (i thought) she seemed fine but after this she told me that shes never fine, that her mind doesnt stop, she like to distract herself from her bad thoughts but she was just exausted of feeling like this all the time and my heart broke i hate this more than anything in my life i wish i could trade places with her this is really painful for me to see so i just cant imagine how painful it is to her.
she began therapy this year, has been diagnoses with depression, has been taking meds but we cant go out during this pandemic to get another prescription. two weeks ago she left our room durimg the night and i went after her bc i felt like i should, she was writing something and said that everything was fine so i went to sleep, the next day she had to go to the bank and something told to me i should look at what she wrote, it was a suicide letter, my heart broke i been in contact with her therapist, spend some time talking with my own therapist about but i feel like im so lost, i dont have anyone i can talk to, i tried to talk to my grandma but i feel like shes too old for all this i dont want her to be sad, the quarantine hasnt been easy on anyone, i just need some light, my sister said to me that she dont talk to me about it because she see how this makes me sad but i dont care about how sad hearing about it makes me i just want to help her, i just want to see her happy.

im sorry if this is a mess and if my english sucks, is not my first language."
1236,Finding the right mental health care is needle in a haystack-like,"Going to see a psychologist for an hour a week isn’t going to help my cause. So much to talk about and cover in so little time, and the clock is ticking and that’s all you can think about. 
If I can’t make it to my appointments and I don’t call about it, nobody’s going to check up me. 

It’s funny, you see a psychiatrist to try all kinds of pills because you haven’t had the chance to really get to the bottom of what it is you might have. You don’t even really know yourself, yet, but you have to try to find the right words to describe what you feel. And those drugs come with side affects that affect you being able to go to work and pay for them. 

But drugs won’t help you with the everyday.
Over two years later and I’m still struggling. 


So I’ve decided to hire a life coach, but for that, I have to pay. A lot. So I have to take out a loan and hope this will help me enough to make enough money to repay the loan. 

But at least I know that I’d be getting the dedicated care that I need..it’s life or death!!"
1237,No reason to live,"I feel like I’ve lived a life that someone chose for me. Anything I’ve wanted for myself somehow always crumbles apart and I’m left with remains that I can’t get myself to put back together. I then go back to routine because it’s practical. I hate comfortable. 

I gave up a major I wanted to do to work a career that makes me miserable. I’m going back to school to pursue a higher level of that career, but only to appease my parents because somehow having a Bachelor’s degree isn’t enough and I have to do more. They still haven’t told me that they’re proud of me and I’m constantly in a mind battle with them. They haven’t communicated with me throughout this quarantine because they think I’m stubborn for leaving so that I can pursue a life without them breathing down my neck all the time. They’re still there despite that. Here I am continuing to do things for them to make them happy.

I can count with one hand the amount of people who’ve checked up on me since quarantine started...none of which are people I thought I was close to. 

I’ve allowed every man who I’ve loved make me feel like I’m small. I never fought back and I allowed it to happen. I push any new prospects away because of the thought I’ll probably never be good enough, so there’s no point in trying. I’m waiting on someone currently who probably could care less and I’ve checked up on him more than he’s checked up on me. 

I still meditate, I still work on my hobbies, and I still manage to workout...however this is all to busy myself so that I’m not stuck in a constant loop of self deprecation. 

I wanted to do another bodybuilding competition because it was the only time in my life that I chose something for myself, but I haven’t been able to train completely for it because gyms are closed. I’m doing what I can at home, but it’s not the same. I still continue to try, though, because I want to feel a little good about myself. 

I stand stoic and pretend like nothing’s wrong because I fear I’m bothering people if I open up. Sometimes I end up spilling more than I should, but it’s only because I’ve bottled every emotion up and I couldn’t work up the courage to say another “I’m doing well.”

I never felt as though anything I’ve accomplished has amounted to anything. I ask myself what’s the point of living almost every day of my life because I’ve lost every reason to be happy. I don’t think I have anything to live for. I feel like my life is a lie and I have to keep up my happy facade so that people can stop asking me how I’m doing or what’s wrong. 

I have no reason to live anymore, but I’m even too much of a coward to end it. So I just keep doing life. It’s so empty."
1238,What should I do to be happy ?,"I moved to a new city 3 years ago and had lots of problems in my school bullying and fights

So now I am home schooled and I don't have pretty much any social life all I enjoy is video games working out in the gym and eating 
Now there is no gym
Also I have TERRIBLE mental health bdd depression ptsd ( because something that happened long time ago ) and I think I has bpd not sure because last one is self diagnosed 

What should I do to be happy"
1239,Feeling severely suicidal,"Hi. I don't know what else to do because I've tried hotlines and with the virus, I don't have access to any kind of therapy. I've been feeling really terrible the past couple days. For some context, I'm diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and ADHD and I was on meds for all 3 but I haven't been taking them for like the past year because I feel the urge to vomit every time I swallow pills. I've attempted suicide once before when I was 13 in 2017 and got hospitalized because of it. I'm really close to trying again and I don't know what to do. I don't want to be hospitalized because I'd feel guilty just taking up space when people need it for COVID-19. But at the same time, I'm worried I'm gonna actually follow through on my plans if I don't get help. I self harm and relapsed really badly last night. Should I talk to my mom about it and go to the hospital or should I just try to push through it? I feel so stupidly guilty all the time bringing my mom into it because she's already stressed enough and it puts strain on my sister too but I don't know what to do. I'm genuinely stumped. I'm just tired of feeling so bad and useless all the time, I can't even bring myself to try in my online classes because I've convinced myself I'll be dead before I graduate next year anyways. I'm worried because I already have a suicide plan in place and I'm very close to actually doing it. I don't see any reason to keep going if the only reason I'm living is so I don't hurt other people. But I'm tired. Please help. Thank you."
1240,Started playing Solitaire,"So I had never played Solitaire in my life. Most I saw of a game was that episode of *The Office* where it’s on Meredith’s screen for whatever reason.

Then, last night, my next door neighbor taught me how to do it and gave me a deck of cards. She played obsessively as a teenager when she was struggling most with changes, ADHD, and OCD, and I can see why. It takes your entire brain, just about, to play. I have anxiety, social anxiety, depression, PTSD, and CPTSD — all of which have been exacerbated by the abrupt changes brought on by COVID-19 changes and the isolation of that situation — and especially if you have physical cards, I’ve found it fantastic. (I’ve also paired it with listening to anime music, especially that which I haven’t heard before, and find that takes up even more of the brain — I respond pretty strongly to music/am a pretty auditory and tactile person.) I plan to do it ritually at night, after taking my pills, and in the mornings, either before or after my first online class.

Just wanted to lend the suggestion to anyone else who might want it. Stay safe out there, everyone."
1241,I'm a cyber stalker and I need help 30M 31F,I know what I'm doing. I was rejected. Dumped. The woman stopped talking to me but I believe that she is talking to her ex. She said she had to work on herself. I don't know why i'm so obsessed. Maybe because I actually want proof to throw in their face. We're in our thirties. Obviously talking to a psych isn't going to work with the situation in the world. Is there a book anyone can point me to self help for this please? I keep making up scenarios in my head and it's killing me. I can't sleep. I feel awful because I can acknowledge these feelings even though I don't want to feel them. I feel vindictive and I just want it to drop off my chest.

Apparently that’s how Robin Williams took his life. I can’t get this out of my head and it’s scaring me. My husband doesn’t care. He knows I’m on medication and doesn’t care that I’m depressed or suicidal. In fact, I think he is waiting for the lockdown to get done to leave me. I feel abandoned and alone. I have nobody."

1247,[serious] Help how to help a family with psychotic depression?,"My aunt depression was caused by a traumatic life event. Another family who has mental illness just snap and was involuntary committed. And that event triggered her depression.

She stop going to work, refused to eat, always on bed, taking without sense, and stop answering phone calls. She’s taking medication for depression, but it’s not working. She totally lost it. I called her work &amp; said she can’t work this week without telling the real reason. She’s barely eating.

Long story short, She is unable to take care of herself &amp; she needs help.

What should we do?
Should we bring her to emergency to be

The journey begins as Robert reflects at age 32 on his early years  and struggles. It tells the very true story about his time as a drug addict,  illicit drug dealer and cannabis cultivator in the the windy city and suburbs of Illinois, long before the advent of widespread American decriminalization.

1249,I feel like I’ve lost confidence to do anything in life.,"I want to do things but at the same time I don’t want to because it feels cringey. I want to draw as a hobby to separate myself from video games a bit more but I feel like I won’t impress anyone. I used to play the violin from 3rd grade to 9th grade but I stopped because I feel like I didn’t advance and no one from my family would show up to the time I had a concert to play in. I also feel like I can’t even socialize online anymore because I may feel bad on what I say or I’ll screw up or people will attack me. I have a therapist to talk to but I never tell her the important stuff that goes on in my life because I’m afraid that my parents and brother will feel like I’m a mentally sick person for thinking and wanting to do some weird actions and I will feel embarrassed since I feel like I’m the only person who has ever done or thought of stuff like this. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do for a job and my time is running out since I have a few years left of school. I don’t want to think about sick actions anymore and I just want to be a normal person with normal thoughts. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone in real life because the only topic I know is gaming but a normal person doesn’t do gaming for so long. I feel like I am going to be left out forever and I don’t know what to do.

I have never impressed anyone.
I am bad at explaining stuff too so I am sorry if anything is out of context and let me know if something needs to be explained; thanks."
1250,"If you're constantly posting, and sharing ""relatable"" jokes about being depressed or mentally ill odds are you're probably not as bad as you think you are. As a matter of fact you're probably taking attention away from someone who is truly suffering.","I used to laugh at all the jokes, and memes but these days I've realized that more than 70% of the people who claim that they are depressed or suffering from some kind of undiagnosed mental illness, are just upset because their life isnt going the way they planned it to go. Once they either get into a relationship, make new friends, or get a job they enjoy BOOM all of their ""severe mental health problems"" are gone. Meanwhile a person posting online who has  severe depression because their brain isn't wired right, or a person who has an anxiety disorder because of childhood trauma is drowned out by all of these people. All of the dark humor about being ""mentally ill""  is kind of getting on my nerves because it's coming from people who if professionally diagnosed wouldn't even be half as bad as they describe themselves to be."
1251,Cant pretend I'm okay anymore,"Whenever I was at work, home or school I would pretend I was okay to not worry anyone. Lately, I physically cant do this anymore. I started having angry outbursts, bad panic attacks and becoming increasingly depressed. I honestly dont care how others see me. I know that when people look on my eyes, they see someone who's not okay and I'm weirdly fine with that."
1252,Could someone give me an idea of what's wrong with my dad? (long-ish but please help),"Okay, so I know Reddit isn't exactly a professional medical place where I could get a diagnosis or anything, and that's not what I'm asking for. I'm wondering if anyone has a few ideas on what's wrong with my dad like what kind of illnesses he possibly has, because somehow I feel like it would help.

Some background info first: there's a pretty big age gap between my dad and my mom(25ish years, my dad is 75 but I don't think its because he's becoming senile, he's always been like this according to relatives) long story short he was a pretty manipulative boyfriend and sorta forced my mom into a marriage. My mom is his second wife. He had two kids with his first wife and then cheated on her with another woman, the other woman left her and he married my mom. His two other daughters cut ties with him since they're adults (unlike me) and have not spoken to him in years.

For as long as I can remember, my dad's always been like this. A typical day involves him *randomly* bursting into VIOLENTLY angry tantrums. A lot of times he'll just get angry for no reason, or randomly bring up something that happened a long time ago and get angry as if it just happened. Or me and my mom will be talking about something and he butt in our conversation and will find some way to act as if whatever he is pissed about has anything to do with what we're talking about and take out his anger on us. The other times, he overreacts to everything. He used to be physically abusive but over the years as he got older he has stopped mostly because he himself has back pain and leg pain from getting old. 

He fights every single day with my mom over small things. My mom mostly tries to ignore him so it's mostly a one-sided argument with him just shouting obscenities at my mom. When my mom is not home he takes out his anger on me and verbally abuses me. He often blames me for his fights between him and my mom and used to purposely make me late for school so I would get detention to punish me for ""causing"" the fight even when it was about something that I completely had nothing to do with. Everyday he just tells me that no one loves me, etc...

He doesn't have a job, a college degree or anything and lives off my mom, hasnt worked a single day of his life since they got married. He actually neglected me as a child. He only takes me to school and makes really crappy food for me to eat and that's it. Doesn't really talk to me and isn't interested in my life, he barely knows basic details about me and only talks to me to yell at me. We're like strangers.

He lies a lot too. In public he pretends to be super nice to people and lies about his achievements to make himself look good. He also lies to my mom and will tell her i said bad things about her when I didn't to start drama between me and my mom. 

He also seems to have quite low mental capabilities. I can't think of any  specific examples right now but overall he is a really immature person and is like a child throwing a tantrum when he gets angry. He has extremely poor logical reasoning and lack of common sense. Honestly I don't even know how he has survived this far because he is so gullible. He believes anything on the internet, like fake news. For example he thinks the coronavirus started in the US and was brought to China, and thinks that you can get rid of bacteria on a surface by slapping it with your bare hand( i really dont know how he believes that...?). When people talk to him they often get confused (or scared because my dad blew up at them) because his logical reasoning is all over the place and you can tell he's kind of.. slow when you have a conversation with him.

Somehow he thinks he is the best and the smartest, though. He seems very delusional to me. He has no friends and he blames this on his old friends being jealous of him. He holds grudges against people who allegedly talked shit about him out of jealousy, and these are people who haven't talked to him in decades so they probably have forgotten about him. He really thinks that he's that important I guess. 

**Also he is uncooperative with trying to get tested for mental disorders. He thinks nothing is wrong with himself so thst he doesn't have to (Well then no reason to be afraid of getting tested then, right??? Nope, I guess not. he's still not gonna listen) and probably it will be difficult to get him to therapy since he got mad at my mom for going to therapy once, so if anyone could offer advice for getting help for him that'd be appreciated.**

My mother said that a long time ago he was diagnosed with a thyroid cyst and thinks that's why he's so angry, but I kinda doubt it. I think that's not the reason why he is the way he is. My friend says he might be on the autistic spectrum but idk? 

If anyone has advice that'd be great, it's kinda weird but I'm honestly really curious as to knowing what's my dad's issue. So far it kinda seems like he has narcissistic personality disorder but it doesnt fully explain the anger and low intelligence. If anyone has similar experiences with parents and feels comfortable with sharing feel free to do so. 

\--

Also, I know that people will probably try and tell me to get out of this, but tbh it's gonna be kinda hard. My mom works a demanding day job so she's not home most of the time, and she's already super stressed from her job that trying to get authorities involved and a divorce would be adding more to her stress. My dad doesn't want a divorce which if i recall correctly kinda makes the divorce process harder too. I also don't know how it works but I'm worried that if my parents do get divorced the authorities will deem my mom unfit to take care of me alone or something. Overall I don't want any risk of getting into a foster home or anything so I'll just wait until I'm old enough to move out. I'm kinda used to it anyway and I'm not in any immediate danger, it's just more of an inconvenience that makes me mad at this point."
1253,Concerned for a friend,"A friend of mine has recently gone through a break up with a guy she was seeing for 3 years.

She has recently taken to dressing up as clowns (holding knifes), witches and other horror related things. It scares me because she has never been into any of this. She posts this on social media too.

I can't talk to her because we have recently fallen out and she won't speak to me.

Any ideas or similar stories?"
1254,I feel like a lost cause.,"I could honestly post this in 3 different subreddits but I feel like posting here first. So my mom made me a daily schedule to follow 3ish weeks ago and it went like this: 

10 am- Wake up 

10:30 am- Shower, brush teeth, get dressed

11:30 am- Activity time: writing, drawing, anything other than being on my phone)

12:30 pm- Exercise: Take the dog for a walk, bike ride around the block, do stretches, or walk on the treadmill

1:00 pm- Lunch: eat a sandwich, fruit + chips (make healthier options) 

1:30 pm- Chores: Take out the trash if needed, empty the dishwasher, wipe off counter or the table 

(2-4 pm is break time until dinner)

8:00 pm- take meds

10 pm- go to bed, lights out, no video games because i go to sleep too late.


So yeah thats my schedule that i stopped following after a week. I told my mom i wanted to follow it but i couldnt get myself to do it but she just called me lazy. I really want to start becoming better because i really dont like laying on the couch everyday (this has been post quarantine, ive been like this for years) not showering or brushing my teeth and sitting on my phone until its night and then having a wave of depression because the day went by so fast. I dont know what to do anymore because any advice anyone gives me or anything anyone says to me (just like my dad says) goes in one ear and out the other. I honestly feel like a lost cause and i dont think theres any hope for me."
1255,Trigger?,"Help
So today while I vaccuumed the house my dad came up to me and patted my arm like when you pet a dog,but like its me and my arm,and like I know he didnt mean anything bad,but that trigerred me so bad,I usually have a touching trigger,like two weeks ago the same stuff happened and I cried for two hours,and yea contuinuing today,I got triggered so bad that I decided to go to sleep since I couldnt function,and like as I closed my eyes I felt hands touching me and like all over my hands and legs and like I twisted and turned,flinched and even verbally told them to stop touching me,but like no one was there I wasnt dreaming,idk why I felt like that but it was horrible,can anyone explain?
(I have never been abused or rap*d to feel this way,I mean not that I'm concious about it)"
1256,Shaking from a Zoom conference hijacking,"I'm a college student and my department has an annual conference to showcase student and professor research and it's something that I always enjoyed going to. With COVID this year, it ended up being hosted on Zoom. First few presentations went great. The last presentation of the first panel starts having issues. The presenters powerpoint stops working. Then someone starts drawing on the screen. They drew a swastika. Probably to see if they could hijack the screen. Then they started playing graphic child porn. The professor running the zoom is able to block the person and turn off screen sharing but then someone starts playing the video as their camera icon square thing. I left. Could not deal with that more. 

I'm so shaken right now and I don't know what to do. I wanna cry but I feel like I'm overreacting. My mental health was so fragile before this and idk. It's so messed up. Idk why someone would do that and why they would have those images. It's not funny. I don't know what to do with myself right now."
1257,My Mental Health during this quarentine,"Ever since quarantine began, I(18M) have slowly felt uncomfortable in my own house. I live with my parents(53M) (50F), an older sister (19F), and a younger sister(7F). No one is causing me to feel this way, but I am slowly becoming uncomfortable living here, and generally late at night. I can hear every footstep from everyone during the day because I live on the bottom floor but everyone lives on the second floor. Late at night, I tend to hear footsteps and voices, but the footsteps sound like they are coming from right outside of my bedroom door, and the voices sound in a different tone than anyone in my family (and no one in my family sleeps with a television on). I am beginning to lose a lot of sleep and I still have school to work on for the next 3 or so weeks. We live in an area that has a low crime rate, but I often go fishing, hang with friends, and drive in areas that do have a fairy high crime rate, but it never bothers me when I’m alone. I’m not generally scared of much, but these late night noises are beginning to get to me, and I’m just wondering if anyone has an idea of what it could be and if there is currently anything I could do to calm myself down."

1260,weird state of wanting to cut :'),i used to have it that after/while cutting I'd go into this weird anxious state like my emotions were all over the place..? and i just kind stayed between laughing and crying and since i had no one to talk to about this irl I'd go online and write to online people about this basically destroying a few friendships saying stuff I'd not say if i was in my normal state of mind...? I remembered everything i did but a bit blurry and like I'd know why i wrote that but also hate myself for doing it and yeah idk how to explain this... Is this a common thing? Do others do/did that too? (now i don't really have friends so idk i cry inside ='&gt;)
1261,Quarantine has brought back my depression,"My senior year, my prom, my graduation feel like they were stolen from me. I haven’t been able to see or touch my girlfriend in over a month. I stay in my room almost all day and barley talk to my friends and family. Not because I don’t want to, but because I feel like some invisible force is stopping me. I rarely come down to eat and I stopped caring for my hygiene or physical health. I’ve lost almost 10 lbs since a month ago from not going to the gym and not eating as much. My therapist isn’t doing online therapy and I don’t know what to do. I talked to my girlfriend and how I was feeling and she didn’t know what she could do to help"
1262,Feel uncomfortable/strained expressing emotion,"Feel uncomfortable expressing emotion

So, as a child I behaved irrationally. Intense anger, throwing fits and the like. Im almost 18 now and this has turned into being just kind of a blank person. Here’s what I mean. Around family, I act with no emotion and it feels very uncomfortable to show any. I don’t enjoy spending time with them for this reason, that and I get a little bored being around them for some reason that I don’t understand. Secondly, when I’m around friends I put on kind of an emotional mask. I act happy, although i think I feel slightly more happy around people it’s not to any great extent. I think I choose to be around people sometimes just for the fear of missing out on teenage memories. I read situations and then decide how to act, it’s not a very fluid thing. I spent most of my childhood with very little friends. That is until my junior year of high school when I became a social butterfly. It’s been two years since I’ve began a very active social life and sometimes I just feel that people are a bother, yet at the same time I almost always hang out with people when I get the chance for the fear of missing out on some memory that I know I should enjoy.


It might be worth noting I deal with extreme social anxiety and depression as well

Is there something wrong with me?"
1263,Is there any way to stop being attracted to things like rape?,"Whenever I hear the words ""rape"", ""sexual harassment"" etc. I feel turned on. I'm 99% sure where it came from. When I was 10-11 I met a girl on a social media app. We chatted and roleplayed with our furry characters. Eventually she asked if we could roleplay ""hentai"" and I said yes. So we roleplayed that. But one day, she implemented rape into it. I was young and didn't know it was very fucking wrong, so I went with it. Is there any way to stop these thoughts? I don't wanna be this way. I just want to be normal"
1264,Depression expressed as anger?,"I've been dealing with a lot of mental health problems for years. Over time, I've figured out that I've been expressing my depression as anger. I just get so irrationally irritated at everything. I dont blackout or physically harm anyone. But damn, do I press people's buttons. Sometimes, I purposely try to get into arguments.  When I dont do this I usually turn to self harm just to get the anger out. It's almost like I enjoy being mad. I think it's because I actually can feel something other than extreme anxiety or numbness. When I'm angry I feel powerful, eventhough I know it's a false sense of control. It just sucks because I feel so powerless in my everyday life. It doesnt help that I'm just frustrated at myself for being a failure."
1265,Week 4 of not harming/killing anyone,I have psychopathy
1266,How to stop feeling hopeless and like there's no point?,"I'm kinda just seeking advice. I have as my sister puts it ""extreme peter pan syndrome"" I really struggle with the thought of being grown up and having a future and all of that when I was 18 I tried to kill myself bc im was and just am really scared of being an adult and feeling like won't succeed and I'm not good enough. well I'm doing better than before and I'm medicared now but I just have days where I feel like me going to school and just everything I do has no point. Like no matter what I'm doing I'm going to fail at being an adult and always be a fuck up. does anyone have any advice how to cope with these days? they're just so heavy and I tend to feel suicidal on these days."
1267,I hate feeling like I'm not allowed call/text a helpline or try get any type of help from a professional unless I'm litteraly right about to hurt myself,"I usually use text lines but I've called on a few occasions. I feel like I'm just not taken seriously at all. I haven't cut in six years. That should be a good thing but it seems to be so fucking judged when I'm trying to talk to people on a helpline or text line. Idk how many times they've tried to pass me off to somebody else or just sent me a link to some mental health website and think that will help. I feel like I have nobody to talk to that will take me seriously. Like sorry that I refuse to hurt myself? What am I supposed to do, ignore my mental health until it gets to that point? Ffs"
1268,How can i get over paranoia,"Paranoia has been popping up lately, and i’m scared of it,please help me."
1269,"MY SITUATION IS STRANGE, I AM A MUSICIAN BUT I CAN'T PLAY MUSIC ANYMORE","Hi guys, I'm 26 and i'm an Italian musician. I have a degree in classical guitar, i teach music at secondary school(love my job because teaching is different than playing). I love to listen music, from classical to jazz to electronic to rap and a lot of various kind of music. The problem is that i don't know if music is my way. I start lot of projects and never finish one, i don't know what instrument and what kind of music i have to play, there's no passione anymore. I want to play because i think i have to but i don't feel the beauty of music and this situation make me anxious. I'm constantly undecided, the problem is that maybe music is not my way and I can't accepted because i studied for many years and without music i think i'm lost. I have many passion and i'm good at it. I'm a mountain bike guide and a personal trainer, I train every day and love to help people with body issues and problems. I feel that i have to let go music playing but I can't,  for me is like an addiction. When i play music i do for 7 hours a day, smoke a lot of cigarettes and get angry.  Music is freedom and for me is a jail! When I stop playing music i feel good the first 5/6 days and next I need to think about a new project, new way of playing to build a career. Please help me, i need someone that tell me to stop playing, people don't understand and they always tell me ""but music is a nice thing and you're a good musician, you only have to find your way"". Well it's a lot of time that i'm trying to find my way but i'm tired, and the time goes on. Sorry for my english, i know that probably there isn't a solution, i have only to stop playing but it's difficult because i always find a reason to start playing again an get bad.  Sorry for the outburst!"
1270,Why do I cry uncontrollably at little things?,"I watched a sad moment in a TV show that would normally just make me sad, but for some reason I started like bawling and crying, why?"
1271,I desperately need help.,"I feel like the world is falling apart right now. I feel like there’s no one who cares about me. I have been going to therapy for over 5 years now and I’m still as depressed, suicidal and sad. The only difference is more trauma and a bigger understanding of who I am. But that makes me hate myself even more. With quarantine I just feel lonely. I have no structure, no motivation, nothing to distract me. I just want to end myself. I don’t have the motivation to call my therapist because I’m so scared. I just want to be done with being alive and existing. I’m only 17 and I feel like I can’t be alive any longer."
1272,I don’t care if I die.,"People find it really weird that I don’t really care if I die. Like, I don’t care if I died tomorrow or in an hour. People think I’m insane or that I need help, but honestly I feel better than ever because I’m more carefree. I’m not going to try to kill myself but I just wouldn’t care if I died. My family is the one that’s most freaked out by this, I probably shouldn’t have told them but after I did they got scared that I was suicidal. I guess my question is, should I think like this? Or should I get help?"
1273,I'm exaggerating or it's worse than what I think?,"I live with my mom (I'm 19) and we've never had a ""good"" relationship.
But the thing is that the more I grow, the more I notice things. And it has got to a point where I'm not sure if I'm just exaggerating and we just have a ""normal bad relationship"" of I'm blind and I don't see that something's really bad at home, cuz sometimes it feels like that.

There has never really been fiscal abuse or harsh insults, but sometimes something feels really off.

A few events lately have made sound the alarms, but I may be exaggerating. I just don't know.

For years I've been trying to avoid hee as much as possible, but it's not easy while living together (specially now in quarantine) and that also may have been worse for the relationship in general, but...idk


I'm gonna do research now but I guess I just wanted to vent.
If anyone can like, tell me places to check or something it would help."
1274,I don't know if I can do this....seriously,"I have severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD and quarantine is literally driving me insane. I haven't had any physical contact with another human being in weeks. I haven't had therapy in longer. Everyday is a roller coaster of crying, contemplating dying, and wishing I was dead because I hurt so much. I am so isolated and so lonely. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is ok. I'm unwell, I'm scared, and I don't know if I can do this..."

1276,Did you become more motivated when you moved out?,"Hi people,
I'm an 18yo female. Since a child I've always had a very self sufficient mindset. I think I've been some level of depressed for some time now. I live with my family and when I observe my life it is wonderful so I don't want to change things. Part of the problem is that I have nothing I want to change. I've come to realize I am still hanging around planet earth because there are people I care about here. Nothing has appealed to me personally for a long time. I wake up, see the fam is still alive, do the minimum to stay alive, do the minimum it takes to look like I'm a person who wants to be alive, and repeat. I've been thinking about moving out lately, as a way to test and see if there is anything I would care to do if I wasn't around the people I care about so much. Right now that isn't possible. In what ways did moving out effect you? Is there any way to mimic the mindset of living by myself?"
1277,Need help with controlling thoughts,"I have these uncontrollable thoughts that pop into my head that I have dealt with for about five years now. They used to be religious oriented and I learned I could get rid of them by just letting them happen and not worrying and soon I would forget all about them. 

However, now I cannot let these new thoughts 'just happen' because they are dangerous to my health. I imagine my immune system attacking my heart or my cells releasing cytokines which causes the immune system to attack the body and I get this weird feeling like its happening. Its just like I am able to create and adrenaline release. And there is scientific evidence that shows imagining things happening in your body can make it happen. On top of this I imagine doing something like wearing earbuds and then the immune system attacking my body which I am afraid is creating a ""nocebo"" like effect when I do wear them.

The harder I try to eliminate these thoughts the more they come back. Any tips and tricks on how you guys get yours to go away? Any another thoughts or inputs?"
1278,Anxiety and school,"I graduated high school in 2015 and went to college with the intention to become a dermatologist. I transferred schools twice, then I got sick and had to medicals withdrawal for a year. I maintained a 3.8 GPA throughout my time in school and had no social life because of it. Now I'm in a online program, in the beginning of the semester I was doing very well. I was very persistent with turning in quality work, but then I started experiencing anxiety so bad that I would go to the library and sit there for hours. Unable to get any work done. And I've been pretty much stuck since February. I don't know how to get help or what's going on. My mom says that I over plan and over think so much in the beginning of the semester that I burn myself out. Even though I know I'm not lazy, I feel crazy and frustrated because I know I'm a good student. I just don't know what to do. I have never done this bad before. And I feel even worse because I don't even have any stories outside of the library and my college dorm. 
Also, covid-19 threw my savings plan off and I really need to move out of my dysfunctional mom's house. But now I'm really broke. I feel really stuck and I feel like a failure."
1279,I've(19) been having issues from different things for as long as I could remember and was finally going to have the ability to seek help but COVID happened...,"I've been struggling for a long time with depression and anxiety.  I'm also worried that I have PTSD from some incidents. I don't know what mental health problems I have because I haven't had the ability to go to therapy or anything yet. I recently got an ok paying job with benefits and was going to attempt to get some help, once I had a bit of money saved up. When I got this job, the corona virus still felt far away, Italy was just starting to have problems. I'm in the USA, I was worried but didn't feel like it was going to come here so quickly. The factory I work in is still open and seemed essential (which feels dubious at best) part of the reason I chose this job is the consistency of working the same hours every week, and for the most part I'm fine with the job, but it's not a great place to be during a pandemic. Factories aren't the cleanest places, and assembly line work has you working shoulder to shoulder A lot of times.

Anyway, I don't feel like I can seek mental health now, even though I'm in a constant state of feeling on edge. Places are closed, and our already inadequate mental health system is inundated with people who normally might not need or seek help, because people are loosing their jobs and everyone is stressed. I don't know how to go about getting help right now, it already seemed very complicated before this, but now even more so."
1280,I hate my mother getting involved in my life,"Grew up with an alcoholic narccassist, bpd , mother .

Me and father my sister couldn't get far enough away every damn day .

She made those years a nightmare .

Longstory short , father divorced my mother and we went to live with my father .

This was many years ago , and we all live apart . My mother has calmed considerably since then , but can still be a major pain in the ass but for the most part we get on ok now .

But , because of those days and the way she is , I tend to have boundaries , I've realised I literally hate letting her or feeling like she is getting involved in my life in anyway, 

Like I will go to see her and me and my sister and her will go out for a meal , but that's it, 

Anything else I feel like shes crossing a boundary I just don't want . 

It's been many years but she's such a toxic person and doesn't understand boundaries , that I feel like I have become extreme on them to keep her just on the edge of my life .

My sister worries about ever getting married , as she really doesn't want my mother and father in the same room, mainly because if my mother . She's a hot head. Especially with drink who knows wtf could happen . 

Anyone else have a really normal yet fucked up relationship with a family member . 

My mother just brings out a side of me I don't like , because I always feel like I've been defending myself against her , that I can never trust her . Although there is less bullshit these but that's because I don't live with her and I keep her at arm's length ."
1281,Why do I get so mad randomly over little things?,"I’m (26F) a calm person for the most part but I do have ADHD,anxiety and depression. I have really learned to go with the flow since I’ve been in my 20’s but I get triggered by little things sometimes. 

this is a great example of things I get mad about...

Today I went to the post office to ship 2 packages but I forgot my tape at home to tape on the shipping labels, I thought surely they’d give me a few pieces of tape at the post office. I went in there and asked and they told me they absolutely could not do that, it was against policy. 

That just annoyed me to the bone. I was soooo freakin annoyed and kind of angry tbh. I didn’t let it show but when I got in my car I was so angry and thought about it for a few minutes. 

Things like this randomly happen to me. It’s so weird because I can be super calm about huge things but little things really irk me."
1282,I don’t know what I enjoy anymore,"Hello! First time posting so sorry if I say something against the rules. But anyways I’m 21f still in college. I developed my first panic attack and to anxiety back when I was 19. It was horrible and I didn’t know what to do except distract myself with work. Yes I was able to work and work and my bf was my only escape for me to not have anxiety or panic attacks. I liked my job as well. There were fun people. Then it got so bad I started taking anti anxiety meds and I’m three days I ended up in the hospital. I think the med did bad than good. I was in there for two weeks and surprisingly, hospitals made me feel calm. The fact that I didn’t have to do anything and when I needed any help, it was one button away. Then I left the hospital and I had my downs for like a month but then was able to recover fully. I was able to travel and go to parties and raves and had the best year of my life. I had great time going on dates and finding a bf. Then it hit again in the form of health anxiety. Since then I’ve been better but occasional panic attacks and anxiety. Now I’m struggling with depression as well. I feel like if it was anything but health anxiety, then I would be able to overcome it. But now I feel stuck. I don’t feel as much anxiety anymore but I get waves of depression. Some days are better than others but the problem is I don’t know what I enjoy anymore. I don’t know what brings me the joy that I felt when I went to raves and parties. I don’t hang out with people at raves and parties anymore because I feel like it’s part of what causes my anxiety. And now I’m left with no excitement. I don’t know what to look forward to anymore. I hate how I could only find my value on these events and can’t find what I like. I started going to school and have a job but both seems so grey. Like in the past I was able to make friends in school and at work I had a lot of friends that I hung out with after work. But now that I changed my major people in my class are so focused and at my new job, I feel like we don’t click as much. Sorry this got quite long but I guess I just wanted to vent somewhere. Thanks for listening :)"
1283,I need advice...,"   
hi, i have a big problem. I have been seeing a psychiatrist for 1 year today. He diagnosed me with severe depression. I already told him about things that happened to me but never enough for him to understand that it is really horrible. I explain myself, I see and I hear things which, apparently, are not real but which make me live a living nightmare almost all the time. It can be eyes, coming out of the walls, voices whispering things in an unknown language but the most recurrent is a humanoid form which often appears in a corner of my sight. Also there are centipede  the most on the time on my books. It's horrible I start to become crazy, the drugs do not work any more and I cannot speak about it because I am afraid of destroying the peace of my routine and my life, I do not want to end in hospital.  Thanks for your help i hope it will end."
1284,I'm just sad.,"And I really wish there was someone I could ask for a hug without a) weirding them out b) having them fear that I would infect them with the virus.

The loneliness hurts today."
1285,You know what? I'm not doing that great.,"I've been repeating to myself and everyone else over and over again that I'm ok and that so many people are facing so much worse situations and I know my fiance and I will be fine, but even though all of that is true, I'm not doing great. 

I'm worried about my friends who've been laid off or had their businesses shut down for over a month now. 

I'm worried about my physical and mental health not being able to go out and do all the things I love doing. 

April is a hard as f*ck month for my fiance and I, full of loss and heartache. We lost his Mom a year ago yesterday and a close friend of mine two years before that on the same day. 

And now today my fiance got laid off. 

We are going to be fine financially. We can afford our mortgage and bills on my income and the EI he will collect, and I have no concerns about my job stability at the moment. I'm able to work from home full time for the foreseeable future and have no reason to be concerned that might change. 

But I'm worried about the toll this is going to take on his mental health and it is a lot of pressure knowing that we cannot afford for me to lose my job too. 

I'm emotionally exhausted but I feel like I need to just suck it up and be strong because I truly don't have it that bad and the people I normally lean on are in far more difficult and precarious situations than me. 

The worst part about him being laid off today is that all I want is to be able to talk to his Mom but I can't and I'm so tired of all these things that keep happening that I want to talk to her about and the constant reminders that she's just gone and that's that. 

I'm lucky that I have a great family too, but when it comes to stuff relating to my fiance, I don't feel comfortable talking to my family about it the way I used to talk to his Mom about his stuff. It doesn't really feel like it's their business in the same way. 

It just hurts and it sucks and I fucking hate the month of April. 

But hey, I'm starting to see a few glimpses of green pop up in my garden so that's nice."
1286,I want to get help but I’m afraid to get help,I just don’t want to want to get diagnosed with bipolar disorder which is what my mom has and has caused her issues all her life.
1287,Memory suppressing?,"So I’ve recently read a lot about past traumas and how it’s important to take a look back at who you were before and work through past traumas to understand where your present problems stem from. 

I have a hard time however trying to remember myself when I was younger such as memories from early childhood and memories from my first two years of high school. I used to think it was normal to not really remember your childhood but apparently it’s not? And even if that was the case, why is it so hard for me to remember things from when I was 14/15? Surely I was grown enough to be able to process memories at that time. 

I did read that if you experienced a lot of mental trauma and abuse during certain parts of life, your brain tries to suppress those memories because they are painful, but how can I open myself back up to them? I’m having a hard time doing so and I want to understand where my present issues stem from."
1288,Not sure what's going on,"Since I left college 2 years ago (UK) I've been dealing with these thoughts that come around during the holidays. They're very random, last year during my summer off I compulsively researched something wrong and almost convinced myself to drop out of university. After that I got a car then developed this fear that I'll accidentally commit a hit and run without knowing. I always check my car after a journey for damage just in case.

I then got scared of being arrested during the Christmas off for no reason and now with this lockdown I've developed a fear that someone will steal my desktop and all my files. I've started locking my bedroom door every night but the thought still hits me at night.

What is this supposed to be? It's like everyday is fine until these random thoughts cause massive anxiety and worry. When I was young I had a habit of checking my laptop to see if it was still there but that was small compared to all the worrying I do now.

I tried going to a gp but all they did was give me a number to call a helpline instead of booking an appointment and hopefully getting me some medication or something. Does anybody know what this could be and what I can do to stop worrying so much?"

1290,Should I feel guilty about running a secret Instagram fan account?,"Hello everyone,

So I currently run an account on Instagram that focuses on video games. I just reached five thousand followers and am quickly gaining more. I also get an average of about 500-700 likes on a photo now. This account is something nobody knows about, not my friends or my family. I never intended to get this my traction on this account so now I am starting to feel guilty about it. I also am gaining alot of followers quicker now so I could potentially end up with way more. I refuse to tell anyone about it for obvious reasons but should I feel guilty about not telling anyone especially my parents, btw im in college?"
1291,I feel like a creep and a piece of human trash,"Hey so I don’t know if this is really the right sub for this but everyone here has been so nice in the past, and this is affecting my mental health so I thought I’d post it here. So I’m 18M and broke up with my first ever girlfriend about 7 months ago after only a month long relationship. I didn’t take this well at all and went down a whole road of mental health problems, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety etc, which were likely present anyway, and just triggered by the event.

That’s just the background. The problem is that I kept looking at her Instagram very regularly ever since,right up until very recently. She went inactive on Instagram for some months after the breakup, and recently became active again maybe a month or two ago. So I started viewing her story obviously as her account was public (we unfollowed each other), and she obviously noticed me because she blocked me. This is where my behaviour gets worrying and embarrassing. I used my secondary account (for a business) to continue viewing her story, and she then blocked that account too, because she obviously figured out that it was me. I then started making throwaway accounts a lot to see if she’d posted anything and then immediately delete them, filled with shame and self-loathing. I did the same today and noticed that she’d put her account to private, possibly because she noticed the random accounts viewing her story and guessed that it was me.

Obviously this is embarrassing and unacceptable behaviour and I’m hoping that you don’t judge me, which no one ever has in this community. I know it’s creepy and weird, but I just can’t move on and I miss her a lot. Let me make it clear that I wish no harm upon this girl, I do not intend to harm her or harass her or cause her any trouble at all, I’m not that kind of person. It’s just a weakness for her on my part. But yeah, I feel like a creep, a weirdo and a piece of shit to be honest. I dread to think what she thinks of me now, and I feel so small and worthless because of this. I’m hoping someone has some words of comfort or maybe some advice on what to do. Please be kind though, this is the most embarrassing thing for me and I already judge myself enough for it, any judgement that you voice will only make it worse. Thank you for reading."
1292,I talk to friends that aren't here.,"So, back in September I was at a party and there were lost of close friends of mine, I tried to drink as little as possible knowing that I get drunk very easily, but we played a drinking game and I lost a couple of times and I got a little bit tipsy. Everything was ok till we decided to watch a movie and a close friend of mine sit next to me, he started touching me and when we went to bed he slept with me since the rest of the girls were sleeping with their boyfriends, he started touching me aggressively, I pretended to be asleep and there were people in the room with us so he didn't do anything. Since then I keep talking to myself, but is more like I talk with someone, like I have a real conversation with someone even tho I am alone. It gotten worse since the quarantine and I feel like i am going insane. The thing is that i always seem to talk to my friends, especially the boy from September and my crush. I kinda stopped talking to my best friends and even though they are concerned about me I feel anxious... (sorry if my english is bad tho, it's my second language)."
1293,Does anyone else go through old text conversations you had with friends to try and find some happiness in them?,I tend to do this every couple weeks when I'm sad. And it sometimes helps but then it also makes me sad at the same time
1294,I give up...,"I'm a 13f and right now I'm laying in my bed crying. Due to quarentine ive had to do online school, its hard for me even though my grades are high, and I have a lot of missing work that I feel like I will never finish, I'm grounded and I cant play games until all the missing work is turned in. Its been hard for me and now i really dont care if I'm grounded anymore, I just give up.

Please I need help and quick."
1295,A matter of not knowing how to describe something,"Last night I had a particularly bad panic attack. Ever since, I've had a peculiar sensation like... like that video effect where every time something moves it leaves behind an after-image trail that moves a half-second later. But I'm not the first thing that moves. I'm the thing that trails after and jolts back into place when it stops.

And I honestly dont even begin to know what to search for or to say to describe what's wrong. Any help is appreciated and whole I'm not concerned for my safety, it's disconcerting at best."
1296,My head is a scary place to be.,"Due to this Covid-19 quarantine, and my past battles with depression, I have been having these thoughts that scare me. Just the other day, I remember just thinking about death and suicide. First there was that part where I said to myself, ""You're just stuck inside, and no one is around, just kill yourself."" Then, the moment where I thought about who would and wouldn't really care. I.e. brush it off, laugh at the fact, or who would genuinely be heart broken. Then, the part where I actually contemplated it and thought about ways I would do it.  My mind, is full of fucking bear traps, I step in one and hurt myself each time till I'm eventually dead. Thankfully it hasn't gotten that bad. I've tried going to therapy, but I feel I'm just not ready to tell a random person, even if it stays between us, how I feel and my feelings and intentions. I'm scared that one day my mind will win and I will no longer be alive to see another day. I don't know why I posted this but I guess I felt the need to tell someone over Reddit over IRL."
1297,I hope someone can help me,"Hey all. I hope you can give me some advice. My friend I met over xbox life has become one of my better friends but from what he's told me every now and again, he has some issues. He is autistic, depressed, has OCD and I think he told me he's suicidal. He's also very materialistic, especially about sex (mind you he is 16). He said that he's had 1 or 2 bad ex's that were basically sluts and now he can't trust anyone like that anymore(also the reason he doesn't have many friends besides me). But 2 days ago he said that he became friends with a couple girls and he's gonna meet up with them for sex after all this corona stuff

I know that it's not a good idea for him to do that, especially with his problems but I don't know how to tell him that without losing a friend"
1298,My (25F) brother (29M) literally beat himself up and I’m struggling to help him,"My brother literally beat himself up tonight over his ex girlfriend. I’m trying to be more sympathetic towards him because he is taking the break up really hard (together for 8 years and have 2 kids) but his actions are very irresponsible and he doesn’t seem to understand this. He’s been living with my mum and me since the split. He came home tonight from watching his children whilst their mum (his ex) was at work. His face is really swollen and one eye is closed shut. 

I’m not sure why this happened tonight exactly but I do know be’s terrified of the thought of his ex moving on, believes she cheated in the relationship and is very vocal about it, and oscillates day to day from loving her to hating her. He has spoken to several other girls and has slept with someone since, but he loses his mind at the thought of his ex getting into a new relationship. It’s definitely taking a toll on him and I guess tonight he was alone with his thoughts and it got to him. 

He arrived home and my mum and I both shouted at him when we saw his face and he explained he punched himself repeatedly. We didn’t really get to the “are you okay?” section, instead we both jumped to saying he’s stupid, that he could have really hurt himself and then the kids would have been unsupervised should anything happen. He said they were asleep but other than that didn’t really consider the fact he could have caused serious harm to himself and therefore his kids also. 

I want to know how to approach this further in terms of being more understanding to his mental health as he is self harming whilst trying to not feel like an arsehole when I shout at him for not only being inconsiderate of his own safety but his children’s too. I’ve always been a little devoid of sympathy but I know he needs a shoulder to lean on right now. However his actions aren’t okay. The break up was 4 months ago and I feel his acts of aggression to himself will only worsen and I want to be able to talk to him. Any help?

tl;dr my brother beat himself up over an ex when he was alone with his children and I’m struggling to sympathise

1299,Extreme paranoia,"I constantly feel unsafe, it affects me constantly especially when I’m alone. I am always afraid of everything from the paranormal to people who want to do bad things. I sleep very poorly and take melatonin - circadin sleeping pills which help to some extent but doesn’t solve the issue. I am always well armed and very careful. Even with alarms, security cameras and motion detectors I still never feel safe, not even in my own home. Is there any way to change this? I struggle everyday because of it. I have looked at online tests (the in depth ones with 50+ questions) and symptoms for Paranoid Schizophrenia but I highly doubt I have it, any advice? Note that in my situation it’s difficult for me to access a psychiatrist/psychologist. Please help!"
1300,I don't know if I have a sexuality problem or not,"\[Sorry for any English mistakes\]

I don't know if I have an actual problem, or that I'm too engaged with psychological theories (about traumas and such). 

I suspect I have a problematic relationship with sexuality. I don't know if it's the usual awkwardness most people have, or that I have an actual issue I should deal with.

I have this really vague memory from my childhood. When I was 7 or 8 I was friends with our neighbor, who was 12 at that time. I know (mainly because my family says so) that we used to hang out a lot, but I barely have memories from those times. I barely have memories from my childhood whatsoever, my memory is generally pretty bad - I lose things quickly. Anyway, when I was 15 I was struck with this one memory: I was in this neighbor's room, laying on his bed (clothed) and he was on top of me (clothed as well). I could feel his penis through the cloths, and I remember trying to slightly move him so I wouldn't feel it, but he kept positioning himself back to that uncomfortable position. I vividly remember the physical feeling. That's all I remember. 

Fast forward to this day: I'm 22 and I've barely had any romantic or sexual engagement with men in my life. I tend to ascribe it to my pickiness and my mental difficulties (slight social anxiety, depression).

The main sexual engagement I had so far was with a guy I met in Berlin. We went (with another friend) to a sex club (I didn't really know it was going to be this sexual). The dance floor had giant screens playing porn. People made out everywhere, walked around naked and in the dark areas they were literally fucking. I saw a man fingering a woman (for the first time in my life I was witnessing a sexual act IRL). It made me feel sick and I sat all evening near the entrance, waiting for my friends. 

I remember feeling extremely depressed during the drive back home (I should say that I was already slightly depressed earlier in the evening, before we even got in). I didn't know why, but I felt awful, like I was violated, although nothing happened to me there. I still don't know why I felt that way.

I kind of want to try therapy, but also don't. I don't really believe in ""digging up"" my childhood traumas - I'm really skeptical it can help me heal (from my other problems).

I just don't really know if I have a problem that's related to sexuality or that I'm just depressed because -. Well I don't really know why, sometimes I just feel emotional pain. I usually ascribe it to not being in a relationship, or not having enough friends, or not loving myself. But sometimes I don't understand it, like that pain that came after the sex club."
1301,what happened to me,"what is happening

I was an underweight kid for most of my 17 years on earth. A few years ago I weighed 33kg (72 lbs) and then during summer going into 8th grade I gained 5kg (11lbs). After that I gained 11kg (24lbs) over the years. I dont know how tall I was back then but probably 5’0 or 5’1 so the 72 lbs wasn’t that skinny for my height. 
Now I am 5’2 and I weight 49 kg (108 lbs) so now im somewhat healthy I guess.
I didn’t intentionally gain weight back then it happened naturally.
But I also wasn’t skinny intentionally. 
I have fast metabolism, my mom is skinny my grandma is skinny so because of genes and then I also were never a hungry person whatsoever. I didn’t lost appetite I was never a hungry person in the first place. I just started recently eating 3 meals a day since quarantine to be more specific. Before that I usually ate some snacks in school and then two meals at home. On some days during the week tho I only ate lunch and a pack of junkfood. And sometimes only a pack of junkfood. My issue is I am not fucking hungry I have to force myself to eat most of the days it was worse back then but now it got better. I just don’t understand the lack of appetite i have I’m not depressed i don’t thrive to have some sort of ideal body I never restricted my self to eat I never did a diat 
Idk even know if I had some sort of eating disorder back then cuz yes I was fucking skinny but I only had lack of appetite that was always the case nothing more blthing less"
1302,Gf and I really struggling,"So we have been together for a few years now, moved in together in September, officially on 1 lease since the beginning of the month. A combination of the quarantine and bedroom issues are really stressing and hurting our relationship and mental. In short, we have had less and less sex and she blames me of not being there during it amd I am in my own head everytime trying to be there and not mess it up and its caused things to be really awkward. We have tried talking about it and we seem good but then a few days to by and it starts to get weird again and we cant get out of the cycle. It seems like a physical solution would ease our mental strain but its the mental strain thats causing the physical issue so we are stuck in a loop and its just really getting to be a lot."
1303,Is it common to get increased appetite and constant dizziness?,.
1304,Is it common to get constant all day dizziness after stop taking SSRI's?,?
1305,Online school is horrible,"I just can’t do this. It’s impossible to concentrate, no matter how much I try I can’t get any work done. I break down and cry after almost every class. I miss my friends so much, they were pretty much the only reason I kept going to school, and now I don’t have that. This situation is fucked, it’s every bad thing of going school and every bad part of going to school, without any of the good of either. 

I hope this pandemic doesn’t last too long, I just can’t take this anymore."
1306,I’m Wiggin our I can feel it,"Now to preface this I probably have some sort of confirmation bias in addition to what ever mental health issues are consuming me. 
I already have this illogical fear that I’m being watched and my actions are being recorded, but to compound on this now when I listen to podcasts or tv shows comedy even music. They will start to sync up to my life in usually negative ways, describing my surroundings, my mental state, or even as far as an action I’ve started but haven’t completed yet. Now I understand that these “moments” I’m having should be entirely coincidental and I’m the one applying them to myself. But the inter part of me screams if I were to go back and play it again the outcome would be different. Maybe it wouldn’t even have the same words as before. Of course when I go back it’s the same as it was and now the timing is off. However; what if this media I’m consuming is intentional curated for me due to my online activity and they know far more about me then I can even begin to understand I’m actions are watched and my mental health is being monitored. This whole thing has got me on edge and idk what to do about it"

1308,Why do you live?,What are your reasons to stay a live through the bad times?  I can't think of much myself except not to upset those around me so I'd like to hear about your reasons.
1309,Medication,"Have any of you guys taken Adderall, vyvance, or Zoloft and had any bad side effects?"
1310,"Having a tough time with work, not sure what to do"," I'm a college student and I work at a grocery store and my job makes me absolutely miserable. I have really bad anxiety, especially around people I don't know. My anxiety had been getting a lot better, pretty much non existent, but then I got this job and since then my mental health has pretty much gone down the toilet. They work me ridiculous hours, bosses treat me with zero respect, customers constantly rude to me, ill have multiple panic attacks a day sometimes depending on how busy the store is. This on top of trying to juggle my school work and my home life is just overwhelming to say the least. I don't think I've ever been more unhappy in my life. I decided to post here because I feel like no one really understands me in my life. I try to talk to my parents, but they just tell me to ""suck it up"" and ""thats just the way life is"" but I seriously don't know how much longer I can survive living like this. I am overwhelmingly unhappy in my current circumstances. I can't quit due to the state of the economy right now and the fact that I have bills to pay, plus this is my first job, so I just feel like any other job I would qualify for would suck just as bad. I just feel so trapped and helpless. Its gotten to the point where I've really started letting myself go too. My place is a wreck. I used to love dressing up and now I barely put in an effort.Plus between work and school I have no time to take care of my mental health.. I just don't know how to dig myself out of this."
1311,A video for people that feel lonely or depressed in quarantine,https://youtu.be/hEUp-_LWY1o
1312,I just want to cry myself to sleep every night,"To start this off quarantine hasn’t effected my mental heath very much. Growing up i was so used to having family say I love you and things like that but I’ve never really felt like they mean it. When they say it it’s not sarcastic they genuinely mean it. The problem is I don’t feel the connection.

Since I was young I’ve been emotionally pushing my parents away mainly because they lack understanding. I rarely ever tell my parents I love them, usually when it’s forced. And due to not having a good relationship with anyone in the family I have nobody to connect with emotionally. I mean yeah I have close friends but mostly guys so we never discuss feeling. 

Also I am below average on the attractive scale and have trouble talking to girls. I am scared to be in a relationship with one and become emotionally dependent on them, then breakup and have nobody again. I can’t even talk to girls and them seem slightly interested in me without becoming immediately fall in love with them. So I cry myself to sleep a lot"
1313,I don't care about anything and here's why,"Yup, it's exacly as the title says: I don't really care about anything.
As much as I would love to make a joke about my situation I can't because it's too serious for me.
It's been a long time since I actually cared about something and was able to devote my time and attention to it for more than a few days or, in rare cases, a few weeks or months. I remember vividly when I last felt truly happy and content, and I know exactly why I'm feeling this way. Brace yourselves, I'm about to tell y'all what I've never told anyone and probably never will.
It's a very long story but I'll just sumarize (this is the biggest lie I've ever told).
I've never been in a successful relationship, meaning I've never had a girlfriend for more than a few weeks and it was all just meh. The first (and probably last) time I fell in love and felt true love was a big mistake. I am a genuinely nice person and for me there is nothing more important than respect and honesty.
So basically, I've been seeing this girl for 7 months and we never became anything serious. After those 7 months of her pretending to care I found out she's been seeing another guy for over 5 months, during the time we were together. I swear I could feel my heart shatter into a dozen of pieces the moment I found out. I didn't really feel sad. Yes, I'm a man, and yes I cried, but that's about it. I cried for an hour when I found out and that's where it all ended. The following day I didn't feel sadness, I just felt empty. I was empty and my very soul felt betrayed. Obviously, it didn't help that I've been betrayed and used my whole life leading up to that point, but that's a whole another story that I'd have to sit down with you, smoke a few blunts and talk for an hour straight to tell you about. But let's get back on track, I know I ramble on for no reason but bear with me, this is all important information, I promise.
So after that whole thing ended I was left feeling disappointed and kinda disgusted. I couldn't believe that a person that I cared so much about could do something so shameful and act like she did nothing wrong. At some point during that period I promised myself that I would never care for and trust another person for the rest of my life, apart from my family.
At the time I had tons of friends, I hung out with 10-20 people actively, and I felt like I belonged somewhere, like somebody cared about me. However, after that point I couldn't help but notice the changes in my personality and also the way my friends started treating me because of that. Not a single one of them asked me if I was doing fine, and I'm not the type of person to talk about my feelings unless someone asks me about it. That shit put me in an even deeper hole because I realised how many people ACTUALLY gave a fuck. The answer was zero. All of those friends that I spent most of my time with showed me in that period how much they cared about me. When I stopped being the loud funny crazy guy in the group that is always up for the challenge I quickly fell out of their little...well, group.
I matured a lot in that time when I realised what people can do and how they can do a 180 and completely erase the image you had of them for years. I felt so much older than all of my friends because I realised some things they won't for another decade. I realised how important respect and honesty truly is.
I started distancing myself from people, I cut off all of those friends, I only talk to some of them and that'a only because we're in a group chat so we send messages from time to time. Do i feel bad about it? Fuck no. They didn't give me the respect and love that I deserved, why would I treat them any differently than they treated me? Of course, that doesn't mean I have anything bad to say about them. I spent the best days of my life (so far) with them and for that I am forever grateful. I still respect them for that but I'm not really in love with how little they cared about me.
It's about time I wrap this post up, it's my first reddit post and boy is it a long one. So to sumarize: I've been through a lot of things I shouldn't have gone through at such a young age. I am 20 years old now but I feel 37 because of all the knowledge I've collected in the period of 2 years where I started seeing things as they really are. That just resulted in me feeling empty and not caring about anything because in the end nothing is worth my energy. I don't know how to fix it (yet), and I know none of you can help me fix it (most likely), but I'm still here writing this because I want to get my message across to someone who might feel the same way I do. Listen, and listen carefully: everything, and I do mean everything, in life will eventually pass. Friends, girls, jobs, good and bad times. Just keep going through all of the crap, keep standing on your feet and don't let anyone or anything take away your value. You are unique and special, no matter what anyone says.
Now, if you've actually read all of this and didn't just skip to the end I respect the fuck out of you. You cared for a random ass stranger venting about his misfortune and that's extremely rare. If you do have any advice I definitely want to hear it. If you don't have advice and have an opinion or a story to tell, share it in the comments and I'll gladly read it.
Thanks again for your attention and I sincerely apologize for this long ass post. I'm complicated and like to go into a lot of details. That's it, spread love and positivity and stay safe y'all."
1314,My boyfriend hates me journaling.,"I’ve journaled since I was a young girl. I would go through phases of journaling daily, to not journal my for a few months. Since moving across the country from any friends or family (and not having very much of those people to begin with) I’ve tried to really prioritize journaling to vent and work through my emotions, eating disorder and depression.
I actually finished an entire journal which was pretty ground breaking and am starting a second book. I’m pretty proud of myself. It took me exactly one year to finish it. Anyways, recently my relationship with my boyfriend (whom I live with) has become extremely rocky. It sucks but I’ve been writing a lot more to let out my emotions and get a lot off my mind. I’m filled with a lot of anxiety surrounding general life but also surrounding our relationship. He thinks I’m writing endless amounts of shit about him. Which I’m not. Sometimes if I’m pissed off but mainly I write out arguments and situational things. I have no one to talk to about literally anything so when I write I feel like I’m talking to someone. 
But he absolutely hates it. Says I’m writing about him, and I’m so selfish for it. That I’m gonna use everything I write against him some day. Which I would never. But he thinks If I killed myself that the police would somehow twist my journal against him too. How do I get through to him and explain that wouldn’t happen? I would never ever use my emotions and thoughts against him. I just don’t know what to do otherwise. I have no outlets. Thnx"
1315,Sick family member,"Hi everyone.  I have a mentally sick family member who has been diagnosed with manic and schizophrenia.  She lost her mind about 6 months ago.  Her father has the same issue.  We were able to obtain a mental health warrant and she was in the hospital for about 14 days and released that's as long as they can hold her.  She doesn't think she has a problem but she talks to things that aren't there and she is highly emotional, immediately spiteful and hateful to all of our family.  She Ubers around showing up unanounced to random family and friends.  She has claimed she has been raped about 10 times lately.  Her behavior is highly irradic and she seems like a danger to herself or others.  After she threatened a family member we were able to execute another metal health warrant so she is off the streets again and she will be in the hospital for 14 more days.  The only real mental facility has a 300 bed waiting list.  So she will just be back at it and who knows what will happen.  It's very frightening. My question is, does anyone have any other ideas or solutions?  We just want to see her get the help she needs but she is refusing help and we don't know what to do.  Thanks for reading."
1316,something positive that came out of your struggle with your mental health?,"I know right now is a really hard time, so is there something positive that has happened in your life out of maybe less than ideal circumstances?

for me, I think it has to be my sympathy for others.  so many people in my life had no idea I was struggling, and it has made me a much kinder person to others.  I also have a much more sympathetic heart for people who are getting looked over, it has made me much more aware and I tend to try to look for those people who are sitting alone, look socially anxious, uncomfortable, sad, etc.

I know it's a really hard time, maybe try to look for a tiny positive :)"

1320,"I chose to end my relationship of over 3 years, this week - quarantine is not helping.","I decided I had to end my relationship with the father of my child recently, mostly because he is pretty emotionally abusive and uninvolved. For the most part, I have had to cut off all my friends while being with him because of jealousy issues, so now I'm essentially alone in this battle.

 I have had depression since my very early teens, and my most effective coping skill has always been keeping busy: going window shopping, book stores, coffee shops and etc. - not an option right now.

I was watching TV during quarantine and suddenly started obsessively checking if the shows I was watching were all secretly connected by a set of secret keys.  Like I watched Twin Peaks, and then listened to ""This is America"" by Donald Glover, and I suddenly started crying and laughing at full blast because I thought the song was secretly about Twin Peaks.  This kind of obsessive thinking and unusual emotional combinations is not at all normal for me.

I was so sure I was right, that I tried to share this with my friends and family, and people on the subreddits for the shows.  I was so sure of myself at first, but I understand now that what I am experiencing is a mental health issue. 

I got out of the mental hospital 2 years ago, for a suicide attempt.  And now, because of how isolated I am after disturbing my friends and family with my crazy theories, I feel small urges building up to hurt myself or end my own life.  So I spoke to a mental health officer on the phone, who video called me with a counselor, but it wasn't very helpful.

1325,Getting over childhood trauma,"Hey Reddit, I just want some advice on how to get over the trauma from being bullied as a child. 

Growing up, my years at school were terrible, I was bullied not only by my fellow classmates but also my teachers. Where I grew up, they have a bad stigma against anyone that are more “privileged” than them, this applies to social and financial statuses. My family was blessed to have enough money to support me and my fellow classmates were not happy with this. They would often make me feel guilty for having better or more expensive school supplies than them. They would steal from me, or they would gang up and beat me after school. During all my school years growing up, I could not make a single friend and everyone would just insult me for no reason. I would blame myself and question my existence, I would tell my family to not buy me “expensive” school supplies anymore because I want to be accepted, however, wit how our schools system work, we are stuck with the same people for the entirety of the years we have (elementary, secondary, college). 

The teachers would chime in with the other students, they would call me stupid, rip my notebooks in half if I cannot answer a question in class, or just get smacked in the face. While my classmates put chalk on my seat and rubbish on my desk etc. There are many more things that happened but I do not want to remember them. I felt so isolated and sad for many many years, now I am in my late twenties but I am still unable to cope with the pain from being bullied. I think after all the years of being bullied has led me to be isolated socially and I am unable to maintain any friendships in my adulthood. Can anyone give me any advice on what I can do to improve my mental health/ my social skills? 

Thanks for taking your time to read this"

End of our chat. So do y'all think I took it too far?"
1328,Lost!,Struggling lately and when the feelings mount I haven’t been able to locate an anonymous source to call just to talk.  I don’t want records kept and reported to anyone ... I just need to talk and I feel like I have no where to turn
1329,Will taking multivitamins and fish oil help with depression?,I'm trying everything at this point to start feeling better without antidepressants.
1330,I can’t talk about anything even remotely personal with my parents.,"Seriously. Talking to them about feelings is the absolute worst. I don’t know why. I can’t stand any form of physical affection from them. I can barely even say “I love you” to them. I may have a few times, but even when I was younger and they would say goodnight and that they love me, I would always just say “you too.”. I could never say the love.

Even now I can’t. I can’t force myself to talk to them about what’s really going on inside. So I fake it. In fact, they probably think I’m doing good right now. That I’m not struggling. They don’t know the truth.

They don’t know that I’m starting off the 4th quarter of senior year failing math because I couldn’t bring myself to do the work until it was too late. 

They don’t know that I don’t like who I am.

They don’t know that I’m about to throw away my future. That when May 1st hits, I won’t be going to the college I worked hard to get into because I feel like it’s pointless. I’ve had teachers help me get in, and I feel guilty because I’ll have wasted their time. They don’t know it yet, but they’ll be disappointed in me.

They don’t know that the reason I sleep late is because the later I sleep, the quicker the day ends.

But they also don’t know that I also stay up late distracting myself on my phone so that the thoughts are tamed for longer. 

They don’t know how pathetic I think I am. How much I feel I annoy everyone. 

They don’t know that I’m pushing people away.

And I’m afraid. I’m afraid that if/when someone else finds out, and if/when they tell my parents, my parents won’t believe it. They won’t believe it, and I’ll once again play it off as no big deal.

Even if they did believe it, last time someone told them I should see a therapist, they told me they would look for one, and didn’t do a thing. So why should I trust them?

It sucks. It sucks when you do have one person you trust, but you can’t reach out to them because you’re too afraid you’re just a bother, and even if they tell you you’re never a bother, you still end up believing that you are and that they’re just saying that to be polite. You think about how your mental health is the last thing they’d ever want to deal with. After all, they have better things to worry about. They have their own life, their own family, their own personal issues. So why should they care? They’ve shown that they care before, but you just can’t stop the nagging feeling that you really just annoy them. 

Besides what could they do other than tell your parents? They tell them, and then your parents say that you’ve seemed normal. They think maybe you’re doing it for attention. But they don’t know the truth. They never will. 

Chances are, no one will, because I’m an idiot who can’t get up the damn courage to say anything to anyone."
1331,Feels like I’m degrading,"Since quarantine it feels like every day i almost sometimes feel sick and I don’t think I actually am, I think its all a mind game that im trying to fight."
1332,Almost daily near panic attacks,Quarantine and school ending I think is the reason. I’m not sure if sleeping and diet affects it but I hope I can fix it.
1333,I'm so lost,"I've pretty much lost all my friends, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do with myself anymore everything that kept me going is gone from me. I've been having increasingly more and more bad days where I question why I'm still going on why I don't just end it. For awhile before quarantine I was doing okay I had my few friends that were still around I had school and now it's all gone."
1334,My girlfriend is showing symptoms of BPD and I need help understanding what this means.,"My girlfried (17) has been showing several signs of BPD for a few years now.  She hasn't taken the test yet but she's planning on pursuing a diagnosis after COVID-19.  She recently started seeing a new therapist but isn't comfortable talking about it over the phone so she's waiting until they can meet in person again.

I found an informative animation on YouTube that got the general idea across but I still have several unanswered questions about it.

What are the treatments, if any?
What happens if the test comes back negative?  Can she still recieve treatment for her issues that led her to seek a diagnosis?
Is there anything I can do yo let her know that I understand and want to help without coming across as patronising?
What can I do to understand further?
How can I support her through this?

I'm on the spectrum so I can sometimes have trouble emphasizing with people and I sometimes come across as unempathetic despite caring deeply.  I really want to make an effort to let her know that I care and am here for her, and no mattet what happens I'll still love her."
1335,"I'm depressed, anxious and insecure, i don't know what to do.","Hello, lately a lot has happened in my life. Over the last year and a half i have changed to a completely different person, i don't recognize myself. However, i am happy about this i think it's a good thing, i am not complaining by a long shot. However, a lot of negative things have happened in my life recently too. 

Firstly a little back story on my mental health, i have suffered from mental health my entire life, It's been a big problem my entire life. I have been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome from a young age, i have also since I've been a teenager (i'm 16) suffered from and been diagnosed with severe Anxiety and Depression. Also at the end of next month i'm going to get diagnosed with ADHD. So there is quite a lot going wrong with me.

I have come to accept that these issues will be problems i will have to fight for my entire life, it will and the thought of that scares me. However, i have already learned many strategies to help me cope with this all. So it's not all bad.

However onto the current problems. About two months ago my first girlfriend left me. That completely and utterly killed me. I was in a non functional state for about a week, it got to the point where i could not even make a tea because my nerves where so bad i couldn't pour the water without spilling it everywhere. I also didn't sleep for four days straight and was basically bed ridden for an entire week, I couldn't function. 

However, i have recovered from that now and am feeling much better about things as a whole, i am still missing her a bit but all in all i am over it. Due to that event though, i did stop my studies, i'm currently studying a web development course. I do not enjoy it i hate it whole heatedly, not that i don't get the work or anything, i will say more on that later. But i stopped because there was no way i could sit at my desk and write computer code for hours on end, it was physically impossible for me to do that because of the amount of mental stress and anxiety i was under due to the breakup. 

I am desperately trying to catch up now as i need to pass that course. See, i have always been deeply deeply interested into computers. It's been an obsession since i was a little kid, i drove my parents mad due to my obsession over computers. It still is an obsession and i love tinkering with them, its one of the only things that keeps me sane in this world. 

However, i was always quite knowledgeable, even from an extremely young age i just seemed to understand computers and how they work and the terminology as such. However, lately since I've been depressed and all, i have lost all interest in doing anything remotely technical, i spend my days now watching YouTube and browsing Reddit on my computers instead of teaching myself computer programming and computer science. Two things i used to do all the time.

I am beginning to feel extremely insecure about this, to the point where i feel like crying sometimes, i just don't understand it as much anymore. I have lost information due to depression that i craved before. I don't know how to stop this and i don't know how to get it back. 

As you can probably hear from my language i am quite distressed at the moment, because the only thing i have in life that gives me joy and makes me feel like i have a purpose is being dragged out from below me and i can't do anything about it. 

Please help me."
1336,I have severe depression and anxiety. My SO has bipolar disorder. Sometimes it feels like too much for me to handle.,"As I stated above, I have my own mental health problems. But my SO has significantly worse symptoms and I’m not sure if I can take it.

Throwing dishes when she’s sad. Extreme unrealistic optimism when she’s happy. Both throw me off my stability and cause me to have bad mental health days, which in turn make her mental health even worse. 

It’s just too unstable for me sometimes and it’s starting to exacerbate my own symptoms. What should I do?"
1337,Quarantine Depression,"The longer I am home the more depressed I am becoming. Doing the same boring shit day in and day out is really starting to affect me. I miss socializing with people my age at college, video chatting just isn't the same. Being stuck at home with my parents is just awful. Who else is in a similar situation? I have too much time to myself to have negative thoughts now."
1338,James Holmes: The Untold Story of a Prisoner of His Mind,"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6Jp6zBl764&amp;t=

Part one is the testimony of Dr. Fenton.   You will hear highlights of her testimony, as she answers questions about her treatment sessions with Holmes and the mental status exams she administered.  

Dr. Fenton's observations and experiences reveal that James Holmes possessed the psyche of a person fraught with psychotic thoughts, delusions, and anxiety.  Dr. Fenton states, among other things, that she believed he was ""shifting insidiously into a schizophrenic state.""  She also expresses concern that ""he could perhaps hurt others.""  

But despite all these warnings, Dr. Fenton prescribes him an antidepressant (Zoloft), which appears to make him manic (increasing his energy) so he feels as if he's in ""hyperspeed.""  Add to this the fact that he fantasizes about killing everyone--and that the Zoloft made him ""lose the fear""-- and you get a barrage of red flags and warnings that somehow went unheeded.  

This is the untold story; the story of systemic problems in treating, managing, and sentencing those with mental illness. The story of pharmaceutical drugs that can have serious, life-threatening risks.  The story of unscrupulous prosecutors who exploit these horrific shootings for political gain, conveniently seeking the death penalty in the aftermath. They deliberately ignore the bigger picture--namely, the systemic shortcomings that allow these tragedies to occur."
1339,How do I get re diagnosed of schizophrenia. I don't think I have it,"Doctors need 6 months to diagnose someone of schizophrenia.t's been 3months and 19 days since my first diagnoses at one hospital. Then because my parents said I wasn't taking my meds cause it had been 20 days I didn't get refill for risperidone 2mg I went on an ambulance to a different facility where I was diagnosed with active psychosis and given an Invega Sustenna injection. Now I have a third and final different doctor and I want a therapist for re diagnosis, but due to Covid-19 face-to-face appointments even with masks are cancelled😭😭😭."
1340,I need help and don't know who to turn to. *Long post ahead*,"Hi! Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, I'll be cross-posting a bit because I'm a nervous wreck and I apologize in advance for how long this is.

Ok so to lay out some background I'm a 23 year old female and a senior in college, living in Florida with Hashimoto's, Cholinergic Urticaria and I'm currently borderline for Lupus. I also have generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, PTSD, and depression. 
Since last June, I have had a myriad of health issues and not a lot of progress beyond some dire news that its chronic and the treatments are expensive. To start with, I've had cholinergic urticaria since I was 11. It's an allergy that primarily presents in hives but that can have systemic issues as well, primarily with bp/hypotension, dizziness, nausea, angioedema, diarrhea, fatigue, bronchospasms, passing out, dehydration and heat stroke, and also anaphylaxis. I tend to fall on the more severe side of the spectrum as I've had many reactions over the years that go beyond the painful, itchy, burning hives. Its triggers are passive warming or active raises in body temp, so stress, spicey food, warm temperatures/heat and exercise are all very real and unfortunate triggers.
Arguably one could say to avoid triggers, and many people that suffer from this have found some ways to partially mitigate some effects but no where near all or a normal life. I currently live in Florida and have for some years now, so avoiding the heat isn't exactly an option as my allergic reactions are easily triggered.
Rarely did I have severe reactions before this past June, although they did happen and I, without a proper diagnosis past an initial visit or a real doctor, went 10 years before these reactions started to be more than unsightly, dizzying, and somewhat limiting but not wholly interfering with my day to day life.
I got sick with what was presumed mono, the blood tests came back weird from the urgent care, back in mid-June as my throat was swelling shut from an infection. I was given steroids that helped with the swelling but made me feel crazy and 3-hour long nightly panic attacks. Fast forward through the 5 weeks I was completely bed-ridden and out of my mind with stress and anxiety and an inability to really eat or drink and being moderly sick w/fever and brain-dead due to the nature of mono, while living alone and trying to balance two upper-level summer classes. Safe to say that summer was a nightmare but I did pass my classes, although with some difficulty. 
It wasn't until about September did I notice my allergic reactions were much more severe and easier to trigger. Walking the 5 minutes to class from my car left me covered and hives and on the verge of passing out, dizzy, etc, 2x in one week. Once that started happening, even leaving my apartment to my car provoked a reaction that took an hour to calm down. 
At this point I stopped leaving my apartment. I live on the third floor and the stress of repeated and worsening reactions has wrecked havoc on my life. 
I failed all but one of my classes last semester even after trying to explain and work with the professors. This stress and anxiety and isolation on top of getting worse and feeling sick even while inside at this point left me a dissociated mess for months.
I finally went to an allergist/immunologist to get help because antihistamines aren't very helpful at treating CU. He knew right off the bat I had CU on top of dermatographism, which is hives from pressure, and he tested me for autoimmune issues due to the on-set, longevity, and severity of my allergies. The ANA test came back with Hashimoto's and a positive for diseases that fall under CREST syndrome, which upon seeing a rheumatologist I was told means I'm borderline for Lupus. I got the ANA results in November, the Lupus results in January and it wasn't until a few weeks ago in March that I was able to be put on an lgE antibody shot, Xolair, to help mitigate some of my allergic reactions. So far it has helped with being able to at least walk to my car again, but stress/spicy food still brings out some hives but thankfully nothing as extreme as before. 
With the lockdown going on, I haven't wanted to push my luck trying to get back into any sort of exercise besides pacing my apartment during panic attacks or trying to get into yoga. 
Although the physical limitations are stressful, I've found that being unable to currently be properly re-tested and put on appropriate medication for my autoimmune diseases is causing more issues with mood, concentration, weight issues, fatigue, aches, constant tinnitus, and other issues that come and go but overall lead to never feeling healthy, motivated or normal anymore. My antibody count for Hashimoto's, which attacks the thyroid and hormonal production, doubled in less than 3 months and that was back in a January to a rather high count based on what others who have Hashimoto's list as their blood counts. The lupus has yet to be re-tested with the virus going on.
I'm not writing this as a pitying sense, it's my experiences and how I, stupidly, put myself into more college classes this spring and again, stupidly, didnt make any progress in past the first week of February and hadn't been able to focus since the last week or so due to external factors beyond my worsening health.
If it were just my health issues I know I could have done better or at least be more responsible in reaching out, getting through the summer of hell proved that even though things haven't been right since.
Adding on that I come from a rather physically, emotionally, verbally and, at some points sexually, abusive broken middle-class household. I'm still well-aware that I have more available to me than many others, especially with the crisis going on now. In no way do I mean to mitigate what others face or go through in their own lives.
My mother is a wildly angry and aggressive abusive drunk, and has been since I was 8 and partially led to my parents divorce when I was 12.  Since I was 16, it has been pushed as my responsibility to watch over/deal with her. My father, who is 18 years her senior and besides being emotionally stunted also thinks hitting everything and screaming, before he had his stroke when I found him at 14, at everyone gets results. I'd like to say the stroke mellowed him out but it just lead to a girlfriend that pushed for constant loud sex, couples trips, and me to get kicked out at 17, which by the way I would have gladly cut off all friends and be drug tested (even though I can't do drugs *allergies* and the few times I smoked pot gave me dissociative panic attacks) just to appease my dad to not live with my drunken mom at that point but even hearing her threatening to kill me with a knife in her hand as I barricaded my door didnt make a difference to him. The attacks didnt stop the first week I moved in, even going on to also try and shove me and my friends down the stairs repeatedly.
So for a few years I struggled to work and go to community college while being constantly hit and scratched, screamed at, and told I deserved to be raped again and will wind up bare-foot and pregnant, etc. 
I didn't have a lot of options to live elsewhere at the time due to my financial situation but I did have friends that were around when I needed them, unfortunately through the years there's been people growing apart/moving on so these things arent the same, but it wasn't all bad.
The basis for explaining said shitty home life is that I'm still stupidly tied to my parents. I'm never been able to financially get independence, some of which was my own doing because I didnt want to go into student debt if I didnt have to, and others were more I'm screwed either way but this is less so financially. Case in point would be how I'm down to being broke and would be homeless if not for my father helping with my rent/medical bills since the repeated allergy visits, expensive medications, and other specialist visits and ongoing medications/tests. All of my money has gone to living expenses or medical and I've been out of work for a while at this point so I'm with no savings to start over.
My mental health has been in a rut since I was 17 and much of my progress as an honors student with freedom just a few months away went down the toilet. 
As I said, it isnt all bad and I've had decent moments. Even until January I thought I was finally moving past my mental health issues, getting back into school, and in the process of getting my health under control as well. 
That is until my father put contingencies on his help, well, more so than usual. And me being me, well how can I refuse when I'm priviledge enough to even have any of this help, no matter the cost or abuse over the years.
He didnt stop pushing for me to get my mother in to rehab, and when she wasn't attacking me and screaming at me in front of the neighbors, it was clean up her vomit and care for the poor dog. I finally convinced her to go at the end of January, and even though she was there for a month, in less than 2 weeks she was drinking and screaming again. I didnt go a day for over a month without getting 6-10 phone calls from my dad to balance my mother's checkbook, deal with her credit cards, and try to solve the thousands of dollars she'd wasted while wasted. This was during my worsening Hashimoto's symptoms, the Lupus news and being more than ever financially strapped and without even allergy medication.
So being beyond taxed with the pressure, issues and lack of support, I let school fall to the wayside. I've continued to let it fall to the wayside up until a couple weeks ago when my mother decided to randomly, and I do mean randomly as i stayed with her to try and take her to meetings as she has lost her license to drive by this point, go stay at my dad's, sober.
That's all well and good, my parents aren't trying to stab, cheat, hit, or cause car accidents on each other for once. 
Except I've backed myself into a worse corner than before and I've tried for weeks to think of what to even say to the school or outreach program or my professors about how to fix this semester. It's all online anyways and we're under quarantine still, why not. 
Although I realize that fixing it is a fallacy and I'm probably going to get kicked out college at this point and cut off.
Reasonably I recognize that even while drowning I should have tried harder to find the words and reach out, but I'll be honest, it's not the first time I've had academic trouble between mental and physical health, even with proper cause and documentation that go approved. Ive been hospitalized for mental health three times now over the last couple years due to mental health, cptsd from home life and ptsd from multiple assaults from two relationships and other issues, all voluntary. The last of which was due to being given medication that did not fit with my issues or brain chemistry and made me an emotional mess and costed a really nice relationship, on top of school. None of that helped me trying to get better for a while but I did, it's part of why I moved and wanted to get back into school so I can finally start my own life.
Even though I know theres cause here too, the pure shame and guilt and self-hatred over being so isolated and dependent and weak, well, I've been ashamed that I cant keep up anymore. I used to, for years be able to balance all of this, to push through. But I can't anymore. I've lost what support group I had left as they moved on to have kids or got more into drugs, and I myself had moved and isolated and didnt want to reach out when all I have are these problems. It's like the me outside of all of this is buried deep somewhere because I don't know fun or normal or how to not be consumed anymore.
I've been to several  therapists over the years, even up until October, and my recent therapist stopped reaching out for new appointments when I told her of my movement situation as she didnt have online/phone visits. I have yet to find another that is covered online through insurance.
My psychiatrist and medical doctors are supportive in as much as they understand, help where they can, but I'm at a loss of how to even start fixing my life.
So much of it is tied up into caring for my 82 year old dad and watching my 64 year old mom drink herself to death. My older brother isn't in the picture very much, he was able to get away but was heavy into drugs during his teenage/college years and due to issues over the years, we don't get along.
I guess just writing this essay was somewhat helpful, but if anyone knows of plans/resources to help start to work things out, that would be super helpful. 
Anyways sorry if I've offended anyone with my story. I hope you all have a great week and please stay kind and safe!!!"
1341,Perspective,"I've had it so much worse than this... Honestly it's kind of cathartic to watch all the people who would have (Or outright did) judge me while I was unemployed just completely fall apart because they're quarantined.

I have a car, a job, a supportive partner, and friends who actually want to talk to me. This is a fucking walk on the beach compared with what I've endured in the past.

I can put up with wearing a mask to Publix every 10 days and sanitizing anything that comes through the door."
1342,Im stuck,"Im 18, physically and emotionally abused by my family but i cant get out because i have agoraphobia(along with the other shit that comes with it) and depression.

I can only stay with my family while being beat up and insulted 24/7 until they decide to kick me out of the house. The only thing they still didnt do that is because theyre religious. I dont know what to do. I dont have any money for a therapy (i did try it but it didnt help me at all). I wanted to find an online job but its impossible. Theres nothing i can do."

1344,HELP! I'm struggling to go to work.,"Hi all

Thanks for reading.

I have anxiety my whole life and felt that I have depression.

I am working as a food delivery rider with Grabfood.

It's about 9 years since I and my parents moved our home from Central Zone to North Zone.

When I'm going to work on my feeling good days or forced to work, I have to travel from the North to Central. And I always imagine myself climbing the bridges, taking the bus for 30 mins, transiting to the train and travelling for another 30 mins.

So, it's two hours daily. And I have to wait for a few hours for people in my house to finish using the toilet or I have to fight to use the toilet.

It's a struggle to imagine myself having go go back and forth, do much so that I often skip work. I have skipped work for a month before in the past, several times, because the journey just seem too daunting.

Now is already 12noon and I have yet to leave the house, much less eaten any food or even gotten myself prepared physically or mentally as I drain myself of my mental energy.

My parents too are s contributing factor because they keep overlooking and doing shit in purpose to trigger my anxiety and not stop to think that I am their only source of help, since they are already 64. If I fail in life, they are doomed. Reason being, the apartment I am living in, has a lease of 30 years and now we are left with 22 years. My family is broke af. If I do not make some consistent money and have a consistent savings plan for the next few decades, we can jolly well sleep under the bridge after the lease is up."
1345,I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me,I’m completely shutting down and I don’t know how to fix it. I’ve struggled with low self esteem and self harm for years but this fucking quarantine is putting me in a place I’ve never been before. My family wants to talk to me but I always shut them out. My girlfriend will call and I won’t answer just because I don’t want to talk. I can’t commit myself to school work or any hobbies. I feel like all I’m doing is hurting people and everyone would be better off without me here. To be completely honest I want to die. I’m tired of feeling and I’m sick of trying to change myself. I’m only here because I don’t want to hurt the people I love. I’m not posting here for a solution. I know that nobody can give that. I’m posting here because I don’t feel like I can live another day without talking to someone about this.
1346,I’m starting to compare myself to others and eating more,"I (F17 almost 18 in 4 weeks) look like a 12 year old kid and maybe younger than that. This is going to be long so bear with me;

I have a baby face and at 17 I am only at 4’2 so that adds to my child like appearances. In my country, the people do not give one shit about your feelings and will roast you about every little thing. When I use to attend my old school my friends would make fun of my height and ask when I’m about to grow up, or if I talk they’ll say that they can’t hear me from up there or some stupid joke.

I know they had good intentions, it was a joke after all, I didn’t mind it was just my height but it got worst. When me and my friends turn 16, we started going to the movie theater more because we could see rates movies that would be for adults, so as my friend ordered the tickets, the person looked at me and raised a brow “how old are you?” He asked, of course showing ID was mandatory so I showed him and I still got a skeptical look but I noticed that he didn’t ask my friends how old they looked

My friends basically look how all those kids in America doesn’t look their age, so yeah they had height and bigger chest than me and more mature despite me being the oldest. Even at the door, the ticket person asked me for my age again but yet when I see older nicer and older looking girls handing their tickets to him, he didn’t say anything.

I was anxious already (read my previous post) that I didn’t look my age and something could happen to me, at random times when I’m coming from school to go home I would randomly get catcalled with pet names such as “smallie” or “tiny” though when they see my badge because I go to a school where they give badges to the higher ups, they make fun of me.

After this, I started getting anxious when I go to the movies cause everything would repeat again, I don’t watch r rates movies anymore because I know I’ll be the one who’ll get picked on. So then, I find myself wishing ...that I wasn’t myself? I would look in the mirror and cry or I’ll wish that I was taller and ..as embarrassing to say had more chest. I don’t even think I’m pretty but everytime I go out I always compare how I look to other girls and it really makes me sad. I would get negative thoughts in my head and I really want it to stop...

Anyway, thank you for listening to my story :&gt; it makes me happy I could share my misery with all of you. And stay safe!"
1347,Memories of yesterday feel like forever ago,"So I don’t really know where to post this but basically I’ve noticed over the past couple of months that my memories of the day before feel like they happened so long ago. I’ve been scared that it’s some sort of memory loss. I try and recall the entirety of the day and there are some gaps but I remember the major aspects (what I ate, etc.). I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this? I believe that I have been suffering from sever anxiety and depersonalizations for the last 4 years, as well as a large Intake of alcohol. I’m just scared that this is indicative of early memory loss"

1350,Suggestions for my New Therapist,"I somewhat recently had to make a move to a new therapist due to my old one (who I had for a year) going on maternity leave and taking a break from therapy for a few months. 

This new therapist was a referral from my old one to cover me while she was on maternity leave. This therapist has great qualifications, being a doctor of Psychology and having 20 years of experience in therapy but every time I have talked to her in the past few sessions I have found myself spurting our really hard stuff that’s really personal but not really in a coherent way and crying my eyes out for half the session while my new therapist just watches me over zoom not knowing what to do. 

I have tried to explain my issues to her in the best way I know how but through all the crying and ranting I have done in trying to explain myself and my own history I feel like it isn’t going anywhere and I am kinda talking to a wall or the wrong person somewhat because I don’t feel that understood and can’t even say the right thing half of the time and convey what I mean. 

I’m worried that it might be a mismatch because this therapist doesn’t seem like a specialist in difficult cases and isn’t into clinical psychology or the disorder part of it and seems more like a life improvement therapist who focuses on trauma and anxiety and it’s impact on clients lives. 

I have had numerous therapists with this approach and I’ve been trying to go deeper into my issues because I have been taught “skills” and been given promises or suggestions from the therapist that are not done in the next session and it makes me feel like I’m really difficult or my therapist doesn’t understand me or care. 

Maybe it’s a mismatch between me and her or I’m trying to go too deep too soon but I’ve been trying to find a therapist that works really well for me and I haven’t found one that has helped create real change for me. 

Any suggestions or thoughts on this? I know that you will probably have a few questions about me in the comments and I will do my best to answer them and give more context where it is needed."
1351,I rly want to cry.,I am very sad and frustrated and all i want to do is cry. It's like I can't quite get it. My eyes well up with tears and I can't get maybe two sobs out but then it feels very indulgent and I have to stop and i'm left with this awful stagnant feeling in my chest. I just want to cry and cry and get rid of this feeling. Maybe I just can't cry.
1352,How to get over something hurtful?,"Over two yrs ago someone told me I look like my dad. I rly want to get over and forget about my dad and I'm constantly worried that people think that I look like him. I feel like I'm separated from my mom and her family because of how i look. Somebody close to my family whose my age told me over 2 yrs ago that I look like my dad because ""you're so dark, your eyes your hair, just everthing!"" i turned away from her and she enthusiastically kept going on about how I look just like him. I'm so deeply hurt by this, and I don't know how to get over it. I hate myself so much. I don't know what to do. My mom is dutch and has dark blond/light brown hair. my dad is italian and i have dark almost black hair. It rly bothers me, because i feel like when people think i look italian its like i look like my dad who wants nothing to do with me... i feel so rejected and i just want to be able to forget about it. i feel rly worthless i dont k. has anyone had something similar?"
1353,Intensely scared,"I know that therapy is meant to help get you back on track, but something my psychotherapist suggested has me  extremely uncomfortable and i don't know if i will be able to show them what they want.

It feels like im being asked to be a spectacle even though its probably just their curiosity in the abnormal."
1354,Terrified that even those closest to me will leave,"Hey, all. 

My early teen years were full of horrendous bullying which left me with major trust issues and difficulties making friends. The few people that I have made friends with mean the world to me; however, there's always that voice in the back of my head that just thinks I'm bothering them. That they'll leave if I goof up at all. 

It's kinda debilitating. I feel awful for any minor thing I do and can't shake it off for the longest time. Sometimes it even sounds like there's legitimate voices in my head saying ""I'm sorry"" over and over again. I've broken down in a sobbing mess in front of my boyfriend several times just because I feel like I'm not worth his time nor love.

Can anyone else relate? Or have tips? Thank you in advance. :)"
1355,My best friend told me to man up and be more happy,"And she didnt understand why this made me more upset. She said shes just trying to be real with me and get me to understand the real world. Idk if I want to be friends with her anymore,and it kills me since she is my best friend"
1356,I feel like i’m losing my mind,"I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago and I was never given any help. It started around the time where I began having weird thoughts. I get disgusted when I look in the mirror. I just started to hate myself and i feel as if i have no purpose. i recently discovered that i might be asexual but at the same time i like girls. i’m also afraid of men. i cry atleast twice a day. i feel crazy being stuck with my thoughts . i’m unsure of how to live. i’m constantly thinking about my death. i feel like i’m going to hell. but why? why me? i feel like god is the player and we’re all just his chess pieces to achieve his goal of punishing satan or something. but there’s days i’m unsure if i’m even going with the right religion. what if i’m worshipping the wrong god or what if there really isn’t anything after death, or even reincarnation. anytime something goes wrong my mom says “pray and god will help” but honestly i think he no longer listens to me because i keep making the same mistakes over and over again. i wake up, eat, and sleep everyday. i don’t talk to anyone. i constantly feel as if i’m in a simulation or that maybe i’m having an acid trip and the world just isn’t real at all. i stopped self harming months ago but i recently had a relapse. i’m sleep deprived. i can’t even smile anymore. and when i do it doesn’t last long. i know i’m all over the place but honestly i don’t know what to do. i’m tired of being told “everything is gonna be fine”. it’s not! people always try to force positivity on me instead of being realistic."
1357,Got jumped by a bully once in my life - still haunts me to this day,"Hello. How are you doing today?

I've been wanting to seek some advice on this one for a long time, especially since it has been nagging at me for ages. Not all the time, but chronically. I also believe it hampers my creativity (I dabble in creative writing) and gives me more reasons to not get good habits and discipline going.

A memory I've been craving to get erased from my cranium (damn it I'm already recalling how Jordan Peterson told an audience that memory is some sort of map, and when there are holes in it, aka the psyche still doesn't know how to deal with a certain situation, the psyche won't leave one alone until one finds how can they deal with it and only then it's hopefully case closed)...

A memory I've been craving to get rid of involves me doing a dorky improv in fifth grade, in the relevant improv class of sorts, and one that everybody liked.   
Only to be jumped at the school gate when I was walking home alone.  
Just typing about it makes my heart races and my fingers shake, even though I try to keep my mind as crystal clear as possible.

People I have told the story always told me I did the right thing. Try to settle it with talks, get hit a few times, get told to cry for him in a sadistic voice, choose to run away to safety and report the incident to the teachers and staff.   
There was only one assailant, a kid I knew. The delinquent bully type. He had been lightly picking on me throughout the previous month (and had the guts to keep pestering me about the incident afterwards. Maybe I should have changed schools) but nothing too physical or grave.  
I never expected him to lay down in ambush. I've never seen such malevolence (or what I maybe mistakenly perceive as such). Maube because I was and still am often projecting my values onto others I find it intolerable when people do bad things just for the heck of it, or just do bad things period.

The aftermath of the affair is not that important (kid god suspended for a week, no charges were pressed. I never even thought back then I could even go to the police about that business. I cared not about him or his parents apologizing)

What's important is that this business still keeps nagging at me to this day.

I still wish I hadn't done the improv cause I think it might have been the one thing that ticked him off. He brought it up just as he dashed at me. Found it annoying apparently. The hell would you attack someone for such a petty reason?! Or maybe he had planned it regardless of my actions, I can't know.

I still wish I had not tried to go home alone. Home was three blocks away, the area was reputed very very safe and even at that relatively late hour (twas a bit dark) the staff trusted kids from grades 5-6 to go home unaccompanied.

I still wish I would have fought back. I know it's wrong, but there's something about stupid male honor and the necessity to stand up for oneself (even when the option to run is here) that makes me think that perhaps I would have felt better if I too made him cry. If he learned that day that when you jump someone like the evil coward you are, prepare to get hurt too.

But more importantly, I still feel like I'm losing time pondering about that business from time to time, and dwelling on it. Maybe it was my first encounter with malevolence. Maybe it was my first realization that I found violence so dirty and repulsive I wish he'd have just killed me. And at times I mean it. I'd rather be your lifetime jail sentence than your plaything sock, you monster. And I hate to sound vindictive when I spell it that way. And I hate the fact that I'm calling a kid who likely had issues a monster and wishing ill on him. I usually have a lot of empathy for other people but I too have double standards like all of us.

I don't know if this prompted me becoming more introverted, I think I had countless other reasons before and after to not go outside that much or engage in extracullicular activities with others. However the incident might not be that unrelated to my problems with my hobbies.  
I mean, why the hell would you try to build something nice and to something and make people laugh if someone's gonna tear it apart and punch you in face? might as well not stand out.

Anyway, I'm still not over it. I still can't find the good habits and the engrossing passion projects that would help to shift my focus away completely and leave it in the past. And laugh it off.

I'm still a lazy unfocused unorganized bloody intorverted mess with no work ethic and no idea where to begin to get myself out of that swamp. I'm still wandering in the desert.

And I'm still triggered by certain sounds, looks, faces, attitudes and hair colors. Just to give you an example the popular tv show My Hero Academia features an (ex?)bully character named Bakugo. I don't follow it. I can't bear to look at Bakugo for too long and can't help but associate that fictional character with my assailant. And wish I could beat the hell out of Bakugo. Meanwhile my calmer self knows that what Bakugo needs is a counselor and some self-awareness. Just like my ambusher did.

I'm still there sometimes, in the streetlights. Sometimes I just phlegmatically dismiss the bad memories with a smile, often I do so by imagining I send the guy flying or lay a good hit. I used to ponder what it would be to meet him today, but that wouldn't help either of us. He's probably forgotten. I have not. I have forgotten parts of it but not all. And likely I might have blown it out of proportion. And I'm an idiot for doing it, like I know that (stupidly enough) people expend brain energy to keep bad memories alive when what's in the past is already gone and will never come back. And I know why people rationalize holding onto bad memories - there's this stupid idea that it'll make you better prepared next time. But how does it help one? what lessons does it teach? never go to school? never associate with anybody? never do good cause ""good people"" too can get ""punished""? be it by bad ""people"" or accidents?

I don't care if the thought crosses anyone's mind that I'm a thin-skinned softie cause I have never seen what it's ""really like"" to get ""jumped"", to live in bad areas or to get into fights all the time,  what it's ""really like"" to have had worse things happen to me. That I'm making a big deal out of something ""insignificant"" which is everything but that to me.

I have no idea how deep in trouble I am. I could probably ""forget"" by getting my act together and turning my life around, and choosing to live.   
(And I am probably extremely privileged to not have obligations at my age that would forcibly take my attention away, that I can ""afford"" to be worried about ages-old trouble.)

I could, but I have so many other issues. (inability to accept my own mortality, constant intolerance and anger at ""the world"", low self-esteem/self-respect, little self-love, little self-care, no passion/life-purpose, tons of bad habits and flawed destructive ideas/things I think I know for facts but things that I should throw away, no idea which master to choose or should I go job-hunting ect... )   
And this childhood memory of mine isn't helping.

Please, can anyone share some insights as to how to deal with bad memories/get rid of them?   
how to stop them from hampering (if not my low levels happiness) at least my fulfillment or lack of thereof?

Thank you for your time. I mean it. Thank you for any advice or feedback you might share.  


I hope you have a good week.

Sincerely."
1358,Do you think talk therapy can really help me?,"I have a lot of mental health issues and, like a lot of people, a rather complicated family situation and life story, with some trauma, including molestation. I’ve been variously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. At one point I even had a psychotic episode.

Here is my question: are there some people for whom therapy just doesn’t do anything? Maybe I’m already too in my head? I tried talk therapy a couple times and even with an amazing therapist the only thing it did for me was make me feel validated. But I don’t know how much I need that anymore. It starts to feel really awkward at some point because I feel like there’s only so much a therapist can do to help me. It’s really up to me. 

For me therapy feels self-indulgent, not because it is inherently self-indulgent, but because my problem is that I think too much about my problems (this post is a good example lol). I actually get a sort of perverse pleasure out of the rumination. In my opinion, the vast majority of my problems seem to be more rooted in an overactive amygdala, compulsiveness, and deep insecurity. I know what I need to do to fix my life. I know where my problems stem from. I understand feelings, my fears, my defenses. But at the end of the day, no matter what I know in my head to be the best choice, I knowingly engage in long-term self destructive activities: I surrender to my compulsions (lying, panicking, engaging in risky or humiliating sex, avoidance, fantasy, excessive reassurance seeking, etc.)

My most psychiatrist (who worked at the inpatient hospital I was at) said after a few meeting with me that 
 talk therapy probably wouldn’t do much for me because I have already spent so much time thinking about myself and my issues. He also ended up weaning me off all of my medications after a horrible reaction to abilify. He told me I was extremely physiologically (and psychology) sensitive and that medication would not be a big part of my recovery. He said my problems were basically the direct result of my sensitivity + my family situation and past trauma. I’ve never in my life had a psychiatrist say anything like this! But to have a psychiatrist (a rather famous one, at that — he’s been on Oprah lol) tell you you don’t need meds, especially after you’ve been prescribed stimulants, antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics! it was kind of surreal. 

Anyway, I asked about talk therapy but he said it might just encourage me to rationalize/intellectualize and that I need to just get in touch with my body and also calm my nerves because of my chronic visible anxiety. He thinks yoga/meditation/somatic therapy would be better for me. Could this be good advice or am I kidding myself?"
1359,Best friend gaslighted me because she owed me money,"My name is Pedro Palma, I am a BPD sufferer and suicide survivor. In may 2018 I suffered an episode where I ended up drunk and shot myself with a .40 to the chest. I died and was revived and was in a coma for 2 weeks. When I woke up it took another week for me to regain my memory and spent another week in the hospital. A couple days before I was discharged I got a text by a female friend who hadn’t talked to me in a long time, I replied and told her what happened when she heard she rushed to the hospital and was by my side being more supportive than she ever been. I told her my BPD diagnosis and explained how it affected me and she pretended to care. I opened up to her about everything my childhood sexual abuse, who I loved, Ect. My family from Arkansas had offered me to move in with them so I could get away from Houston and the pain so I left and worked over there, while I was over there she would call me crying telling me that her family kicked her out because she was lesbian and they didn’t support that so she would beg me to send her money so her and her GF could get a room to spend the night in telling me she would pay me back so I did, she would keep calling and beg for more in total I had sent her $260 and $50 extra bc one time her tire blew while I was driving it so I felt bad. The only money she was supposed to pay me back was $260. So she knew who I loved and I had gotten in an argument with the girl and she blocked me then secretly behind my back she messaged the girl and they talked so much shit about me saying everything that was wrong with me having BPD, they became best friends and both turned against me. She begged me to come back to Houston because that’s where I belong so I listened and when I came back I would go take her out to eat and spoil her bc I was grateful she was my best friend, she would always bring up about how she was gonna pay me back, I never would. She had a job so she could but she would rather spend her money on weed, concert tickets, on her gf instead of paying me back. At some point she just didn’t so she decided to use my illness and suicide attempt as an excuse to end the friendship telling me that I wasn’t good for her health, that her own parent who kicked her out and disown her would say that I was toxic and her gf agreed to. I understood but she blocked me before I could ask for the money and deep down I knew she ended the friendship bc of that. I gave it a couple months then I contacted her on twitter for it and she went off talking shit to me about me being toxic and that that’s why the girl I loved didn’t want anything to do with me and that I was a stalker for hitting her up about the money bc she had blocked me on my old account and I had a new one now. Then she said if I really wanted the money she would pay me back but she didn’t want me in her life and before I could say anything she blocked me again. The only reason why she put me through so much pain was because of the money and everything she would tell me would make me cry and make me consider killing my self. She’s such a bad person and she wouldn’t want anybody to know what she did to me. If anybody would do me a favor and text her “Pay Pedro back his $260” her number is 8322477743. I would gladly appreciate it because if she put me through so much pain bc of it I at least deserve it back and need it to pay medical bills. She does have the money she has over $1000 in savings. Thx!"
1360,Need to talk?,Need to talk? I can be a friend to talk to. No judgement
1361,Is anyone online who’s oriented with psych and mental health? I just wanted to confirm what’s wrong with me while I cannot see my doctor during quarantine.,I kept breaking down. Idk what to do.
1362,I’m crushing and having a ‘fp’ relationship towards a bpd sufferer,"Second time having a fp relationship and I honestly felt so good before developing this second one... I forgot how horrible life is when I have one. And first of all, I think I dream of having a forever fun life and she’s the first person I’ve ever .. actually sort of liked? Like I’m starting to wish I could be with her forever and I don’t rlly care where it is I just find her so comforting and funny and amazing but I’m developing fp relationship towards her bc she ... alwats talks abt other ppl she likes or admires or has a crush on and more, but basically she just is a bit more interested in other ppl and that rlly hurts my brain..
I just knkw too that bc I love her so much that the feelings likely wouldn’t be reciprocated bc of how she’s explained her feelings to me 

To clarify, I’m not diagnosed with bpd but I do share a LOT of the symptoms according to my doctor. I’ve had one of these “fp” relationships before and I remember crying almost everyday, waiting all day for them to respond, acting incredibly impulsively and erratically, freaking out, intense anger and depression and then intense happiness when ‘fp’ was arnd and suicidal thoughts however as a desperate attempt at trying to get ‘fp’ interested in conversation or speaking to me... I would rlly rlly rlly rlly like to not go through these emotions again. My fp left the app we used to talk on so it was almost like a break up bc we didn’t talk ever again after and it was so sad I remember! I don’t want to go through it again but I’ve already begun... the more I realize this girl likely won’t like me back bc of her mental illnsss, the sadder and angrier I become... this also may be one of my first heartbreaks too..? Like I’ve never rlly had crushes or liked ppl but I keep imagining a future with her and I listened to a love song today and I thought of her? Like .. that’s never happened to me... I feel good knowing I have a crush but idk if it’s bc of me developing an fp like relationship towards her :(

Anyways sort of just a vent but I can really talk about it to anyone and it’s giving me such a headache... life so hard rn🤦‍♀️.  Can’t deal with these crazy intense emotions... Like I haven’t cried in so long and now I’m crying everyday and sent a text to start an argument for no reason just bc I thought they liked someone more than me but they didn’t even initiate in it they just ignored me and haven’t responded in two days and I’m angry at them but I shouldn’t be 😭😭😭"
1363,Slowly getting help but might be too late,"I recently started looking into my mental health. I have never been the person to actually want to do self harm but I feel like I have started to joke about it a little too much in my head. Running through what would happen if I were to do it and then just saying/thinking ""no that's crazy and would cause more harm to my family"". Its starting to become a daily thought I have. I use to have them while driving randomly thinking "" hmm it would be super easy to crash into that pole"". Knowing full well I would never do it because I care too much about my family and how it would impact them. But as I said it's becoming a common thought.

I feel like if I keep having these joking thoughts they will stop being jokes and one day I might actually do it. I'm going to schedule a doctors appointment tomorrow so that I can inform her of these thoughts. I have told her that I occasionally had the crashing into a pole thing and reassured her that I wouldn't actually do it, just my head running random of all thoughts."
1364,It's like the universe is trying to push me away from ym dream of working in the NHS,"I finished med school last Feb and wanted to appear for PLAB 1 (entrance exam to work in the NHS) in November '19. But I couldn't finish my english language test in time because of a stupid power outage at the exam centre and thus I had to book PLAB 1 IN March instead.. But 1 day before the exam I had a panic attack and cancelled my exam and rebooked for September.. I regretted it instantly.. But now I'll hopefully be appearing in September.. That's 9 months later that I had originally planned.. 

And all the while thousands of other doctors are taking up jobs in the NHS which means I'll probably not be able to get a job too by the time I'm done.. It's taken a toll on my physical and mental health.. I stay up nights wonder what I could have done differently.. I don't know what I did to deserve this.."
1365,I just know that I don’t know what the f*** is this feeling,"I don’t even know how to express it. I feel like there is just me and nothing more. Everything else feels just grey. Like I’m surrounded by an endless void. Like I’m stuck in somewhere. I used to have an idea of what would I do with my life but now I don’t. So, is it a deep state of uncertainty? Or I just kinda lost interest in living? I don’t even know if that’s posible, I mean, I don’t want to kill myself or anything, i never wanted to. I do have experience struggling with depression and maybe anxiety but I never felt like this so I don’t think it’s one of those things. I just feel, I don’t know, neutral?...empty?...lost? When I think about the future I certainly have no idea of what would I do or if I have it then is not what I want but neither I know what I want or how to find it. I’m literally just living without any specific course and everything feels made of plastic or empty right now. It has been like this for the last couple of months. Everything feels colourless and I want to feel the colours again but I don’t know how. At least I know there’s a way, but again, uncertainty lays upon it too."
1366,Recovering from a Psychotic Break 24M,"Feel free to skip ahead to the ellipses. Above it is an account and kind of dramatization of events leading up to the psychosis including psychological trauma, extreme weight loss, and a barrage of coincidences. 

In October 2018 I ended a six year relationship with my former highschool sweetheart. In January of 2019 she finally had the financial means to leave our STUDIO apartment. The proximate cause of the end was her cheating on me after I’d been working 3 jobs (sometimes 90+ hours a week) to afford an engagement ring. I took serious inventory of my life and made many changes. The dietary changes were the most significant. I weighed around 270 at my heaviest. Around this time (call it February) I started to notice intense amounts of energy. (At one point I listened to Governed by Contagions by At the Drive and it was like a switch flipped and I was living at that tempo and energy level for months) l thought naively that this was what eating right or not being in a bad relationship felt like. In reality these were manic episodes. Also around this time I started using marijuana somewhat regularly. I kept that weed in a jar with a little packet designed to keep it moisturized. 

Fast forward to July. I watched the HBO miniseries Chernobyl and soon after went to the port authority bus station for travel. These two do not mix especially on a manic episode (I can expand on the connections between these things if wanted lol). I texted my dad, who is a psychologist, and he came and picked me up the next morning. He smelled my weed and said there was something wrong with it. I poured out the jar and saw (at least part of) the material cause of the hallucination and paranoia. The packet mentioned earlier was twisted and mangled. I smelled it and immediately recognized the smell of the cleaning product I use on my pipe. This means that for god knows how long (at least a month) I was inhaling extra strength cleaning product. A year lifetime of trauma (I left some out), manic episodes, and tainted weed combined into probably the worst experience of my life. 

... TL;DR QUESTION BEGINS HERE ... 


Back in July I had a full on psychotic episode. In particular I was sure that some kind of nuclear catastrophe or civil war would occur in America. Since then I haven’t been the same. Most strangely, my dyslexia was cured. Other than that on the one hand I’m much more secure, less depressed, less anxious, and spend less time ruminating. I’m so different in this respect I can barely even relate to who I was before. However, I also have severe long term memory loss and I’ve lost almost all passion and sense of direction. To quote Emily Dickinson 
“And Something's odd—within—
That person that I was—
And this One—do not feel the same—
Could it be Madness—this?” 

Has anyone experienced changes like I’ve described? Or does anyone have advice on how to rediscover passion? 

P.S. I left allot of details out. If anyone is curious I’m happy to talk more about this. I started seeing a therapist which has been helpful, but I haven’t talked about this much with anyone else and frankly I would really like to."
1367,Something about me taking over personalities and goals of characters in movies and shows,"I really don’t know how to explain it that’s why I stated the title like that. So basically I have the tendency to get kind of attached to characters I see in movies and shows. I don’t mean I care what happens to the characters it’s more about how I take their personalities and reset my goals to kinda act more like them. It’s like I look up to someone new everyday. One day my goal is to make music, then the next day I want to win an Oscar. Then I say screw trying to get famous I want to become a successful businessman. It’s so stupid and Idk if it’s normal or not. For some reason I’m convinced I’m a genius when in reality I’m a senior in high school barely making B’s. It’s probably just me being unsure about who I am or something but idk people seem more sure about themselves than I do, since I literally try to take on the role of whoever I see. 

This is my first post here so I don’t entirely know what I’m doing."
1368,"My dad mentioned how 'we don't really express love and hate in our family' because he was raised that way and used to it, and so now he doesn't know how to do that and raises us the same way.","I love my parents so much, and I know they love me and are proud of me. They do tell me they are proud of me every now and then, for how hard I work for school and stuff.
But we never really explicitly say 'I love you'. And we rarely actually touch. The last time I got a hug was a week ago, when I had a mental breakdown in front of my mother, but besides that it's usually only with birthdays that I hug someone.
And ever since my father mentioned 'not really expressing love and hate' I've been thinking a lot.
I hope he doesn't blame himself.
I hope I'll be able to push past the feelings of awkwardness and just tell people I love them and give them random hugs.
And I hope he knows, despite us not saying it, that I really love him. We don't talk much, because we're both pretty closed off and have very different interests. I find talking with my mother easier. She is more of a people person. But I really love them both so much."

April 21 2020

It's the perfect timing! Amid the virus which has ultimately cancelled the things I wanted most, hospitals jammed! If I were to off myself, the chaos with covid19 may make it so I have a lesser chance of survival.  I will fix the mistake. They wanted this. I will make sure they know. If I can't kill them myself, I will do everything to agonize their existence. You are a contributing factor, \*\*\*! I'm tempted to end it all now. End you then me. Oh the poor agony of my parents. Losing us both. Imagine feeling anything about you dying. You didn't seem to care when you choked me. That I was losing air. So if I strangle you till you can't breathe..!! ! ! ! 1 ! ! 1 ! ! ! ! ! 1 ! !  ! 1

&amp;#x200B;

Why should I care?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go to jail but I'm for sure not living my life without fufilling those desires. They say to those who commit those crimes should have just killed themselves. So shouldn't I do that? Dreams: crushed! It's all going downhill! Crashing..crashing..crashing.. going to break my ankles with a hammer..fuck fuck fuck!! !fucking fucking fucking fucklign fuckign despise it here."
1370,How do you take care of yourself (body and mind)?,"For those who have anxiety, panic attacks, depression and other kinds of mental health illnesses, how do you take care of yourself? How do you take care of your mind and body? e.g exercises you're doing, foods you're eating and avoiding, practices, etc."
1371,I Have a weird thing for blood.,Okay so well I really like blood and everyday I feel the need to see it. Almost everyday I will cut myself to see some blood so I dont end up hurting others. I cant stop this need/urge for blood and its starting to get worst as I go. I dont like drinking the blood or anything I just love to feel its warmth and look at its vibrant color. I wouldnt hurt myself if I was able to inflict some cuts onto other individuals without consequences.
1372,I’m terrified of sleeping now..,These past few nights have been pretty rough.. I’ve been going through sleep paralysis episodes.. and it’s terrifying because I can’t move.. or speak.. and it’s gets difficult for me to breathe from my panic attacks... I’m really considering online therapy.. but I just don’t know where to start...
1373,How is everyone,During these rough times we have to stick together ! Let talk how are you ! I'm kinda losing it just a lil lol but hey I'm here !
1374,I cant cry,"19M (as of 4/20) and I cannot cry. I don't know why. I've been through the ringer, my girlfriend broke up with me, I was suicidal for months, and have been depressed my whole life. I haven't cried since my friend committed suicide back in 2016, other then when i'm drunk, which I have cried a couple of times in the past, but now, it feels like I really need to cry, a lot. The feeling will come, my face will start squinting, eyes barely start to water, and then its gone. It doesn't feel good, not crying, and I have no stigma against it, at least that im aware of. So why is this happening? I used to be able to cry fine. No one ever shamed me for crying, and I don't feel like it makes me any less of a man or any bull shit like that. Anyone have experience? Tips? My ex shamed me on the phone for not crying implying I was some sort of sociopath or something, and it makes me feel like I am. I feel sad, all the time. For the past 2 weeks I'd say, which I've been through before, but this past few months have been really fucking rough, and it feels like I need to cry. How do I cry?"
1375,My mental health is declining,"For so long I’ve been trying not to complain because I know people have things much worse than I do. But tonight I started realizing how much my mental health has declined and how it snuck up on me so silently yet so viciously that I didn’t even realize it. I’ve been in denial.

I was depressed for years and was finally starting to really improve my life. I was finally enjoying my classes at university and actually going to class. I was finally getting over my avoidance problems and the cycle of staying home being so much easier than facing my anxieties. In the past, I used to skip all of my classes. I was so excited and proud of myself that this semester I had gotten so much better. 

Only for me to be forced back into the same place I was. The insomnia, the isolation in my bedroom, the disintegration of my personality and interests. Spending literally all day in my bedroom is not something new to me, but not something I’d like to relive. I’m starting to get delusional thoughts and it wasn’t until tonight that I realized how delusional they are and remembered that I have experienced this type of delusional thinking before while depressed.

I have meds that I went off over the summer. They helped me the first year I took them but after that they didn’t. There were many other factors that probably played into them not working anymore. I should have been doing therapy at the same time. I have an online therapist now which I am very lucky to have and I’m trying to utilize it the best I can. But I’m wondering if I should start taking my Zoloft again. For some reason I fear it will make me go more crazy. I remember feeling a sort of emotional numbness which I feel like I already have right now. At first when I became depressed it manifested as panic attacks and depression was a side effect. I haven’t been experiencing anxiety as much as emotional numbness now.

Should I try to take Zoloft again? I’m not even sure if I would be able to be prescribed something new right now."
1376,I have no clue what I'm feeling,"so for the most part I don't feel anything except for sometimes, and those sometimes are most of the time sad, and when im sad its outrageously sad like on the brink of suicide hard crying for 20-40 minutes with no end in sight. But after a while I just go back to feeling nothing. I don't know if I'm depressed or if I'm just sad sometimes please someone answer me. I can't go to a doctor about this cuz my parents don't believe in mental health or whatever."
1377,Can someone help me with what’s going on?,"Every time a small stressful situation comes up I always worry about it a lot like, I can’t stop worrying about it just affects me a lot when I feel stressed I feel as if I just want to sit and cry , feel like shivering as well also it feels like a rubberband is tightly gripping my throat. It’s been a lot more frequent now with the extra school work."
1378,Will I ever be truly happy again?,"I feel ungrateful just saying this but all my feelings have been heavily diluted for months. I'm doing so much better right now than I did a few weeks ago but everything I do is because I force myself to; not because I truly look forward to doing things. 


I miss the times when my stomach twisted at an exciting part in a book/movie and I felt excited to start drawing or writing, the stories in my mind sweeping me away into another world. I miss having the energy to go for runs and laugh with my family and friends and the intense dedication to learn new things.


I know I'm so lucky to have everything I have right now but I hate not feeling grateful about it. I hate feeling like I'll never truly enjoy life to the fullest and now that I'm trying I'm just filled with more frustration as it's not working. I just want someone to tell me this is something that will pass but I can't see a future where I can feel things as passionately ever again."
1379,Is it ok to cry for 3 days,Is it normal to just craw up in a ball and just nearly cry for 3 days straight and after a while feel emotionless and just worthless
1380,Need some advice for struggling with complex post traumatic stress disorder and struggling to exist,"Hi there

I am 30yr old female and lately my life has reached rock bottom. I've had some abusive relationship in the past, and have never fully recovered from the depression that has plagued my life since (10 yrs ago). I have tried probably all the possible medications and more therapists than I can count.

My brain seems stuck in a constant depression mode. I because so emotional and low over little things. I crave attachment and sometimes I feel like a child, I don't know why. I crave being held and cuddled and rocked. I used to drink a LOT to numb the anxiety and pain. I've cut back during Covid19 but I feel an emptiness inside me. I don't know who I have become over the last year or two.

I ruined a man's marriage by being the other woman, he had two children. I hate myself for it and blame myself for it. I was so lost and depressed and he showed me compassion and what I thought was love. I tried to make it work with him but he has told me I am controlling, stressful and that he no longer loves me. I gave that relationship my everything and I feel so empty inside now. I dont want to be with him but I want my heart to stop hurting. 

For ptsd sufferers, is it safer to never open one's heart again after a bad experience.  I tried and now I feel like all the past trauma is raw again. I sleep with nightmares, feel constantly scared and have to avoid people because the tears won't stop flowing. 

I want to heal, I'm losing hope and am wondering if I am a poisonous person with no positive qualities. I never meant to hurt anyone but I seem to and I feel hurt in return and self hatred. I'm also struggling financially and my depression is making it too hard for me to work. 

Please, any advice?"
1381,"I think I’m a sociopath, I just want to know so I can stop questioning every decision I make. Maybe I should just stop thinking and act","Why I think I still might be sociopathic
-I lie all the time (without even thinking about it) sometimes it’s just random “facts” that pop into my head. I lie to make people think I’m smarter or to buy some time away from class or whatever the lie can get for me without being to risky.
-When evaluating my actions, (which I recognize sociopaths don’t do often) I never seriously take into account another person’s emotions into account. I evaluated how their feelings will affect their attitudes towards me and my reputation (which I am trying to change because of reasons I won’t disclose here)
-I’m naturally really good at lying
-I have depression
-I might have something similar to adhd (still getting tested)
-Lack remorse/empathy (the ONLY time I ever feel empathy for someone is in a movie or video game, I think this is because I force myself to feel something for them.)
-I feel sorry that I got caught, not for what I did and I don’t ever plan on changing my behavior, I plan on how to prevent getting caught. I only plan to change behavior when it’s the only way people will stop fucking with me.
-70% of the time, I feel more or less nothing. 30% of the time I am angry or sad. There is very little in between. (I attribute this to some bipolar thing I have that causes mood swings)
-I have always been fascinated with fire
-I love torturing bugs and I always have loved it. (The only reason why I haven’t done it to big animals is because 1. They are/can be dangerous 2. People care if I hurt them and will punish me 3. I really haven’t had the desire to)
-I’ve always had issues respecting people’s boundaries
-I never have long term goals
-I’m sadistic but I also like making people feel good. I feel better about the ladder because I get praise and there’s less risk
-My vocabulary IQ is in the 95th percentile 
-I plan multiple lies to tell people so I can do what I want
-Lying to people is fun
-I have a huge ego but I can seem very humble
-I get very annoyed watching people react to anything with emotions that aren’t necessary.
-In the past I’ve had visions of an alien possessing me and forcing me to choke my parents to death.
-I laugh at shock images of people just splattered across pavement. Without any blaring music either
-Ive seen 3guys 1hammer and I thought it was more interesting than hard to watch or gruesome. It was interesting to see how much the body can take and still MOVE. How much blood can ooze out of one’s face. How much they could gargle on it on not choke. How many holes you could puncture. How long that can last. And the general mindset of someone who think they will get away with doing this 21 times and taping it. Maybe it happens more frequently than I know
-It’s very easy for me to catch when people lie to me/use tactics to manipulate me. Although I don’t point it out just cuz there’s only a negative in doing so most of the time
-The idea of happiness and love now seem like such distant feelings. Nothing has really changed since my childhood but now I just don’t feel either of those things.
-I believe I am smarter than everyone I meet, very few people have called that idea into question

Reasons why I wouldn’t be a sociopath:
-I have no problem telling the blunt truth
-I have some sort of superficial value of “the truth” which doesn’t really make sense since I can lie all the time and not feel some sense of immorality
-I am not charming at all
-I have this weird contradictory feeling of fairness where I feel as if that fairness should be applied to me specifically (I don’t care if it doesn’t affect me) but at the same time, I won’t object if it is unfair and balanced in my favor. 
-I’m striving to become an actor of any caliber, in any genre"
1382,Mental health during lockdown,"This is a time that not of us have been through and many people that may not have suffered from it before are now struggling to cope during this lockdown. Isolation, less contact with friends and family and much more each different for every person. I will not say that exercise will cure mental health issues or depression but it can help during this time. Motivation is very difficult when dealing with these problems to just get started but I wanted to give some motivation to help. I struggled when I was younger as I had a parent that had problems so  thy mental health and I used this to help me through and I hope it helps you too

1383,self deprecating/depressing memes,"“casual” depressing jokes/memes are everywhere now. do they signal a serious societal issue, or a genuine lack of empathy and understanding of mental health issues?

not sure if this is the right sub, but I really wanted more professional/informed opinions on such a matter. 

we’ve seen it on the internet. millennials and gen z are constantly posting depressing/self deprecating memes and jokes on instagram and twitter. while such content is said to be “relatable” and “humorous” and allows for “relaxation”, I can’t help but feel that this signals some kind of mental health crisis. 

such memes are a double edged sword. on one hand, it might make people more likely to step forward to seek help due to the more open conversation of mental health. on the other hand, (which I personally feel is more likely) everyone treats feeling this way as “normal”. by seeking help, they’re labelled as attention-seeking or week. 

worser still, for those who do not have mental health issues, they might chance upon such content and treat mental health as a joke or something to bond and laugh over. 

what are your thoughts? a fine line exists between increasing awareness, reducing stigma; and the possibility of it being treated less seriously."
1384,Someone say anything please,"I'm going through a very tough time and my only way out is suicide. I tried to do everything but that's just it. I'm living in hell and i can't do it anymore i swear. I need help , i need anything to get me through this before i do it."
1385,"I feel like a crappy friend, and i’m always doing something or the other wrong.","Disclaimer: This is speaking about events prior to covid-19, i do not meet with friends during lockdown. 

Look who it is, back again, complaining about their first-world mental health problems.

Despite my very best efforts, i always found myself sitting down in class feeling as if i needed to be a better friend. My closest friends, the ones i’m talking about, are amazing, kind-hearted and intelligent people who suffer from serious mental health issues and the blame does not go to them. They deserve no more shit than i feel i’ve already given them.

They’re incredibly smart, kind people who can get along with anyone, except me it seems. I’ll talk to them, we’ll have a good conversation, and then, because of just how fucking socially inept i am, i’ll ruin it right then and there. I’ll be sitting in a corner of class because i want to be able to focus (ADHD is not very helpful when being near friends) and i’ll see, out of my peripheral vision, them laughing, having a crap load of fun and then i realise. When i’m with them, they don’t express any of those emotions. I can make them laugh, but rarely, and they never really have much fun with me. I’m not intelligent like them, i’m not kind like them. It always leaves me feeling like a really crappy friend."

1387,"5 years after a major accident, I don't know how to feel emotions anymore.","I was in a motorcycle accident when I was 12, now 5 years later I have just forgotten how to be emotional, I was a rainbow of joy and knew how to be sad and angry before. Now, I remember what everything felt like but it's no longer there.

I talked to my parents about it and according to them it's just a phase (that started 4 years ago and isn't  going away) and I can't have mental illness because they love me. I have practically begged them for therapy but according to them, if I really needed it I wouldn't ask. 

I do laugh, but whenever someone is in front of me, it's like I putting on a show and I have no idea how to laugh or cry when I am alone.

I do get angry, so very much but besides that I don't feel much on my own. I tried meditation and kept a diary (for like a day) 

Every single day it's getting so much difficult to be anything."
1388,What can I do?,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit.. i've kind of panic searched ..

My mother(late 50s) has a range of psychological issues stemming from childhood trauma and I (late 20s) live with her, I'm coming to the end of my line of what to do I feel like the biggest piece of shit.. she is on alot of medication and sees a psychologist but not as often as i think she needs it. Every time she has an episode of crying and mumbling about what is making her feel like that I feel absolutely cold emotionally and absolutely hopeless of what to do i just usually stand around and listen and walk around. What can I do to help her? calm her down? what can I say or do when each reply is just negative or incomprehensible. I'm getting quite worried about suicide entering her mind in which she constantly references taking things to make her feel better or take the pain away, things along those lines. Any help would be greatly appreciated"
1389,No sense of self,"I guess I don’t really have a sense of self. I kind of understand what that means, that I just don’t feel like... anything. But I don’t really understand the opposite of that... what it means to actually have a sense of self. What is that like?

Yesterday I had a therapy session, mostly about how I have very low self-esteem. My therapist told me to make a list of things that I am, or that I want to be. His examples were like “I am hardworking” and “I am confident”. Stuff like that. He said that even if I don’t feel like a confident person, I could look at the list and tell myself that I was, like fake it til you make it.

I tried to make a list but it was very hard. I tried to find examples online of positive traits. Stupid, i know. I finally put some stuff down but it felt very generic. I don’t know what I am or what I want to be. Like even though I have evidence that “I am creative” (for example), it still doesn’t... connect with me. Nothing resonates. It might as well be a gibberish word. It’s hard to explain. 

Does anyone else experience something like this? I want to do this therapy homework but I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me, or what’s wrong with me. This would be easy for other people. I just don’t know what a sense of self is supposed to feel like."
1390,I made a video addressing how i came out of a depression and what techniques i used,"hey, 

I have struggled with depression for the past 2 years ever since my final year at school. I was travelling europe earlier this year and felt very alone as i was across the other side of the world from my family. I was constantly binging porn as a coping mechanism and emotional regulator. It got to the point where i had had enough and decided to try and climb out of the hole i was in. I made this video when i got back that explains some of the things i did to make myself feel better. thanks for the support.

1393,How to build mentally ill mum's confidence to do basic tasks for herself?,"A month or so ago I posted here about my mum's short term memory loss, see here for details [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fox07p/helping\_mum\_with\_short\_term\_memory\_loss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fox07p/helping_mum_with_short_term_memory_loss/)  


While she's been at mine her memory is slowly improving, I believe that since her mum died a decade ago, she got into depression and stopped doing things for herself.  
After many years of doing this and not doing anything stimulating for her brain (mindless tv and no interests/hobbies), it's become weak and doesn't retain anything anymore.  
I've tried getting her to read, watch documentaries and other stimulating activities while I work during the day.  
She won't do them unless I push her as she's used to being mentally lazy and likely thinks she too stupid to.  
But still, after a month she is starting to remember more often, though still far below baseline.

I've realised there's another problem that prevents her from making significant progress, and that is her self confidence.  
She's gone through ten years of her short term memory getting worse, so she has no confidence in herself to do anything.  
She immediately panics when she forgets and it all goes to shit from there.  
She never asks for help because she's scared to be judged, no matter how many times I tell her to ask for help if she's not sure.  


Here's a typical scenario that happened this morning for example:  
. I told her she needs to shower, not just ""a quick easy wash with a flannel"".  
. I showed her how to use the shower multiple times, then got her to turn it on/off a few times.  
. I reached up and closed the curtains as she won't be able to reach easily, to which she says ""good thing I can't reach as I'll probably break it"".  
. I then leave her to it, reminding her that if she panics, just step outside the shower and call for help.  
. 5 minutes later I still don't hear any water, then I hear the bath tap.  
. I knocked asking ""why are you using the bath when you wanted to use the shower?"". I know exactly why, she panicked and took the easy way out as usual.  
. Eventually she uses the shower, I think. I mean, her hair was wet so hopefully she did.  


Another example, from when she visited a year ago, is during the night she went to the bathroom, but couldn't remember which room she was sleeping in.  
Instead of asking for help, she panicked and slept on the bathroom floor with the light on.  
I can't send her home if she can't properly look after herself.   
Only eating sandwiches/crisps and washing with a flannel because it's easy is not looking after herself properly, it's just her doing the bare minimum to survive.  
She is absolutely capable of looking after herself, but her constant panicking and fear of messing up is preventing her.  
8/10 times she'll mess up a task due to her confidence\\panicking, but 2/10 times she's fine. If she was beyond help or had dementia, it would be 10/10 times, right?  
The doctors say that she does NOT have dementia as she has no lesions in her brain.  
The same doctors say that she performed much worse than typical dementia patients in various tests as if she sabotages on purpose, but subconsciously.  
It breaks my heart to see her like this and she's made some progress by working her brain more.  
But she won't be able to go back to how she was until she changes her mindset and not left to take the easy/lazy way out all the time.  
I'm going to look into counselling on the NHS when things start going back to normal, but I don't think a one hour session a week or whatever is anywhere near enough.  
I said to her that if she doesn't put the work in to get better, I'll have to get a carer for her.  
Which she really doesn't want and I don't want, because that will give her more excuse to carry on being mentally lazy and less reason to do things for herself.

1399,Nobody noticed I have been gone for a long while ... BUT...,"I just learned that Steve Cash, the YouTuber who did the Sylvester The Talking Kitty Cat videos has taken his own life at age 40. He hadn't made any new content in 4 months because he was Bi-Polar and in his words, he would often be down (in an awful depression) for months at a time. He couldn't control it. I get that feeling for sure. I can't control mine either tho people tell me "" well...just don't light any fucking fires ya moron and you'll be fine."" I won't rant about the ignorance and fucking stupidity of people now.

I have now changed my mind for now about committing suicide myself. I see how hurt the fans and family of Steve are and idk... It just seems like too much to put my family through that same pain. I am also a YouTuber, but very small, and I am sure not one damn person (besides the one person from here who has subbed me and who is my bestie) who has ""subbed"" me (subscribed) will notice I'm gone. Only my family and maybe a dozen more people irl would even notice I was gone...6 of those people being my family. So, while noone really cares, I still will live to see another (many) days...quarantined or not. 


There is no point to this. I am now on Tik Tok if anyone was wondering what I've been up to lately. I promptly became addicted and had now spent all damn night scrolling through videos. It is a bit after 8 am now and I have not slept yet.

Bring on the crash I guess. Insomnia is so great isn't it?

1400,Is it wrong that I don’t want to fix my emotional intimacy issues???,"So I was a super emotionally open and available kid and teen up until I was about 16-17? That’s where 1) I started realizing life isn’t fair and more importantly 2) I had a suuuuuper toxic codependent friendship that, when I ended it, caused more lasting emotional trauma than literally any other event in my 24 years of life including the death of family members and pets that have died in my lap.
Basically it just made me realize how easy it was for me to give every little piece of myself to someone without even thinking twice about it. And i decided to knock that shit right off.
I’ve had several therapists since then and have always been very upfront about my trauma and issues and mental illnesses and such and they always ask if I want to work on emotional vulnerability and I’m like nope! Sure don’t!
Like I know it’s because it’s a shitty coping mechanism but I feel safer this way? I used to be too open and it hurt me a lot multiple times and now, unless I was already close with them before, I don’t wanna risk that shit with anyone else. I’m aware it’ll be hard for me to have a long term romantic relationship or develop more deep and meaningful friendships but like..... I usually feel just fine with that because at least I won’t have to endure more trauma? Like I can make friends and such I just don’t get super vulnerable with anyone anymore no matter how long I know them. It’s too easy to see myself falling into a codependent relationship again and this time not being able to get out of it. Idk I’m just not concerned about it and honestly I like the safety that I feel by not letting anyone close to me who wasn’t already close before all that shit happened that messed up my emotions real good. (That shit HURTED and sometimes I still cry about that one friend legit 7-8 years later out of the blue for no reason at least twice a year)
I guess TLDR is I had some fucked up friendships and one VERY codependent friendship that absolutely destroyed me emotionally for months and now, 7-8 years later, I refuse to let people close to me anymore and I don’t WANT to fix that despite people telling me I should. Is that wrong? Weird? Should I actually try to be vulnerable with people like I used to be?"
1401,Haven't been eating properly and honestly can't motivated myself to,"For the last few months my food intake has been all over the shop. I go full days without eating and only realise that I haven't eaten at night or when I'm in bed. I am extremely high functioning and have no issues maintaining this right now but for whatever reason I have no appetite and then get stomach cramps and the urge to throw up when I haven't eaten. Is there any advice about stimulating appetite outside of living an active, otherwise healthy life style? I've got anxiety issues which I manage well but other than that I'm healthy. All advice is greatly appreciated."
1402,Armchair ''Licensed psychiatric nurse'' said i was malingering my disorders.,"I understand i have a tendency to exacerbate traits after becoming offended, but to suggest to me that all of my struggles are malingering, are absolutely harmful.

This occured on the r/psychiatry sub. I am still shocked by the words that were used. I was basically banned for lashing out at the nurse via comment, because she accused me of malingering. What other reaction do you expect?!!!!!!!! You can't invalidate peoples pain and traumas, and their suffering.

This ruined my whole day."
1403,my mental state has deteriorated slightly and I don't know how to cope,"So me and my female friend are pretty close, we don't live very close and are a few hours away from each other, recently I was I guess rejected? After admitting she viewed me in THAT way she changed her opinion and it left me pretty heartbroken and questioning my own character for a pretty decent amount of time, We're getting on well now and I really like her but my mind still hasn't been able to get over the last ""rejection"" and I'm really not sure if I could cope with it again, I know this isn't r/dating_advice but I would really appreciate any advice with how to cope from the fallout from this, thank you :)"
1404,Coming off medication,"I posted a while back on here about wanting to come off my meds. I’ve spoke to my doctor and made the decision to start reducing. I’m terrified of not being ready and of my symptoms coming back, especially my dissociation. Does anyone have any positive stories for reassurance? It is always negative ones online so would love to hear from someone who has successfully come off their meds"
1405,ISO: a workbook for self-help/relationships,"A while back, I saw a post somewhere with links to workbook PDFs that could have been CBT/DBT-based/other, but can’t find it now. I really want to work on some OCD/anxiety issues. I’m (25F) having a lot of problems with a new relationship where the person (31M) is amazing but I keep thinking it is too good to be true and almost working to push him away. A lot of our early time spent together so far is me asking questions about if he is sure he sees all of my flaws and trying to understand how he can possibly be willing to deal with them. I feel like I am sabotaging the relationship. Any resources/articles? I would be so grateful. Sending love to all."

1407,Loneliness,"I've been feeling extremely lonely for a while. It's actually a bit complicated. I have people around me but I hesitate to emotionally connect with them. I just stopped being emotionally vulnerable and I'm starting to hate myself for that. I just don't know what to do. When I'm alone, I feel lonely and when I'm around people I feel extreme need to be alone. It's like I'm forcefully rejecting any attention anyone is trying to give me. I'm rejecting love, but it is completely as an instinct. It's as if I'm comfortable being like that. It's like I'm so used to the pain of being lonely that I am now hesitant to even emotionally open myself up to people I'm close with. I just don't know what to do. How long is this gonna last?"
1408,Self diagnosis,"Was wondering if it is possible to self diagnose my mental health right now if i do enough research

1411,Group Therapy and Support Groups Are Different: Here’s How,"Often, group therapy and support groups are used interchangeably in our day to day lives. However, it is worth noting that these two concepts and practices are as different as chalk and water. This is mainly to do with pop culture. Right from Fight Club to Jerry Maguire, movies and TV series show support groups in different contexts. Due to the popularity of these movies and our genera tendency to get influenced by pop culture has led to this perception that [group counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) is the same as support groups. However, there are some very key factors that differentiate these two practices from each other. Let’s first understand what these two practices mean. Group therapy is when two or more therapists get together to treat ten to fifteen people with similar illnesses. A support group, on the other hand, is when a group of people with shared experiences or concerns come together to give each other encouragement and comfort. Now, here are 2 main differences between group therapy and support groups.

1) **Different goals -** One of the main differences between a support group and group therapy is the goal. You go for group therapy to change, but you go to a support group to cope. [Group therapy activities](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) are designed to help people get better at dealing with their trauma to one day get rid of it or at least be better equipped to deal with it daily. Support groups, on the other hand, are for when you realise that your coping skills are not strong enough to help you through a difficult phase in your life. It is all about getting support and encouragement from people who are on a similar ship as you are. It is a blessing to be around people who have similar experiences and getting their support can mean a lot and make a huge difference in your day to day life. With group therapy, the goal is to help you understand yourself better, and moreover, help you understand yourself in context to your issue a lot better. 

2)  **Commitment varies hugely -** Due to a lot more casual nature of support groups, the commitment required from a support group member is minimal. Members can drop in for a session as and when they feel like. However, with group therapy, due to the amount of work that goes into it, a lot more serious commitment is required. Irregular members can disrupt the group dynamics. Different group therapies have different activities planned. [Group activities for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) would differ from those of a group full of war veterans. Hence, it is extremely important for members to be regular and more than that, stay committed to the cause. Also, in a support group, the dynamics are different. Not a lot is expected out of a member, apart from mutual respect and maintaining a decorum. However, it is a lot more different in group therapy. There are roles and responsibilities for every member that they must adhere to."
1412,Is watching gore and violent videos bad for mental health?,"First of all, it's not like I enjoy watching people suffer or get into accidents. However I am a very morbidly curious individual. I like seeing things that are taboo, like videos, where someone gets hit by a train or videos, where some poor individual got hacked to death with machetes by drug cartel. I am curious, how these victims react in these situations and I compare what I would do myself in their shoes. These are things that the polite society would never offer me to see, so I like to explore. It also helps me appreciate the things I have, and be thankful I have never been in these morbid and inhumane situations. Helps me stay humble.  

However I have noticed that I have become more and more numb to them. They are simply not very shocking to me anymore. I do not have any thoughts to repeat the shit I have seen or anything like that, but I'm starting to think that there is a possibility, that this numbness cannot be a good thing. I don't feel any emotions or feelings while watching them anymore. Maybe someone who is familiar with some research on this could tell me about this topic?"
1413,How long do people normally stay on antidepressants?,"My daughter is turning ten and she takes an anti depressant and mood stabilizer.  She started them because she was having severe panic attacks. She has been taking them for about 6 months and hasn't had an anxiety attack in months. At first i thought they werent working at all but i think it just took a few months for the meds to fully work.  But i was curious, how long do they normally keep people on the meds? Will this be a rest of her life type of thing? Or will they eventually decide to take her off the meds. She is doing great now but i do wonder if the meds were to be taken away if the anxiety will come back. I know each person is different but is there a general way they do it?"
1414,Anyone use music for their anxiety?,"I started using some relaxing music to mellow my anxiety, especially at night. Its not a cure but its definitely been helping. Anyone in need of a little relief try this music out, its been a life saver the last few nights [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0v0iCOUBcs&amp;t=135s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0v0iCOUBcs&amp;t=135s). Let me know if any of you enjoy it or it helps a little."
1415,Need emotional advice. Agressive anxiety over romance.,"Some things you should know about me:

- Am 18 aka young and stupid
- Never really had real emotions for anyone (serious ones) 
- Never really had one experience with romance (ex lived away)
- Is not used to the idea.


So theres this boy who lives away. Great. We habe a thing where we arent dating, but we are trying out things and seeing if theyre worth, since we vibe pretty well with each other (In terms or romance interests and overall connections, hes on top in terms of understanding and vibing with each other). We spoke, and if things work or dont work out, it will be okay. We are aware of that outcome, and we are also aware that irl is different than online, and we would only date if we met AND still had a connection. K? Good.

The thing is, MY ANXIETY IS EATING ME UP. More specifically, anxiety about my emotions. I think I like him enough already that I dont want to be just friends and let him go. But since a small child I have this anxiety over what I want for myself and what I feel. Im scared that I wont get what I want because I cant control my feelings. Aka years of panic over sexuality, my previous relationship(and it has gotten to worse paranoia levels than that but i dont want to get too deep into it).  Basically. I dont want to feel things that will cause me the outcome I dont want. Not like its not okay to not like him, thats completely okay, simply the anxiety doesnt allow me to have fun and try things out, because thats what we are doing.

So. Pls tell me u also go through this. And advice. Take in mind that any outcome in this situation is fine. BUT IM STILL EATING ME UP.

Help i have suffered for years over this :)) I wanna allow myself to let my emotions decide for themselves and be uncomfortable when things are okay because theyre new and I want to experience them.

Also him living away isnt a problem because we both have the needs to meet, we are just seeing how things go."
1416,How to cope with emotional scars left by previous employers,"Hey all,

So I work in IT and I have changed jobs within that area a number of times, the 2 times I have done this is due to poor working environment where IT is not thought of highly. 

The first job we received no training and unless you were seen doing busy work like cleaning or dismantling boxes you were seen as lazy so being sat on a laptop learning was bad. I left there after being accused of being lazy and feeling fedup. I then moved to a new job where I had more work but again, the general treatment of IT was low, end user says jump and we ask how high kinda thing, to the point where if you were clearly doing something like a computer setup and doing cable management users would ask you to do things rather than raise a ticket. Also a lot was expected of you after hours and no learning provided unless via book. This job resulted in me having a panic attack and being let go for ""mental health and errors which got pinned on me"" basically, I was a scape goat I feel but luckily I had another job lined up. 

Now I just constantly feel im not suited for this kinda job, constantly worried, nervous, even scared of any new tech I see and dont understand. Things definitely are not helped with lockdown and being cut off from team mates and colleagues but I feel my last jobs have damaged me and really shaken my confidence when it comes to my field.  has anyone else gone through this? how did you shake this negative feeling."
1417,I have no one to talk to about my mental health.,"I hate talking to my family about my mental health and illness. Everytime I try talk about it everyone just becomes quiet and awkward. And not because they listening. It's so difficult to try and find people that will understand what you are saying and that will be engaged with what you are talking about. I have never ever met anyone with my disorder before (that I know of) and it's so so difficult to talk about it because no one knows what to say.

I can talk to my partner about it here and there but I know any time you talk about something to someone too much they eventually get sick of it and no longer become interested. I also feel like he is becoming a lot less patient with me. Which is okay because you cant always be completely okay with something, but I feel like he is just not being as understanding with it anymore.

I'm feeling really frustrated and really lonely. No one has been free to talk or they have been out of reach. Or they just arent someone I can openly talk to, which Is really starting to take such an extreme blow at my mental health."
1418,Sad boi hours 2: electric boogaloo,"Posting this on a sub where I might get some advice lmao 

Basically I don’t have any healthy coping mechanisms and too many problems for that to be fine anymore. Idk what the root of the issue is so I can’t really expect help with it but I’m scared that someone’s going to find out about the way I’m coping with some stuff and tell my parents or something. I’m too scared to open up to people and actually ask for help when I need it but I’m pretty sure that if I keep doing what I’m doing it’ll end up killing me and I don’t know how else to deal with it. Advice is appreciated lol"
1419,too much wrong with me ??,"most people who know me know that i have mental issues. depression, anxiety, bipolar and an ED. i’ve been hallucinating, both visually and audibly, for quite a long time now. over 8 months i’d say? but it’s recently been getting more often and intense. i know it could possibly be a side effect of my other illnesses, or medication n drugs (haven’t had a lot) that i’ve taken, but should i be concerned? i don’t wanna talk to anyone about it because i feel like i already have enough wrong with me. scared to even tell my psychologist."
1420,"I’ve been off my medication for around 2 months now... long, thanks if you have the time to read.","For some context, earlier last october i had been off my medications for around 4 months which led to me being hospitalized inpatient in an eating disorder facility for 2 months, part of that was only partial 12 hour days but i still had to live alone in a different state. I was discharged early December, not because i had gotten any better, but because i was refusing treatment and it was a voluntary program. Two weeks after said discharge i was readmitted inpatient to a psychiatric unit for 2 suicide attempts. 

I had been previously enrolled in a trade school, but they had a policy that you couldn’t continue that term if you missed 3 consecutive weeks, so i am no longer in school. I was hoping to start again until the corona crisis happened.

I am diagnosed w bipolar 1, OSFED (previously bulimia), and generalized anxiety. I think i may have ptsd but i’ve never addressed this with any of my doctors due to the fear of talking about specific events. 

The beginning of this year, pre-corona started off really nice. I got out of the psychiatric unit on new years, and spent it w a guy who got out the same day as me (who has now been my boyfriend for almost 3 months). I was back on my “miracle drug” lithium which i had not taken since back in june or july, and my life was turning around. I stopped self harming, i was eating normal meals a day without binging, i had a lovely boyfriend, amazing friends, and was about to start school again. My intrusive thoughts cut down A LOT, and i could go days without suicidal ideation. 

My boyfriend lives 2 hours away from me and was visiting my house when the quarantine started so he’s been staying with me since the end of february. The quarantine really got me off my schedule, especially since my boyfriend is a bit of a night owl, to the point where i was going to bed at 12-5pm and waking up around 7-10pm. 

This really through me off my medication routine, as i take all my medicines before bed bc they make me extremely tired, but if i was going to take them at the same time i did previously, i’d have to take them when i woke up.

This is a good time to mention, that i have extreme issues taking medication. (Part of the reason i believe i may have ptsd) I was never good at following a medicine routine to begin with, but during high school i had overdosed 5 separate times, one of which being especially traumatic. I now have a physical and psychological reaction to medications. I get very anxious, sweaty, my throat hurts, i feel nauseous and gag at just the THOUGHT of taking pills. I have to take pills one by one (i have around 8-9 prescribed to me at the moment), it feels like my throats swelling up, i shudder, gag, i even have flashbacks to the specific moments of my overdosing. On occasion i will throw up from taking my pills. This is with ANY medication at all. I have tried liquid medication (made me throw up more than regular pills), and crushing my pills actually makes me gag and shudder more from the taste and appearance. My doctor doesn’t recommend taking shots because it can cause weight gain and it’s also not available in the specific pills she wants me to take. 

Anyway, that aside, for those reasons, i just wasn’t motivated to find a way to work taking my medication into my new sleep routine so i just stopped.

That said, off my medication, i started cutting again, have extremely intrusive thoughts and constant suicidal ideation. I have more urges to start restricting again but i’m resisting. My boyfriend threw away all my knives and makes sure i eat, and while he assured me he knows i’ll have bad days and how i act while i’m off my medication isn’t who i am, hes also described me as non functional. i am constantly sobbing. i can’t leave my bed. the emotional pain is so intense, and i think it’s even worse because i haven’t experienced it in a few months But sometimes i claw at my skin and pull out my hair because i have no other way of self harming. 

My boyfriend is making me take taking my medication more seriously and tonight is going to be the first night i take them again and i hope i feel better soon enough. 

Aside from that, in terms of my eating disorder, my body dysmorphia has gotten worse. A bit of background on my eating disorder. I had an extremely toxic figure in my life since middle school commenting on my weight and eating habits but it wasn’t until freshmen or sophomore year that it became a real issue. It started off as bulimia which eventually turned into (in my opinion, due to the way i restricted and what i weighed) a form of anorexia but the diagnosis stayed as bulimia bc i guess once you start throwing up they think you do it forever. Late highschool it developed into a binge-restrict cycle and i went from being extremely underweight to slightly overweight. this has been extremely hard to accept. I am so used to being the skinniest person of my friends and family for my ENTIRE life, that now being the biggest person? i can’t even describe how much pain this has caused me in so many ways and i just wish i could rip my own skin off of me. I’ve come to accept that i do need to lose weight for my sanity, and i will even tolerate being a average weight for my height (even though i would love to be 100lbs again, it’s just not realistic if i don’t plan on actively restricting anymore). i know it’s a tricky slope to try to lose weight in a healthy manner for someone with an ed as it’s extremely easy to get sucked back in. but i absolutely cannot live life knowing i am technically overweight now. i think there is absolutely no way i can have the possibility of loving myself as is for many reasons. it’s also scary because i know i probably still won’t love myself at a lower weight, and all my work could be for nothing but at least i’ll be able to fit into old clothes lol.

i guess that’s it. life’s been kinda chaotic and i’m kind ready to just feel stable again."
1421,social isolation is too much,"this is ridiculous. i’m (18M) a high school senior and self-proclaimed introvert and i feel like i’m about to lose my mind. i need to rant, so sorry for this post in advance.

for one, i have diagnosed ADHD and i feel like online school is totally useless. i’m not retaining ANY information and i’ve given up on trying at this point. i’m going to fail my AP tests and i really don’t care anymore.

everything i’ve been looking forward to in the next several months is GONE. prom, extracurriculars, concerts, graduation.

i used to go out for a lot of walks at the beginning of social isolation but now whenever i go for walks, seeing the exact same houses and trees just makes me even more frustrated.

i feel like i wasted my senior year. i transferred before this year, and just when i was starting to feel comfortable and make good friends, the year got cut off before i could even process what was happening.

and on top of all that, i am stuck in a house with parents who consistently get into screaming matches with each other at 8am. they hate each other and get extremely upset with my brother, who has ODD and ADHD every day. not being able to go out with friends when they’re at their worst has got my mental health in the gutter.

if i don’t get to leave for college in the fall, i have no idea how i’ll keep dealing with this. it’s exhausting and i don’t think i can take several more months of this without regressing to the really bad place i was at for most of middle school and freshman/part of sophomore year."

1429,Help Explaining Weird Occurrence,"Good Afternoon,

I am in the midst of experience an incredibly weird sensation and I am not sure if it is the signal of some sort of break or other mental health concern but I honestly feel like I am going a little bit crazy. I have been working from home and am currently in the midst of a project. All of a sudden, while using the computer, I became oddly aware of how my pinky finger felt, resting against my ring finger as I used the computer mouse. 

As soon as I had this realization that I felt slightly uncomfortable, I have been unable to work for the past half hour. Ever time I touch the computer mouse, it is all that I can think about and it is driving me insane. I had a moment of hysterics where I almost cried over it for no reason at all. However, no matter what I do, it seems that I cannot just focus on my work without being distracted by that feeling and how it just doesn't feel ""right"" even though I haven't changed anything about my grip.

I don't know who else to reach out about this, but it just makes me feel like I'm having some sort of breakdown over something so weird and stupid and I wasn't sure if anyone here had any experience or knowledge of this kind of thing."
1430,I (16F) feel like I can't control my emotions.,"Hi! I've had this problem for as long as I can remember. I thought I should post here since I had an ""incident"" related to this just now.

So the incident: I had an arts assignment today. I was supposed to draw two people that were the opposites of each other (for example, poor and rich). I read the instructions wrong and only drew two people with nothing different about them. My mom saw the drawing, laughed a bit and explained the instructions to me, which made me cry since for some reason things like this always make me feel like I've failed everyone. So here I am, crying alone in my room for no reason again. 

So, this is more about starting to cry about everything. It bothers me and it often bothers everyone I'm around. I don't really have problems with other emotions, except sometimes feeling like nothing actually makes me happy or angry. My point is, I don't know if this could be related to some sort of mental illness or if it's just my personality. Help?"

I have the scariest pains and symptoms in the scariest places. I also have psychosis from letting my mental illness (self-diagnosed bipolar) go untreated. I'm absolutely terrified of this virus and I'm 110% certain it will kill me in the most painful suffering way possible if I get it, and I'm certain I'll get it if I leave my home. I'm on state insurance medicaid and they suck. I can't find a doctor that's worth a damn. They get all impatient and annoyed with me over the phone when I tell them I have a ton of conditions/symptoms, too many to list. I've talked to my family and my only friend and my toxic girlfriend and nobody cares. They just shrug it off like I'm the boy who cried wolf because I have a history of hypochondria. But even when I go into explicit detail so they know it's not fake, they still just ignore it. I guess they just can't handle their own problems and mine. I'm just so scared. I haven't been to a dr because I'm beyond terrified of them. I'd rather continue living in 99.9% certainty that I'm dying than to be stuck in that grave, somber moment where I have to hear the scary medical name of my diagnosis and get an expiration date. I'd then just rock back and forth in a corner in maniacal terror in anticipation of when that moment is going to come. I wonder if I'm truly the most ill person on Earth. I hope that if this virus was made in a lab, that whoever did this shit gets the most fucked up disease imaginable. Like some incurable flesh eating disease that starts at their toes. Fuck.

So in November, I left my school and started homeschool which has helped me and my depression is gone, but I still have that social anxiety.

After a year of therapy and an SNRI, I can officially say I haven’t slipped back into that depression for at least 6 months.

BUT my anxiety has turned me into a hermit (months before social distancing guidelines were a thing). I’ve always been a bit of an anxious person, but this is a bit ridiculous. It takes SO much energy to leave the house, meet up with friends, or even go on a date night with my husband. 

Because I tried to conserve my energy for things like nights out with my husband (for our marriage’s sake), which often includes going places that would naturally give me anxiety. I’d feign excitement, just to get through it.

However, as I have actively tried to work through my anxiety issues, I’ve noticed something. Every time I can tell I’m excited about something, I can also feel myself getting anxious. This all leads me to wonder if, somehow, my brain has confused excitement with anxiety. Is this a thing that can happen?"
1440,Repeated violent visuals in my head,"This is something I have never really talked to anyone about, I´m not even sure if it´s a big deal but it has always peaked my curiosity. Ever since I was a kid, earliest I can remember was when I was around 9-10, I would have pictures in my head that would play on replay. Mostly it would be when I was trying to fall sleep. The most recurring one was pictures of skin getting cut open and a lot of blood and such, and not only ""one"" picture on replay, it would be one subject, like skin getting cut open, and several similar pictures would pop up in my head on repeat until I fell asleep pretty much. And not things I have seen before as far as I know, but visuals I had no familiarity with. Another recurring theme was nails being pulled out (even writing it now makes me want to cover my nails). When I got older I started to cut myself as a form of selfharm, not connected to the pictures but for other reasons, and the pictures of skin getting cut started to become fewer, and I couldnt start to cringe and try to cover up any exposed skin as I normally would. Even now, that I dont actively selfharm, I have noticed the pictures getting conciderably less common. Now it very rarely bothers me and at the time I just dealt with it and got over it as I didnt think much of it, but I´m still very curios as to whether or not it´s normal and if not, why I had them?"
1441,Long sleep,"I don't care if this is reccomended or not, I'm in a really hellish situation at the moment and literally all I can do is wait it out. Is there any way to achieve a continuous sleep of 24/48 hours or more?"

1443,Finally learned how to set boundaries and realized how manipulative and emotionally abusive my friend/roommate has been to me.,"Hello, 

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships. Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 2: The first night I stayed at my SO's place overnight because I was tired and couldn't safely drive home without my glasses (which I forgot) [https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz](https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz)  
Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years. She was upset that we couldn't ever hang out, even though we lived together, watched TV together, made dinner together, but would never try to make plans with me outside of that. So it's my fault.

I really need advice on how to cut off a friendship as smoothly as possible while we are both still on the same lease for another 6 months. I also would really appreciate any advice you have on processing and moving forward from a situation like this. It's been very hard since I am working from home, isolated with her every day. TIA."
1444,My Baby Sister is Self Destructing. Advice on how to help?,"Let me preface by saying my sister is young (Tween). She is not even a teenager yet. I know that doesn't invalidate her experience what-so-ever but I'm so scared because she is so young. 

Due to the recent outbreak, my family and I have discovered my little sister has been self-harming, is depressed, has anxiety, and is bulimic.  We also found out she has purposefully waking up at 2AM in the morning. (She never did this before the quarantine. In fact, she never wanted to wake up to go to school) 

Prior to this, we weren't home much because of school and work so we never noticed. We've always been pretty close and I can't help but think that I should've been there and have noticed and I don't know what to do or how to help. 

Whenever we try to bring it up or ask her how to help, she clams up and won't say a word. 

I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. Because I'm so afraid I'm going to lose her. I can't help but blame myself sometimes. 

She's said that she doesn't feel like she measures up to my parent's standard and the bar I've set as the older sister. 

Today we found out that she has been throwing up before and after meals. She eats pretty well (She loves sweets and junk food) but her weight has never really been a problem and she is not fat by any means-- just not skinny. I should add in that the rest of my family is quite thin, including myself. 

Another thing playing in is her sexuality. She's confided in me that she thinks she's bi. I have no problem with that and love her regardless but she thinks that my parents will hate her based on some previous comments about the LGTBQ+ community. Honestly, my mom won't care if she's an alien. At this point, she just wants her to be safe and happy. 

She's not open to our help or outside help. 

I need advice. If you were in my sister's situation, how could I help you? What could I do more to understand? 

Also, does anyone know where I could find online advice from professional therapists or psychiatrists? I would like to know what they think. 

Stay safe

\~A worried sister"
1445,Anxiety,"Last Thursday I(19F) had to go out grocery shopping for my family. Then Friday I had to drive 30 minutes to a pharmacy that was open. I wore gloves, a mask, and religiously put hand sanitizer on after discarding the gloves. I’m now sick, I’ve chatted with a nurse online and she says I definitely have a virus. We don’t know if it’s THE virus rn. I’m self quarantined to my room right now. If my parents got sick from me and it was the virus it’d be a death sentences. I feel so alone, and angry at how people are treating this. I also have a compromised immune system but I don’t really care what happens to me. I’m more worried about my parents."
1446,Can anyone recommend me some over over the counter anxiety medication that actually works?,"I'm going crazy at home. I need to start taking something or else I'm gonna lose it. I have no therapist and I'm stuck in a toxic enviroment at the moment.

Please share some of the things that you've had positive results with. Some herbs may also help, but non-perscription meds are what I'm looking for."
1447,Understanding the Buzz About Magic Mushrooms: Understanding the Buzz About Magic Mushrooms,"Cultures throughout the world have used plants and fungi with psychedelic properties for millennia to produce altered states of mind. More than just temporarily transforming the lens through which one sees the world, these drugs were considered sacred, because those who took them frequently had mystical or religious experiences.

To this day, many individuals who use psychedelic drugs feel they grant a certain kind of perspicacity, and the number of people who are using psychedelics appears to be growing. Several clinical trials are now examining the effects of these drugs, while some cities and states are considering decriminalizing “magic mushrooms” that contain the psychotropic compound psilocybin.  

While under the influence of the drug, users typically experience changes in mood and perception, a sense of oceanic boundlessness, radically altered reasoning and thinking, and auditory and visual hallucinations. Once the acute effects of the drug subside, however, many people feel as though they have a heightened sense of empathy and self-awareness, which is why these drugs have generated much interest from many medical researchers. While this is not an endorsement by any means—since far more research needs to be conducted before medical science can definitively say these drugs are effective—preliminary clinical trials indicate that these aftereffects may have therapeutic benefits, especially for those who are confronting the limits of their mortality.

Perhaps some of the most promising research into psychedelics examines how these drugs affect those who are in the latter stages of a terminal disease and experiencing existential distress due to their impending death. Several studies have shown that psychedelics such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms”) are effective at producing antidepressant and anxiolytic effects by letting these individuals come to terms with their own mortality.

Not only are these findings relatively new, but they are also supported by strong data sets. This is important because many Western physicians and medical researchers would have looked askance at such claims about psilocybin had the evidence not been so strong.

For decades, even the suggestion that psilocybin and other psychedelics possessed therapeutic potential was often seen as an endorsement of not only the drugs themselves but the counterculture of the 1960s. And while many researchers continue to associate the use of psychedelics like psilocybin with this counterculture, the stigmas are beginning to subside as more research is published that strongly indicates that psilocybin does have therapeutic potentials.

Cultural stigmas surrounding the use of drugs like psilocybin are not the only obstacles to research. There are also legal restraints. At this time, psilocybin is still considered a Schedule 1 drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which means there are significant regulatory barriers preventing researchers from obtaining and testing the compound. The good news, however, is that the FDA has designated psilocybin as a breakthrough therapy on two separate occasions, most recently for the treatment of a major depressive disorder. Breakthrough therapy designation, according to the FDA, “is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.”

**How Does Psilocybin Affect the Brain?**

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring tryptamine compound found in at least 100 species of mushroom. When consumed orally, which is the typical route of administration, psilocybin is converted into psilocin through hepatic metabolism. Psilocin, not psilocybin, appears to be the pharmacologically active substance responsible for the psychotropic effects of “magic mushrooms.”

Psilocin has a high affinity for serotonin (5-HT) receptors. It is a partial agonist of 5-HT2A receptors (&lt;40 percent activation efficacy), and also binds to 5-HT2C, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B receptors in the thalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). As the thalamus is responsible for processing sensory input, it seems likely that the hallucinations associated with psilocybin use stem from the activation of receptors in this part of the brain. Meanwhile, because serotonin receptors throughout the PFC help regulate numerous crucial functions throughout the body, including one’s circadian rhythm, memory, social behavior, and mood, it is believed that psilocybin can affect these functions, as well.

Psilocybin and other psychedelics, like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and mescaline, also activate 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in the PFC, which in turn have downstream effects on serotonergic and dopaminergic activity. The increase in dopamine is believed to be part of the reason for some of the psilocybin’s effects on mood, such as euphoria, and the commonly reported phenomenon of depersonalization.

Additionally, the stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors found in pyramidal neurons located in the deepest layers of the cortex leads to increased levels of extracellular glutamate in the PFC. This release of glutamate activates AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. The activation of these three receptors (5-HT2A, AMPA, and NMDA receptors) is believed to then cause an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Increased BDNF is strongly associated with improved cognitive functioning, mental health, and memory.

[Repeated doses ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2884)of some psychedelics have also been linked with the downregulation of 5-HT2A receptors in the PFC, which may contribute to the therapeutic effects of psychedelics like psilocybin. 5-HT2A density was found to be significantly higher in post-mortem samples from patients with major depression. Studies in rodent models, meanwhile, have shown a strong correlation between increased 5-HT2A receptor density and anxiety-like behavior.

**What Do the Studies Say?**

There have been numerous studies involving psilocybin that I have touched upon in a [previous post](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201906/psilocybin-101). To quickly summarize, these studies have found that psilocybin may be effective at treating:

* Clinical anxiety and depression caused by life-threatening cancer diagnoses
* Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Addiction to alcohol or nicotine

Additionally, Griffiths et al. reported that a majority of individuals who took psilocybin experienced an improvement in mood and attitude. Many also felt that the experience was one of the most meaningful events in their lives. This was not just a passing phenomenon. After more than one year, 58 percent still ranked the psilocybin session as one of the top five most meaningful experiences in their lives; 64 percent said it increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction to either a moderate or an above-moderate degree; and 61 percent believed the experience was associated with a positive behavioral change.

**Is Psilocybin Safe?**

For psilocybin, the prevalence of abuse and serious adverse events is low in comparison to other major classes of abused drugs, and researchers have found that any significant association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and an increased likelihood of mental illness or suicidal thoughts, plans, or attempts simply does not exist. Moreover, psilocybin has a very low risk of overdose toxicity. It is estimated that a lethal dose would have to be 1,000 times larger than an effective dose. However, psilocybin can produce side effects like hypertension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, vertigo, confusion, and increased sensitivity to light due to the dilation of the pupils.

It should also be noted that the subjective experience of being under the influence of psychedelics (often called a “trip”) is highly variable and influenced by an individual’s mindset and their environment. These two components are known as “set and setting,” and they can have a significant effect on one’s experience, even when the same individual has been given the same doses. A positive experience may inspire life-changing epiphanies and grant individuals a greater perspective on life. A negative experience may result in disturbing thoughts or hallucinations, which may lead to anxiety, disorientation, delirium, and, in extreme circumstances, temporary psychosis. Researchers have found that they can significantly diminish the likelihood of negative experiences by providing patients with more preparation and interpersonal support during the period of drug action.

Though there remains a great deal of stigma surrounding the use of psychedelics, research into these drugs has shown that they do hold a great deal of promise so long as they are administered in a controlled and clinical environment or under the guidance of individuals who are experienced in the use of psychedelics. Whether or not these findings will encourage the loosening of restrictions and regulations in the United States is a question which we will only be able to answer as more research is published, and the case for the use of psychedelics becomes stronger."

1449,Athlete's Mental Health Podcast,"Hi everyone, 

I struggle with anxiety and confidence crisis, and it was made much worse after my Grandfather committed suicide when I was 20.  I struggled with this for months, consumed by of sharing what I was going through to my teammates and coaches during my time in collegiate football. I believe I'm not the only athlete who's gone through this. I created this podcast to try to raise awareness for athlete's who struggle with their mental health.

1450,Why am I mean to the ones that love me most ?,I’m so quick to get mad at my dad or my fiancée. It’s easy for me to keep cool around other friends and family . Idk it’s starting to make me sad . Anyone else ever have a problem like this
1451,Anyone with experience with mental hospitals,"HI, my mom has just been admitted to a mental hospital / behavioral health institution and I am very worried. She had a complete breakdown (not sure if thats the right word to describe it) where she completely loss touch of reality and begun coming up with lies in her head and swearing they were real (EX: she was being searched for by the police). Along with a few other very strange behaviors. 

My problem is that I do not know what to expect from the mental hospital and what I should be looking for / what questions I should be asking the people there. Is there anyone who has experience with mental hospitals who I could possibly PM to ask a few short questions? I would greatly appreciate it. 

Also, feel free to post anything in this thread that you think I might find useful / guide me to any resources. 
 
Thanks"
1452,made online therapy appt just now,"idk where to even post about this. 54 year old woman. have been in quarantine/stay-at-home (NYS) for 5 weeks now. have 13 year old daughter with ADHD, generalized anxiety, sleep disorder, clingy yet always pushing me away. 17 year old son. in community college, (online) very introverted, i worry a lot about him since he’s not open with his feelings. husband working from home, has to go to work a few hours once a week. he has ASD, ADD, APD, OCD, etc etc... he’s sometimes great, other times everyone’s walking on eggshells. 

i have anxiety, ADHD, sensory issues, blah, blah, blah. history of complex trauma, my mom passed away 2 years ago. not close with my family (my brother abused  me), my closest friends are good people, just happen to have lots of needs. 

recently had a terrible experience with the mom of one of my daughter’s best friends. we helped them move back to NY from another state after her H finished his degree. found out after she moved in with a mutual friend (her and her 5 kids and H) that she was talking a lot of crap about me behind my back, but was still accepting help from me, while refusing to apply for *any* of the MANY MANY programs here that would help her and her family. she was even implying my religious practices were evil. this really upset me, and when i stopped helping her, and our friend insisted she move out at agreed upon date, despite her H not getting a job, because 5 kids in a tiny house are a giant infection risk, she became a baiting jerk with everyone. i know now she likely has borderline personality disorder, but i was still heartbroken by everything that happened. 

put that situation together with a pandemic and not only super easily triggered anxiety, but having trauma issues too. I DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN TO MY FAM, esp my H. 

none of this has ever happened before. just grocery shopping is killing me. so many of my coping mechanisms just vanished. my poor daughter is suffering and i cant (wont) fix her not being able to see her friends. everything is very difficult and i cant make anything better. i dont even know what to ask for help with.... 

hi! i’m matilda, and everything is just fucked up."
1453,Need Help : STUCK IN PROCRASTINATION HELL,"I'm 22(M) currently in the final year of undergraduate degree.

I  have been interning as Software Engineer in a startup since last July. I  got offered full time positioned there in November and then I continued  my internship which was supposed to last till December.

My  performance was really good until November, I used work extra hours and  learnt a lot during that time cause I really wanted to get a offer  there, which would make my life easier by providing me the option to  skip interviews and hassle of job hunt.

But  after the job offer, my performance took a hit, I couldn't work as hard  as past few months but It was ok until February when I hit the slump. I  was told to work on a solo project unlike my previous tasks. I missed  deadlines by 3 times and more. (I was bad at giving timelines since the  beginning). Adding insult to the injury, because of the covid situation,  I have to do work from home. My productivity became almost nill. I  started lying regarding my tasks and delayed timelines.

I  am ashamed of myself, but  still could not concentrate on the work even  during work hours. I browse reddit, youtube most of the time and play  CSGO(I never play during work hours). tried watching motivational  videos, did not help. One day, I blocked all the sites in my laptop, but  still could not be productive.

I  also feel like my boss is too good of a human being. He always was cool  when I missed the deadlines, pushing me complete it asap.

My financial situation is also not great,have to pay the education loan.

SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME IN GETTING MY SHIT TOGETHER. How do I concentrate on my work?"
1454,What is this called,"recently i noticed when i get upset or i freak out, it feels like my body is shutting down. my mind goes blank and it’s hard to breathe. I start crying, hyperventilating, and get nauseous. does it have something to do with my mental ?"
1455,Past life events creeping up on me,"I've been doing really well, though now we're about 2 or 3 weeks into quarantine I'm starting to feel it a bit more intensely.

Though this is my problem:
About 2 years ago my nurse said I could possibly be suffering from PTSD from things I had mentioned and some older notes on it from a previous psychiatrist, in the uk in the NHS it can take a long time to even start working with a psychologist, I was placed on a waiting list but it's taken some time still, I've also had to move since then to another team so hopefully my place in line is still intact. I have moments where I'll be pretty much reliving moments I don't like, it's really quite real when it happens, I was told these are flashbacks but I don't know why but I feel I don't really have the right to say I experience flashbacks right now, so I describe them as they feel. But it's like when I daydream, except I can't help it and it's like I'm there again, if I was to conciously think about something in my past that I don't like, as much as it's upsetting I'm still quite grounded where I am so I can bring myself back, though sometimes I'm forced there in these moments to not only see everything again but feel the emotion. Recently I've been having small panic attacks and my chest has been really hurting which I think is safe to put down to anxiety. I find at the moment staying away from anything and everything that could spark one of these moments helps, so I'm avoiding talking about my time in hospital, and how some people have treated me through my younger years until things have a bit more normality. Though does anyone in a similar boat have any strategies they use that work? Also as embarrassing as it sounds though I think it's relevant - I've now totally got a porn addiction, I don't mean to sound inappropriate with that but I often use porn as a sort of self treatment and when I feel worse the addiction gets worse, and it can get really overwhelming at times."
1456,Learning to be okay?,"How do you accept help and just let go of everything you have known for so long? My parents are making me go to a counsellor and I feel like it will just be the beginning. There’s so much I don’t say and I know I should tell people and I probably need help but I can’t seem to be okay with letting myself talk. It’s like a tripwire panic shutdown in my head, you know?"
1457,Dreaming?,"I dont know if anyone can help me out and I am going to see a professional soon.

I feel like I'm dreaming all the time and I dont know why. I poke myself probably 20+ times a day so I can check that I'm not actually dreaming. Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I'm so tired and confused"
1458,Feeling so lonely right now :(,I rarely feel like this. But I feel like no one will ever like me.
1459,do I voluntarily admit myself to the hospital?,"I live in the UK and I'm 18. tw for suicidal thoughts/urges, panic attacks and general triggery mental health stuff.

So. Basically I've been mentally ill for a really long time, got bad when I was 13, settled down and hasn't been this bad in a long time. Got a week off work yesterday bc everything was becoming way too much.

Ended up having a panic attack on the bus on the way home from work last night and called a suicide hotline that night. Woke up this morning, spent the morning and afternoon feeling sick and shaky and not good. A friend sent me a link to another site they thought might be helpful, called them and the woman was very nice. She calmed me down, got me to eliminate various steps I could take to end my life and got me to work through an action plan with her. Felt fine for a couple hours but now the thoughts and urges are back. I'm terrified. and I have no idea what to do. 

My family is not an option, I don't currently have any diagnoses or treatment or meds (due to a lot of bullshit involving my family). I don't know if self admission will help or if it's too much or not enough but I'm just reaching my limit."
1460,Advice,[deleted]
1461,Is it possible or wise to contact a retired doctor?,"Okay, so here's a long story short.

I have OCD and ASD. When I was thirteen, I had insomnia, meltdowns, and outbursts as a result of my OCD. I had a doctor tell my parents that I had ""pediatric bipolar disorder"" that ""cycled within seconds"". 

Later, I would get re-diagnosed. I would also learn that the ""ultra-rapid cycling pediatric bipolar disorder"" that my doctor swore up and down was a real and permanent thing was actually heavily speculative, and had been rejected by the DSM committee twice. I'm off medication now and have been for about a year. It's been around 7.5 years since anyone thought I had anything resembling bipolar.

My relationship with my family has deteriorated. My parents kept acting like whether or not I had bipolar ""didn't matter"" and nothing would happen again because ""it hasn't happened yet."" They refused to educate themselves, and my doctor took no pains to educate them (or me). I've spent around three years angry and exasperated that I feel like I, as the pediatric patient, am the only person who ever took the diagnosis seriously.

I also struggle with resentment towards her. I don't know what she thought of the diagnosis or why she made it. I'm left wondering ""why?"" Did she care at all? Was she just too burnt out to make sure that everything was actually accurate? My mom implies sometimes that the diagnosis was ""for insurance companies"" (and other times she implied it was genuine-- she's inconsistent with it). 

This doctor has been retired for three years. I brought up contacting her three years ago, and my parents shot it down. They said it would be ""improper"" and that my anxiety about mental health would ""just go away on its own."" (It has not.)

So I want to contact her because I want to know why she made the diagnosis... But also, I want closure. I want to be able to forgive her if at all possible. It was beyond traumatic to deal with this diagnosis, and she's been this big enigma in my life for three years. 

She's probably 79-80 years old now. She may not be alive, I don't know. No matter what she says, I just want some closure and to be able to move on. Does that make sense? Or is it ill-advised?"
1462,I feel defective. Rant/vent,"I know all the things that can make me better, all the things to do to help my problems, but I just can't do them. I don't have the energy, I don't have the drive or for some other reason there is just an invisible wall that I can't get over.

I have ADHD. My medication is great till the come down crash. Then I am feeling like I am now. Anxious, depressed and really upset. Exercise would help a lot with this, but I can't do it. I've tried so many times to keep a pattern and it just always falls part. Retaining habits is the biggest hurdle in my life and they are what I need to get better and I just can't do them.

I also have depression, so of course my brain is working with even less will-power than what is typical for a lot of mental health issues. It's just sapped away. Everything feels futile and hopeless when it rears it's ugly head, which is at least a few times a day.

I also have OCD which makes my life what I call a living nightmare. Mine is Morbid, so I think about depressing, scary, crazy unwanted things many times per day, sometimes falling into a trap of rumination on the thing and then getting OCD about ruminating on it and then freaking out because I'm OCDing about OCDing. Anxiety over anxiety, but less generalized.

I also have autism recently diagnosed so stress of almost any form is at least 2 fold and I just shut down. And I stress about everything. I don't know how to relax at all. I'm constantly tense and I don't sleep well, even though I sleep a lot.

Medications I've tried Sertraline, Voxra, Fluxotine, Buspirone (permanently made my anxiety worse), Concerta and others I don't remember by now.

Everything has the same pattern. It works for a week or less, then the good or neutral effects it had bring side effects that make it not worth taking.Any habit I develop lasts maybe a month, sometimes a little more, then drops off. I've tried so many diets, eating plans, exercise routines, or just up keep habits like bathing and brushing teeth.

So little sets me off. Any added stress and I just crumble. I'm also not a functioning person at all.

And I just feel defective. So many of my issues interplay on each other to. Got ADHD? Exercise. Can't because depression. Got ADHD? Can't because anxiety and meds make it worse. Got Autism and ADHD? You screwed. Should go out and meet new friends to help all these issues? Can't got social anxiety and so on and so forth.

Medications don't help that much and I just don't know what to do. I can't exercise, I'm desperately trying to meditate (7 minutes or more, but I just feel like I'm waiting for that to fall through for on reason or another).  And I'm just lost, sad and scared."
1463,Is my dad going crazy?,"He’s above 60, we’re from EU. He has 2 degrees in fields considered to be hard. As I remember he always was a little eccentric. He has a conflict with my mother, the whole life he’s complaining how bad she is, how bad things she has done, told me stories which happened before I was born. Recently I asked my mother about them and she said something completely opposite.. like it wasn’t that grandma who done sth but the opposite. He was accusing my mother of throwing dead mouses into his mother bed.. but his mother was seeing psychiatrist.. I got to know that recently... he didn’t want help from my mothers family when my parents were building the house because he thought the family wants to take his money, always stubborn. I have to emphasise that my parents didn’t get divorced, idk why and still live under the same roof, but as I always remember they acted like roommates that just tolerate their presence. Thus, when I was a child and teen I thought that it’s normal for parents to have separate rooms and stop loving each other after few years. I know, some of you may think wtf but in my family serious talk doesn’t exist. I got to know most things accidentally and my parents try to keep like nothing serious happens, we’re OK. Now, when I’m an adult I know my family is fu*ked up in many ways, but I have never experienced something different (like loving parents starting to hate and divorce) so it was what it was.. When I got to the uni my father lost a job because of politicians and him exposing some million € frauds and corruptions. He was 2 years before retirement, so he just retired early. And now his behaviour became worse. He has even separate food, skillets, cutlery from me and mom, especially mom. He hides his food in the basement and he puts it on separate shelves or separately from those which my mom bought. He became antivaxxer, vitamin C proponent, takes crazy doses of supplements, watches Ancient Aliens on TV and recently.. literally I wasn’t taking this so seriously, but this thing got me into thinking: he bought 6m mast with my country flag and plans to put in in front of a house. You may ask why? Because our home isn’t rectangular but has specific shape and the terrace is to low. If the flag will be placed in front of a terrace the house will become more rectangular, thus the circle can be build onto it and it prevents us from coronavirus... What may it be, what should I do, for what should I google? Reasonable arguments don’t help."
1464,"I've Been Working On Overcoming My Sexual Repression. And As A Result, I Found Myself (Long Story)","
I wasn't entirely sure where to share this story, but I've been really wanting to put it out somewhere. Most of my life, I had been living under what I now know to be called ""sexual repression."" Of course, like most people dealing with the same thing, I had no idea it was even there. The best way that I understand sexual repression is when someone all but stomps out their sexuality, either consciously or subconsciously avoiding it. And most situations I've heard about ha the same symptoms as me. I had absolutely NO idea how much having a healthy sexuality positively affects someone mentally, emotionally, and even physically. 

  
 My revelation came about 2 years ago when my boyfriend (now husband), discovered that I had never had an orgasm in my life. Not only that, but I also didn't know what an orgasm even was. On top of this, I knew nothing about my own body; what's a clitoris? What's a hymen? What do you mean that there is a physical response when I am aroused? Moreover, I didn't like to look at myself naked in the mirror. I had never even looked at my own vagina before, much less bothered to touch it out of curiosity. These are things I had never even ventured to consider. The thought of the logistics of sexual activity, or even the idea of personal pleasure, those things were just entirely off-limits to my imagination. Just a couple of important things to note here. First, my husband had been trying to have conversations with me about sex for months. He wasn't at all pressuring me into anything, as we were both waiting till we were married to have sex. We were having, what he believed at the time to be, conversations about what we both believed how we both felt about different aspects of sex. I, unbeknownst to him or myself really, had no idea what he was talking about. So imagine the shock when in one night we discovered that not only was I COMPLETELY out of touch with my sexuality, but I had never even known I was allowed to find it. The second thing I would like to point out is that I was 23 at this time. 

  
 I'm not sure how anyone else would have reacted to this epiphany, but I was horrified. The realization that there was an entirely separate part of me that I had been ignoring my whole life terrified me. I should note here that I do not believe that my repression came from any kind of abuse, more from a lack of encouragement or understanding from my parents. My mom and dad did the thing that I believe most parents do, which is briefly explain the part about making babies and quickly end it with ""if you have any questions, let me know."" I was a goodie-two-shoes and very shy as a kid, so naturally, anything that made Mom and Dad feel awkward was a no-no. As a result, sex was seen as something on a ""need to know"" basis; what I didn't know I didn't need to know. And that's how I lived until I was 23. Even when I thought I was sick, even when I had an embarrassing medical problem and told no one about it. Sadly, my parents' approach to the subject of sex isn't all that uncommon. I realized that in most families it is handled with the mentality of ""they'll figure it out,"" never helping encourage kids to ask questions and start conversations. There is a societal taboo on sex talk of all forms, which teaches kids that anything relating to it is bad. And so, clearly, this is the effect it had on me. And for those of you wondering, yes I did take a very brief sex-ed course in high school. However, because of my ""good girl"" predisposition, I all but ignored it. I was so embarrassed by mere sexual anatomy, that even the science of it was ""inappropriate"" to me. Even the brief informative class I had to take didn't reach me because I thought it was my place to ignore it. No one told me to think about my body, my attractions, my emotions, and as a result, I was out of touch with myself in so many ways. 

  
 My resolve to change this was almost over-night, as the next morning, I ordered books on the subject and texted my husband every little question I had. I considered my knee jerk beliefs on certain subjects; I questioned why I thought they were wrong rather than just believing they were wrong. I looked at my body regularly, sometimes having to really make myself do it but learning something new every time. It's been about 2 years since I discovered I was so sexually repressed, and I am nowhere near the same person I was. 

  
 I'm not sure if finding my sexuality had a direct hand in my growth as a person, or if stepping out of one box led to another. But in those two years, I've found a confidence I never knew I had. I decided I wouldn't be embarrassed about sex and therefore discuss it openly with my husband's siblings (and his parents.) The confidence has had an effect on my interests and my physicality. I feel more inclined to take care of myself, and I have been more and more excited to try all kinds of girly things that I thought were ""off-limits"" to me before. 

  
 My husband and I have been happily married nearly 6 months now, and even still, I break into tears over the girl I used to be compared to the woman I am now. She was so out of touch and scared of her own body; she had no idea who was hiding underneath her fear and ignorance. I am so thankful to be married to my best friend, who tirelessly worked to help me step outside my comfort zone after seeing how much it was harming me. I wanted to post my story somewhere because I know that there are other young women out there who go through sexual repression and think that's just the way life is. The feeling of not understanding yourself or your own body is not normal or healthy. But the good news is that there is a way out of it, it can be overcome. And when you discover your sexuality and accept it as a completely natural part of yourself, you're going to love the person you turn out to be.

Do you guys have any stories of yourself or loved ones that have experienced sexual repression? Have you stepped outside that box and realized what you were missing all that time? I would love to hear your stories!"
1465,Helping a friend,"So, my friend recently opened up about her self harm. She told me that she stopped last year, but yesterday she told me she did it again. I really want to support her in any way and help her recover. But I really don't know what I should do. I know that she has a lot of problems at home and no easy access to therapy. So if you think you can help. Please do so &lt;3"
1466,I'm so sad it's effecting me physically,"So I have been dating this guy for a year. First guy I have ever loved, and I have dated a lot. I basically lived in his apartment for 5 months and we were going to move into a different apartment together. 

Glad forward to February. We get in a fight about some things, mainly about how he doesn't like that we don't do everything together bc i work FT nights and am in grad school. He was also mad I went to Istanbul and planned it without him, but his greencard wasn't in (he is persian, I am American and we are in america) so he couldn't go. 

Anyway later I ask him about the new apartment and he tells me we arent moving and gives a couple excuses. Later I ask him why he didn't think to tell me and basically he starts gaslighting me and changing his stories. 

By now I am mentally worn out from these things happening and trying to communicate with him and things going nowhere. 

I told him if he doesnt communicate with me we won't work out. He kept giving the excuse that he is 32 and ""set in his ways"" and doesn't like being direct but i said too bad. We can't have a healthy relationship if you don't communicate. I've been initiating almost all the hard conversations. I can tell he tries sometimes and he helps me with things a lot. I can tell he cares. But I just can't go on dating him if he chooses not to change. 

Knowing I very well may need to break up with him after quarantine is breaking my heart and I am so sad to the point I'm not running anymore and feel so weighed down and sad. I just want to stay at home and watch netflix and eat comfort food. I feel like I dont have energy. 

Anyone else gone through this? I'm trying to get it together since I'm finishing up the semester and trying to do well. And running to meet my fitness goals. But I just feel like I'm in a cloud of sadness, as cliche as it sounds."

1470,Haven’t self harmed in over 12 years. Relapsed today.,"I had a fight with my boyfriend over coffee.

He suffers from something, I don’t know what it is but when he is commented with something negative regarding his behavior he flips completely. Initially he gets defensive then switch to blame.
It happens even with super minor things and he doesn’t admit that it’s an issue. In the end he depicts me as instigating his behavior and as the reason he is in constant need of defending himself.

I had doubted myself all my life and I still do when he says that it is my fault. Today it was different though. I refused to take any blame or any responsibility over he guilt tripping me but it was super hard.

So I bit my arm full force. I didn’t bleed but it hurt and it’s still sore and a little bit purple. 

I know I did it because it was too hard to stand my ground and also because deep inside I know I am part of the problem. It has always been like that in my life, that I am causing all the problems and it’s like a curse. 

I am already in therapy with a great mental health professional for issues with my childhood and I am aware that this behavior stems from forgetting all the other tools I have built to protect me. 

I just needed to put it out there so I know I am not crazy."

1472,A new movement,"Hi everyone,

I am new to Reddit, so please forgive me if I’m not well-versed in the way things run around here. 

I have recently started a new business/organization that is combing creativity and art to encourage people through a website dedicated to helping others. I am partly coming to this through a mental health advocacy angle because I have struggled with mental illness my whole life and want to use what once brought me pain to help others. 

Right now I am planning on writing inspirational messages, graphics featuring photos, and videos. I am also working on doing instructional tai chi videos because I am getting my certification to teach and believe that it can really help others. 

Right now I plan to fund this through selling apparel that features some of the graphics and artwork. I am reaching out to this community to see what their thoughts are and whether or not they would be willing to check this out when it goes live in a couple of months.

I know that this is a really hard time for everyone, and I hope that whatever it is that you may be going through, that you come out stronger on the other side. I believe in you, and I hope you believe in yourself too. 

Please leave your thoughts and suggestions in the comments. I’d love to hear what you have to say."

1478,Not really sure about mental health and want to learn more about it,"Hello I’m a 22 year old male and have been having a lot of problems ,especially within the last two years , with depression. I have issues talking to people about topics like this so I usually keep it to myself but last year I spoke to a doctor about it and not much was done, we just talked a bit and I haven’t sought out anymore help. 
The main issue is I don’t understand my mental health and I’ve noticed that a lot of traits I have are symptoms of adhd, bipolar disorder etc and want to seek help but I don’t know if I actually need help or if I’m just over exaggerating because the state of my life is steadily going downhill and that’s what you tend to do when that happens. I think I’d be more comfortable speaking to someone if I better understood my mental health so how would I go about doing so because even tho I may have most of the symptoms I don’t feel like I actually like I have the disorder. Mental health isn’t really a thing in my home and environment so it might also be a pride thing where I make myself think it could never happen to me. 
I was also thinking of taking Concerta as the main thing this has been affecting are my grades and I feel like that would help me overall. Where would I be able to get these from, I’m from the uk and have done a bit of research into them already.
I also had really bad anxiety as a teenager, going to gym has helped a bit but it still lingers sometimes.

Thank you."

1480,Constant overthinking and anxiety,"I overthink everything about how I look, how I act, whay I do, how horrible I am and so on.

Some People say ""love yourself and start focusing on other stuff"", but I have also met people who say that means I should change myself always to make other people happier, and thus making myself happier.

1481,My parents are in a loveless marriage. I don't understand their choices. Have I been conditioned to fail at romantic relationships?,"I (21) have never seen my parents (60&amp;62, still living together) show any affection towards each other. None. No physical touching. No gifts. They hardly spend time together. They don't have anything nice to say about the other. Chores are very much divided by traditional gender roles, they don't do anything for the other ""just because"". Their ideologies aren't even remarkably compatible. This has been true for as far back as I can remember. (They are capable of love. Doesn't mean either of them are good at it.)

I haven't even heard stories of them being in love. I have no clue how they met. No proposal/wedding stories. Nothing. In high school, my class was given a ""fun"" assignment about love, and we had to get responses to questions like, ""what is love,"" and,""how did you know you were in love,"" from both parents. I dreaded it so much, but I was curious for the answers, so I just put the sheet on my mother's desk and didn't say anything about it. When I got the sheet back the specific questions were left blank and the general questions had cliche answers. I couldn't tell if my father had also answered the questions or if my mother had answered twice in different handwritings. (We're not the type of family to talk about feelings.)

I have two older siblings (34&amp;32). The oldest is developmentally disabled and lives at home (perpetually five, can be self-sufficient, but requires lots of supervision). When my parents no longer sleep in the same room, I wonder if responsibility for my sibling is keeping them together. My other sibling is married with kids. I wonder if their relationship is headed down the same path as my parents'. I was not planned. I've been told this, in a joking tone, but it's obviously true. I wonder how I fit in to the trajectory of my parents' relationship. I wonder if I've been left romantically stunted from lacking examples of healthy relationships.

I don't want to dig into the topic with my family out of fear of severing the remaining threads and having to face the fallout. So here I am. I guess I'm just in a weird fucking boat, and I'm wondering if anyone's boat looks vaguely like mine. I don't even know how this boat is still floating. It's depressing, really."

1484,"Please help me help a very depressed (suicidal) friend...! (also, searching for psychiatric/psychological help in Vienna, Austria, any help would be absolutely amazing)","I don't know is there is a sub specifically for this kind of requests, so I am posting it here in the hopes that someone will redirect me. I am asking for help/advice concerning a friend who is really struggling right now. I can't do this alone and I would be immesurably grateful for any help.

**TW: suicide, SH, ED**

My very good friend is in Vienna, while I'm in a different country; borders are closed now, so even if I wanted to up and go get her physically, I can't. I have no idea what mental health help options there are in Vienna, how it works with insurance, nothing at all. I don't speak German, so doing research myself is difficult. So that's my first point - if there is anyone who know something about this, please let me know...! This is a desperate attempt, but I don't know what else to do, where else to turn.

Now about my friend. She is very depressed. She is in no long-term therapy and on no medications. She has never been officially diagnosed either, as far as I know. Therefore it's complicated, because I'm not sure if it's even possible to get admitted somewhere now, to go see someone... I have no idea what professional help options she has, all I know is she really needs it. I just spent couple hours talking to her on the phone and talking her out of giving up, she is borderline suicidal, feels hopeless, sees no silver lining. She just wants to give up. I'm one of her only safety nets as far as I know. The lockdown is extremely hard on her, the thing that normally helps her is going outside and being with people, but she can't do that now. I'm convinced that she needs to see a psychiatrist and get a prescription, she tried therapy before, but this is a long-term state (not this severe, but yeah). Just therapy wasn't enough. But again, idk how to do that now. I myself have never needed meds, so I have no idea how one would have to proceed. She feels hopeless and lost; so far she hasn't tried taking her own life, but her depressive states are gradually getting worse. She is coping in extremely unhealthy ways: she goes to alcohol for relief, way too much way too often, and I just found out that she's also started binging and purging as a form of self-harm, which really scares me. She never had any ED issues as far as I'm aware, this is likely really ""just"" a form of self-harm, or redirecting the pain.

I am essentially just asking for literally ANY kind of help/advice. How do I help her effectively? Does anyone have any experience with these things, and if yes, what would have helped you that a friend could do? I studied the r/suicidewatch guidelines about talking someone out of suicide, those are great. But that's for the immediate crisis, what else can I do...? She needs help, she can't do this alone, and it's not something that can exactly wait. And if this is not the right sub that could help me, where can I ask?

Thank you to everyone who read this far and who offers any insight. I truly appreciate it. Please stay safe and take care. You are loved and you matter so, so much more than you know."

i dont feel as a human as I am as for typing this

usually my level of existence is just sitting at this computer for hours straight, be it mindlessly watching videos, playing games. and the like

right now i suddenly feel nothing

i don't believe this is about depression. or boredom or loneliness

im used to this life

but why this. so sudden?

all im hearing is just incoherent humming from nearby beings and objects. my computer fan. etc

my head feels like a heavyweight anchor

i feel void of emotion right now. i have no way to explain it.

i dreamt of something peculiar

an

i saw an object. likely a railroad . or stairs or some of the like.

like a 1fps claymation with stairs or tracks of this unknown object being built upwards to what likely is the sky, or the other way around

i remember, somehow, the words ""negative energy transportation"" or something of the like.

this was something related to extra terrestrial

but this is just a void of thought. mindless thoughts. dreams

i don't know why im typing this

i don't know

i don't know what my purpose is

i rarely ever go outside. not in correlation with the pandemic. this has always been like this

i have no life

and yet somehow im usually either feeling ok. bored. normal.

i feel like i am currently in a level of existence away from usual

am i ok

this is likely a temporary experience

but maybe not

help please. if i am in the wrong place of this internet please tell me where to look

thank you kindly readers

from the recent message i got. i am indeed autistic. Aspergers syndrome but i don't think this has anything to do with it

i do not believe i am depressed. i felt similar to depression before but its nothing like this

not sadness. emptiness"
1486,Losing the things that I love,"My mental illness has been getting progressively worse over the past few years. A huge reason for my depression is my fear of loss. And no, it's not the fear of rejection or someone close to me dying. I've actually been coping really well with these situations. What bothers me is when I lose feelings for the things that I love. It's happened many times over the years and I just can't shake the feeling of defeat. It's difficult to explain because I haven't heard of anyone having the same issue and I am really struggling to make myself understood. But whenever I get emotionally invested in something, I will obsessively indulge in it and then suddenly lose interest forever. It's happened to me with both people and things that I have loved. My last relationship ended because of me. I just...lost feelings for my partner. Overnight. Nothing bad happened between us, we didn't fight, we didn't argue. A switch in my brain just went off and I stopped feeling for him.

Basically the same things happens to me with everything. If I become really interested in a hobby, it's only a matter of time until I start to hate it or become apathetic towards it. I really don't want to live like this anymore. I feel like I'm destined to always run from one thing to another because I can never settle. I can never have a stable personality. I can never have normal relationships and hobbies. All of my friendships ended the same way, because I just started feeling uninterested in all of my friends at one point. I can't take it anymore. I am tired of trying. I wish I was dead, life is a constant struggle."
1487,"I have depression and anxiety, but is it possible I have ptsd? (I just want an opinion because I’ve never shared these stories with anybody)","I’ve never told ANYONE about this, so it will be a jumble of words that may or may not make sense. It felt good to rant, so I just kept going. So here is a jumble of words that I call sentences.

When I was 4 years old, I was best friends with my cousin. At 5 he was sexually abused by his other cousin, (I don’t know exactly what she did to him) and did things to me. For example, once when we were playing house and pretending to sleep, he told me to come here. So I did. He told me to kiss him (this happens a lot and when I said no he would hurt me) I said no, and he got angry and grabbed me and pulled me on top of him on the bed and then made out with me. Then, I don’t remember. I can’t remember what happened next. He hurts me a lot, and once grabbed me and threw me out of my bus seat, tearing every muscle in my back. I am afraid of him. And this is only half of why I suspect what I do. When I was 8, I went to the movies with my cousin and my older sister. In the middle of the movie, she got up to go to the bathroom and asked me to go with her. I said no, because I wanted to watch the movie. She was raped in that bathroom. She took a long time, but I was the only one to notice. After the movie, we were supposed to have a sleepover at my grandparents, but she went home. I will never forget her face when she left. I feel guilty and I try not to think of it, but it’s hard. I could have prevented her depression, anxiety, ptsd, and suicide attempts. Almost every night, I dream about both of those nights. I dreamt that I watched it happen, I’ve dreamt it was me instead of her, I dream of people I love being raped or abused. When a older man talks to me, even if it’s a teacher, my stomach drops and tears come to my eyes."
1488,Everything is terrible and I’m just sorta here,"The world is falling apart and it’s stressing me out so much and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any motivation to do schoolwork since (at least for my school) our grades aren’t allowed to go down, only up, so if I don’t do any of the work  I won’t be penalized. Because of that, I feel like I have no reason to do any work. I don’t even want to do my APUSH notes (I love history) and I don’t want to take the AP test. All I really have the energy or motivation to do is just do nothing, or maybe watch tv. It sucks, because I have stuff I want to do but starting whatever it is takes more energy than I have so I just don’t do it. I feel like I’m just slowly losing my mind."
1489,Just a vent I suppose,"Not entirely sure if il benefit from this but I suppose it’s good to vent. I’m a paramedic in the midst of this crisis. Since the start of this pandemic I’ve lost a relationship of many years because of work, I’ve lost my home and now sleeping on a work mates sofa bed, I can’t see my family because they are vulnerable, I can’t see my friends because of lockdown, my alcohol intake has gone up ten fold, I’ve had my first cigarette in 4 years along with many others today. I don’t have anyone to talk too. No one I message constantly, no one I can say I’m driving now too and expect me to message them saying I’m safe. 

Most of all, no one to hug, talk and be comforted by after a tough day at work with tough decisions, sad scenes and witnessing life’s torn apart first hand. 

It’s a difficult feeling but I feel I’m spiralling and I can’t do anything about it. I deal with mental health patients a lot, I comfort a lot of these people but the question is.. 

Who comforts the ones who help?"
1490,am i wrong?,"so i’ve been crying nonstop for two days. i’m just extremely stressed and suffer from depression. the stress caused me to have a relapse after almost a year of no self harm. my mother basically forced me to tell her what was wrong so i told her about me wanting to be emancipated. i didn’t say why. i just want to be emancipated because this household is toxic and i feel like it’s adding on to my stress. i told her i was upset because i was feeling troubled that my plans for the future would go wrong and i would end up in a worse place than I am now. she got irritated and said i had no room to be stressed, that i’m not mature enough to handle myself in the real world. she says it was stupid to even mention that. maybe i am wrong for mentioning it... she brought up the fact that she has to pay bills and things of that nature. but the whole point of me moving out is i’ll have my own place and she’ll have more money for herself and the others. i already have so much money that i saved for my new apartment, all for her to tell me that she won’t sign the papers. i have to deal with this for 3 more years. any advice?"
1491,Super anxious about going back tomorrow. Please help,"I've been off work since Friday due to my mood really tanking and being unable to do much other than sleep. I want to get back to work as it gives me something to do. I am working from home at the moment which is what is causing my problems I think. I hate it. 

But anyway, I want to get back to work. I am anxious about what the rest of me team will think as I took some sick days the week before last as well so I've been off quite a bit. Other than my boss, I don't think anyone knows why I've been off. I'm also pretty worried about what's been going on whilst I've been out as we are really running close to deadlines and there was a load of important stuff I was meant to be doing. How do i control this anxiety. If it gets too bad I won't manage to get back to work tomorrow. 

What do I do? How do I stop the anxiety?"
1492,Is it normal that I get upset &amp; anxious when someone calls me their friend?,"This is a thing that has been 'affecting me' since I know myself. Every time someone asks me if we are friends, I get really stressed.

As a person I can say that I don't easily trust people, especially in cases like that. It takes me a lot of time to open up and ' act ' like I would do with my other friends, to start joking and be all sarcastic about different topics. But sometimes there is the instant click with that other person that I just feel comfortable from the very begging. 

However, in both cases when the 'we are friends' topic comes, I get upset. My stomach ties up. Literally last week I helped someone with something related to her writing stuff and then, with the best of intentions she asked me why I help her.  The only response I had in mind was ' because we are friends and friends help each other'. But I hesitated to send it. My stomach got all tied up and many stupid thoughts ran through my head.

Thoughts like: Will she feel offended if I call her my friend?  or, why would she like to be my friend anyway? , Will calling her my friend upset her?

Today, a similar thing happened. A person I have been chatting for a while on discord all of the sudden asked me ' would you consider us friends?'. This feeling came up again. I don't know this person in real life, basically, I know nothing about them, not even their gender. and again, I felt the exact same feeling when I was about to send that text. I felt that things are going a little too fast for me to handle. ( and of course, I am very wary when it comes to texting others online so I guess it's somewhat justifiable. You never know who hides behind that profile picture)

And these are two of many incidents that have happened during my life. The same thing happened with my current best friend when she introduced me to someone as her friend.

I just don't get why such a small word causes me so much stress. So many questions ran through my head and I always feel like it's too early to adopt such a title. That person I wanted to send the text, I know her for a whole year and hell do I trusted things I never did with other ppl. And it frustrated me that calling her my friend upsets me so much. 

I don't even know if what I am saying makes sense at all or if anyone else out there feels the same way"
1493,FINALLY,"So, today started as usual,but I finally did something today. I mean it was a few things around my apartment but I'm honestly proud of myself.

Usually I just completely ignore everything I'm supposed to be doing on my days off. Maybe its my mania but IDC because I was productive. I'm absolutely proud of myself given all of my mental issues that keep my confined. I feel good today."
1494,Advice on disconnecting,"I have been in a state of hesitation and indecisiveness lately when it comes to social media. Part of me knows I would probably a bit more in tune with myself and my thoughts, not to mention more productive, without a constant distraction and influx of unnecessary information streamlined into my head.

During this quarantine I, and I think almost everyone else in this country, find myself glued to my phone-on instagram, snapchat, twitter, etc. and every now and then I can feel the weight of these distractions pressing down on my mental health. Part of me hates the fact that I am displaying my life to people who I dont really care about. Ive been feeling personally lost and the fact that I am displayed a certain way online irritates me. I also feel like life is intimate and why would I want to be intimate with a bunch of randoms online? 

I am torn on what to do about this. Should I completely disable all of my social media accounts as a whole? Should I archive all but a few pics so I dont feel like I am oversharing with the world? Am I being over dramatic and over thinking all of this?

Currently I have a screen time limit on my instagram and twitter app and this has helped me stay productive a little bit. But the fact that I still have these accounts makes it easy to fall into a rabbit hole and get distracted.

I want to be my best self and I know the time I spend on social media I could spend reading or writing or creating a new hobby, being outdoors, working on finding myself etc.

Personal experiences and advice on this topic would be great :)"
1495,i idolise people whove done bad things and are toxic,"not like,, SERIOUSLY bad things but enough to get them cancelled. whenever someone in the cosplay community (cringy i know lol its just the community im most active in) gets called out for being toxic, part of my brain starts idolising them. it becomes my number one priority to dress like them and become their friend. and i dont even really know why. i know part of it is because i know theyll give me negative attention and part of my brain seeks that out. my relationships are always unstable because i basically live off of gossip and drama. i hate who ive become. i want to change but i need to stop idolising these people and seeking negative attention first, and i just dont know how to do that. if i stopped id have no sense of self and id feel like a blank slate i guess."
1496,The things I enjoyed doing during this free time I don't enjoy doing anymore,They were a distraction from my thoughts. But now since I've been doing them every day in this pandemic I no longer enjoy doing them. I could do my homework but homework is challenging and I don't like to struggle so I ignore that. So now I kind of just lay in my bed and do nothing and stress because there's something I probably should be doing whether it's school related or just life related.

1499,Seeking Guest Speakers for Thinking Out Loud [Live],"Hello, everyone... 

Start Day One ( [https://startdayone.org](https://startdayone.org/)), a non-profit foundation for mental health and suicide prevention, is looking for guest speakers to join our show, Thinking Out Loud \[Live\], where we discuss different aspects of mental health and mindset to proactively help people.

Our organization has a more proactive approach by trying to reach out to people BEFORE they get mental issues instead of being reactive and waiting for people to have mental issues, or worse, suicidal tendencies.

We are all experiencing a lot of stress, anxiety, and depression from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, where we are dealing with the loss of our income, experiencing business losses, coping with the change of our lifestyle, being lonely or worrying about the future of our situations.

The negative mental health effects of the pandemic are going to be catastrophic. The coronavirus may affect the elderly more but did you know that suicide is already the 2nd leading cause of death with young adults? Loneliness is one of the biggest catalysts of suicidal tendencies so this will potentially increase during the pandemic.

Did you know that there is a strong correlation between unemployment and mental health issues? It is estimated that for every 1% of the unemployment rate rise, we lose about 58,000 people from suicide?

We can't predict who needs help with their state of mental health so please help us in our efforts to reach more people to help improve your mental health during this pandemic to change your perspective and prevent you from going deeper into anxiety and depression.

If you're interested in being a guest speaker, you can learn more about our show here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQTCVdCp7DJQk5BKQAZASWYbJil\_nYKm](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYQTCVdCp7DJQk5BKQAZASWYbJil_nYKm)"
1500,I don't know what to do.,"My anxiety over time has just left me with serious breathing difficulty, and tightness around my back and chest.

Even though the source of the anxiety is largely gone, the feedback loop has started, and I'm anxious because I can barely breath, and because I can't get up a hill without feeling like I'm going to collapse (I'm not unfit otherwise, I am an athlete) because it's painful and makes me loose sleep, and because it's making everyday tasks very hard.

Why does my chest feel permanently tight and why is it not just as easy as loosening your muscles like if you were flexing your arm?

has anyone else gone through this and how did you get out to breathing normally again, and not feeling like every breath is a huge task?"
1501,ATTENTION SPAN IS NONEXISTENT,"My whole life, I’ve always gone from task to task, activity to activity. Rather than indulging in whatever I am doing in any given moment, I’ve purely lived in thinking about the next thing that I should be doing instead. I day dream a lot . Basically lived in my head my whole life. I’m 20 now and Through spirituality and just struggling obtain value from any thing I do, I’ve come to realize that I have been in an endless cycle of bad habits that I make excuses for to myself In my own head. Mediation has helped me stay grounded in the moment, but I still struggle. Besides starting to put plans and concrete structure to a calendar or agenda, is there anything I should be doing to aid in my battle to stay grounded, avoid disassociation, and feel like any given moment is enough ?"
1502,Does anyone know what's going on with me (TW: suicidal thoughts and mention of self inflicted wounds),[deleted]
1503,a place to vent and discuss,"I think we’re all dealing with a rough patch right now, I’m hoping for a place where people can talk about what’s on their mind and others can listen, respond and contribute. If this helps anyone it’s a success."
1504,I’m not sure what’s wrong with me please read this!!,"I’m a 15 year old male and I am always worrying about something. A little background about myself I have ADHD and Autism. But there’s something else going on too and I’m not sure what’s wrong! For example I have 2 rats that I love with all of my heart. I’m always worried that they will die or get sick or something. So I always have to say in my head “my rats will never get sick and they’ll live for 5+ years” and stuff like that and sometimes it takes me like a minute to say it all then I alwayssss have to say touch wood and touch my head. And I have to say it over and over again until it feels right. Same with many other things. I say touch wood even if I say a joke. Then I say “just kidding obviously” even though it’s really obviously a joke. Then I always have to say “touch wood” I always have this voice in my head telling me something bad will happen if I don’t. When I drink water I have to drink in sips of 4, I do anything I can to avoid the number 6. Even when walking down stairs and things like that. Stuff like that is always on my mind and it drives me mental. Also when there is like the smallest scuff on my phone it’s all I can think about and I feel like I just have to get it fixed in order to think straight again. I want my phone to be so perfect for some reason. Anyways about at least 40 ish times a day I have to say something in my head in order to feel like nothing bad is gonna happen then I have to say “touch wood” And I also have to pray before bed and ask for nothing bad to happen and stuff because I feel like if I don’t something bad will happen. I always ask for my rats to be looked after because I care about them so very much. Plus they are only 3 months old! Also when I press buttons on the bus I have to push them 4 times. Same with any other button. Anything in my life revolves around avoiding the number six and so many more worries. And like sometimes I talk to that voice in my head and it says “your rats are gonna get sick if you don’t say touch wood!” And things like that and it’s really really awful. Can someone please try and help figure out what this is? I’m probably the only one who’s got this problem because I sound so insane. So I’m sorry if you don’t understand. Help would be much appreciated💜😔"
1505,What mental disorder does my sister have?,"
My sister is 19. Still lives at home. She isn’t working right now because of quarantine. Her room looks like a literal garbage dump. She broke her bed frame so now she just has a mattress on the floor. There is literal garbage surrounded by her mattress. Plates/bowls with rotting food, rotten moldy cups, empty chip bags, empty cans/soda bottles, popsicle sticks, candy wrappers etc. her clothes are mixed in with it. She literally picks clothes off her floor and wears them for days on end. I believe she has no clean clothes. They all smell like onion BO. I never see her do her laundry. She ALWAYS stinks. Unbearable stinkiness. I share a bathroom with her and have to febreeze everytime she leaves the bathroom because it smells so bad. She does shower everyday but she throws back on her stinky gross clothes. I have mentioned this to her and how bad she stinks and she just laughs and thinks it’s funny. I don’t think she brushes her teeth either. It’s gross. She also has a boyfriend, how he can tolerate her stench, I have no idea. How she is not embarrassed to have him in that room, that you can’t even see the floor in, and how it smells so bad, I will never know. How he is still with her, I will never know. My parents have also mentioned to her about being stinky but they don’t enforce anything."
1506,Feel like a dick,Am an agoraphobe so I don't go outside or socialize like ever. Meaning this quarantine is easy as pie for me. But I hear my other friends talk about how its driving them nuts and I can't relate to them and feel like a jerk for it. Am I a dick or nah
1507,Lockdown and mental health,"As humans we are very “in mind” creatures. Always thinking, reckoning, calculating, anticipating, worrying, etc.
When thoughts in your own head become loud enough, we want to get away from them. They bring us trouble like stress, anxiety, depression to name a few. To relieve those thoughts, we usually partake in entertainment. Something to completely distract us from the thoughts and feelings within ourselves be it a movie. Games. A party with some friends. Social media. Snowboarding. Or whatever. 
With the lockdown, that avenue of distracting is cut off (mostly) leaving us alone with the undeniable unavoidable noise that keeps going on in our heads. Ignorance of how to stop those thoughts leads us to depression and in a lot of cases suicide. This very ignorance of how to operate our minds and isolation with it is what will continually bring suicide rates up and up. So what is the solution? 

It’s not medication. Medication also serves as a distraction from those thoughts instead of facing them head on. A solution must come from the understanding of one’s own mechanism and how it works. Because at the moment, a lot of us are creating stormy states of weather in ourselves when we have full capability to create sunshine.  
How does 1 take control over the state he/she is in? How does 1 come to understand how his/her own mind works?
The solution to anxiety, depression, stress, worry, all these emotions is to watch your mind. Watch all the thoughts that we at first believe are “my thoughts”. Don’t judge them, don’t wish they were something else, just watch them. We all know these thoughts/feelings. “I’m not good enough” “why’d I have to do this instead of that” “why’d he do that to me” and on and on.
From the most unidentified, neutral place, observe the activity that’s happening in your head. 
From this active observing, away from all distraction, in isolation, all depression and it’s symptoms have no choice but to fall away. 
Depression can only exist for someone that believes they are their mind and all it’s activity. 
When one becomes a watcher of the process instead of being the process itself, nothing can stick to you. Nothing can touch you. From this active observing (which you are already doing just unconsciously) one realizes his true freedom."
1508,A depressed young man struggling with mental illness is looking to chat with anyone,"You know, as a child, I could never cope well, and even to this day, I find myself struggling with behavior and things. Everyone expects you to do something with your life, but they are not you—they have no idea what you're going through. It's hard to be happy these days, and life is shit. Bad way to look at it like that, but its the truth. And then my old man is bitching about life when all he does is drink. He is an asshole who fucked with me for years now! Can't I have some god damn piece?"
1509,In hospital again,"-Trigger warning -

Yesterday I tried to end me, I’m being experimented on, I hear voices but they are sent to me I believe someone is testing some new psychological warfare. The voices are to loud I can’t escape so to end them I tried to end be but I failed and now they still have my mind and they are using it. The psychiatrist said it’s another psychosis because of my schizophrenia but I don’t believe in it . I think everyone at the hospital is in this and they give me medicine so they can steal my mind because they co trole me better. The restraint me yesterday because I broke a plastic knife and tried to attack the voices, I can’t remember much. They poison me , how is this legal . 
My depression is so bad I feel hopeless and alone and like no one understands me. 
I hope you are all having a good night 
Keep your mind safe"
