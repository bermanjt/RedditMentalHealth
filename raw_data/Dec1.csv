0,I hate when terms like depressed are used loosely.,"I have a family member who likes to say they’re depressed. Now, if someone is actually depressed, I don’t have anything against them saying this, really. However, the person I’m referring to has self-diagnosed. Things like this make me angry, because I’m aware of how much stigma surrounds mental health.

I’ve never been taken to see a doctor about what I feel, so I don’t say that I’m depressed or that I have anxiety. However, I almost constantly don’t want to exist. I feel worthless. I feel like a bother. I just get in the way. Like I don’t have a future. I stay up late to “delay” waking up the next day. I always manage to convince myself that everyone hates me. I had someone tell this person that I should see a therapist because they were pretty concerned about me at one point. In fact they’re one of my favorite people and were one of the first people I’ve thought cared. Anyway, when she told this family member that I should see a therapist, they didn’t do anything. They told me they would look. I kept asking if they were still looking and they always said yes, so I stopped asking and decided to just trust them. They didn’t do anything. I never got help. Instead, they gave me hope that I could get help, just to crush those hopes. 

I guess it makes me angry partly because I’m so desperate for help, and too scared to reach out to family because of that incident. I don’t know, I’m sorry I said all this, I’m just so incredibly frustrated."
1,A really bad therapist.,"I suffer from servere bipolar disorder. When I first went to centerstone Bloomington, Indiana. I was given an intern to talk to for about year. She was alright,but didn't know what she was doing.My mental health went downhill. I seriously was do psychotherapy in conference room where people constantly went in and out.Then I had the A.C.T team lead as a therapist. She was awful. I seen her for just seven months. She would no call no show. She did this five times. I was driving 60miles round trip. I lost my first job I held i down in 15 years due to this. I would have a series of panic attacks , wondering if she was going to show up. I would sleep in my vehicle because I had no money to get home. Once I said to her that since you no-call no showed you should give me gas money. She lectures me on ethics and tells me I should grab a gas jug and beg for fuel. They was making me come in every week. I was court ordered. Her excuses for no-call no showed was once an ankle sprain,which was a lie. One time she said she had chrones disease. In she said this to make me feel really bad. That was a lie.I believe one time she was meth? She had meth mosquito bites on face. Can't confirm that.Really can't. That therapist would laugh at my mental health symptoms would refer to me as the weirdo. She would over step her boundries. Once she talked the whole session on how mad she was that her exboy fond a new girl. This really confused me? Oce we talked about beer. I didn't know if she was trying to be my friend. I have suicidal ideations everyday. She was so bad I would call my mother so she could talk me out of suicide after every session. My mother wanted to talk to her. I ask if I could sign a release she says ,I don't talk to mothers.One day I was having a bad day. She calls the police on me after we had a verbal contract that the police would never be called. She drunkenly calls the police on me at 1130pm. She calls me to tell me this . I hang up on her. I knew my life would get difficult. I get kicked out the commune I lived in. I was shunned.I lost all my friends,they was like family for me. They really wanted to see the best of me. Six state troopers do a welfare check ,than proceed to totally mess up my house looking for drugs that weren't there. Luckily I wasn't home.That devastated me. I knew my life was destroyed. I had a nervous breakdown. I was literally walking around Bloomington crying,and yelling and screaming at nobody. I call this therapist to tell her what's going on. I'm literally 24 hrs from a complete breakdown. She laughs. And tells me how I scare people. I'm homeless now. I sit with her for another appointment. She lies to me about a govt program that didn't exist. She countinued to laugh at me. She litteraly told me that if I wasn't a weirdo I wouldn't be homeless. That was really humiliating. She quit the next day without a notice. She quit before she got fired. Another thing almost monthly I would asked her for a new provider. She would manipulate me and tell me that she cared. She could fix me. She fixed me alright. I now and still sleep in my vehicle. It's cold now. The director Greg may tells my probation that I'm no longer a client at centerstone in December 2019. I was going to appointments up untill the middle of February. I was due to get off probation in January of 2020.They was charging my Medicaid. I go to jail for two months. The alful thing about is when I had that bad therapist I continued to ask management at centerstone for change of a therapist when she skipped out on the first appointment. They did nothing. Centerstone and that therapist makes people homeless. My life is a nightmare thanks to centerstone and that therapist. There are now no solutions to any of my problems now. Yes centerstone you are correct, you do deliver care that changes lives."
2,I can’t focus (sort of),I can’t focus on anything for any reasonable amount of time. It’s not even like I don’t want to do schoolwork or anything. Even video games or talking with friends. I’ll go from being interested in something to being unable to think and having to go do something else.
3,Heart Anxiety?,"I frequently (probably constantly) feel an anxious feeling in my chest. It feels like a warm, burning anxious energy in or behind my heart. I feel like it could be suppressed emotions or just anxiety. I had once felt the anxious energy spread and fill my whole chest and I passed out (i was intoxicated and dehydrated though). Before I passed out, I just thought about my failures and felt so hopeless. Each thought led it to grow until my chest felt like it was on fire and I passed out. Also when I feel this burning anxiety feeling its only physical I dont actually feel nervous in the moment. Is this common for anxiety? Why do I feel this way?"
4,a toxic mother: my story,"hey guys, so i have been dealing with my toxic mom/stepdad for as long as i can remember. i finally got the courage to leave them and break the cycle of abuse. i wrote a poem/story about this kind of huge moment in my life, it felt appropriate to post here c:

—

i’m sick of being an animal in a cage that you poke at and torture for your own amusement. i’m sick of being your puppet that you use to entertain guests to benefit your image. i’m sick of pretending that being around you is fine, when really it is tearing me apart. i am sick, and i have been for years in your care. and finally, i have freed myself from the cage YOU put me in, i have broke lose from the strings YOU tied around my appendages, i have left YOU. i have finally found the antidote for the sickness that YOU gave me; that YOU watched infect my entire body, my mind, my body, my soul; and YOU dare call me selfish for bringing the antidote to my lips? for wanting to rid myself of the burden of humoring YOU, of pleasing YOU, of wanting YOU to love me?? i have battled with YOU for all of my life, and i have battled with myself, too. do not forget that part. for i have felt selfish for feeling resentment towards my captor, my puppet master. but i have finally realized something. YOU didn’t cause the sickness, YOU are the sickness. YOU are the disease that’s been killing me all these years. it was not me, like you claimed. if was not my mind, it was not my “selfishness”. YOU wanted me to feel selfish, so YOU could continue to feed off me. YOU are the parasite in my mind, my body, my soul. and of course YOU, the parasite, causing my sickness doesn’t want me to drink the antidote; because, what is a parasite without a host? it is nothing. YOU are nothing. and i no longer feel selfish for wanting to rid myself of you. 

...

so fuck off, will you?

thank you for reading if you did :) i hope everyone is doing okay during these trying times."
5,I feel like an imposter,"I just wonder why i went through what i went through and snap memories are not helping. Just remembering all the shit people said about me and just not good shit. However there wasent enough proof of what i went through that I can show only tell so it feels like it’s not valid. And i had my first flash back in a while but it wasent bad just made me fucking sad. Like i don’t even feel real kind of sad, i feel like a robot. Like i put effort to seem human but deep down i’m not."
6,Where to start getting mental help,I’ve been dealing with some sort of mental disorder for some years now and I’m ready to get help but I don’t know where to start. I tried to make an appointment with my primary care provider but they can’t see me for another 2 months. I’m not sure exactly what I need but I feel like talking to someone who can maybe diagnose me and put me in the right direction would be helpful. Where should I reach out to?
7,I'm tired of fake people,"Hello guys 

I fell all the time lonely and sad a lot no one of my friends Love me even my best friend was such a fake friend I did for him a lot and what I got from him he just bullied me and said I didn't do anything for him I don't know why even the people don't love me I'm so upset even I can't sleep cause of this I got no friends I got nothing just nothing"
8,The Last Nights,"These never-ending nights of solitude so recently introduced into my existence
 have given me too much time to reconsider my position
every night it changes every night some transition every night getting older and closer to perdition
 you left without a word aware of my condition
 abandoned again now a Man without a mission."
9,I’m very confused emotionally,"I’m scared that I’ve fallen for someone. I’ve never cared for people the way that I care about this person. I’ve been in relationships before, some good some bad, but I’ve never felt so safe and comfortable before. I’m scared I’ve caught feelings for someone that I can’t be with, at least not for a long time. What should I do? Has anyone had any experience with this?"
10,Wondering if anyone else has similar experiences?,"Ive noticed things like this happen quite a bit to me like tonight
I dropped one of my leopard geckos caves and freaked out she was actually completely fine not even stressed but i had to sit down for a minute or two before i continued feeding her since then ive felt really like tired almost? No motivation just sad i dont know why i just do i feel like i let these tiny situations affect the rest of my day and i dont know what to do?"
11,No idea what's wrong with me...,"This week has been one of the worst weeks of my life. I've been struggling to focus in all of my classes since midterms, but it came to a head during finals week. I already dropped 2 of my classes bc I knew I wouldn't have the attention span needed to get back on track in them, so you would think my other 2 classes I had left would be a breeze right?? Wrong. I can barely pay attention to my science lab lectures on a regular basis,  &amp; I just failed my English final bc I couldn't write the 6-page term paper. It's a pattern for me to lose all interest in school/life by midterms, but I told myself I would never let it get this bad again. I was diagnosed w/ situational depression last year after a suicide attempt, but the thing is I'm not sure if that diagnosis even encompasses all that's wrong w/ me?? The sad thing is I worked sm shifts at work to be able to afford this semester &amp; I'm wasting my own money☹"
12,Overthinking,"I hate having generalized anxiety disorder because my intrusive thoughts do not allow me to have any sense of peace. I’m in the field myself and have the ability to use the techniques at hand, but I still can’t seem to just turn off my thoughts. I end up having such a bad self-esteem if I do one thing wrong. I also have OCD. I obsess about money, about doing things wrong, and just always thinking that people think I’m weird. It sucks to constantly feel like crap because of my racing thoughts and as much as I sit back and try to be the “viewer” of my thoughts, it’s mainly the worst when I’m alone. I have some pretty good hobbies, but I’m also not the best at following through what I plan for myself."
13,Help !,Need help on how i should react when people say ‘ew’ or someone judges me on my appearance or gives me an odd look. Growing up I was always told I’ve been attractive and  good looking but the last 1-2 years have stressed me out. I’m a 20 year old male and I’ve never dealt with something like this before so when I hear people say these things it kind of hurts. Now I know what it’s like to kind of be bullied. Obviously no re action is the best thing to do but it has messed with my self confidence and how I think about myself.
14,What does depression recovery feel like?,"Over the past year and a half, I have been in treatment for depression with DBT and Lexapro. While I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal like I used to be, I am not super excited about life. I really feel like I could take it or leave it. Do other people get to a point where they can say they are happy?"
15,Mood swings,"I don’t understand myself. Earlier I was in a much better mood than I usually am, I was actually excited thinking about my future which never happens. But then something so super small happened and I feel like my whole world is falling apart. All those good things about my future and life that I was thinking earlier was completely flipped and now all I want to do is die"
16,I want to be dead but don’t have the legitimate desire to kill my self?,"My job sucks I’m trying to get a new one and it feels like it’s never gonna happen

Nothing is making me feel anything 

Me and my girlfriends sex life sucks 

I feel so disconnected and like I’m never going to come back. I went through similar feelings for a few years but made it through and told my self I wouldn’t make it if this happened again.

I want to be loved. I want to be desired. I want money (just enough to not worry). I want to be touched. I want to feel."
17,i dunno how to get outta this “mood”,"i got that seasonal depression. idek... i know my mental health is shit rn like i recognise that. it’s shit because i don’t know if my plans will work out, if i’m smart/good enough to go to the places i wanna go to, meaning: will i like myself enough through exercising to the point that when i look at myself, i feel ‘peng’ ✨.
am i smart enough to graduate with the gpa i want and get the job i am satisfied with? will i be good enough to impress them?
i wanna leave my city/comfort zone but what big ass city do i go to?"
18,What happens if you call a suicide hotline?,I live in the UK and I've heard lots of story's about negative effects of calling a suicide hotline. I don't want the cops showing up at my door so I am anxious and thought best to ask here before calling
19,going in circles, so I though getting my license would make me happy so I did it I thought getting a car and a job would make me feel like I was doing something worth while so I got them both I thought having a girlfriend would make me feel complete but I met up with this girl and it was not what I expected what am I doing wrong its like I have everything I want but nothing I want at the same time I seek out what I think will make me happy and feel complete but I just keep getting lost in this empty feeling I've had for years
20,[Rant],"I always feel like something bad is gonna happen to me and it’s getting annoying! I feel like I’m gonna get kidnapped and things will happen.

I was literally using a snapchat filter that tells you which anime character you are and I got Kaneke from Tokyo Ghoul.

[Spoiler]
And guess what? At the end of season 1, Kaneke got kidnapped. I won’t go into detail about what happened when he got kidnapped, but what happened was the things I fear will happen to me.

And my brain took that very personally, I felt anxious when I saw the snap while scrolling through my camera roll.

There’s more things that I’m afraid of and more things that remind me of those thoughts, but I’m keeping this rant short.

Wtf is wrong with me and what can I do about it?"
21,I'm(15M) sabotaging my health while being fully aware of what I'm doing. I hate every second of it but I don't care enough to stop,"I struggle with extreme spcial anxiety and in my little time on this planet, I've failed to develop any social skills. I've been into complete shut in mode for almost a year now. I leave the house about once a month at best. I'm slowly losing contact with my few friends and my girlfriend (that I got by complete miracle) broke up with me a little before our 2 year anniversary, mainly because of all this. I'm a depressed piece of shit with no motivation to change anything. I can't even fall aslee anymore. A good night's sleep for me is 4+ hours. I sit in my chair all day long just playing video games and watching YouTube to pass the time. All my classes are online so I get literally 0 social interaction too. My eyes are tired from staring at a screen all day everyday, my back hurts like a 60 year old man from sitting all day, Ican barely stay awake most of the time and when it actually becomes time to go to bed, I can't sleep. I have only one truly close friend that I met online while playing overwatch a year ago that I'm scared I'll lose too. I'm somehow both underweight and look fat at the same time so that's another blow to my already low self esteem. My parents are desperately trying to help but I'm too scared to let them because I'm afraid of change. The worst part is, I know what I can do to fix it, start going out more, try talking to people again, ect. But I don't have the motivation to do anything that requires hard work, and I hate myself for it. I care just enough to bitch about it online, but not enough to actually get better. What the fuck do I do with myself?"
22,Just wanted to recommend a book that helped me immensely with realized my feelings are valid and I am not pathetic,"As the title says, I have a book I wanted to recommend. Its a common theme that people think their feelings are invalid, feeling like they have no reason to be depressed or anxious, feeling pathetic for not getting over it, feeling like other people have it worse so you should be okay, etc etc. I've recommended it in a couple comments on peoples posts, but sometimes it gets lost in all the other comments.

The book is called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. The book talks a lot about PTSD in regards to veterans and sexual assault, but even if those aren't topics you relate to, if you have been depressed or through any other traumatic event, especially in childhood, this book talks a lot about that. It even touches on things as ""simple"" as not feeling supported or loved as a child can have a huge impact on us.

It talks about how these things affect our brains, and even YEARS later, triggers can make the same feelings arise. Even though I've never been to war, and I've never been se ually assaulted, I was able to relate to a lot of the things the book mentioned and it helped me realize my feelings are valid. I no longer felt so pathetic for feeling depressed or anxious, even though in my current life things are going relatively well.

The book also mentions a type of EMDR, which I wont get into but I tried it with my therapist and that helped a lot as well. I'd recommend that for trauma survivors (of any kind) as well. But if you've yet to make the step towards therapy, at least give the book a shot!! 

TLDR; read The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk"
23,At what point does unproductiveness signify a mental illness?,"I (18F) know that a lack of motivation is common, but all of the sudden it has just hit me really hard. I physically can not force myself to do anything, even my schoolwork, which is weird because I was a pretty studious person before but as of late I feel as if I literally can not do anything productive. I can't sleep well because I'm worried about how I'm not studying as much as I should, but I literally wake up and can not do anything. I'm scared because I was never like this before. I've had my bursts of laziness but I've been feeling this way for like the past three weeks. I just feel so down and worried and anxious, but I know if it's just a normal thing people go through that I'm just blowing out of proportion or if there's something genuinely wrong with me. Any advice?"

25,I need genuine help about this relationship,"So I’ve had this online friend for a few years, and within the last year we both kinda really like each other... a lot... so I told my mom about this, how we met online and how she’s a bit older than me (18 and 21 yrs old) and she got a bit concerned but shrugged it off. She only lives a state over too. And after talking to my counselor, she thinks it’s smart for the two of us to finally meet. My mom was very hesitant about this, because this friend I met has some struggling issues similar to mine (anxiety, bad depression, and is also diagnosed with aspergers), and my mother thinks that she’s too unstable for me and that her sadness will rub off on me.

Well tonight I had a bit of a breakdown because of some other issues, and my mom and I talked a lot. And she gave into me and my friend meeting! I thought that it was nice that my mom was giving my friend some sort of chance. But she’s been constantly asking questions like “you can’t deal with a long distance relationship!” And “you need to date someone else before.” And other comments about how she thinks we’re both jumping the gun a bit.

Is this relationship I’m in safe? My friend never manipulates me, and makes sure that the two of us are very comfortable with where we are and we make sure that we are verbal about things. We both make sure to prioritize ourselves. Though we had a bad bout of emotions a few months ago where we both constantly made each other anxious based on our mental states. 

I just want to hear other thoughts. I’ve heard from friends that while my mom is being over protective, that I’m ready for this and that her impression will change since my mom met my friend in a bad light by total accident."
26,... :(,I was having a panic attack and I told my mom I didn’t feel well and she said to me she didn’t care because I always feel like that... :(
27,"Why am I angry, how do I stop it","I didn’t know where to post this so I apologise if it’s not appropriate. I feel horrible saying this but I want to understand myself better. My housemate was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a number of years ago before I met them. They tend to talk about it a lot and don’t like telling me how they’re feeling. They often hide away in their room a lot and don’t have very healthy habits. I see that they share posts about anxiety on places like Instagram. I care about them but for some reason I have feelings of anger toward them in regards to how they talk about their problems. Especially when I see what they post on social media. I’m not really sure why and I feel terrible for it. To the point where it affects me quite a lot. I feel like sometimes they’re monopolising being sad if that makes any sense. They are often quite dramatic about things. And I always have a paranoia that they don’t actually have problems and that they’re making it up. Which I know isn’t true. I feel like I am being incredibly immature and I recognise that these feelings are wrong and yet I can’t get rid of them. I just have a very strong reaction whenever I see their mental health posts online. I have a lot of friends who struggle with their mental health who talk about it. But I don’t have the same reaction with them. I have not told my housemate how I feel. For extra background, my mum has quite serious mental health problems and it’s really difficult. She needs a lot of assistance and it had really affected my life. I want to be helpful to my house mate because I care about them. But also when they talk about their problems it can privately cause me to have a massive mood swings and I just don’t know how to stop it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me."
28,Alzheimer’s and No Masks,"My dad has advanced Alzheimer’s and is cared for at home by his much younger wife and a few part timers she hired. None of them wear masks. One of the caregivers has two school aged children and also drives for Lyft. Dad’s wife will soon be going out of state to visit her family with no regard to the potential risks to my dad when she gets home. 

I tried to tactfully ask if she’s comfortable going with all the travel advisories and she basically said she’s going no matter what. This whole situation is so upsetting and I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m terrified that my dad will get Covid because he’s fragile and I do not believe he would survive it. 

Why am I the only one who sees a problem here? Am I being paranoid or unreasonable? I have nobody to turn to for support. What can I do to accept this since I have no control? Am I crazy for worrying?"
29,What's going on with me?,"I used to daydream a lot in 2019, it happened when studying or eating, I would just stare at a wall with my eyes wide open and say nothing for like half an hour. It suddenly stopped in January of this year but now it's returning and it's worse. For some reason my dream feels like a conversation with someone: I talk and he responds, I sometimes blame him for things in my life and he accuses me of being lazy or just doesn't answer when I insult him. Idk if I am going crazy but I try no to, when I realize I'm talking to myself I instinctively slap my face or say ""shhhh"", only then will it stops. Do I have something or am I overreacting?"
30,U ever feel sad for no reason?,"Lay in bed, in the dark, talk to no one type of sad. And like super sensitive to everything and everyone. I love my brain 🙃"
31,Have I finally achieved mental health as strong as a brick or is there something wrong with me,"I had a lot of successive exams and goodbyes to different people. I also have high-stakes calls coming up. 

... I feel fine ... I'm weirdly centered and balanced through and my brain body mind soul is doing fine. I am constantly sexually cued in though. Also it is the time of month the peak ravage of PMS should be kicking in. But I am ... A-ok? Or did I succumb to nihilism without being aware? Or am I detached from reality? I just think life is nice all the time. I mean, my life is? All checks out"
32,Really struggling with medications and overall mental health and really could use some advice or tips,"I apologize for how long this is, I just don’t want to leave anything out. Also, if there’s a more fitting sub to post this to, please let me know. Anyway... I’ve been having persistent issues for months and I can’t pinpoint exactly whats causing it and how to fix it. Ive lost 30 pounds, I have to take zofran daily to help with my nausea, I can eat 1 meal a day if I’m lucky. My anxiety has also been more prevalent than ever before. I have emetophobia(fear of vomit), so the nausea has been making my anxiety escalate. I was using marijuana for my anxiety for the longest time, but now I can’t smoke because it makes me feel anxious, nauseated, and overall just off. The beginning of these symptoms started back in the early summer. I was on Zoloft and propranolol, but I had to get off of them because I lost my insurance for a bit. Once I got my insurance back(a couple months later),I refilled my scripts. Like an idiot, I got back on Zoloft at my same dosage(100mg) instead of slowly working my way back up. I had a seizure like episode and felt awful. I got off of it immediately and slowly started to feel better. I told my doctor, and she put me on Prozac and Buspar. I didn’t realize both of those increase serotonin (which I think I’m hyper sensitive to now) and I had another episode, only worse this time. My jaw locked up, my eyes were moving on their own, it felt like hot water was being dumped on my head, I couldn’t physically speak, etc. I got off of those as well. About a week after this episode, I had a really bad fight with my brother(it got physical). I feel that was my breaking point. After the fight, I was hospitalized because I couldn’t eat for a week. They told me it was anxiety, set me up with a psychiatrist, and sent me on my way. My psychiatrist prescribed me seroquel because it doesn’t increase serotonin. I’ve also been prescribed hydroxizine and clonidine, but neither really helped and make me feel weird. I’ve been on seroquel since September, but I’ve felt weird since. I was just barely prescribed Wellbutrin, but I’m going to stop because it makes me feel like I’m on cocaine or something. I’m having persistent nausea, food does not interest me anymore, I keep losing weight, which is odd because most everyone gains it on seroquel. I also keep getting these weird sensations. Sometimes I eat a decent amount, but feel like my stomach is eating itself, like I’m still hungry, but I’m definitely not. I also have days where I feel hungry, but the thought of food makes me really queasy. I’ve reached out to my psychiatrist about stopping all my medications all together and waiting to hear back. I just keep getting prescribed new things and nothing is helping. I kind of want to let my brain heal naturally for a bit, but I’m also worried that it’ll get worse. I’m at a loss and feel so helpless. It feels like there’s something going on, but everything gets dismissed as anxiety. I just want to feel normal again, but don’t know how. Has anyone had any similar issues before? Has getting off of medications helped you? Any advice or insight would be much appreciated. Sorry again for the long rant."
33,(Canada) Question about involuntary commitment and answering yes to suicidal thoughts.,I have a question about the Mental Health Act (Ontario if that matters). My question is hypothetical and is not related to me in any way. I've read stories from people that were caught after a failed attempt to end their lives and were questioned at the psychiatry ward including whether they have suicidal thoughts. Does answering yes to this question ensure that you remain in the ward under the discretion of the psychiatrist? Does it also ensure that you are medicated against your consent?
34,I hate myself,"I'm on mobile, so forgive my poor formatting. 

This has been on my mind all night. I hate myself as a human being and as an individual. I just want everything to go away. I feel so stressed and tired, and no matter what I do, it's not getting better. 

I'm only writing this because I can't fall asleep. I can't stop trying. 

I'm a highschool student, and I just can't see myself out of high school. I fear the end might be coming for me soon. Please tell me ig anybody else thinks this way about themselves. I really just want to know if I'm alone or not."
35,"Could it be a trauma bond if a guy [35M] goes back to an ex [33F] when He was disgusted by her, and stopped having sex w/or kissing her? He also said he...","*Wasnt in love with her

*Wanted to punish her for the things she’s done

*Kicked her out of their apt and informed the landlord of the situation to get her off the lease

*Said she “stole” his fb friends and acted like they were his

*Thought she was a narcissist, learned all about the condition and narcissistic abuse. He even blogged about it and his difficulty recovering from it. 

*Vented about her daily 

*Experienced high stress, elevated blood pressure when she contacted him

I think he may have bpd for several reasons: emotional volatility, unstable relationships, intense fear of loneliness/being alone, sensitivity to feeling rejected 


He said She:

*Was a liar

*May’ve killed one of her patients and fraudulently claimed the death benefits (he showed me the obit and said he reported her to the dept of veterans affairs and the state bureau of investigation 

*May’ve been involved in the deaths of 2 others

*May’ve tried to poison him and her own children 

*Was a drug addict

*Didn’t shower or wipe well so she smelled like literal sht

*Was manipulative, possibly a narcissist and “fucked up”

*Abused him emotionally to the point he stress ate, drank and “lost” himself

...but they got back together

TLDR: What could make a guy go back to an ex after he says she manipulated and emotionally abused him, potentially killed multiple people, and tried to poison him? Is that like an addiction?"
36,I NEED some help,"I really need someone to just talk to about life and that can keep it private, lately I have been thinking about suicide. I just need help and no goddamn upvotes"
37,Increased anxiety and possible hallucinations since discovering something about myself (possible DID),"So basically a few months ago I learned something about myself that kind of bothered me, and decided to explore it online, discussing my experiences with people on the other side of the world, rather than going to a therapist. I believed that by doing this I would be able to delete all traces of that info if I felt like it, rather than having some psych report or whatever linking the experiences with my name and stuff. Dodgy logic but there you go.

I was in denial about the revelation at first, but as that faded away, I've been hearing (or maybe mishearing) people say derogatory terms related to my ""discovery"" when I'm out walking and stuff.

I want to point out that I'm not delusional (at least I don't think I am) and I don't hear voices at home for example. It's only when I'm around other people.

Like I said before, I explored this stuff online so I wouldn't have a personal connection to it. But now I feel like people in my town know what I'm going through and are taking the piss out of it and treating me like a lesser creature.

I don't really know what else to put here right now. I'm finding it hard to concentrate. If you have any questions, just leave a comment and I'll reply to all of them (within reason, of course)."
38,"Going Downhill, please god help","Hi. I'm a 19 year old female who aged out of the foster system when I was 18. My foster family did all sorts of things to me and my siblings (beating us with coat hangers, telling us we should be grateful we weren't in a group home getting ""raped every day"", throwing pots and pans at our heads) but, honestly, it didn't really start truly bothering me until I moved out. It seems like the closer I get to those things I wanted so desperately as a kid (like going to a nice college, having friends, and eating properly) the worse I feel. Getting out of the state and taking charge of my own life was supposed to be the happiest moment of my life, so why am I having trouble finding the motivation to eat or sleep or go to class? 

And since the pandemic forced my college to send us back home, I've just been bouncing around from house to house, barely able to muster the effort required to breathe. I feel like it's the foster system all over again and I don't know what to do. I was coping better with all this shit when I was actually IN the foster home. God. I waver between fury and apathy and it's getting fucking exhausting. It's finals week and if my GPA dips I'll lose my scholarship and then where will I go?

Sometimes when I'm at the top of the stairs, I look down and falling would be effortless. I'd never do it. I'm just so tired. 

Sorry for the long post."
39,I might need to start going to therapy again,"I've been trying to write an essay tonight. I've been trying to work on it for 3 hours. One of those hours was efficient. The second hour I struggled through articles trying to research and not comprehending what I'm reading, and then staring at my google doc. The last hour was a mix of sobbing and staring into space without the google doc even open anymore. 

I have depression, adhd, and social anxiety. I take medication, but I'm currently not seeing a therapist. I went to a therapist for 2 years, and she did little to nothing for me, so I stopped seeing her. I thought I'd finally gotten stable enough to not need one anymore. But I'm starting to think that I do. 

I procrastinate everything because nothing feels real. The passing of time is either really slow, or alarmingly fast. I'm a senior in high school, and this is the first time I've ever struggled with grades, despite having gone untreated for 4 years prior to the last 2 that I started treatment. 

I have high expectations for myself. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to things like these, mainly because I don't want to let down my teachers and have them judge me or confront me about my poor quality work.  Just every day, by the time I get home, I feel like I have no energy. My brain has done all of the thinking it can do, and now it's done. 

I seem to never have the ability to care about a project until the day before or even the day of. For a while during school last year, I prioritized my mental health over school work because of how miserable I was. I would come home every single day and cry. But as I started prioritizing myself over my grades, I now don't remember how to prioritize my grades at all. If I think about my responsibility even for a little while, I feel completely overwhelmed, so I've trained myself to suppress it so much that I almost forget about it. 

And I'm not depressed all the time at home anymore. I have low energy, but I've been able to make myself happy, or at the very least, not miserable. I haven't been able to do that for years. I guess now I just want to be happy instead of stress over a project, so I push the project away, in turn making my stress more intense in the future. 

I now have to turn in my essay that isn't even half way done now, and hope that I don't get pulled aside to talk about it at school tomorrow. I'm gonna have to accept that, once again, the best work that I could do wasn't even close to being good enough to pass. And I'm gonna have to start trying to get my mom to find a therapist. I just hope I can function a little bit better than this in the meantime."
40,I don’t know when to stand up for myself,"I have a few coworkers that are class A bitches. Real terrible people. They make complaints about me (apparently it’s any new comer) not doing my job right. Never offers me extra training just complains to the supervisor. My team leader is a pice of work. He can be happy go lucky to a complete asshole in under a second. One of my coworkers made a complaint to him and he went over to me extremely mad (and I mean mad) about something so minor that I didn’t even do.

I’ve been passive and always said okay I’ll do the job better but now I want to call them out but I don’t know when to do that. I’ve never had a backbone so it’s difficult to find a way to start standing up for myself.

How do I go about this? I don’t want to end up being an asshole like them. I want to be strong and tough. But I want to do it right and not turn into them."
41,Stressed about work so badly I ended up early..,"This morning I laid in bed worrying about work. Work has been so awful lately and most mornings are so stressful because of it. I've been shakey and forgetful. Well, this morning I was so stressed laying there thinking about work that when I checked the time at one point I told myself it was time to get up, get ready and leave. Turns out I was so lost in my head that I mixed up the time and thought it was later than it was. I ended up getting to work an hour early. I was so mad at myself because I didn't get to spend the hour with my boyfriend.

Has anyone else ever done something like this?"
42,Am I Agoraphobic?,"Since I was 6 I've had panic attacks in public (grocery stores, churches, sitting in a car in a parking lot, ect..) my first experience was when I was 6 and passed out after the panic attack woke up in the truck

My mother doesn't believe in mental illnesses so I've never been allowed therapy or counseling

Now I'm 18 and have struggled with anxiety only ever in public or in situations because I overthink so much when I was little I remember I was super neat because I was always afraid of someone stepping on a lego or ball and tripping and dying by hitting their head to hard or something

But I went to new york city completely unmedicated and was fine we was walking around everywhere 1000's of people everywhere and I was completely ok honestly I felt free and happy but then I came back home and everything picked up to be like usual don't like going places or to see people I prefer my room overall 

I think it's because I know that compared to new york and all its people, buildings, and lights I'm completely invisible no one knows me there and no one will remember me I know that everyone I pass is to busy with other things"

45,I Have Self-Image Dysmorphia,"I've been struggling with a unique condition for many years and I feel like not a lot of people can relate. Hell, there isn't even a term for the condition, but I thought self-image dysmorphia would be the best way to describe it. It's a lot like body dysmorphia, except that instead of my body, it's my sense of self that gets intensely warped at times. I know the trauma that caused this feeling and I feel lonely cuz it seems like no one understands what it's like. When the feeling is triggered, I see myself as a mentally/socially inept loner loser/outcast that nobody wants to be around. In reality, I have many friends, a vivid social/sex life, and I have no issues interacting with others. Sometimes certain things trigger me and immediately snaps me out of reality where that terrible fake sense of self consumes me. That description is nowhere near the person I am, but it's so intense that it causes full-on mental breakdowns when it happens. I am seeing a therapist and I am slowly getting better but it's just so so hard to live with this. Any word of advice or encouragement would be appreciated"
46,I have nothing.,"Well, yet another resource I reached out to in an incredibly vulnerable and hard way ignored me. r/dentistry doesnt care that I have such severe dental issues I cant eat, sleep or care for my teeth and I cant find  a dentist or periodontist or doctor who will take me seriously. I spent 700 trying to fix it so far, anything I could think of. I am going to have to spend my entire stimulus on it, and gone is the money from the settlement when I was going to use that money to move to my dream area, my dream of ten years, I was going to visit in ajuly and covid made that impossible. I ended up having too much debt. I am going to have more debt. I was like, alright, you can't move yet again. 10 yrs and you can't move or even visit because you're poor. SO can I work? It's going to have to wait. My body is rejecting computer posture and today is the last day I use the internet for two months minus unavoidable things so I can stop my addiction, work on my posture, and figure out how to be ergonomcal. I am looking at needing surgeries. I bought a $300 computer chair and should buy a new computer today but I rushed into that last purchase only to find a better deal and im so conflicted. i need a new computer to work, mine is noncompatible with software bc it is a 2011 imac. i have no idea what to buy, im being priced at $400 for a shitty computer, im worried there will be no sales at christmas time but its like buying a year's supply to liqur when you're quitting drinking ...right?

So scratch that, righjt? Right? I should get a cat. Wait, no, the cat im in love with requires at least biannual labs, a special medication twice a day and i cant afford jack shit. And guess what. Without a cat I suffer. When I am witha  cat I feel so good. But when im not, all i can do is try not to die because of the dental and posture issues and IT KILLS ME THAT I MISSPENT THAT MONEY 

why couldnt i convince the dentist and periodontist for  a new nightguard? why couldnt i convince to have them out? why wont r/dentistry respond when I want to die from this. NEVER EVER EVER have I felt so much constant pain and this is ME TRYING. I AM TRYING. I cant do this. Do you want to know why I didnt kill myself this weekend? I was afraid I would go to hell and never see anyone I love again. I was also frightened of what happens to the body after death, or whether it would hurt to overdose. And nobody understands and I cant go to a mental hospital because I wont get to save my teeth or gums or whatever. I really wish I could get that cat. They are holding him for me. But tomorrow I find out if I should have these surgeries and these are big big surgeries but this cat... this cat.I searched hundreds of pictures of ads for a look in a cats eyes that reminded me of my deceased cat and this beautiful boy was found starving to death, literally, after a stroke, in a construction site but he survived that to only need liver medication and labs and he loves pets and I want to meet him but its  not ethical, is it? I cant afford him. I don't know if I can convince anyone to let me foster because of my disabvility. I don't know if I want this cat because my own died of a stroke or because I really fell in love with him. But..the surgeries. Those goddamn surgeries.

So .. no. I have no hope. I ruined my life. And if I could have saved the money for moving, or a new computer to work,  but god knows if my posture is ruined from computer use I should wait to try working ----god, what do I do. Please. Do I get the cat, do I get a computer, do I walk away from my housing voucher, move to my dream state with nothing and no one because at least i wont be suicidal---what? If I tell the psychs, they WONT UNDERSTAND.

I wish r/dentistry would give me hope. I wish somebody would. nothing has ever been so bad, ever."

51,Why can’t I talk about my problems?,"I don’t know what it is or how it happened but I’ve realized I’ve been shutting people out of my life to the point where I feel like I can’t turn to anyone for help. I can’t cry anymore and I find it difficult to have genuine lasting emotions. I find it impossible to talk about my problems with people because I myself don’t even know what exactly the issue is. There are so many things I want to talk about but I just can’t. I’m always supportive of others and care for them deeply but I’m never on the receiving end. I’m only 18 and I don’t want to waste anymore of my life isolated. I’m failing 3/4 of my classes in my first year of college and it’s just so hard for me to find motivation to do anything. I have so many regrets in life I want to fix. Sometimes I wish I could just start a new life because I’m tired of this one. I don’t feel like I’m living, I’m just alive. Don’t worry, I wouldn’t do anything rash, I would never wish to hurt those who care about me. I just wish I could’ve had a better life."
52,My mental health is deteriorating really fast.,"I just dont know what to do anymore. I just have a hard time opening up to people I feel like they'll judge me or say I'm faking it. And I feel like I'm faking a lot of things in my life. My anxiety, emoshonal problems tallents. I just can get so sad easly one comment can make my mood switch and I'll start berating myself over something small. Like today I was getting frustrated over something and my mom was helping me, and because I was frustrated I raised my voice i wasn't yelling just made my voice slightly louder and she told me my temper was getting out of hand and I know it was, but I just got so upset and started crying and telling myself she deserved a better daughter and I was a failure. I cant get motivation I'm having trouble with hobbys and school and its getting harder to get out of bed."
53,Help with an personal mental issue,"I'm sorry for the very noninformative title, but i don't exactly know what to call this. I've looked online, talked to people i know, like friends, but they can't exactly relate. I just want to know what this may be? For years now, I've personified anything that has eyes. The funko pops i collect, book/disc/CD covers, shirts, posters, charachers in tv/movies/video games, paintings, drawings (both traditional and digital); you name it, and I'll get incredibly paranoid around them. This only applies to things i haven't created, all of the drawings and clay figures I've made have no thought or feeling. Everything else freaks me out, i feel like they communicate between each other, judge me, talk about me, it'll get to the point where i try to act as how i think would please them, act 'cooler', 'smarter', depending on the character and their personalities. I can't hear them or anything, but i just can't fathom that they're just inanimate. I tried talking to my therapist and she said its just from my low self image and anxiety. I tried telling my parents and they thought it was silly. Its gotten to a point where I'm putting tape over the eyes i can cover, turning book spines around. I try to avoid all eye contact and i guess it works a little but im still incredibly paranoid and anxious around things with eyes. I know it sounds silly, but if anyone could help me out or experiences the same thing, i'd love to hear anything about it. I just wanna know how to cope and live with this, i want to be led in the right direction to figure out what this may be. Thank you :) sorry for the long read."
54,"I think I’m having a full blown mental breakdown. I want to call into work but I’d have to tell them why I can’t make it, and I don’t want anybody to know what I’m going through right now.","So, I work at an old folks home and if I call into work I have to give a valid reason. I would just make up some malady I’m suffering from, but then I’d be out until I get tested for COVID and it comes back negative, which I don’t really want. However, today I started to think about the “demons” that live inside me. I’ve always personified my mental illness as demons, but now I think it’s more than a personification. They are real and they are killing me. I know that if I just have a couple days to hang around my room I’d be okay, I could shove all that shit down and go back to pretending I’m a functioning adult. But, I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I woke up two days ago with the horrible thought that hell is real, but it only exists on earth and inside of us. The demons won’t let me be. I can’t focus, I can’t do anything but try to not get talked into killing myself by the evil, vile things that live inside me. I just don’t know what to do because I can’t call my boss and tell her about what’s happening. She thinks mental illness isn’t real, she’d think I’m crazy for all the demons that are poisoning me right now. She might call the cops or get ahold of my parent to have them do a wellness to check on me. I can’t have that. My parents will make it worse, the cops will make it worse. I just need to be alone for awhile. I just need to hide in my house and dedicate all of my energy to shutting the demons up. It’s not an easy fight,  but it’s one I’ve fought and won before. How can I take care of my residents if all I can focus on is the war being waged inside of me? How can I make sure that everyone is getting their right medication when I can barely even breathe? I need to call into work, but I can’t. I absolutely can’t. I can’t tell my boss or coworkers all this. I don’t want to go to a psych ward. Not only can I not afford the time off of work, they only make things worse, not better. I’m worried about not only my wellbeing, but also my residents. What if I completely snap in front of them? What if I try to kill myself or hurt myself at work. I know I won’t hurt myself if I’m home, but if I’m out in the wild, there’s just too much to navigate. The demons need me to focus on them and only them and once they’ve spent a day or two or three trying to kill me, they’ll leave me alone and lay dorment for awhile before this all starts again, as it always does. I’m just in a catch22. If I go to work, it’ll be made worse, if I call into work it’ll be made worse. I’m just not sure what to do."

I'm 16yo and I just need help I'm not sure what I'm going through, well sometimes when I feel really low, I'm on my bed having a chest ache like something physically in my chest, and sometimes I have a hard time breathing when that happens and I get shocks in my back and like I get twirled in my bed for a while and it hurts and some days i'm just happy and it's like rapid mood swings and is it weird that my first reaction to a triggering situation is laughter, I feel like I'm going insane, I just wanted to ask if the chest pain and all of it is normal or should I be worried."
56,Lack of Self Value,"My 30th birthday was Saturday. I have not done anything to celebrate in about 7 years. No party, no cake, no gifts, I don't even really bring it up unless it's prompted (gotta go get my license renewed, yay my I sursnce is going down, etc). I don't like imposing on other people and it's always been my reasoning that by doing any sort of celebration or any of all that would  only make the people around me feel an obligation to attend- that they would be inconveniened and have to go out of their way to meet this social obligation that I just selfishly handed to them.

So, again, in 7 years, no parties, no cakes, no gifts. I've always felt like this supported what I thought: that I am not important enough to anyone for them to do these things when they are not expected to do so. I've consoled myself in that, with the fact that these things don't matter. They're superficial.

Today, I have been talking with someone who is trying to make me a (late) birthday cake and I keep declining. A. Because I just met them today. And b. As the reasons above, I don't want to impose. I don't want someone else taking the time and wasting the effort just because it's late November. And as she has prodded and insisted and kept asking me why not it's really made me confront these feelings. The cake, the party, the time- i say they don't matter, because I feel like I don't matter. I feel so small, and insignificant, and like everyone one around me is simply dealing with my presence. Like I'm just riding along- no one really wants me there, but no one even feels strong enough to say anything about it. It's the feeling that if I just left tomorrow that, outside of Financial obligations, no one would even really take note. They. Ay think, down the line ""huh, I haven't seem him for awhile."" and then immediately forget about it right after. I feel so distant and isolated, and quite frankly I just had to express this all somewhere, and sort out my own head, but dear God I don't know what I'm doing here."

THANK YOU!"
58,How can I help my friend? (Please help),"Hi, (trigger warning)

Thank you for taking your time to read my message. I am greatly concerned about my friend. She is suicidal and has been dealing with depression for a while now. She has tried therapy but is extremely private (also very stubborn) and never opened up. I told her parents over a year about her mental state after a suicide attempt, but she lied to them and convinced them that I was misinformed. However, she has gotten much, much worse since then. She now is on anti-depressants and ADHD meds because her parents finally got concerned, but she isn't eating. She wasn't eating consistently before the meds, and now, to my understanding, she will only have one or fewer meals a day. She is getting scarily skinny but won't believe me that she has an eating disorder. The other day I told her that I was concerned because she's unhealthily losing weight, and she got excited and asked me if her cheekbones are now ""more defined."" She is now tired all the time, and it doesn't help that we are in an important and stressful school year. I don't know what to do and am beginning to snap. Here are some questions: (in your responses, please say your experience on this subject to give me background)

1. I know I am not a professional, but as a friend, how can I encourage her to eat? Would these methods be helpful or harmful:

\- Sending her pictures of my meals so she can gauge what a good amount of food to eat is and hopefully encourage her to eat

\- Reminding her to eat meals vs. asking if she's eaten yet

\- She has a premade lunch at school but never grabs it. Would picking it up for her be effective? How far can I pressure her to eat before it's detrimental?

\- Reminding her of the dangers of not eating

\- Should I tell her parents about my concerns with her eating habits?

\- Any suggestions you have?

2. How can I convince her she has an eating disorder, and she needs to start eating. I believe she has body dysmorphia. Every time I bring up the conversation, she says she's ""fine"" and ""has it under control.""

3. She texts me at least once a week saying she's going to commit suicide, but never does. I know that I should take every claim seriously, but this has been going on for over a year, and I am emotionally drained. From experience, I know that telling her parents isn't helpful. It's painful because she'll text me to ""say goodbye"" but won't listen to me saying not to do it, and to be honest, I don't know what to say anymore because I'm so desensitized to it. I need my sleep; is it okay to go to bed? Staying up doesn't do anything because she never actually says she won't do it but is always there in the morning anyway. What do I do? It is torturing me.

4. She's sometimes mean or rude to me. I don't normally take it personally because I know it happens when she's upset. She fears that people ""hate"" her or that she's ""annoying"" and often asks me if she was mean or annoying. I don't want to make the situation worse, but I also know saying nothing isn't a healthy friendship. What do I do?

5. Any other suggestions to help out? How do I support her as a friend while still maintaining my mental health?

Please please respond. I have no idea what I'm doing, and she really needs help. It often feels like I'm the only one stopping her from committing suicide. I don't know what to do. In your response, please say your experience on this subject to give me background. If anyone has a success story with a lesson, that would be helpful.

Quick version: My friend had depression and an eating disorder. How do I help her? How do I convince her that not eating is not okay?"
59,"Feeling like I'm always failing, no matter how hard I try","So, I was recently diagnosed with a personality disorder. It causes me to spiral and depression is pretty much inevitable for me. 

Regardless, I'm 29 years old. I graduated college with an overall 2.4 GPA three years ago. It took me seven years to get a bachelor's. 

I don't even use my degree. I have had to hop around jobs since graduating. I was given a job offer before I graduated in my one of my fields (I double majored) and was quit after 2 months to move across the country for someone I love. 

In three years I've had 3 salary jobs, 3 hourly jobs, and have worked 4 side hustles. In only fucking 3 years.... 

I just noticed the Zoom stock. When I looked at it in March of 2020 it was an affordable $150, now it's worth close to $450. I feel like no matter what I fucking do to start getting ahead in life, I'm cut short. 

I don't want to work around the clock. I want to live, but this world doesn't allow me to be successful unless I work non fucking stop. I can't do it anymore. If I'm a failure, then so fucking it be it world. All the fuckers that judge me from high school, and assume I'm worthless I'd fucking love for them to try to last 2 seconds in my life. 2 God damn seconds.

60,Possibly Losing my Sanity,"So I’m not quite sure why I’m here and there’s probably about a thousand of these per day, but I need to get this off my chest. I promise to make it as coherent as possible.

I’m usually a no-Fs-given kind of person, but (as with many people I have no doubt) this year has certainly taken a toll on what was possibly my already dwindling mental status. However, Seeing how everyone in the world is at each other’s throats over the pettiest things, People around me losing their jobs, the pressure to move out of my house, (I am 23M still living with my parents) and the general stress of life. However, here is where we get to my gnawing problem; for a quite few years now, (and please do not click away when you see this) I have been under the impression that there is an alien’s spirit linked with my soul, and that his consciousness lays dormant in mine, he speaks to me almost daily, often going silent at times when I actually argue with him, he has told me the history his people, that he has wondered the world through out recorded history. At first I thought this was just my young writer’s mind having an overactive imagination, but 8 years later, it is sometimes the only voice I have to go to. I swear I’m not on drugs of any kind, but I just don’t know what to think anymore.

This has strained me and my spouse’s relationship. She is not aware of the “alien” but she tries to help me as best she can with what she does know about. Neither her nor especially I know what is truly going on in my head. I just feel like I needed to get it out there somewhere and I don’t even care if this gets passed up, as long as it’s out of my head.

All I know for certain is that I’m tired. 
Just so. Damn. Tired.

Also, I apologize for formatting."

62,Counseling fully booked until mid January,"Hey everyone,

I regularly go to therapy, every other week (I would go every week but can’t afford it because I have an extremely high deductible so my sessions are pretty much out of pocket).

Today I called to make my next appointment and they said my therapist doesn’t have any openings until the second week of January. How does this even happen? I understand other people need support, but I am a regular client of theirs, and it sucks.

They had openings with other therapists sooner than that, but it takes me a long time to trust and open up to a therapist, not to mention she knows a lot of things about me that I’d have to re-explain to a new therapist, and so I don’t think it’s worth it to switch to a new therapist for a session or two. 

I have depression, anxiety, and intermittent explosive disorder. I am not on medication for it, but I am no longer suicidal so I think it will be ok until January, but it still is frustrating. 

Has anyone else had this happen? Thoughts? Tips? Advice? Pictures of cute cats? Anything helps!

TL;DR: My therapist doesn’t have openings for over a month and it’s not worth it to switch therapists and I’m frustrated about it."
63,Writing made mental things stop? TW- Self harm,"So, a week or two ago I was in what I would consider my worst mental state, sad all week, and self-harmed a bit. But something I had realized at the time was something weird about my thoughts.  
I could imagine other versions of me.

Now I've been talking to people about it, and quite a few seem to have what I have defined as ""The Thinking Self,"" another you that kinda is there when you're thinking, and I had this, but I also had two that would argue, not over anything, just argue. I want to say this was at least partially conscious thought, like manifesting my mind into my imaginary space, which I could overlay on the real world.

But the day I did my worst SH there was a new thing. It was another ""me"" but it was dark and malformed almost, and I had imagined it that morning, and it kinda scared me, but was dismissed as I went back to my wallowing. But that night I was obviously not doing well, and my ""Thought Self"" was there, but they were tired, but the Thing was there too, like screaming into my ear, it was overwhelming.

I decided to log it for future me, wrote it down. And since then, I had mentioned these mental manifestations quite a bit, and asked people about them, without the context of my doing SH ofc.

But since ever writing and sharing, it's all kind of stopped. I can imagine the entities from my imagination, but not even the Thought self does anything. It's really been fucking with me, as the thought self and the arguing two were there at points throughout my life, ya know when I thought things.

I can imagine the same sensations that I would feel, I can think about the two arguing, I just can't feel them, if that makes any sense. I was wondering if anyone had any idea, as I sure don't. 

Thanks."
64,I need edvice,"OK, so I'm 12 years old and I have these thoughts in my head I have had so since was about 6 or so. These thoughts are murderous thoughts about killing any one or anything. Some times I watch these dog YouTube channels and I just wish I could kill or hurt their dog so badly same with humans some times I have dreams about killing my mom or dad or just anyone. I go in to this NSFW discord server full of gore and people getting shot in the head and laughing at it I know it is not right but for some reason it brings me more joy than anything.                  Q:where you abused as a kid. A: yes from when I was a newborn till I was 10 to the point where I was scared to come home."
65,Is there such a thing as anorexia for height?,"I'm 5'10, so slightly above average height, but whenever I see myself, or whenever I am in public, I feel like I'm 4'11.  It's terrifying, as I used to get bullied for being short.  Is this an actual issue, or am I just crazy?"
66,How do you stay positive?,"When I was 18, 4 of my friends died in a car accident. I was close with a few of them and I feel like this was a terrible time to lose a friend, let alone 4. It was right before I graduated high school. 

A few years later I was almost 20. One of my best friends drowned in a lake. This absolutely tore me apart, I think about it everyday. 

At 21 I a friend of mine took her life. 

I never really learned how to properly deal with my the loss of my friends. 

My current partner of 3 years has bad health problems and was told there’s basically a 50% chance of her living out of her twenties. 

I’m struggling so hard to stay positive and this year has taken a toll on me. I miss my friends. Winters are usually really hard on me... what helps you stay positive on a day to day basis? How do you deal with losing friends? Does anyone recommend any books that might help me?"
67,Going around in circles,"Anyone feel like they go to the hospital to prevent from harming themselves but get out to go back to the same point again? 

On the plus my school forcibly put me on medical leave so that I can ""get my mental health better"" but I'll lose my insurance through school and can't afford therapy, psychiatrist and hospital so welp screw me right?"
68,IDK why but can't go to anyone else,"Sometimes I really don't want to be alive. More often than not I live so my kids and fur babies have their mother. But I'm so alone and lonely in this world. 
I'll never be worthy enough for someone to IDK fucking love me and want to spend a life together. I'll never going to have that. I was never meant to live this long. I've never belonged anywhere, and when I thought I did belong it was apparently not true. Can't turn a tulip into a rose they say, but really I'm the fucking weed that kills the garden. 

I deserve nothing in all honesty. But all I want is my home back right now. But I fucked that up bc well I'm a psycho bitch. Life shouldn't hurt so much. Sometimes this pain I have inside is way too much to take. I thought I was getting better but apparently I'm really good at even tricking myself. Life is a sick and twisted joke that I don't want any part in playing anymore."
69,Little things ruin my mood the most,"I am brought down by the little things. I play Rainbow Six Siege a lot and my friends will often joke around by saying ""You suck"" or ""Big boy whiff""

I know they're joking (at least I think they are) but it still brings me down so much. My one friend knows about how I'm very easily effected by this, but he doesn't say anything. I don't want to say anything because the other two people I play with are newer to me and I have very bad anxiety. What should I do about the small things bringing me down?"
70,I tried doing cognitive behavioral therapy on myself and I can't seem to find my core belief," 

So, what’s the problem?

I have low self esteem.

So what if you have it, what negative impacts does it have in your life?

It makes me depressed, anxious about the future and my relationships bad. I seem to seek approval and love from others. I get easily disappointed when my actions aren’t accepted with eager participation. I always seek the thumbs up and a smile whenever I say something. And during conversation with people, I want to be understood. I try to shift the conversation to make it more about me, about my feelings

Why do you think doing so is bad? Why do you think seeking affection from others is bad?

Because it is a sign of weakness and unattractiveness. People don’t like needy, self conscious, unconfident and overly sensitive people. I am afraid they will find out that I am unlovable, the type of person that they hate.

What would happen if they find out?

They would talk bad about me and see and treat me as someone worthless. They’d try to use me, if they found out I have low self confidence. They will hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what question to ask myself next. Is this the end?"

72,Concerned over Father's Mental Health,"Hi Everyone, Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. 

I'm hugely concerned over my 69-year-old father. His mental health has drastically dwindled over the past few months, and my family and I are not sure how to help. My brother and I do not live close, so it is just my mother caring for him. 

It started this summer when my father was thought to have Peyronie's disease. I'm not sure if that was the ultimate diagnosis, but it took a very long time for him to receive treatment to manage his pain as nothing seemed to be working. He could not sleep or sit down for months. He ran his own business and closed it down because he could not work. While his original pain had lessened, he developed pain in his feet and hands- which doctors were calling carpal tunnel and plantar fasciitis. 

A few weeks ago, he began to call ambulances almost daily - for loss of feeling in his hands, being constipated, and finally, for having suicidal thoughts. He was hospitalized for about a week and came home with a new medication that simultaneously treats nerve issues and depression. His doctors told me they believe the stress of everything is manifesting as physical pain. One doctor suggested I look into John Sarno. 

I went home to see him, and he had lost 30 pounds and was acting very abnormal. He is a very educated lawyer and has always been a typical 'dad joke' kind of guy. Now he was trailing off, unable to hold attention for extended periods. He sits in a dark room, staring at the ceiling most of the day. At the moment, he can use his hands to do some tasks, but most often can not. I don't want to deny his pain, but I feel like it's worth mentioning that when he can and can't use his hands appears to be sometimes arbitrary. At one point, he became fixated on winter coming and not being able to wear shoes if he needed to go outside in the snow. Nothing could help him feel better about this hypothetical situation. 

Today, my mom told me that he asked for a sharpie and wrote 'carpal' and 'tunnel' on each of his arms. This is extremely unlike him, and I don't know what to think. This act was very frightening to me. I know that he is starting to have zoom meetings with a therapist. Still, he's overall very pessimistic about what his future looks like in terms of recovery. 

I'm just at a loss for what I can do to help. I was hoping for any support words. Maybe this situation sounds familiar to you; perhaps you have a success story. 

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this."
73,Looking for Organization to donate to,"Hello everyone,

This month I decided to participate in no-shave-November. The end of the month is here and I want to make a donation to an organization that supports individuals struggling with their mental health. More specifically I want to donate somewhere that focuses on men’s mental health.

I have lost men in my life and currently have people in my life struggling with mental health issues. It’s important to me that I make this donation count.

Yes, I’m aware no-shave-November isn’t actually focused on this but is in-fact intended to make awareness about those inflicted with cancer. 

I used the no shaving action as a way to set aside money for donation. Waxing appointments and shaving supplies add up. And now I’d like to put it toward a worthy cause (I’m sure there are many). If you have suggestions please leave them here! Thank you everyone"
74,"Being untalented in a world surrounded by adept, talented, remarkable people is really tough","I'm a gay 27M who lives in Alberta, Canada. It really fucks me up to think about how there isn't one thing I've come to excel in or display as a talent. I have no special skills that are useful, creative, or otherwise interesting. I never grew to enjoy and specific hobbies or become proficient in anything, and I feel like I wasted my time. I feel like there's more I should have done by now. It's hard when I encounter people who are very talented at a lot of things, because I can't help but see the comparison. It really fucks my relationships up because it makes me feel like I'm not good enough. 

I know that the dialectic is that there are things I can do that other people can't, but really, I don't understand that. It doesn't make sense, because I cannot identify what these things are supposed to be. I know normally people are very proud of their achievements with education and work, but that just feels like work, like a minimum of competency or specialization that I still even have doubts about aptitude for.  It really sucks, and I'm not sure what kind of treatment would help. I just want to feel like a unique, well-rounded person."
75,Go to therapy!!!!!,"So as a background, my entire life has been on the rough side. Whether it was growing up in project housing and seeing all the stuff that occurred in that area, my emotions never mattered even to family ever since I was around 6 years old, being cheated on 6 out of the 7 relationships I’ve had, things I’ve done that haunted me til now, or I’ve lost 6 friends(2 murdered, 1 car crash and 3 to suicide) that I was close with in the past year and a half. I’m about to turn 22 years old in February. I got pushed into therapy by my friend who is like my sister to me, so I listened. I always thought it was fake. I have been to 4 therapy sessions with this therapist and finally opened up to them. Today I had cried for the first time in my life because of all the emotions that came out that I had always kept buried my whole life. It was a massive release of sadness, hurt, anger, relief, pain, etc. I have always been in control of my emotions when it comes to keeping them in check but I guess I always pushed it further than that where I buried them so deep I stopped feeling them and they started messing with my head, I’ve also been diagnosed which was a confusing feeling of relief and something else for me. I felt like I just really wanted to share this for anyone who might be considering a therapist. If they can help me, they can help anyone."
76,I don’t know who I am,"I think I’ve lied about who I am to everyone else around me that I don’t know who I am. I don’t know my personality, I don’t know what I really act like, it’s like I have a different personality for every person I’m around. I feel like a hollow shell of a person"

Even if I sleep my sleep is getting disturbed by dreams. My head getting messier each day because of this. Any advices??
78,Feeling lost,"Ever since the start of the pandemic, my mental health has been going up and down like a roller coaster. it really sucks, i’ve just been emotional and it’s so hard to describe it because i think there’s so many things and my mood suddenly just shifts. i feel like i care too much and to the point where it’s making me feel drained, like i give more than what i receive and no one really checks up on me. it then also involves overthinking and that doesn’t help either but i can’t help it, i have no one to talk to or vent to at all &amp; it sucks feeling lonely. i can’t even describe how i feels but hopefully someone gets it. i can’t even talk to my parents because they just won’t get it. there’s so many things like caring too much, hiding that i’m gay from my family, the pandemic, seeing so many i guess negatives factors around me on tv or on social media everyday just doesn’t help either. there’s a lot of things but it all sucks"
79,Goodbye Reddit,
80,I just need to tell my story to someone.,"If you're one of my brothers that I mention and you read this, don't bring it up in real life or over text. Don't even comment on this. Don't make it awkward between us 


I was abused, mentally and emotionally, sometimes physically to an extent, at eight years old. My father has heart disease and couldn't take the stress of my mother so he moved out, not knowing what was to come for his children. My father is at 0% fault here because he had no clue what was happening. My mother is an awful person. She walked out for days, sometimes weeks, at a time on myself and my two brothers. Being the youngest child, I was the anger relief for my brothers. I wasn't abused physically by them, but emotional scars leave a lasting impression. We had $10-$20 per week for food for three of us. We ended up rationing out food, I felt like we were in the wild. My mother didn't pay the bills so the water got shut off and the electric and heat got shut off. I'm not comfortable saying the state I live in, but I'll say we are one of the coldest places in America. Living without heat here is devastating. My brothers ended up locking eight year old me in a room alone for the day. We were often not going to school because we lived about ten miles from town at that point in small town USA. Buses got our there, but we were usually sick so we couldn't go anyways.  I eventually sat alone at home, no power, no running water, no heat, for hours while my brothers went to school. I called my father whomst I had not seen or been able to speak to for weeks and he got me out of that place. That wretched, God-forbidden place. I moved in with him a week later and have sustained a hatred for my mother ever since. Now, six years later, the memories of that are haunting me as I sleep at night. Because of that place, I'm extremely paranoid of being abandoned by people. Even my closest friend who has helped me through so much, I fear of abandonment. If our power goes out during a storm, it's like a fucking war flashback. I get anxious, paranoid, sad, and angry. Not long ago, I started bringing myself closer to God (my family is Christian and so am I). I began reading the Bible for a bit everyday and praying everyday. I try to listen to things that I wouldn't normally do because God will tell you to do something that may not make sense at the time. But, I do it anyways... Or at least I try to. Four years ago, my father and I adopted a rescue dog. We weren't told what happened to her, but we know she was abused badly. Nearly everytime she falls asleep, she will shake or twitch or growl. It makes me look at the world differently. I feel like I connect with this dog on a new level. 

Here I am, six years after escaping my mother. Depressed, anxious, paranoid, and easily spooked. I have talked to my closest friend about my issues, but nothing makes them better. Nothing I do can even distract my mind. If I sit down to play videogames, I remember when I didn't have power. If I go for a walk, the memories of the cold and no best come back. If I see the Minnesota Vikings logo, I get memories because that was the only jacket I had at that time. If I hear or see my mother at all, even her name on my phone, I just get this deep feeling of hatred and self-worthlessness. If I go try to play with me let my dog, I get memories of my old dog that died in the confines of that house. The house my father and I love at it very small. I am grateful for it though, I'm happy for what I have because I've had less before. When I sit to eat lunch, I silently thank God. This house has five rooms in total, not bedrooms. Total rooms. Living room, one bedroom, kitchen, one bathroom, laundry room. Our backyard is the smallest I have ever seen in my fourteen years on this planet. Our front yard is practically non-existent. But I'm thankful for it. I'm thankful for everything I have. I'm thankful for my father. I'm thankful for my friend, who has gotten me through much of this. I had to wake my dog up seven times while typing this because she's had back to back nightmares. My nightmares, by the way, aren't ones where I wake up sweating or screaming. My nightmares are torture. I can't wake up, I don't wake up from them. It's constant, I have to watch, I have to deal with it. When it strikes 7 AM, I'm up. I'm out of bed. I stay awake until 3 AM often so I can minimize the amount of time I have to spend in my nightmare. My life is like a nightmare. 

My closest friend is my only real friend. He's the only person I'm close to. I don't even trust my own family enough to talk to them. Just for clarification, my brothers are now good people (one of them). The other one is a whole different story. My closest friend is my greatest fear. I fear that he will find others to talk to and stop talking to me because I'm fucked up. I put my fake face on and act like everything is fine. My school hasn't closed for some reason, but I switched to online classes for the health of my father. This hasn't helped me get any better. The quarantine over the summer was fine, I don't leave my house during the summer anyways. Now, I feel like I'm going fucking insane. I'm trapped with my memories and my emotional scars. I'm trapped with my dog, who is scared of the wind. I'm trapped with my computer and my fucking online schooling. What do I do during class? I don't take notes like I'm supposed to, there goes that 50 point grade. I don't pay attention, there goes my overall grade. What do I do then? I sit there and dwell in my own thoughts because I'm alone for seven hours in this room per my request. I'll leave to grab a water in between my class, but then I'm right back in there. I look at my Bible and think to God ""Please help me out of this."" 

Maybe God told me to come to this subreddit. I'm a freethinker and get criticized and made fun of by my classmates for it. It's pretty bullshit, but it hits me hard. I sit there in my virtual class watching my teachers camera as it's positioned at my classmates. Do they think I can't hear them? I've developed sharp ears from my torture. The slightest noise catches my attention. I know if someone puts their foot on the first step of our deck. I can hear the rumors about me. I can hear the drama about me. 

""Why is he online?""
""He just needs to get over it.""
""This virus is fake.""
""Apparently, he has anxiety.""
""He has nothing to be depressed about.""

Those are all things I've heard about myself. Saying I have nothing to be depressed about means nothing to me. You haven't been to my house, you're not my friend, I haven't told you anything about me. You know me by my name. You think of me as the quiet kid, but have you ever been considered my friend? Even for five minutes? Have I ever say down and had a conversation with you outside of discussing our school work? I didn't think so, Paige or Chloe or Kelly or fuck, everyone in my fucking grade. Why are these fucks spreading rumors about me when I haven't spoken a word to them in a year? I'm not joking. I haven't spoken to some of my classmates for almost a year. About being paranoid and shit, I keep one ear of my headphones off so I can hear everything clearly to make sure nothing is going to happen to me as it did.

This post is all over the place, but I have a new topic to talk about. This really messed me up more. I had a ""close friend"" from the fourth grade up to the beginning of the eighth. This friend was all about herself. I tried opening up and I was told ""Not right now"" 

Guess what this bitch was doing? She was fucking playing Minecraft on her phone. How do I know this? She had the Xbox app opened. Not fucking kidding. This bitch uses as many people as she can then plants the blame on that person, a classic fake asshole. I cut this person from my life, but I was four years too late. The damage is done. A ""Sorry"" doesn't fucking fix my mental health, you fucking dense moist doorknob that spreads COVID-19. Oh wait, I forgot COVID-19 doesn't exist because your Karen mother told you so, sorry. 

If you're reading this, I'm not going to throw the name out. You know who you are, bitch. I hope you die alone. 

One way I can cope with my issues to listen a rapper named ""NF"" who talks about faith and mental illness often. 

Just woke my dog up for the twelfth time. Just so you know, I'm not trying to beg for pity, I don't want respect or attention. I don't want recognition. I just need some place to go. Thank you for reading. Not all people are bad, most are.

Stay safe, everyone. Please."
81,Is this dissociation?,"Since I was a kid I suffered lots of tragic things and violence, not hardly traumatic events but it was  regularly so I guess it shaped my mind in a bad way because I've done abnormal things that were wrong  too.

From a young age I use to talk alone, wether outside or in my house,I don't hallucinate when I do so I don't see nothing but I do talk as if I'm telling something to somebody I like. And sometimes I even do it when I am with real people, it happens most frequently when I'm in a bad state or when I'm desperate for telling something to somebody.
 
I will go to therapy obviously because I need it but I wanted to know if what happens to me is dissociation so I can read more about it and start controlling it if I can,thanks in advance"
82,I know I need help but I feel like I've lost trust in the mental health system,"tw: depression, self harm, suicide

I've (20F) had multiple therapists and a psychiatrist since age 12. 

1st therapist:(12) Yelled at me for making my mom feel bad in the second session, causing me to cry and never go back. Instead of asking why I wanted to kill myself, she asked why I was doing this to my mom. I was 12 years old...

I didn't get help all of high school despite many incidents of self-harm and depressive episodes. Everyone knew I was depressed (went to a small high school). No one did anything though.

2nd therapist:(18) Got her through mental health services on campus (took me 2 months to get an appointment with her). She diagnosed me with anxiety and depression but only saw me a total of 3 times before referring me somewhere else. I actually really liked her and wish I could see her regularly.

3rd therapist:(19) Nice lady but just agreed with everything I said. I told her my boyfriend had been cheating on me and she said ""relationships aren't perfect."" She never texted me about setting up another appointment after I had to cancel.

4th therapist:(19) Ghosted me after the third session. It was Zoom so I showed up and waited twenty minutes. I showed up again the next week. She never texted me or reached out to me. 

Psychiatrist:(18-20) Old and never remembers who I am. Randomly stopped filling my prescription without telling me despite having a follow up appointment. I've reached out a fews times but no luck.

I've been trying to get help for years. It sucks that the people I have to pay to talk to me/help me don't even want to. It really makes me feel hopeless. I want to seek help but it takes so long to even get an intake and I can't wait that long. Why can't I just find something that works that won't ditch me?"
83,just wondering what could cause this?,"so i (17f) was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago, and just recently ADD. the pandemic has definitely made me more socially anxious, but like in the way that i’m overly confident in conversations like i would be with my mom and friends i’ve talked to on facetime. but then i cross a weird self-set boundary and spend HOURS freaking out about it and shaking and feeling nauseous. basically, i just get super badly embarrassed over the tiniest things and have to literally “shake it off.” since i have a couple different diagnoses, i was just wondering if this is more of a hyperfocusing on negative thoughts or just an anxiety thing. not urgent at all just curious!"
84,Overthinking,I’m a first year at a community college and I took my first semester online for fall but I tend to overthink a lot about my grades because of a certain program called honors transfer program. My schedule contained statistics and other 3 classes and I’ve been working my butt hard to keep a 3.1 gpa or higher to stay in the program. I have a C in statistics and I’m glad I’m passing but my gpa is a 3.2. I’ve been overthinking way too much this week cause it’s my last 2 weeks before the semester ends. I kept getting nervous and anxious of everything that I’ve hurt my mental health. This semester I kept throwing up a lot because of how anxious and nervous I was at every essay and exam that came up. I kept fearing that I will be kicked out of the program. It didn’t help that during my first semester other people around me were suffering with depression and becoming suicidal. I kept running back and forth for everything. In this two days I went into a breakdown episode where I couldn’t control my emotions and kept getting anxious of my final research papers. I am scared of the future and what ahead of me. It’s gotten so bad that I think I developed insomnia and I don’t eat anything cause I end throwing up later from how anxious I get during the course of doing my assignments. I haven’t felt so horrible before and I keep doubting my capabilities cause I’m not smart or wealthy. I want to stop overthinking cause it’s slowly consuming me and it hurts that I am not able to focus on these assignments because of my fear of getting grades harshly and my grades dropping. Sorry for the rant but I hope to hear something on how to decrease my overthinking.
85,Could the feeling of being uncomfortable because of reduced personal space be justified?,"My parents moved to the studio in April last year and I joined them in June in the same year. The lease agreemend was until April this year; and since we have the studio, it is not too much for the family of 3. I was glad that our lease was up because since we could afford bigger apartment, we could move to one where everyone will find a peace in its own room. However, because of Coronavirus, it has not happened: due to the social distance and restrictions we didn't take a risk to move to unknown apartment without visiting it in person. So we decided to stay here. And because of the lockdown, we all 3 stayed here. It was quite normal for couple of months, but as Fall approached, I started to feel... Uncomfortable. There are 3 of us here, mother bullies me sometimes and overall my family try to talk about every my flaw here. I don't feel comfortable to grab a snack because they would tell me that I have problems with skin (it is, but it mostly because of menstruation hormone levels), I feel uncomfortable because I can not take a nap during the day (I'm told I need to sleep at night) and I feel angry because whenever I study, there is a lot of noise in the evening. Even though I tried to explain, they ignore me and I try to study while listening to noise in another language. And the best of the best thing here - I can't sleep CALMLY, NEVER. My mom snores aka old manatee, whenever she starts snoring the walls in the house starts to trembre, and every night I needed to stand up and tuck her and after cover my ears with hands so tightly so they are hot but for relief I don't hear snoring mostly. I feel exhausted and restricted, but I hope everything will be good later."
86,I JUST WANT FOOD,[deleted]
87,My life has become just a bunch of different repeating cycles.,"I hate to look towards the Internet as some form of validation or help, because everyone that will read this will never have any real sort of communication with me throughout my life but I just keep coming back to it, seems to be cyclical but I don't really know what to to do.

Although my whole life seems to be cyclical in everything I do, what I do in a day in pretty much the same every day. When it comes to my mental health its cyclical, I start off happy and engaging with friends and family then something will just completely swing my mood into a point where I feel like how I'm feeling now.

Some of you may be wondering what has made me feel like this on this occasion? Well again my dear friends is part of another cycle that I'm stuck in, I met a girl recently who I think is really freaking nice, cool and interesting and don't get me started on her looks, she's an absolute angel in every sense of the word. Admittedly I haven't known her for that long at all and I definitely don't love her but to say that I have a slight crush would be an understatement. Problem is that I'm pretty sure she has a boyfriend :/ now she hasn't told me whether she has or not but I'm fairly certain she does, neither of us have really been too flirty I guess but she doesn't really avoid my compliments and she does reply with her own in reply sometimes, it probably doesn't mean anything as I just feel like she's trying to be nice to me. I'm not blaming her, it's not her fault or her bfs if she does have one. In fact it's mine for falling for this same situation again, this has happened a few times (where the girl I'm talking to is taken) since my last relationship, but this one did kind of sting a little bit. I guess if you read this L (Calling her L for privacy I guess) I'm so sorry for well being me.

I just don't know what I can do to stop these cycles in my life, I guess the relationship one does really bug me a lot because I feel like because I try and be really friendly and open about myself to people they feel like they can't tell me? I don't know, again I don't want people to think I'm pinning it on them because it's not their fault in the slightest. Maybe my typical daily cycle that I mentioned and my mental cycle if you will don't help either but it's gotten to the point where I'm kinda getting bored of my own life and it's making me sad.

Anyway that's my long venting sesh over, hope you're all having a good day and please if you're not feeling OK please talk to someone.

Much love to you all,
Cam"
88,Did I have an advance hallucination or do I have a powerful imagination?,"So I was walking around and was home alone and was doing chores and talking to my friend. Her name was Keri and we talk for 5ish minutes she was very nice. Soon we were talking and I turned around and didn’t see her there and then realized that she doesn’t exist. I knew she was not really real but my mind been trying to convince me otherwise. She felt real the was she talk and her movements and when she patted me on the shoulder I felt the hand and when she sat on my bed I saw the pressure of her weight on my sheets. 

I don’t know if my imagination is going crazy or if I am? I had seen glimpses or feel the presence of other things for a while but this was the first full conversation. I can’t find an answer on google so any advice? I know some things about hallucinations but not munch so any help would be helpful."
89,"Finally gonna get help, hope this is thr right tag.","So for the past 5 years of my life I have been battling my suicidal thoughts. I dont want to get into how far deep I am, story for another time mabye. So recently after I had a spiral downwards (for the 100th millionth time) I decided to finally reach out to help. I told my mother as she is super close to me, and well I just got off the phone and mabye just msbye everything will look up. I kinda feel a weight lifted of my shoulders, but enough about me I chose this flair for a reason.

90,I have a question about health,"What happens to people who have any traumas, mental illnesses, or physical problems (asthma, etc.) left unchecked for years and years on end? Does it ever get to a point of no return and you’ll just die from the problem?"
91,Does everybody feel like joy is entirely transient and never lasts?,"Basically, I can never sustain feelings of happiness or joy. I can do something that should make me happy, like going out with friends, and in the moment I can feel happy, but it's almost like I'm behind a glass wall. I can see my friends smiling and laughing so I smile and laugh with them but it doesn't feel real to me. Then as soon as I leave from the situation that should be making me happy (e.g. go home from a party), I feel crushingly empty and sit staring at a wall for hours wondering why I can't just feel happy like other people. 

Does everybody feel like this?"
92,I need professional help,"I’m trying to find services in my area. Many providers practice spiritual and belief based therapy. No judgement of course healing is a beautiful thing but I think I am just looking for something more conventional I guess. Is there some kind of directory of mental health professionals I could consult?

I have struggled with mental health off and on since I can remember (mostly on. Actually pretty much always on but some times less on than others?) had a less than rewarding experience with a social worker at my local clinic several years back and have not sought out help before or since.

I’m lost in more was than one and I don’t really know what I need or what I’m looking for. I just know things aren’t right and that something has to change."
93,This is kinda a mix of a vent/question.,"I'm a pretty social person and since quarantine I haven't talked to anyone face to face in quite some time, and the fact that I moved to another state in the middle of it hasn't helped. And I thought I was doing fine but lately I've been getting tons of tension headaches, self doubt, and ive been crying more for seemingly no real reason. And my mind has felt really tired over the last week, it kinda feels like when you finish a really long and difficult test and you just cant/don't want to think. And ive been thinking about telling one of my close friends my problems, but then I realize that they have their own issues and I dont want to burden them. And with every thought I have about maybe talking to someone there's a part of my mind thats saying ""you're just doing this for pity, or for attention"" and that stops me from telling anyone. I feel ok enough that I can live/do daily tasks, but everything just seems a little gloomy. Is this normal? Am I struggling with my mental health? And to add im also in puberty so my hormones may have added to this."
94,"I was kidnapped last year, and I have a deep fear of leaving my house","A year ago, I was kidnapped and sex trafficked. I managed to escape. It was extremely mentally damaging. I haven't been able to leave the house. Of course I do for errands. I have to force myself out the house to exercise or socialize though. I mean like beat myself up about it. I also live with a narcissistic family so it's hard staying in, but even their nastiness isn't enough for me to leave. Especially since my neighborhood is unsafe. A lot of guys stare at me, I'm sure that's normal for girls but it freaks me out. I want to go back to normal and be healthy. It seems like I beat myself up so much for having a normal human reaction..."
95,How to Treat Coronavirus at Home ?,"Hi, one of my friend have some coronavirus symptoms. Please let me know how to cure from this virus at home."
96,My friend has been seeing the same face every time he closes his eyes,"My friend has recently described a phenomenon in which he experiences the same face flashing towards him every time he closes his eyes. In the past, he experienced night terrors due to a scare from a family member on Halloween. Doing searches on similar experiences from other people has simply brought up articles of people claiming to be having an awakening of sorts. 

Can anyone explain what he is experiencing?"
97,I had a full on schizo-something episode today.,"Over the last few weeks I've been feeling, ""off"". I've been feeling alienated in every aspect of my life. Like everyone is out to get me or try to screw me over in some way. And today I accused my wife and brother of sneaking around behind my back, just CONVINCED that they've been doing it for years. I broke a cup during an argument and stormed out of the house and continued the argument shakily and teary eyed over text talking crazy and insulting myself and talking about suicide. 

This isn't my first one, but it's been a long time since my last one. In 2017 I attempted suicide three times and almost didnt come back the 2nd time. I faked my way out of the psych ward, I had the counselors fooled and blamed drugs/alcohol, and gave the appearance for drug seeking behavior rather than real psychological issues. And here I was thinking they were the fools.

Right now I wanna die. I'm so embarrassed about my episode today that I wanna shut myself in my bedroom and smoke myself stupid and watch some crazy stuff on youtube alone until I shrivel up and turn into nothingness. 

I can't escape myself, I cant help myself, i cant stand myself."
98,what's my problem? is this even a mental health issue?,"so I've been having a pretty bad sleep schedule, procrastinating way too much, and being very irritable (constantly in a fight with family or friends). I know that sounds just like a normal teenager, but I'm already  past the teenage years. And I didn't even act like that when I was a teenager. I've been trying to fix these problems for the past six months, but haven't had much success. These problems have been so persistent that I'm starting to think that they hint at or might lead to bigger problems. 

Any insights or tips on how to fix these issues? (I've googled how to solve them, so answers easily found online won't be much help)"
99,Never supported for hard work,"As a kid all my hard work was neither supported nor rewarded by my parents in regards to school or friends. 

The only hard work that was ever rewarded was that I put in videogames. 

Needless to say, during high school I did mediocre work on school, less than mediocre on friends, and in college it was the same. 

Result, depression coupled with social isolation and the inability to truly put in hard work and reap the rewards from it and I'm sick of it. Sick of being alone (fuck you corona measures) and just sick of putting more effort into videogames than I do in the people around me.

The idea was to make 2020 a good year, return to the pub, socialise with people, get to know people better, but that all went down the drain when every bit of fun I was starting to have became impossible. Neither is going online something for me, because the best part of being outside, is that I'm not stuck at home. 

Now they have made facemasks mandaratory (even though the science doesnt back it being effective, otherwise cases in countries like France and the UK that have made it mandatory in the summer would be non-existant) which is gonna make communication even more difficult outside, if I even get outside, because I'd be missing facial expressions. 

I know, lots of complaints, little action....but these measures aint good for my mental and emotional wellbeing..."
100,Does everyone have a childhood where most of their memories are miserable?,"I remember my childhood as being almost always miserable. I never had bad parents nor divorce in my life. I was sexually abused at school in front of everyone everyday when I was little, our parents spanked us, and I was bullied in elementary school but other than that I lived an almost perfect life. I know this all sounds like it's a lot but believe me when I say those things didn't contribute much to the misery of my childhood. I was just a miserable little kid no matter how good of a day I was having.


I'm glad I'm not a little kid anymore and I assumed it was that way for everyone but recently, fellow Gen Zers have been sharing stuff that made them happy from when we were kids and how much they miss those times but all of the things they miss make me feel a feeling of nostalgia and then I feel really down because I remember how absolutely miserable I was as a kid.

 I never want to go back. Ever. But then I hear my friends saying how they miss when they were kids. So, is it just me? Or does everyone remember their childhood miserably? Is very child miserable? 

Thanks!!!"
101,"I know I'm not the only one, but I still feel lonely","I've always been afraid of reaching out in a public space like this. I think about people's reactions; what they might say, the downvotes, the criticism. But I'm taking a huge leap of my own as this is one of my ""cries for help.""

I can spend hours reading, watching videos, exercising common practices to help cope with anxiety and depression. I can study mental illnesses from morning till night in hopes of being able to build myself further, and ""cure"" myself slowly. I realized that, besides the difficulty of getting out of bed, feeling numb to the world around me, I can educate myself on things I need to work on. 

But at the end of the day, I'll still feel the need to talk to someone. To not feel alone. To be able to express, especially at times when my mind is completely blank.

The anxiety has somehow settled down a bit, but the depression is slowly eating away at me. I've done as much research as my energy can provide in looking for a counselor or therapist, but I just don't have the financial support to do that. I've lost my boyfriend who understood me the most, mostly because of the impact of the pandemic that caused us to drift. My friends and family support me, but I could never have a conversation with them because they didn't understand (and I've tried many times).

I feel like I'm closing up on an impasse, and it'll only get worse from here. 

Please be gentle with me, because I've never had the courage to do this before. Thanks for reading."

103,I feel like I’m on the edge of a psychotic break/nervous breakdown and I’m genuinely terrified. What should I do?,"I’ve been getting more and more depressed these last few months, my anxiety is bad and my moods are all over the place.

But the last few months really have started to get very strange. I’m feeling something I haven’t felt before. I wake up confused, sometimes I don’t know where I am. My boyfriend might be in the kitchen and for 3 or so minutes after I wake up I think I’m at my parents house and they are in the ones in the kitchen. When I finally realize where i am I feel so embarrassed.

I woke up at 3am one day and in my half sleep daze I pulled all the covers off the bed to put them in the hallway, my boyfriend was annoyed I woke him up. Then I went back to sleep ashamed and scared of what is happening to me.

I’ve been trying to pull it together for months now, just “get on with it” but all the depression and stress is creeping up on me. Work stress and feeling inferior in work (me being kept down while every man and his dog seem to be progressing career wise), worrying about a parent during corona times, feeling lost that I’m in my 30s and getting older, worrying about feeling stuck in life with time ticking by and eventually missing my chance if I want to have kids etc etc etc.

I guess in short, all the stress I’ve been trying to handle has started to cause me to feel confused and scared and I don’t know what to do.

I see a psychiatrist and I am on lamotrigine, I had talking therapy but it didn’t work for me at all."
104,"I dont have ""that friend"" that I can call in times of need","This problem has been on and off for a couple years but recently (past year) its been really difficult. In high school I was almost always in some sort of group, usually around 6-10 people. These groups shifted people but there were always people who I could really ask for help if I needed it. As life goes on those people have faded from my life which is fine, we all go our different ways. I've found myself truly alone. I'm currently living at home and I found my family is not usual. We aren't close at all and separate 90% of the day. We don't talk and im (M)19 while they are much much older, like an entire full grown man could fit in between our age gap. Its not a big problem till I relized my parents cannot possible comprehend what I'm going through. I've tried many times to talk about things but they just don't understand.

 My friend group that I had stuck with also turned into an extremely toxic place and I had to distance myself. I thought it would make me happier or more confident but I find myself just sitting or laying on the floor for hours contemplating weather I made the right choice. I've told other friends about my  troubles but all it leads to them getting farther and farther away. At this point there are lots of days where I just have an urge to cry because of my isolation.
I wouldn't say i have any abandonment issues but I go days without talking to anyone other than my parents and I feel so disconnected from the world"
105,Was feeling depressed today and need someone to talk to.,These days I have been feeling really depressed and low. I have been staying at home most of the time because of my OCD. Just needed someone to talk to. It may help me relax my mind
106,I want to understand why I'm like this,"So I'd say for the last 7 or so months, there's something about myself I've been deliberating about that I wouldn't really call harmful, just strange. It's something that's been a thing for me for a long time, but I guess I never really thought about it until that point.

Both the child me and the adult me still exist within me. I'm not talking like, a multiple personalities type thing where suddenly I'll switch and start acting out like a child. It's more like in my head, my adult inner monologue didn't replace my child one as I got older, more like they coexist. Not all the time, but certainly sometimes, my inner monologue is more like an inner dialogue, especially at night time (ever since I was a toddler, I haven't slept easily, so I kind of talk myself to sleep, if that makes sense). Pretty much any time I'm not socializing, really, I'll eventually find a child-like voice weighing in on what's going on around me, what I'm doing, or on the same old toys, games, shows, friends, and places from over ten years ago. Whereas back then, it was the opposite-- an adult masculine voice would weigh in on what I was doing when I wasn't socializing (possibly an early sign of what would later be diagnosed as gender dysphoria, since I was born female, thankfully no longer am). It's like I became what I thought was just an imaginary friend back then, but ""I"" didn't disappear.

I did try to talk to my therapist about this a little, but she wasn't interested in focusing on it because she thinks it's in place for a reason and she doesn't want to antagonize it. And I understand that, I'm basically on the same page. I don't care about changing it, I really just want more of an understanding of *why* this is in place even though I'm not a kid anymore. That answer, she didn't give me (though I admittedly didn't press much for it). I don't think it's dissociative identity disorder because I don't really have any memory issues (on the contrary, I can remember things as far back as 2 years old, whether good, bad, or unfortunately traumatizing), and the person I am outwardly doesn't ever change (except in the natural, normal ways, such as not talking to your boss the same way you'd talk to your best friends). I'd be hard-pressed to even consider it a disorder, because it doesn't cause me any stress or inability to function in society-- in fact, it's quite helpful; I work in child care and it has made me able to easily empathize with children, understand how they're thinking, and how to communicate with them in a way they'll understand and enjoy.

Thanks in advance for any information you may have."
107,"‘Possible Bipolar’, don’t know how to tell my longtime psychiatrist the uncomfortable truth","Preface: Not asking for diagnosis, I just don’t know how to talk to my longtime psychiatrist. 

I am 22 years old, and the psychiatrist I have seen since I was 12 for ADHD told me a few months back that she suspects that I may have bipolar, and to tell her if anything happens with me. I have never been entirely honest with her because I am scared to talk about being really sad and wanting to die, drug use sprees, and several terrible and uncomfortable sexual phases I guess that I am ashamed of. I have never told her any of that and I don’t know how to come clean, but even still she is concerned about bipolar. She asked if I have had periods of bad anxiety or depression which is very true for me, but I said no because it was easier.

I have researched bipolar a lot and I hit quite a few of the things, subjectively. I’m not self diagnosing, I don’t think that I have bipolar, but I think there is a good enough chance that I need to do something. I just want to live like a normal person and move past these stupid problems. 

My biggest fear stopping me is that I have been somehow using the thought of potentially having ‘symptoms I can’t control’ as an excuse for my character flaws and life shortcomings, paired with some kind of sporadic perverted sexual issue. For example, am I staying up until 5am because I have too much energy to sleep due to a medical issue, or is it because I am completely irresponsible and have no self control? If I tell her the whole truth as I currently see my issues to be, I can guess what the outcome will likely be. But would my own suspicion of bipolar bleed out into the information I report and lead her to an incorrect diagnosis? 

I don’t know what to do so I haven’t been doing anything."
108,"I fell very little, occasional satisfaction from life","My lookout on life as it is right now is not catastrophic, but there's little to be joyful about. It's all about solving problems by pouring some money on them. Money that are always short, even when living a very frugal life.

I may be overworked though I find it hard to get some true satisfaction from resting, it feels more like pacifying myself. Some stuff works better than others, like immersive video games. Other stuff feels like passing some time.

There were some past months that were better for me, before that I used to be very hard on myself and blame myself for not coping. Right now, I just go forth with life but without any resolve: stuff just happens."

111,I feel lost with nothing to look forward to,I been stressed out lately. Feel like the entire world around me crashing down .i have no idea what do with my life. I just want to dissapear
112,What's going on with my brain?,"Background:  I'm a 29 year old male.  I'm diagnosed as bipolar but I don't know how accurate that is.  I'm currently not taking my meds (yes I should take meds don't bother saying this).  I've only ever consistently taken my meds for a few months during this time things improved slightly.  I have a therapist but I barely talk to him and miss most of my appointments.  When we do talk it's for a few minutes to check in.  I'm very very bad at expressing myself especially when it comes to my emotions or mental health.

Symptoms:

The last couple of years I've had these fits that last for a few months and gradually get better on their own.  During this time I am very incoherent.  It comes in waves and sometimes I'm fairly functional. I get lost easily, I struggle with forming thoughts, concentrating and speaking.  I can't do much of anything at all when it's at it's worst.  I don't remember much about my mental state last time but it's starting again so I'm going to try to keep track of things.

I am not depressed or suicidal.  I get lost in thoughts.  Often I can't remember these thoughts after I have thought them but they are incredibly engrossing.  I am extremely tired and hungry but unable to sleep or eat.  

I have some very slight religious delusions all of the time.  These delusions are that I am in hell or that reality is sentient and actively hostile.  Usually it's just sort of background noise and usually they aren't audible at all.  When they are audible it sounds like a very faint demonic chorus (once or twice it has been deafeningly loud but I barely remember that.  This chorus tells me something like: ""you can see now, you're already in hell and it's all too late"". It goes on and on with lots of verses.

It's really just something I made up.  At no point (except once on acid) have I ever been convinced that I am in hell.  I don't recall making it up but I don't recall all sorts of things.  Don't fly off the handle and claim schizophrenia.  I've talked to lots of mental health professionals and no one has ever mentioned schizophrenia.  Online people always want the most interesting and insane diagnosis.

There are a few things about me that firmly classify me as an evil person.  I'm not going to tell you what they are but trust me I am actually evil.  Don't say that's made up it isn't and I should know.

I usually thoroughly enjoy my delusions and the times when I am unable to think or speak.  This is probably a lot of the reason I haven't been getting help very much.  I want to increase my insanity.

Is there a name for this condition?"
113,Do I need to see a psychiatrist?,"For context, I'm 19M and I live in Canada. I do not drink or do any drugs ever, and I'm not on any medication. I don't know if trigger warnings are encouraged on this sub but tw for self harm, su\*cide, memory loss and false reality. 

I've been experiencing memory loss, time jumps, and false memories, and its starting to be dangerous. I often forget things I'm supposed to do and don't know what has happened to me in the past few days. I've mostly been able to work around this with timers and alarms, but sometimes it doesn't always work. Today, I made some muffins, and I completely forgot that I had made them. then, when my timer went off, I distinctly remember taking them out of the oven and checking for doneness, that they were done, and that I left them to cool on my counter. I just walked downstairs and was told that my little brother took the muffins out of the oven, and that they were on fire. I could have burned my house down. I trust that my brother is telling the truth but I keep thinking that he put the muffins back into the oven and burned them on purpose so that he could be a hero. This type of thing happens every other day that I notice. Sometimes I have conversations I remember that never happened, or vice versa. I never know what day of the week it is or even what month it is usually, unless I check. 

There have been many times where I have ""woken up"" in a place that I wasn't before, where I could not have been asleep, like while driving or working out at the gym. One moment I'm at home or school and the next I'm somewhere completely different. The people around me don't seem to notice any difference either. It's very disorienting and distressing when this happens to me, because I don't know where I am or if what is happening is real. Sometimes I think I am in a simulation like the matrix and that the only way to get out would be to harm/k\*ll myself. 

I'm very scared to talk to my doctor about this for a number of reasons. First is because I've overreacted to symptoms in the past and later discovered that what was going on was normal. Secondly because I was hospitalized for my mental health 5 years ago and it was terrible. I can't do that again. Third because my family is still supporting  me and they are always saying how proud they are for me for ""beating"" my mental illness. Fourth because I might lose access to life saving HIV medication if my mental health is not fine. But since my memory lapses are staring to put me in danger (almost crashing the car or burning down the house, and suicidal ideation), I worry that it might be time to talk to him. Any help you guys can give is greatly appreciated."
114,Am I too far gone for professional help?,"l am sixteen years old, and I do not remember a life before I had awful mental health. For the past six years or so, I have thought about killing myself in extreme detail. I've had nonverbal periods. I've self harmed numerous times. I used to go days without sleeping because I was terrified of closing my eyes. Before that, I went weeks without showering or even brushing my teeth because I didn't have the energy. Last week I slept around eleven hours a day because I hated being awake so much. 

The reason I'm asking if I need to get help is mostly because I don't know if it would work anymore. I feel like no matter what I do, I'll kill myself or something soon. I know my life isn't sustainable, but I don't know how you change something this deeply routed. 

Another problem is, as bad as this sounds, I'm not sure I want to change. I don't know who I'd be without these issues. It feels like most people frame having mental health problems as a phase or a temporary part of your life. My mental health problems have devoured my life. There isn't a single area that isn't negatively affected by them, but I don't know what anything would be like without them. 

Sorry if this is poorly worded, another issue is that I don't have the easiest time articulating my emotions."

I’m 99.9% sure I have health anxiety/hypochondria. I’m suffering from panic attacks/anxiety attacks almost everyday from convincing myself I am seriously unwell to the point I physically feel unwell. I am constantly checking my body for signs of serious illnesses, constantly checking for lumps and bumps on every area of my body from fear of having cancer etc which sounds insane I know but it’s draining me and stopping me from living normally. Everyday is a new thing I’m worrying about. I had pestered my mother over and over when I was 16 to get my heart checked over as I had fully convinced myself I had something wrong with it, I had full blown panic attacks and screaming matches with her to get her to believe me resulting in her taking me to the doctors, having hospital appointments with ECG scans and every scan came back fine, they said I was just suffering with anxiety but I’m still to this day not happy and have intrusive thoughts telling me I’m unwell. My friends and family are at their wits end with me (as they should be) and don’t know how to comfort or calm me down when I am panicking about these things. Nothing in my past could have triggered this and I’m just at a loss of what to do right now. I want to call my doctors about it badly but I’m fearful/embarrassed that they’re not going to take me seriously or think I’m joking. I don’t know anyone else that suffers with this so I feel like a massive weirdo. Does anyone else suffer with this and is there anything that has helped you? Any advice/questions/opinions are welcome."
118,Is it normal to fantasize about killing yourself/others?,I always find myself imagining ways to kill myself. I know every way I could kill myself in my home. I also fantasize about killing my parents. I never take any action.
119,Everyone thinks my brain is fucked up because of my anger issues,"Hi r/mentalhealth, I'm a 14m.

Due to my bursts of anger, everyone thinks I have a fucked up brain. I go to a high school that in order to get in, you have to do a test to prove that you are smart enough. Most people, including teachers and my peers at school make fun of me because of my issues and they always tell me that I have to get my brain checked up because I'm apparently fucked in the head. I'm part of the more popular group at school and its mainly the outcasts in my school that make fun of me. Whenever they tell me I have mental issues enough times I will usually just get up and bash everyone I see. Yes, this probably doesn't help my case but I really cannot control my anger and I cant help just laying into the 4 foot 5 gremlins that make my life living hell and tease me for something I cannot control. 

Because of this, I have had 4 suspension warnings so far this year, and all my teachers don't trust me, for example, the teacher was asking everyone in the class who had finished reading the book, said I did so she had a 20 minute interview asking me everything that was in the book. This is only one scenario of the many that I experience everyday in school. I have also had a girl I was with leave me because of my issues as I mentioned earlier. 

Currently, I see the school counselor who has sent me to the hospital and diagnosed me with bipolar anger and racing thoughts, of which I am very grateful for her help and she helps me greatly. I am also trying to turn my life around and am trying to lose my bad reputation in school because of an incident with a girl that told me I had severe issues so in a blind fit of rage, I just told her everything I thought of her and every insult I could every think of. But I want some advice on just what I should do and how to get people to stop harassing me because of my mental health issues. 

Thank you guys in advance, I really appreciate it!"
120,"After being close to someone with BPD, I am so pissed I was misdiagnosed with BPD.","SORRY IF THIS OFFENDS ANYONE.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually have Bipolar and PTSD... NOT BPD. But my one idiot psychiatrist thought I had BPD because idk. I had some slight PTSD triggers,(before i was diagnosed with PTSD) and was reactive occasionally because of the bipolar episodes (before I was diagnosed with bipolar). BUT I WOULDN'T EVER PULL SHIT EVEN CLOSE TO THIS. (I may get pissed over time, if people are assholes, that's normal. We have to learn our standards lol)

I just got involved (not romantic really) with a close friend who ACTUALLY has BPD, and AFTER A WEEK, I MADE ONE TINY LITTLE MISTAKE THAT WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING, AND A DEMONIC RAGE WAS UNLEASHED. As soon as I didn't respond because of a technical glitch (and THEY were the one to flake out on me after the LOVE BOMB stage, in the first place, so the ball was in their court), they GHOSTED, and ACCUSED ME OF GHOSTING and gave me the most irrational character assassination ever when I called them on their flakiness/BS. They wouldn't listen to any rational discussion or attempt at moving forward/resolution. I didn't do ANYTHING wrong. They just flipped on me in a second. I am honestly INSULTED that anyone would treat me or misdiagnose me as having this disorder. That behavior was never something I did, I may have gotten reactive as a result of the bipolar, but I never would ""split"" like that... idek what that would feel like. Once I got the bipolar treated, I have been totally fine... WTF!!!???.  

&amp;#x200B;

And my ex would constantly be a narcissistic jerk about my ""BPD"" implementing the most rigid boundaries, which may be necessary for some people but like... Yo, there was a serious family emergency... Anyone would need extra support that week? And he of course made it a ""BPD"" thing. And implemented harsh boundaries like ""NO calling me on Sundays, because I need space..."" During a legit family problem... Okay. PLUS he was manipulative in general which wears on one's mental health. He treated me unreasonably because I was labeled as ""BPD."" And it made me feel like CRAP because I DIDN'T NEED THOSE BOUNDARIES SINCE I DON'T HAVE BPD. \*angry\* 

I also have another friend with this condition, and she is also very... oof. Like clearly she needs validation and always wants attention to draw people towards her. She also lies a lot. The bottom line is, CHAOS, just CHAOS. AND IT PISSES ME TF off that I WAS EVER misdiagnosed with that. Luckily it has since been formally changed and I am treated for bipolar and doing great!"
121,Tired of trying,"I've been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Five years ago, I finally went into intense therapy. I've made progress, I've done a lot of work to make the most out of my life, but I keep relapsing in depression and anxiety, even on medication (it only works for a while) . I can't work full time and even part-time feels impossible at this point to keep the job without getting fired or wanting to quit because I get burned out.  I have a hard time accepting good things in my life because I feel like everything can go wrong in a second. My therapist that I can get through this because I am strong, but I don't feel that way. I know life has its bumpy roads, but does it have to a struggle for survival like this? I don't feel like trying anymore if this is the way it's supposed to be."
122,"Wanting advice on possible first break up, please help","Im kind of freaking out right now. My bf and I never really had a perfect relationship. From the very start he told me he wasnt physically attracted to me, and that really hurt me. Later he denied saying that. But I stayed, because I really believed this was my only chance at a relationship. I hadnt dated ever in my whole life and he was literally the first person to ask me out. I was 22. I needed a distraction and he was one. I was and still am working a shitty job and I have a lot of mental issues/problems adulting. Its sounds selfish now but he also was my ride to and from work, and he helped me with some adulting stuff. Im freaking out now because he just told me tonight that he wanted to see other people. I always felt he was looking at other girls and I knew I wasn’t his “type”. But I didn’t think he had a problem with what we had. There were so many times I thought about breaking up with him, but my emotional attachment and reliance on him always made me stay. Im mostly just surprised he could be so cold to me after almost 7 years. He was enough for me. It hurts that Im not enough for him. I just dont know how Im supposed to deal with this right now. Hes also making it as if Im choosing to leave when he doesnt give me much choice. Im not open to an open relationship"
123,Ocd and anxiety fears paranoia,"Morning everyone,

So recently I’ve been very anxious and emotional over my thoughts. Firstly, I’m starting to obsess over different mental health conditions which are causing me extreme anxiety. Examples of this is, schizophrenia, BPD, Bi Polar, paranoia and I feel like I’m starting to obsess very strong that my OCD is loving it and making me feel like I have got these illnesses. Is this a common OCD issue? Just thought I’d ask. Last night I was talking to my parents about a discussion and my mum said something and I automatically thought “is my mum saying that to annoy me or just to be nasty” it wasn’t even anything remotely nasty at all but it just came in as a thought and then I started thinking of all the times before that I can remember times that I have had weird thoughts like “what if my girlfriends parents don’t like me” I hate it but I don’t get them all the time just when I obsess over it and look it up online and ruminating over it and now my ocd makes me think I have these things? Does this sound common? Or is this something that’s going on? I honestly only feel like this when I have my OCD down days but when I don’t think about it my anxiety goes down by I’m stuck in this rut that I can’t get out of it and when I wake up in the morning I get anxious about having these thoughts. Anyone else?
Thanks"
124,Why can I not show affection to my SO and family?,"I (25F) am genuinely curious and kind of confused. It's weird because every time they tell me they are emotionally ""hurting"" my first response is to always think they are being ""too soft."" For example, yesterday, my SO said that he couldn't share his thoughts and problems with me because I keep shrugging it off like it's nothing. 

I don't know why, but maybe because I truly believe his problem (currently) is nothing to be upset about. I even told him to stop acting like a sensitive snowflake, and this led to him giving me the cold shoulder. 

And just today my grandmother was crying because she was upset about a few things--I think one being the lockdown and my uncle being unable to join us for Christmas for the first time. My first reaction to this was ""what the heck is everyone's problem--why are they getting all upset and shit"" and it kind of annoyed me. I know, it sounds shitty, but heck, it was an initial response. What I did to make her feel better was make her favorite vegetable soup, but that was the extent of it.

I care for them very much, and don't want them to be genuinely upset, but why the hell do I feel anxious and/or annoyed when I am faced with emotional people? How can I change this?"
125,How can I get tested for ADHD by a professional?,Especially during coronavirus does anyone know how I could get tested for ADHD by a professional as  I believe I have it but I want to know where I get tested either over phone somehow as I don't want to go to a hospital because of Corona
126,Thoughts on Mental Health page run by a recovering patient?,"I was wondering what the mental health community thinks about a Facebook page about mental health, experiences in therapy, and reflections/thoughts run by a recovering patient.

 There are many mental health pages out there, ranging from unverified and out of context ~psychology~ self care quotes and to the verified and researched based podcasts by licensed psychologists.  I feel like there is a lot of content written by professionals---which is great--- but on the other hand, it's sort of from a detached and impersonal perspective. 

As a recovering patient, I often look back and remember the days I first decided to go to therapy but had no one to ask about it or walk me through the process. I imagine the facebook page to be something like a friend who's been there/done that.

I want to talk about how it's like to be afraid of what your therapist thinks of you, how to ask questions that would make the most out of your session, journaling techniques that worked for me, an open letter to parents and friends explaining how mental illness is like (since in my down days I struggled to express my feelings), etc. 

I'm going to take all measures to say I'm not a licensed therapist and this isn't advice, merely sharing of experiences and will definitely fact check (and let my psych read beforehand) all of my content.

Do you think it would be helpful? Or do we have too much of that already?"
127,"Not spoken to my mum in over 10 years, I need help.","This is my first post on here, apologies if it’s got errors 

Long story short. 
Growing up my mother was in and out of my life. From the ages of 8 - 15 she was around quite regularly and I use to see her every other weekend and in the holidays. 
She struggled with addiction issues her whole life and neglected myself and sister quite badly which resulted in social services getting involved and my dad getting full custody of us.
Boxing Day 2009 when I was 15 years old was the last time I saw her and she rang me New Year’s Day 2010 saying she will sort her life out and be in contact. From there I’ve heard nothing. 
I think about her every single day and mentality wise it has effected me quite badly. 
I recently saw she came up as a recommended friend on Facebook, I’m tempted to message her or make some contact? I’m not sure what it would lead to. 
I don’t like her but I miss her. 
However my dad has done so much for us and I know he would feel let down and upset if I started to make contact with her again. 
So I’ve come on here as I have no idea who I can speak to about it. If anyone can help or give some form of advice I’d love to hear! 
I can give anymore information about the issue if needed.
Thank you x"
128,Trauma/flashbacks of bullying. How to deal?,"I had no one to talk to about my traumatic experiences of being bullied so I can here in hope of sharing my feeling and maybe connecting with people that have had similar experiences. I am a 23 year old woman that’s had the so-called ‘ugly duckling syndrome’: ugly and bullied in early life (elementary school to high school), then blossomed in university. After gaining popularity and good looks, I looked at my past self as a different person, someone so awkward and ugly that was prone to the hostility of others. This kind of thinking reassured myself because since I was no long that person, I would never feel that way ever again. Yet recently I’ve realized that I could never entirely cut away my younger self, and that no matter how ugly or awkward I presumably was, I never deserved to be called names-ugly, fat..., jeered at, having my pictures taken without my consent and shared on the social media for a cruel laugh, having kids do a ‘draw my face as ugly as possible’ contest.... and as all of this dawned on me, years later, I am experiencing fresh, painful flashbacks even though no one has said anything remotely mean to me in years, and I have great people around me. My sense of safety and comfort is being wrecked again as I am thrusted back into the traumatic years, the terrible feeling of people snickering behind your back and taking pictures of you. I feel like I am reliving my every moment.
How do you come to peace with memories of bullying and other painful experiences? Please help me pull through this, please share your courage.)

129,Life on Klonopin,"When I take Klonopin, I feel like myself. I am calm, my mind is clear, I feel good.

130,I feel like the only way I will ever be happy if is I stop caring about people.,"I feel like the only way I will ever be happy is if I stop caring about others.  I have bent over backwards to try and do best by my family, friends, and anyone who needs help. I have been used, played, taken advantage of, ignored and disrespected. Everyone suggests I should be a counselor or social worker because I ""have such a bug heart"". My empathy and emotions enslave me and I am ruining my life by putting myself under the emotional stress of giving a shit. Others around me act annoyed by me and also do not care and I have also been told that I care too much many times. But yet I am the one they call and rely on to be their part time counselor, ignoring the weight of emotional labor and how it has an affect on me. I don't know if it's because I am a female and grew up in a very religious and patriarchal community so I have been taught to put others first, if I am trying to find meaning through others because I think life has no real meaning and we are here by coincidence, or if I am trying to right all the wrongs that have been committed towards me, but I can NOT do it anymore. I am no longer going to work towards making the world a better place, I am going to accept that humans are inherently selfish and for the majority stupid. I am going to try and get back all the wasted time, money, and opportunities I have sacrificed for the good of others. It brings me nothing but hardship and misery to care about others. No one appreciates me, which isn't the point of doing something kind, but man it hearts when people act like you're nothing or judging them by voicing/informing them of actual atrocities. I don't haven't had any social media other than this page for over a year so it's not like I am a keyboard warrior. My family is just full of ""toxic positivity"" and I honestly feel gaslighted and insane for daring to care."
131,Looking for second opinion on wether or not to try changing psychologist,"Hi, 

I finally got my ADHD assessment after waiting over a year about a month ago. First meeting it's me, the psychologist, a doctor and a med student. I was already super stressed since the day I had waited for so long was finally here and now there's also the added pressure of 3 people listening. 

The psychologist wanted me to talk about my life and I had a really hard time even remembering my symptoms and ended up mostly talking about stuff that's probably not closely related to ADHD. He's super judgemental in his tone throughout the assessment but especially when he asks if I was suicidal at a certain time 4 months ago and I can't remember, he laughs and says ""Oh wow I've never heard of that in all my years here, someone who can't remember if they we're suicidal.""


I talked about my life for an hour or so and then they had a 5min talk that got pretty heated (I was sitting outside and could hear raised voices), I get called back in and am told that it's probably not ADHD but that I'm welcome to come back and talk with just him.

I brought up his judgemental tone the next meeting, he got pretty defensive and he explained that it's hard for him not to be judgemental when I say stuff like ""I'm just going to school to have something to do, I'm not really interested in the stuff I'm reading."" He adviced me to quit school but then I will just be doing nothing and I don't see how that's better.


Today we had our sixth meeting and we've basically gotten nowhere (Big part on me because I have a hard time explaining my feelings and problems). I'm not sure if I want to go to my next appointment but I still want help so I guess I'm wondering how far from normal this is and maybe it's just part of the process.

This is probably super confusing I had a hard time putting this to text, sorry about that."

I have felt like have gotten anxiety for like 3+ years, but it’s only been the last 5-6 months that I have begin to cry every night. 

I am crying right now when I’m writing this, a part of me wants my mom to walk on me crying, so I can finally say something. Is this normal? Do others also feel like this? Because I don’t wanna die, but living is a pain in the ass."

On Tuesday it's worse because I can't stop thinking about what could happen and that everything is going so fast, I don't feel ready but I know I have to be. I got this job because I was tired of being home 24/7 and I was feeling so much anxiety, but also work I feel somewhat worse. I don't know what to think or do.

134,What makes you have suicidal ideation?,[removed]
135,I feel like I can no longer tell some my dreams apart from reality,"I’ve been having all sorts of weird dreams lately all of which range from just what I can only describe as “whacky shit” to the most mundane and “life-like” of situations. The problem with these more “life-like” dreams is they often are so realistic and become lodged in my mind that I’ll mistake them for events that actually happened. 

This can be as complex as whole events with friends to even something as simple as what people post of their Instagram story. To use an example from last night, the one of many dreams I had involved seeing something on a friends Instagram story. Don’t remember what it was but I woke up this morning to go look at it only to find it wasn’t there. I was so confused and thought they must have deleted it but came to realize oh wait that was part of a dream. 

Situations like that seem to be happening a lot. It hasn’t drastically effected me in any noticeable way but I’m worried it might and curious as to why this is happening."
136,Should i talk about this with my new therapist? TW SH and suicidal thoughts,"So I decided to change therapists after my last one told me i had suicidal thoughts and used to self harm because I'm a very philosophic person.
I emailed a different therapist for an appointment today.
I was diagnosed with adhd but am scared to ask if i could possibly have anxiety or depression (people with adhd are more likely to have those). I do portray symptoms and used to be really suicidal 1-2 years ago. I stopped self harming this year. But i kind of feel like I'm just being dramatic and that theres actually nothing wrong with me.
Should i talk to them about it?"
137,What's a way to get help if you don't want to tell/ask your parents?,(Self-Explanatory)
138,What is wrong with me,"I have a hard time paying attention, and it's bad. I'm like ""Oh I'm going to do this!"" and then I see something else and think ""oh I'm going to see what that is!"" and since I have a hard time paying attention, my grades are dropping. I also tend to forget things, like let's say there's an assignment due a week from now, I'll say that I'll do it, and then get distracted, forget about it, and panic when it's due the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't really understand social cues because I never really liked talking to people due to the overwhelming anxiety I get whenever I'm around people. My mom thinks it's autism, so does her friends, but I wish they'd understand that it's probably not autism because I've been around autistic kids, and they have completely different mannerisms than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

My self esteem is unstable as it can get. One moment, I can think so highly of myself and think that I'm better than everyone else and the next I think that I look like a chimpanzee. I have feelings of emptiness, along with dissociation.

141,FMLA leave due to anxiety/depression,"Hi all, I have always struggled with generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I’ve been on and off medication for years. If medication works, I have unbearable side effects, or it doesn’t work at all.

Recently I’ve been buckling down on finding a medication or combination of medications that works with help from my new primary doctor. I now work from home and my concentration issues have been horrible. Not to mention constant anxiety and just not wanting to wake up or get up in the morning.

This has all been pretty bearable up until yesterday when my body basically said “that’s enough” and threw me into a depressive episode. I had no more sick days to use at work, but I called off anyways and thankfully got supervisor approved PTO because I told my supervisor about everything that’s going on.

I looked into FMLA leave and short term disability because a depressive episode for me is no joke. If untreated, it can last quite a while.

I made a next day appointment with my doctor and decided to take unpaid time off work for the rest of the week and apply for FMLA for job security (with the go ahead from my doctor and after speaking with HR about my options).

Well, this process also has my anxiety through the roof because if for some reason my claim is not accepted, I’ll be written up at work for my absences.

My doctor made tweaks to my current prescription and added another medication, so hopefully that will help at least get me back to a functional human being.

Has anybody been through this before? What do you do to pull yourself out of a depressive episode? I really need ideas on what to do for the next few days I’m off work to help with my symptoms while I get used to this new medication.

TIA"
142,"Got prescribed Zoloft today for my depression/anxiety, have any of you been prescribed this drug?","
I didn’t even know I had anxiety and depression until my doctor told me I did then I started reading about narcissism and bad parenting and stuff and it all started unraveling. I told my doc I couldn’t sleep and couldn’t breath at times and I got an EKG done on my heart because I thought I had a heart problem but he says it’s panic attacks. So he prescribed Zoloft and said the goal is to only be on it for 6 months and flush the anxiety out like a bad flu. He offered Xanax and I said no. I had two friends overdose and die on Xanax and I’ve heard nightmares about that drug and with my addictive personality I figure my best move was to stay away.  But he says Zoloft is the same deal except instead of taking it when I have a panic attack, I take one every morning to control the anxiety throughout the day which sounded like a good plan to me. I was clear that I didn’t want to feel sedated in any way and that I didn’t want to feel medicated to function but he insists the Zoloft should only take a few months along with my therapy sessions that I start in 2 weeks. Should I be worried about starting Zoloft?"

144,Values and expenses,"I hate work. I have looked to the ends of the earth to find a reason to keep working and I have self diagnosed depression. I’m a high school students a year younger than my classmates and terrible grades. I feel like part of me wants to get better, but the moment I try, everything goes down the drain. By the time whatever it is is finished, I had spent all of my efforts, gotten a bad grade, disappointed the people around me, and learn nothing in return. I have a hard time paying attention and I just unconsciously believe that there’s no point in going to school or working hard. Nobody really cares to learn about me and they use me to get some benefit in some way, but I can’t refuse. There’s no point in working so hard, to slave away at doing the same thing every day. I won’t do it for my future because at this point, I realized that if you work hard, it’ll only get harder. Is it really a bad idea? Why can’t things be simpler?"
145,Looking for a Psychiatric Residential facility for an adult in the US,Hi I am looking for a 30+ day live in facility that takes HMO insurance.

Any help is appreciated.
146,Please advice on this..!, I seem to find BPD(Borderline) is more of what I am. In depth I had research about it alot and found that I have few of its symtoms. I had already booked my 1st appointment with therapist next monday and just want to know that should I share my thoughts and self doubts about BPD with my therapist? Because I m not sure neither I m diagnosed. So I want to avoid a situation where I just say it and my therapist literally considers to give me sessions based for BPD.
147,My problem with apathy,"I have always believed no one really matters. It’s true. The mere fact existence of humanity has caused so much damage to every othe being in the world, but then again, those don’t matter either. I think there’s no point to social law and ethics and rights. Everyone has an opinion, and they will act or not, upon them. Talk about basic human rights seem stupid to me. They have the “right” to do whatever they want. And other people’s ideals might contradict theirs. Conflict resolved these issues and one will emerge victorious. Is that a wierd way to think. Like, someone would choose to rob a bank because it’s easy money, but the law will fight them and put them in jail."

Spring usually kicks back up and I’m motivated and “normal” but I feel like it’s always during this time of year where it’s almost like I give myself a hard time, like I make it hard for myself, it’s my favorite season but for some reason I am either miserable or just not my usual self."
149,I can't stop thinking about killing myself even though I don't want to. Now the thoughts themselves are upsetting me even more than my real problems,"Over the last two weeks I can't stop thinking about killing myself

Every day during mundane tasks my brain just suddenly switches to bad things. When I walk past Tesco I can't help thinking about buying paracetamol and a bottle of wine. Every time I hear a train I think about jumping in front of it. After I talked to my Mum on the phone I think about how it could be the last time we ever talk, and wonder if she would even remember the conversation. Now the thoughts themselves are really upsetting me even more than everything else going on. 

I can't help thinking about how no one would notice. If it wasn't for xmas coming up even my family wouldn't notice for months. No one cares about me in any meaningful way, I don't have friends or strong family connections. The only reason my family even talk to me is to keep up appearances. I'm not complaining about it, it's my fault for not strengthening those connections over the years.

Christmas is going to be really unbearable this year, I know there is going to be a huge argument and as usual I will let everyone down. At first the lockdown was no problem I am really introverted anyway but I have barely talked to anyone for the whole year. I lost my job so all I do now is stay home. I even tried to adopt a rescue dog but my flat wasn't suitable. It hurts to be disconnected from everyone but the good thing is no one is depending on me. I have no kids, no partner, no pets. 

How can I control my thoughts. I feel ashamed even typing this, I know there are people literally starving to death now and I am sitting on my warm bed feeling sorry for myself

I wish I could disappear or run away and have everyone who ever knew me forget I existed"
150,So profoundly sad.,"I don’t know how to even pick myself up off the floor. I’ll try and break down things as simply as possible but here’s the quick story of my life. 
My father didn’t want me because I didn’t want to do all the things he never got to do as a kid and be exactly like him. He was a drunk abusive alcoholic who regularly hurt both my mother and me until they got divorced. He continued to hurt me though as I saw him on the weekends. I begged to not see him but the courts rules in his favor as our religion backed him up. 

My stepfather didn’t want me because I didn’t want to be exactly like him, and he blames me for he and my mother still having to deal with my father as he had visitation on the weekends. He barely acknowledged my existence. 

I was raised in a semi closed community religion that I decided to leave when I was 24 because I was so miserable and scared from my experience. As a result my friends and family all treat me like I am a stranger and only will have business dealing with me. Including my mother.It cost me everything and every one in my life but I was able to finally find a little peace. I don’t really have any very close friends because I have been building relationships slowly because I have severe abandonment issues, because when people learn about my past they always look at and treat me different.  That’s also because I’m good at putting on a front and I’m very good at taking care of business because I’ve had to to survive. So it looks like I have it all together and then when they learn about what I’ve been through it always changes things. 

I didn’t have a girlfriend until I was 30 because I was so emotionally immature from my upbringing and it took years of therapy to value myself even a little. I told my girlfriend my backstory and laid out how I was very early on in the relationship. I don’t want kids, I didn’t celebrate holidays growing up so I don’t have a natural desire to do them. I don’t wanna rush to get married. I strongly support equality and am against racism and homophobia, transphobia etc. I love people and interacting with them. I’m not an overly sexual creature as there are some scars from certain concepts in my upbringing that still weigh on my mind. My mother treated any sex, including between two married consenting adults, like it should be an offense punishable by death. My father was molested as a child and became addicted to porn and was sexually promiscuous after the divorce and I experienced certain things as a result that still haunt me. He also beat me on a regular basis.  I have huge amounts of trauma from what I went through as a kid. 

My girlfriend assured me these things would not be an issue because she loved me so much. Then Her sister got pregnant, and three of her best friends all got engaged within a two month period. She began to shrink back and became reserved. We talked and she admitted that her priorities and wants had changed and that I wasn’t going to be able to deliver those anymore. She wanted kids and to get married soon. Her parents didn’t like my liberal views, and she realized she wanted someone who shared her values on things like holidays. We broke up that day. It was amicable but still heart breaking. Again I felt like I wasn’t enough. 

The very next night I hit a deer on the highway and my car was totaled. I was taken to the hospital and got lucky as I only had bumps and bruises but am looking at a huge hospital bill. Two days later I went into work and was laid off from a fifteen year job due to Covid. 

I have no one to talk to and it’s my own fault for not trusting people enough to let them in. But as soon as I tell people my story they treat and look at me different. I’m just so so sad and I feel completely useless."
151,I'd rather LIVE with depression than SUFFER from depression,"New here.  I suffered from depression for 12 years.  I have lived with depression for 2 years.  What made the difference.  One word.  One four letter word.  HOPE.  It can be so debilitating and lead to what some are calling Psych Ache.  I just want everyone who may feel defeated to know that with the right therapy, action on your part and cultivating hope, you can begin to control your feelings rather than the other way around.  You are not alone.  (for context I host a podcast called The Happy Molecule that deals with positivity, good advice, community and...hope!)"
152,Normal reaction ?,"I’ll attempt to keep it brief , my dad’s recently returned from hospital after staying there for over a month .
He frequently visits hospital ( due to a chronic condition )and in turn I’m frequently home alone  . 
He visits so often that it’s hard to get excited when he returns , that grouped with depressive episodes I experience bode for a pretty underwhelming reaction on his part . 
I end up feeling deeply unsettled / disoriented when he returns but I simply can’t find it in myself to even attempt to be happy , I often find a semblance of normalcy after a few weeks but then he has to leave again resulting in a feeling of numbness ig .

I guess I’m asking if this a normal reaction ?? I dont really have anyone else to ask lol ."
153,What is going on with our mental health system!?!?,"I'm getting tired of this. I had a 45 minute phone call with a therapist and the next appointment he could schedule me was almost 3 weeks out. So I waited the 3 weeks and today, I recieved no phone call from my therapist. So after being on hold for 30 minutes, I finnally got ahold of someone. They said he was running behind schedule but it's now been almost 3 hours and still no phone call...

She told me if he didn't call, I would just have to reschedule. WHAT THE HELL! I wait almost a month for a therapist appointment just to hear that he can't talk with me on our scheduled date and I'll probably have to wait another 2-3 weeks... ridiculous.

I also had a pysch appointment. Talked with her for like 15 minutes. She wanted to wait to prescribe me any stimulants until I took an ADHD test, even though I've been prescribed Concerta in the past and it worked well for me. But I understand why she'd want me to take the test first. But our scheduled appointment again, like the therapist, is like 3 weeks out. WTF. 

How are you suppose to get help for your mental health issues when the system is so broken and you have to wait weeks just to get a little half hour phone call. And then it's like a huge slap in the face when you wait that ammount of time just for them to tell you, ""Oh sorry, we ran behind schedule today. How about you wait another 3 weeks of no help for your mental health."" 

They didn't litterally say that, but that's how it feels."
154,I don't feel like I deserve my lifestyle,"I'm an 18 year old. And often, I don't feel that I deserve many things that are just given to me. Like the food that I eat, I am forced to eat 3 heavy meals a day. I have to eat food even if I don't feel hungry, just to maintain my family's lifestyle. Here I am sitting on a chair with a very full stomach, while some people may as well be praying for more food to feed thier family. What do I do? Is this the imposter syndrome? This feeling applies to many other things too like, owning luxuries ( bear in mind I didn't earn any money to deserve this), having an air conditioner in my room, and so many more. I just feel helpless that someone somewhere needs what I have more than me, and I'm not able to do anything. I understand my father earned all this by working hard, although I want to do the same and not be granted everything. I have a fear of things that are bad which I can't do anything about.. To whoever read this all, thank you. Stay safe"
155,Emotionless,Hi (female age 25) I don’t wanna talk about this to anyone I know personally cause most of them will think I’m crazy or I’m faking it. As I’ve been told about my depression in the past. But this is something a little different then depression I don’t at all feel depressed at the moment but I feel numb all the time (maybe that is a symptom of depression??). I have a hard time feeling emotions towards things that I should have emotions for. I easily can be annoyed or mad or whatever other negative emotions there are out there towards them but I can never feel sympathetic towards the people I once loved most. I just feel myself wanting to just be away from these people because I feel guilty feeling like this.. I’m not sure what I should do:(
156,I can't even afford to breathe at this point.,Being so broke that you can't afford the $20 to pay for your school application is what keeps me up at night low employment in my country keeps me up at night. It's gets really exhausting at times.😭😭
157,"diagnosed with ADD/ADHD at 22, not sure what to do hehe","I've really struggled with depression since I was 17-18 - I'm now 22 and it's just as much of a problem. People tend to like me, but I really struggle to form strong connections. Even my closest friends seem to feel a lot more strongly about me than I do about them, which makes me feel awful. My self-esteem and confidence are horrendous, almost the complete opposite of how I was when I was younger. I don't really try anything new because I'm terrified of failing - this includes properly interacting with new people. Even things I'm genuinely passionate about don't really get much effort, because I can't move beyond a sort of apathy even for them.

I've tried medication + therapy, but I didn't really engage with either, which was my own fault but still meant I got little benefit from them. During the first half of lockdown I really felt like my mental health was improving. I was living with two friends who I got a lot closer to, I started to have a stronger sense of who I am, and I was much more productive with my time. I stopped wasting days playing games or lying in bed, started reading more, exercising, going out more. I was replying to people's messages more &amp; I think I'd outgrown a lot of dumb shit I used to do.

I moved into a new house at the end of summer for the new term of university and it all really went downhill. I've always been pretty into drugs, but since the end of summer they've become a crutch for me in a way that hasn't happened before. I smoke weed a couple times a week at least, and while I never get high alone this just means I look for excuses to go see people and get high. I rarely hang out with people sober - I find it much harder. All the progress I made feels like its gone - I don't exercise, my house is really messy (although that isn't just me), I'm really far behind on my work and my free time is spent messing around with friends or on my computer. I feel more depressed than I think I ever have. I'm not actively suicidal but I've begun to really romanticise death. I really idealise the concept of dying as a martyr for a cause, which I know is unhealthy (as well as pretentious lol).

I recently started going to therapy again, on a private online service. My therapist has told me that it sounds like I could have ADD or ADHD (probably the former). Her reasoning behind this seems pretty sound to me - a lot of my behaviours now make a lot more sense to me, both in the past and now. I'm not really sure why, but I'm really bugging out about this. Getting diagnosed at 22 makes me feel like my life up to this point has been wasted. I'm not really sure if its the sole source of my depression, but I'm pretty certain its one of them. I almost feel like I've missed the life I could have had by finding this so late, as well as by being so depressed during what should be the best time of my life. Sometimes I worry that I've missed everything a 'normal' person would have done during this period, and that that will hamper me for the rest of my life. I feel so distant from my family and friends, and I have no idea how to fix that - I really wish I wasn't.

 Where I live, it takes a couple of months at the least to get an official assessment and therefore medication. That was before the pandemic, and I assume waiting times are longer now as they are with other NHS services. I guess I'm just posting this looking for advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation, especially other people diagnosed with ADD/ADHD as a young adult. I want to make more out of my life, and finally start enjoying it, but the hurdle feels so insurmountable."
158,Covid PSYCHOSIS,"Am I the only fucking person who’s going crazy because of these fucking events? I need help I’m going to kill myself. I need help and support no friends family boyfriend lmfaodkem 
Please tell me you’re going through the same please fucking tell me"
159,How do I handle my extreme reactions to bad grades?,"Ik this sounds pretty dumb but I always get really inflated emotional responses from academic things specifically. I recently got a mediocre grade on a maths test and I was convinced my teacher hated me for weeks. Aswell, I've noticed bouts of depression after not performing well in school and get really nervous going on campus. I know this is a personal issue I need to work on but I have no clue how, or even if this is somewhat normal?"
160,I have 3 diagnoses at 18 and survived a suicide attempt,"I have OCD, Depression and BPD i sttruggle with self harm and i tatted both my sleeves so i can no longer cut myself, my life for the past 2 years have been parties and a lot of drug abuse like xanax promethazine weed lsd and ecstasy, just experimenting on myself see how much i could take and not OD but i ended up overdosing on a mixture of prescriptions and 600mg ecstasy on purpose and survived, i have corrupted my mind entirely and don't know what do, every day i'm playing russian roulette."
161,Random words,I need help. I tend to have random obscene words pop into my head. And I’m scared I might say them out loud. How do I forget about them?
162,what do you do when you start overthinking?,"i’m a really hardcore overthinker. i overthink basically EVERYTHING and it causes so much unbearable distress. is there anything i can do to slow my thoughts down, even just a bit?"
163,Who am I,17(M) I don’t wanna say I had a hard childhood because I know there’s so many that had it worse but growing up wasn’t easy. As a young child at age 4 I had already had the birds and bees talk. I moved around a lot cause we just had a lot of issues anywhere we went and when I went into foster care I stayed with my aunt for a few months. I was about 6 at this time and I had two older cousins and an older brother staying there. In this time I was forced to drink beer and smoke weed and had to witness just a lot of stuff that I wish I didn’t. My cousin who was 11 taught me and my brother how to masturbate and showed us porn. Since then all I ever thought about was sex and it ruined so many good relationships I had. I definitely had a porn addiction ever since I was shown it. This definitely messed me up since I’d masturbate just about every single day multiple times a day sometimes. I had a sexual experience with another boy when I was about 10 as I didn’t know it was wrong but that’s no excuse I still should’ve known. I used to watch my mom get beat to a pulp by her boyfriends. My biological father was never around and he passed away a year ago. I guess I’m just lost. One of my really close friends passed away two months ago he was shot in a drug deal gone wrong. I used to get kicked out of any school I went to because I craved attention and would do bad things to get it like throw desks and chairs and hit people. My brother and sister would always yell at me and say everything’s my fault and they hate me. Sometimes even my mom would seem like she hated me. I’ve always hated my life and when I was 11 or 12 I tried to hang myself but that didn’t work out which I’m now very thankful for. There was just a point in life where it seemed like I had no one and everyone hated me especially since my brother would beat me to a pulp sometimes and he was like my best friend growing up. I’m not sure why I’m making this post I guess I just felt like venting. I often lose myself and don’t know who I am. Especially now just staying inside all day doing school work I think too much and lose focus and just think more. Sometimes I’m not sure why I continue to try. I’ve never had anything to live for and now it’s hitting harder than ever before. My life’s amazing right now too we live in a big house and it’s just me my mom and step dad who’s the best guy ever. I got into a fight with him one time and messed up his eye for a few weeks and that killed me inside because no mans ever given me the love that he has and I treat him and my mom like shit even though they do everything for me. Sometimes I go for a walk and wonder if I should just slice my throat and make everyone happy I feel like such a burden as I’ve never done anything right in my life. No one has to respond to this I just felt like venting I guess. I’m going to keep pushing myself to do better cause I know things will get better. I know this whole post is random and out of order I apologize but thanks for reading it.

165,Antidepressants and weight gain,I was diagnosed with MDD in the fall of 2018. My doctor put me on my first antidepressant (Wellbutrin) and it was not a good fit what so ever. They changed me to my second (Zoloft) shortly after. I’ve noticed since I’ve been on it that I started gaining weight and can’t seem to stop. I also have super bad breakouts and skin issues now. I haven’t changed my diet. I still exercise frequently. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you combat your prescription related weight gain? And tips or tricks for getting this under control?
166,I work at a car parts store and my manager hates me,I asked my manager for next weeks schedule and he told me no and to stay at the store I’m at and I would but I don’t get to choose that. I have to have a ride it’s snowing it’s winter. So I called hr and told him what he said and I’m sure he’s going to hate me more. I’m not sure what to do
167,Girlfriend is diagnosed bipolar and schizoaffective,"My girlfriend went through psychosis about 2 years ago, a few months after we started dating. She was 20 at the time, and pretty much on her own since she was raised by her grandparents who past away. She was in the hospital for 6 weeks and put on Seroquel. It took a long time but she finally recovered and was doing extremely well. But recently, she was stressed balancing her last semester of college and work. There were also other factors such as medical expenses. Anyway, she was not feeling herself and as a precautionary measure checked herself out in the hospital last Tuesday.  Yesterday she was released and they also prescribed her colonopin  but is worse than before she entered the hospital. Loud noises and bright lights were messing with her which is something that is completely new. She also just seems to be very slow, like mentally it’s hard to hold a conversation, and I have to be very careful with how I speak to her since she just doesn’t seem to be all there. This is someone who was offered multiple full rides to colleges and is always the one initiating complex philosophical conversations. Does anyone know what the fuck is going on? Why is she so slow all of a sudden? She didn’t slip into psychosis so wtf is going on? I truly love her and have helped her through this illness but I am just confused on what exactly us happening to her right now. Any insight would be greatly appreciated."
168,Depression or societies standards on a human Brain?,"Vanessa Brown 03/29/2020
     By no means am I psychologist or someone who holds credentials longer then a Chinese scroll, but I am one of the very many who have suffered with depression for as long as I can remember. Clinically speaking, depression is viewed as a mental illness, but it’s much more than that. We all live with depression in the back of our mind it’s called, society. Society has forced these images into our mind of what makes us happy. We have a created a system that’s built upon power and competition- that is sadly to say driven by what the humans find worth in.
    What’s the worth of a picture to you? The likes or capturing moments to hold on to. Is a rich mans soul hold more value then a poor mans wallet? It is almost as if in our genes we are born with a nature to single out those who we find to be different. This causes a restriction on the human brain to find happiness with in ourselves and enjoy the things we love without fear of judgment. This fear that we have drilled into our brains has limited us from reaching our maximum potential leaving us scrambling to find a purpose and deeper meaning in life. 
    For those who are suffering with addiction, they are frowned upon in society. When in fact it has been shown in studies that addiction is caused from being in a poor environment. In the rat park experiment they placed a rat in a box with the option of a normal bowl of water or water that was laced with drugs. The rat would choose the drugs in most cases, but a rat in a box isn’t exactly relatable to the life of a human. 
They then gave the rat some companions and a park for entertainment. The results were outstanding showing almost all of the rats chose to not partake in the drugs. This shows that when providing a nourishing environment a human, or a rat in this case, does not feel the need in finding a source of happiness. As a society we have judged addicts when in fact that’s the last thing they need. They should be receiving more love and provided with a more enriching surroundings."
169,Made an appointment with a psychiatrist,"I can't take it anymore. 
Wish me good luck..
Hope the medication will help me"
170,Not sure if I have a mental illness or just emotionally unstable.,"I’ll just start off with this. I think I have suffered from depression, and I have without a doubt had thoughts of suicide and self harmed, although nothing severe happened. 

Due to some life altering events and a few talks with my dad, and time passing, I felt free. It didn’t feel like there were weights over my shoulders or anything. But recently, that same feeling has come back, and my darkest thoughts of self loathing have re-emerged. 
I think there’s nothing wrong with me, and that I’m just faking it or being a scumbag. The problem is I don’t plan on behaving in this way, and I act on emotion. I get upset, and just complain about myself and wonder how the hell do people put up with me. It doesn’t help that I’m dramatic about it either. Whenever I feel this way, I practically talk down and degrade myself and I like to think I deserve to suffer, although I tell others they don’t deserve what’s happening to them. 

If anything, the most likely circumstance is I might not even have any sort of mental illness and I’m just getting highly emotional, especially since I’ve been very inconsistent on an emotional level. From what I know, most mental illnesses are in a way consistent, and from how everything’s looking, I’m probably just overly emotional.

Just wanted to let that out. Take care."
171,Just head about a crime that made me want to commit self isolation,"I'm not suicidal first of all but i want to move away to a country where you don't get 20 hours house arrest for killing another human. 

I head on the news that two young men my age (19) got tortured for 9 hours at a graveyard in broad daylight by two others young men one over 20 and one under 20. One of the boys got raped while both where cut with knifes and showels as well as kicked and sufficated with dirt.

I am so descusted and distrot that these kind of people exist in my country and that they get to go free  despite doing these kind of things. I were already nere losing my mind over the posebility of being herast or attacked by someone because they want to be famous for something (some bs ticktock seleb that killed a man for clout). 

I usally listen to what ever true crime thing i can find on the youtubes but hearing this on the news near me makes me want to puke. To be frank, I think, if i get into a situation where i get mugged or worse. I might kill that person, quickly, just because i don't want to be killed myself, or worse like these young men."
172,Is it normal?,"I came to a new place a month ago and I was trying to blend in with the other people here but I just felt bad most of the time cause I felt like things were too shallow, surface level conversation, and I couldn't bring myself to talk more.
Yesterday I wanted to try being alone, stay In my room most day, and I feel great, I felt more lonely when I was around all the people but now that I'm alone most of the time except the necessary parts I have to be at.

Is it normal to feel better while being lonely?
I do want friends, it's not like I'm anti friendly. But just staying in my room brings me more happiness, I watch anime and do my things.

Not sure if I'm right but all around me people say it's bad being alone, is it really that bad?

If you need further information about my situation tell me I'll be glad to help you help me."
173,"my parents think i'm ""better"" ever since ive become suicidal","I have been raped and am battling ptsd and insomnia with severe nightmares and sleep terrors. 
This all became diagnosable when i moved for university. I had a few suicidal moments before they started to accept that i was really in need of help. I flew back with their promise to help me get the help i was receiving abroad. 

it never happened, and every time I brought it up, I was starting a debate about whether psychological treatment is needed for my abnormal behaviours. They called me bipolar and said they do not trust doctors to help with ptsd. I'm in a country with stigma against rape and mental health. I never would have come back if I knew they would do the same to their own daughter.
I have never felt so alone next to the people i love more than myself.
I have decided to end my life, and heartbreakingly, they seem to think im all better now. 

I never pictured my end to be this bitter and sad, and now it's really hitting me that all my years amount to nothing positive. Nothing feels right anymore."
174,I have never felt worst in my life,"I (M21) have never really had any mental health problems. I have felt sad very few times in my life and when it happened I would just power through it. I live in Italy and my region is basically on lockdown. This time it hit me very much harder than the first time in March. Back then I just saw the lockdown as an opportunity to have more time to study, and that's what I did, but now I can't seem to find any motivation. For the past few days I have felt so empty that the will to study has just gone away, I also tried forcing myself into it but it didn't work (it has worked many times previuosly). I have also been crying basically on the daily, which I know isn't strange for many people but it is for me since I cry very rarely and always for something actually happening. I don't know how to explain it but it is strange for me to do it. I just want all this to be over, I want my life back.

My situation is probably much less serious than what many people in this subreddit are living.. but I just can't stand it anymore. I feel so bad for so little and this makes me feel even worse. Sorry for the bad english and formating I just wrote this in one go."
175,Should I be nervous,"I think I have attention deficit disorder but I’m not super hyperactive, I’m 23F and have an appointment to get my mental health reassessed in two weeks.

I’m nervous that I won’t be diagnosed and treated for adhd right away even though I’m pretty sure that’s what I have.

I just want to be able to function and emotionally and with my daily tasks I’m struggling a lot. I’m a young adult and just want to be able to keep on top of things in my life. Especially with covid things are kind of falling apart. I had to wait a month for this meeting with the psychiatrist and I’ve been on and off in therapy since I was 7.
I’m kinda worried I won’t receive the proper help or medication I need to function. I’m kinda excited to hopefully see someone for it but also nervous that things won’t work out well."
176,Deleting (most) social media,"I'm going into my second week of no social media.

I've deleted Facebook, Instagram, twitter everything.
and I feel SO much better.

My anxiety has lessened, I'm not constantly checking my phone, I have not thought once about where I am and comparing myself to where I should be.

I redownloaded Facebook for 5 minutes to try and find a picture on a family's page and my anxiety PEAKED. I literally could feel it washing over me I could not wait to delete the app again.

Take this as some inspiration for anyone feeling anxious, I started off seeing if I don't go on it for a week I'll ""treat"" myself to an hour or two at the end of the week.

Take care and stay safe to all of you struggling, especially during everything that's going on in the world x"
177,Is mental health an excuse to be mean?,"So I have this friend who for the sake of this story I will call her Ellie (not her real name). I have known her for years and we grew up together along with some other close friends. Having know her for years I know her life is really hard and she has some family issues causing her to have what she calls “server depression” (As far as she tell me she’s diagnosed with it). Ellie constantly gets mad at us for the smallest things like planning something that’s on a day that doesn’t work for her schedule or if we even slightly raise our voices at her even when we are just joking she just goes off at us saying how we don’t care about her and we aren’t her real friends. I know for a fact we all care about her, I always try to reach out to her and I’ve even stayed up all night waiting for her to answer me and potentially call the police because she put something rather triggering on her social media (turns out she was at dance practice and that’s why she wouldn’t answer), she didn’t even seem to care that she freaked all of us out by doing that. She seems to blame me and my friends for everything then when we try confronting her it’s back to the “it’s my depression and I’m sorry” stuff. I have a panic disorder and her doing this kind of stuff and worrying all of us really puts a strain on me, I like to keep to myself so I’ve never told her this but still. Anytime she is ever mean (she can get REALLY mean) she just blames her mental illness as if nothing is her fault, not even a little. I’m not saying that her depression isn’t valid because it is but it’s her reason for literally EVERYTHING she does.I’m really lost at what I should do about her because she freaks everyone out when she acts the way she does. I still care about her but is it really just her depression that is making her act out or is it just the way she is? Sorry if this makes no sense I’m just glad to get it out of my system."
178,Dad's meds screwed and got into a fight at home,"my dad is on some meds for his mental health and got covid which led to pneumonia, they gave him some steroids and other drugs to help. Even since then he's been very aggressive and only will let himself talk and tells you to shut up. He got upset yesterday when I tried to answer his question and then today He told me I needed to clear my room for new windows and when I tried to explain hoe I was to do that he would let me talk and raised his hand to hit me. He says a bunch of shitty thing about me and about i'm a shitty child and how he wants me gone, then says gets upset when I get upset and tries to hid me but I block his punch and hit him back. I back away from him and he continues to yell and says things about me and then tries to hit me again which he does and then I hit him back. He proceeds to grab a chair but decides not to throw it and instead kick me, I stop most of the kick and then he hits me in the head. I back off and he go off to his room continuing to yell at me and then I tell him I could call cps, which leads to an argument and him getting in my face begging and taunting me to call cps because he knows I wont and never have. Now im in a room breaking-down, he's left the house and im fucking scared. Idk what to do and I'm very tempted to kill myself or start cutting. I need help what do I do. I don't trust calling my grandparents because he always talks to his parents when he has an issue at home. I was just beginning to feel safe and normal at home and start to repair our relationship after several month of him being on the meds, idk what to do now"
179,Recovery is weird,"I've been pretty mentally ill my entire life. After the worst depressive episode of my life last year, I'm currently in the best state I ever have been. People have always told me ""it gets better"", and I'm glad to see that it actually does, but no one told me how strange recovery is. Does anyone else experience this?

I don't think I've ever felt normal emotions before. When I was sad it would last weeks, if I stressed I'd have anxiety attacks, if I was angry I was this unbearable demon that would black out with rage, if I was happy, it didn't last long.

My new default state is content, and I think from before it would've been my version of happy. I never thought I could be that satisfied with just being alive. I hadn't ever felt that constantly happy even in some of the biggest highlights of my life. 

Now whenever I get sad, I kinda sit there and wait for my depression to overtake me. Sometimes I'll even ruminate and make myself cry because I think ""It's happening again."" And then it never does. It hasn't for a year now. I do the same thing when I'm stressed or angry. I don't know how to be properly angry. I've never been just mad before. It's always been rage. 

I've tried explaining it to my therapist but she doesn't think it's a big deal. I don't think it's a big deal either, but sometimes I just sit and think about it, like right now, and wish I had a guide or something to finally being ""normal""."
180,OCD and tricky intrusive thoughts,"So I suffer from OCD and experience intrusive thoughts. I’ve been ignoring them and letting them come and go. There are two things I’m concerned about however...

1) Do I have the tolerance to keep ignoring them long term

2) What should I do if they become intense and I don’t have the ability to think about anything else 

Most people don’t understand the second dilemma as far as not being able to think about something else. It makes me feel so alone. I wish there was something I can do about it but I just don’t have the ability to think about something else. I actually tried and I can’t. It’s frustrating that no one understands either. Just my thoughts on the second one. Any advice helps. Thanks."
181,"My gf has mental health issues and were out of time and money, she keeps begging me to let her die","My gf has severe anxiety and depression she has been unable to work since late July. She was unable to get help for awhile because she's an immigrant but we finally managed to find a charity and get an official diagnosis plus a doctors letter. The problem is that her works insurance keeps saying the doctors wrong and rejected std application. The person she talks to keeps saying that she should be better by now and there's nothing stopping her from working. They're now saying she should be coming in and working.  We don't know what to do her anxiety is getting worse and she's spiraling. We live in Canada ON so if anyone knows anything that can help let me know please.
UPDATE shes saying she gives up that she wants to die. She's begging me to let her die.
UPDATE She tried to take a knife into the shower which I took after I heard her trying to lock the door(the lock is shit)
And I've now hidden all the sharp objects in the apartment which she keeps looking for"
182,Weird beeping noise?????,I just started hearing a random beeping noise. Not like “beep beep” but “beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep”. And I don’t know if something is just wrong with me or not or if I’m staring at a screen for too long or if it’s actually coming from my phone or my MacBook why am I making this post lol I’m stupid
183,How do I help my significant other?,"My(20) significant other(22) is showing signs of depression and I want to help. I go to therapy for my own personal problems and even though our situations are very different, it's something that we've discussed.

They talked about starting therapy once the next semester starts (our university provides free but very good therapy services) but I'm worried about the two months of winter break we have especially since they will be going home and I cannot visit them as frequently because of COVID.

I don't want to diagnose but I'm like 90% sure it's depression mixed with stress. I'm worried about them and I want to help them in any way possible. 

What is the best way to go about that, without coming off as overbearing or pushy? Any tips would be really appreciated."
184,"Having some thoughts, tldr: vent post about my life and less than optimal living arangements","Let me preface this with, im not going to kill myself. However the thoughts are there constantly. Like i just found myself wondering what time of year has the lowest concentration of holidays that i could bite it in so as not to spoil too many days for my friends and family close together. 
 Ok so im just gonna spill here a bit, im in a mental health program that is based on reintegration into the community via therapy, counseling, and medication compliance. As part of the program you have a roommate, ill call him k. Now k, being in this program as well has his own mental health problems which for sure contribute to his behavior. Without getting into specifics he has problems with paranoia and delusions. I used to feel bad for the guy but his constant disrespect and disregard for everyone around him makes life really difficult. I have ptsd, severe depression, anxiety disorders and bpd so management of emotion isnt exactly my strong suit. Me and him dont get along at all because of one of several of his delusions concerning me, which results in him screaming, slamming doors, and general spiteful behavior towards me. Now before i got here i hadnt lived in a house in quite some time and my house training was a bit lacking, especially in the locking doors front(which is a major problem for him due to his paranoia) and that started the issues. As of now though ive gotten up to speed with all the little idiosyncracies hes got and generally gotten back to indoors mode. Are there things i could do better? Absolutely, and i try to do better every day with my life. But literally all i have to do to set him off is being outside of my room at the same time as he is. It reminds me of being a kid and trying my hardest not to make noise at my moms house so she wouldnt notice me and direct her drunken rage at me, which makes my life rather unenjoyable. 
 I have case workers who check in on me and stuff to get general progress reports who seem to be pleased with my ability to function given the circumstances. However where they fall short is their ability to manage this situation. I have my part in it and have been holding up my end by staying sober, taking my meds and enthusiastically/honestly participating in therapy. Im currently not in a stable enough mental condition to be employed though and thats what half of the therapy is focused on(in case people were wondering why i dont just leave if im so unhappy). They want me to complete a 4 month treatment cycle before im recommended for a job working for the hospital associated with this program which is honestly smart given my track record. 
 My main point here is that every day i spend a significant portion of it wishing this would all just end somehow but i know it wont without some kind of major action on all involveds part. Im making genuine progress in my life for the first time in over a decade and im not belittling that fact, i just feel like things are going to be this way forever because every situation i land myself in turns out this way in some form or another. The common factor is me so i cant escape the thought that its all my fault even though im doing my best to make my life better every day. I have friends and family that are supportive again now that im making an effort to get my life on track and i feel ungrateful because it just doesnt feel like its enough for me to continue most of the time. I dont want to completely be honest about these feelings with my case workers anymore because even after ive gotten recorded evidence of my roommate threatening me amd telling me to kill myself they still drag their feet and tell me to make the best of it. 
 Maybe i wanted some sympathy, maybe i just wanted to get this off my chest, or maybe i just want someone to tell me its all going to be worth it in the end. Im not exactly sure where i land on that spectrum but here it is. To those of you who have stuck through me complaining about my life this long i appreciate it, thank you for listening to me. And please if you dont have something nice or at the very least constructive to say keep it to yourself, im going through a lot at the moment and dont need anymore negativity than whats already bouncing around the corners of my brain."
185,Afraid of medication,Hello everyone. I was diagnosed with gad some years ago. I tried to deal with it through some kind of therapy or alone but things become harder and harder. I have found that keeping my mind occupied through programming reading etc does help for some time but nothing that lasts. I have mentioned to my family and gf about going to a psychiatrist and getting medication but they are opposed to it. They are afraid of the implications or the case of becoming addicted to them. Tbh I am too. But I have to do something cause I can't stand my self anymore. Anyone else here with gad? How do you cope with it?
186,I'm so insanely lazy and I don't know how to fix it,"I'm an 18 year old kid that just started university, and so far it's been a total disaster. 
It started off, and everything went wrong almost immediately. I didn't have my books yet and because of that I couldn't follow classes. When they finally arrived I was already two weeks behind, so I had my work cut out for me. Instead of working hard though, I slacked off. Everyday I spent at most 2 hours studying, though 1 hour is probably closer to the average. Eventually I decided this wasn't working, so I decided to hit up my friend for some ritalin. Snorting that worked for a while, but eventually I became so depressed I had to stop. 
I finished the semester by failing two of my three exams, and promised myself next semester would be different.

Next semester rolls around, and it goes well for the first week. That weekend I decided to get drunk though, and the hangover prevented me from working that weekend, and it all snowballed from there.

Now I'm sitting here, waking up everyday knowing I need to work, and just not doing it. Every night I promise myself tomorrow will be different and that I'll get some stuff done, but so far those promises haven't amounted to anything. I'm not gonna pass a single exam this semester, that much is for certain, and it's making me incredibly depressed. Previously I'd be able to say ""at least I tried"", but I know I'm not trying, and it's honestly killing me. The only times I have fun are with friends, who I only see at parties because of corona. Other than that my life is an empty mess and I know it's my own fault. 

I spend all my time on my phone and don't go outside, even though I keep telling myself that I'm going to. Other than that my life consists of smoking and drinking with friends because I don't really see them outside of parties.

Has anyone gone through something like this? If so, please tell me how you got through it. If things continue like this I don't  know if this life is really something I want.

187,IDK what to do,"My psych wont prescribe me stimulants for ADHD because he believes I am bipolar and have manic episodes. The thing is I have never had a manic episode and I am pretty sure I am not bipolar. The crazy thing is is that a barely talk to the psych and he is not the type to talk to you longer than needed to refill prescriptions. I assume he believes this because I had racing thoughts when taking an antidepressant. I never was deluded and I dont think seeing objects in the dark and picturing them as something else counts as hallucinations (like seeing clothes on your chair in the dark and it looks like a person). I am pretty sure it was all just anxiety and insomnia.

This shocked my therapist too since I have never talked or seemed manic. I do have mood swings but its mostly just being depressed to feeling content. I plan to talk with my psych but he is an inflexible person so I am preparing to find another psych. But I want to keep the therapist I have now but Im not sure if I can get therapy from one center and prescribed meds from another since each have their own therapists and psych. So I am in a tough situation. Hopefully he prescribes it because I have tried all the non stimulant meds for ADHD. Wellbutrin has helped me the most and I want to pair it with adderall because I still lack focus and motivation. 

It feels like I am so close to being a fully functional person but my doctor is gatekeeping."
188,Just wanna chat with someone here,"I wanna chat with someone here if possible, just a friendly conversation. Someone to talk to please. That’s all"
189,Breakdown episode for two straight days cause of college,"I’m already near the end of my first semester in college and I suddenly started overthinking so much about my gpa and my future. In those 2 days of not working on upcoming assignments. I suddenly broke apart and I feared for the worst for my gpa just because of a program I’m in that I have to maintain a certain gpa. I started vomiting everytime I went through an exam and did an essay. I don’t know what to do and if I should extend my time in community college to not over pressure myself to keep high grades with over 4 classes. I planned to transfer out of community college in 2022, but I don’t think my mental health and my health in general will be okay. I also wanna transfer on 2022 cause I don’t want to waste my opportunity of having free payed years. I feel so burnt out from that first semester and become so anxious of my studies that it lead me to lose over 10 pounds. Hope to hear from someone soon!"
190,"Cant bring myself to do anything, even if my future depends on it.","As the title, for the last couple of momths i just cant bring myself to do anything for myself. Id rather hide in bed or read than face reality. Its scarring me and k dont know what to do. Its becoming an issue and i cant seem to care. Nothing matters much anymore. How can i get out if this?"
191,I made a poem,"&amp;#x200B;

**--- Progression ---**

*''As i delve deeper into the tunnel the light behind me closes shut, i've chosen a one-way route. The light ahead grows dimmer and dimmer day by day, it all seems hopeless. I'm cold, the pipes on the wall frozen as the tears stopped dripping months ago, the sent of iron is strong in the air even days after i dropped the razors by the rails. The air grows lighter, my shoulders feeling as if they're empty like a day once long ago. Red turns to pink and pink to faded as the bright light shines as if i'm walking trough the gates of God's kingom. Yet i'm not, i emerge out on the other end. As i see the sun shinineing down on me, the warmth rushing trough my body as a smile emrges across my face, followed closly by tears. But not evil tears, these are meerly tears of joy. The long journey is over, as i stand on my own to feet with no weights on bearing on my shoulders. The air rich, and the sky clear and bright. My journey and battle is over, as i emerge victorious.''*"
192,better reminders/alarms,"Besides phone alarms/reminders. Is there a better way to create a reminder for someone who has trouble remembering to eat/drink or take meds? I was thinking like a bracelet with 4 led lights. They all turn on in the morning and as each activity is done (eat lunch, take morning dosage, etc.) you turn off the light and so if you forget you did something, you can tell by the LEDs. There might be totally different things that accomplish similar goals, this is just what I came up with.

I have no knowledge on whether such a thing would be a good idea or if the person should be asking their healthcare provider. But I'd like to get it in any case as  it seems like it would at least provide some motivation."
193,Anyone have a way I could email a professional about symptoms of depression to partially verify?,"I understand that it cannot stand in for an actual screening. I just really don’t wanna ask my parents to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist or something cause I’m not comfortable telling them yet. I just want to have some verification first, even if it’s incomplete. Just to ease my mind a little. Please."
194,This semester I dropped out of college for the third time. I’ve tried meds and many therapists. At this point I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.,"How do you handle the absurdity of life? How do you make decisions and move forward in the face of this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hey everyone. I’m a 25yo guy who has dealt with existential dread for about 6 years now. I’m not sure if this is the exact place to post this but there are many existential concerns I have that play a role in my lack of progress. I have dealt with social/general anxiety for as long as I can remember and severe depression for at least 6 years. Between multiple medications and many therapists, self help books, TedTalks, philosophy readings, you name it... I am still in the same place I was when all of this really started.

I’m sick of it. I am so tired of being tired and of being lost and confused and anxious and worried and simply overwhelmed with existence. I know the world has beauty and good, it isn’t all sunshine and rainbows but there is an opportunity for a good well-lived life. But my depression, anxiety, and existential confusion has skewed my perspective towards negative thinking. At this point I don’t know what to do or where to turn because nothing has stuck. I’ve continued to end up right where I started despite trying different things and taking chances. It’s extremely difficult to move forward when doing mostly anything can be considered getting out of my comfort zone.

And I haven’t even discussed the existential doubts that have permeated my life. To be completely honest I don’t know who I am at my core - what I want from life, what I stand for, what I believe. I am simply coasting on sheer spite against death. I want to live. And I haven’t, I haven’t been able to. My existence, a brief flash of consciousness between eternal darkness, is (I think) the only opportunity I have at life. And I have the ability to choose, to determine what has meaning to me, to say this is what I believe THIS IS WHO I AM. However, I have no idea what to choose or what matters to me. In the face of this terrifyingly liberating idea I am frozen with fear. I’m aware my indecision will not get me anywhere other than what life decides for me, but I have no confidence in choosing anything else. I don’t feel knowledgable enough to say to anyone “I believe this and you should too.” “I stand for this and here’s why.” Because the only thing I know is that I don’t know anything. This goes for everything: which political policies work best, which form of education works best, what time I should sleep and get up to start my days, any of it... and that’s not a joke. I don’t know.

I understand this is overthinking matters. I have to “let go a bit” and “trust myself” and yada yada yada. That doesn’t answer anything. That doesn’t get me anywhere. I feel completely lost and I’m tired of hearing cliches. I can’t handle anymore “Nobody really knows what they’re doing. We’re all figuring it out. You’ll be okay.” They don’t know what they’re doing and that’s the elephant in the room! That’s the thing I’m trying to say! Why are they giving me advice when they don’t know what I’m going through and don’t know what they’re doing anyways? I can’t give any advice to anyone right now because I don’t know what they’re feeling or what they’re experiencing despite my best attempts to put myself in their shoes.

The most frustrating thing has been my inability to make decisions because I don’t see anything to be better than another (to a degree of course). I have to decide where to work, where to move to next when my lease is up, and so many other things I feel completely incapable of deciding on because I have no solid foundation to build my life on.

I don’t know.. that was just ranting at this point. But please, if anyone can message me or talk to me or offer some kind words I’d really appreciate it. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m so sick of it. I just want to live a good life and make the world a better place and be a good person but I don’t know what that “good” looks like whatsoever."
195,i’m constantly tired,"idk if it’s linked to my mental health or not but i think it might be and i’m literally always tired. from the moment i wake up to when i go to sleep it’s constant tiredness and my grades are dropping cause of it. 

what do i do?"
196,I am having a lot of trouble with online friendships,"Over the quarantine I’ve made a few online friends. However, I’m really busy with life now and I don’t want to go on my phone. It causes me a lot of anxiety and wastes my time. I feel kind of attached to it though because my friends will obviously get upset if I ignore them. 

Also, the closer I get to them the more scared I become. We have shared a lot of personal information and exchanged social medias so I can’t exactly remove them from my life. I regret sharing a lot of this personal information, it gives me more anxiety. Also, there is one friend in particular who I find a bit creepy and it may be impacting my mental health. At this point I want to delete all of my social media and go back to my normal life but I can’t exactly just ghost them . I really need advice because this is giving me a lot of anxiety."
197,How to approach parents who don’t take mental health seriously about therapy?,"I want to preface this by saying that my parents are wonderful; they just don’t understand teenage mental health and therefore don’t see it as a serious enough issue to go see professionals for it. Ive been noticing harsher and harsher intrusive thoughts and that I break down over the tiniest things. It’s gotten so much worse over the pandemic, and I really need help. I don’t know how to approach them because I don’t want them to shut me down. Any advice?"
198,tw! SH,how do i cover up sh cuts? i have ones from last night and it’s hot in my house so i can’t wear a sweater 24/7
199,Need help,"Alright so I can’t hold it in anymore i feel super depressed, this lockdown is messing with my mental health, my girlfriend takes a long time to reply even though she’s active on different social medias and i know that might be a daft thing to say and i might just be making a big deal out of it but the small things turn big especially since I’m depressed, all the wrong things pop into my mind straight away, i have like 2 real friends who rarely talk to me but when they do i know they’re real, all i do is sit at home all day and go to college 2 days a week, and I’m bored, don’t have the motivation to do anything i just want to see my girl again man i hate this lockdown 😔"
200,i am overwhelmed by loneliness,"i’m 20m in college and i need help. it’s exhausting getting out of bed in the morning. i don’t have any motivation but i’m too anxious to do anything about it. my ex boyfriend was the only person i felt comfortable talking to. i’ve been single for over a year so everything is bottling up inside of me. i feel so incredibly alone i just want someone to tell me everything will be okay. i feel overwhelmed and i want to cry. i’m scared i am going to self harm again. i am almost a year clean and i feel strong in my ability to distract myself but it’s constantly on my mind. i don’t know how to help myself bc i can’t afford therapy.  i feel so defeated.

someone please let me know i’m not alone. i’m terrified that i’m just typing to the void rn.
idk what to do. i’m desperate for someone to say hi"
201,So I go for walks and talk to myself to untangle my mind sometimes. Heres a summary of what I talked about (I also posted this in r/bpd but realised it wasn't a bpd specific thing),"●Everytime I go to a doctor I expect to leave with a body cast, and instead I get handed a plaster (bandaid).
 
●I have lived my life collecting wounds that never got the attention they needed, and it was only when I looked down and saw them that they started to hurt. When you get injured, it usually takes a second for you to notice. The adrenaline kicks in and you carry on with your life. The task at hand takes priority. Mental health works in the same way except the shock can last much longer. 

● There are wounds in places I can't see. I can feel the pain but cannot explain exactly where it is or when I was injured. I can pinpoint the vague location but not the exact one. I can pinpoint a timeframe but not an event.

● Sometimes I will get frustrated at the pain and attempt to close the wound and instead open one or many others. 

● These wounds needed medical attention when they were made, I do not feel as though that happened. So now I am left to deal with a scab that shouldve healed over by now as well as the many others I have collected since. 

● I know I need to address the pain, but I can only do so for so long. Eventually I have to lift my head and distract myself to subside the pain. 

● It hurts to see people running up and down flights of stairs when I am left to crawl over a single step. It hurts to see people doing what I cannot. 

● I had to break up with my girlfriend. There were requirements she had to meet to ensure I wouldn't be in pain, but there were too many. She's human and makes errors. I was not flexible. I couldn't afford to rip open because of one simple mistake. Even if she abides by every rule, they were made by me and I too I flawed. I was breaking and as much as I loved her, I needed to relieve the pressure. It wasn't a risk I could afford to take.

● I feel abandoned. Forgotten about. I wasnt cared for when I needed it. People saw one problem and babied me, undermined the issue, pointed to their own injury and said they understood, but either couldn't or wouldn't fix the issue. I am resentful towards that fact. It has saddened me. I was let down.

● When people point to their own wounds and say they understand, it can sometimes be comforting. Especially when it is a new one that I've only just realised existed. But when they do it for the older ones it is less comforting. I know that they will get the care they need sooner than I, if not they will treat themselves. I don't know how to do that. I was never taught. The comfort I do receive is short lived. It lasts until the moment I look down and see that the wound hasn't closed.

● I don't trust the people I need to. I don't trust that they will keep me from hurting as I heal. I am fearful that they will cause more pain than I can deal with. 

● I get this urge to show every wound at once and get it over with as soon as possible, but I've come to realise that that's not how it works. Each wound needs to be looked at individually, and will probably get worse before it gets better. This has also been holding me back due to the sheer amount of injuries I have obtained. I am not prepared for that level of pain. If it is possible to ignore it, I will. 


*these are all metaphors. It was the easiest way to simplify a complex situation"
202,Twisted mind,"My mind feels fucked, like intrusive thoughts and desires and I think of really fucked up things all the time I just want it to stop"
203,How did I get here?,"I'm lost. I keep making the same mistakes over and over and over, I feel like nothing ever changes im so lonely and I'm a disappointment to everyone around me I don't know what I want to do with my life and I feel like I'm slowly going insane. How do I make this cycle stop? I'm scared."
204,Laughing really hard often leads me to feeling sad and crying,"This has happened to me multiple times, but I’ll use an example from the other day. My partner made me laugh really really hard about something. The type of laughter where I was wheezing and out of breath. I laughed so hard I cried. But once those tears of laughter formed a wave of sadness swept over me and I began to weep like someone just told me awful news. The feeling usually goes away quick and I can carry on the rest of my day without feeling depressed or sad. 


There have also been times where I was laughing hard, but without the tears of joy, and I still felt the sadness and tears coming because of my laughter.


Is there a cause for this? It’s really frustrating when I’m sharing a laugh with someone and then it just turns to waterworks."
205,I feel like I'm on an unending dark path,"everyday I feel numb, im dating a girl but i don't feel i love her, i have barely have emotions towards anything meaningful. my thoughts are also different from what i do, i live a fake life half the time. im not asking for help im just throwing my thoughts out in the void where no one will hear them."
206,I[19F] need help with anxiety and a lot of health stuff,"
Are there natural ssri options that work with vyvance

Vyvance makes me an insane hypochondriac, have more anxiety (but I cope with anxiety by hair pulling/putting my face in my phone/ maladaptive day dreaming/ obsessive thinking), experience depression, and I have tics (but I had these before). I also had selective mutism as a baby and social anxiety now. I’ve always had a lot of self doubt and feel like I’d be healthier if I could get to an average level of confidence and have a clear, non anxious mind and be a little less hard on myself.

I feel like an ssri would be amazing for me but I reallyyy don’t want to add another serious medication. I feel like I need this though. I think anxiety/depression/ocd/adhd all run on my moms side of the family. Although I’m not similar to her luckily, she is a narcissist- and I can’t help but think this must have stemmed from the fact that she’s never put any treatment into her mental health but thinks she has so her emotions are out of control and I’m sure she experience cognitive dissonance. 

The risk of an ssri are scary to me and I’d really rather just be on vyvance. I feel like my anxiety is stopping me from my life because I always try to push through it and cope unhealthily or it just stops me from doing things. That’s why I feel like I need real treatment for it since I know an anxiety gummies probably won’t make much of an impact- but I also don’t want to be on an ssri"

209,Why don’t employers care about mental health?, I have a three years rule. After about three years I have to quit my jobs because my coworkers passive aggressively harass me which triggers my complex PTSD ( which was caused by severe bullying in the first place) and workplaces management routinely absolutely refuses to accommodate me. I’ve been told to “take an Ativan and get over myself” as if doctors even prescribe Ativan long term.I’m just expected to just put up and shut up. I am routinely a target for bullying and I don’t know why. I just don’t understand why employers simply don’t give a damn about their employees mental health.
210,I’ve got a confession that I didn’t even want to admit to myself. But it’s time !,"My entire life I have known that I am bisexual. I tried to fight it and be a hardcore boyband fanatic , it was like “look I love one direction I can’t possibly be gay! , nope not me !, totally straight! “ . I had never dated anyone until I was 19 because I was to busy trying to confront the lesbian thoughts and convincing everyone “I am totally straight I promise !“.

When I was 19 I went on a date with a guy . I was determined to show the world and myself “I’m not gay ! “ . Well , to say it went badly was an understatement. He was a repulsive guy and I just couldn’t . That put me off dating all together . About a year ago I finally just gave up . I admitted to myself, I am in fact bisexual. When I stopped forcing it away and resisting and finally let it into my heart that I was in fact bisexual I felt so liberated .

A bit of time went by and I decided to join a dating website . I didn’t hold out much hope , I was basically on there to see what the dating scene was like . About three months ago I met a guy on the website. At first I was hesitant because I am much more sexually attracted to women than I am to men . But I thought that even if nothing romantic happened I could at least make a friend . Things are going really well and we talk every day and every night . We are really close . Yesterday he said the dreaded three words “I love you “. 

You are probably thinking “why is this a problem ?” . I knew we where getting close and having a laugh and being romantic, but when he said those words my heart hurt . And I came to a conclusion . A confession I want to make but I am terrified to admit . “I am afraid of male love “ . I’ve tried to get close to guys before but I can’t do it . The first man I ever loved with all my heart was my dad and he pulled my heart out , shat on it and put it back in (not literally) so now I am absolutely terrified to love a man . All I can remember was my hero packing his bags and driving away . I still think about it .

I try and try but I just can’t fall in love because men scare me . I know they are not all the same but I’m scared . You are probably thinking “why are you telling Reddit this ?” I just wanted to say it , I wanted to admit it , I wanted to get it off my chest and I don’t feel I can tell anyone in real life 

Thanks for listening"
211,I'm lost.,"This is actually a long post, didn't expect it to be this long... good luck reading I guess. If you have any suggestions please share them. Also if anything stated is unclear I am willing to clarify things. It might read a bit messy, so please forgive me for that. 
To start off with a few disclaimers: first off, English is not my first language, so please don't mind any spelling, grammar or language errors. Secondly, barely anyone knows about most incidents you are about to read, and I really do feel like you won't understand me and my feelings without me painting the whole picture.

Anyway, to the story of my life we go. It all began on a certain day at the end if spring when I was five years old. Back at the time I used to live in Japan with my three years older brother and two years younger sister and my parents, of course. A friend of mine atp the time had a sleepover birthday party. It was a lot of fun until the next day when I returned home. During my time gone a fire had started in my house and my family was sent to the hospital. To cut the story short; no one of them had survived the fire. On short notice I moved in with a friend at the time and quickly after I was sent to my uncle, where I currently still live. My new ""dad"" and his wife had a daughter so I somewhat felt at home. She is older than me but not that that really matters to me. Skip to 2019. I've built up my life quite well with the help of a few friends but mostly good therapy. I've had a reallyweird relationship with a girl, as in we were childhood friends that became distant lovers, but we sometimes broke up just to come back together again a few weeks later. In August 2019 my girlfriend, that girl I just mentioned, got diagnosed with cancer a second time. The first time was when she was way younger and the doctors had thought to have eradicated the tumors but somehow they managed to grow back and even stronger and quicker. After fighting for her life and a few surgeries she lost the second fight to cancer. I've never really had the chance to say goodbye to her but I don't really want to go too deep into that as that's been mostly dealt with already. Now go to a year later. My granddad (both my actual dad's and my ""dad""'s father) is about to die. I don't really know how to use this word in English so I'll just say it here, not in a sentence: euthanasia. He's been suffering from a special type of Parkinson and after about a year he has given up on it. He regularly falls over and gets injured, puts stuff in a totally different place from where they belong etc. All my family has cried dozens of times over it and when I'm there I just feel this awkward disgust in myself where I tmalmost try to force myself to cry. He is the only ""real"" family I still have, but yet I can't cry about it how I usually would, or I can't even feel anything about it. When I think about his death I just get numb in a way of emotionless. Then I start doubting myself whether or not this is normal, and if I'm being respectful to him and my new family. If there's one thing my mom taught me before she passed away, its to always be respectful, no matter the situation. Am I crossing the lines here?

I've really lost myself here and I need guidance from people on what to think and do. I feel like I can't really talk to a therapist anymore without hating myself or being embarrassed by myself. That's why I reach out to you, so I can hide behind this screen without anyone knowing me. I at least feel safe. Just safe. That's something, I guess. 

Thanks."
212,I feel worthless because I don't have a job,"I lost my job and my career last year. Honestly the career was a bad fit I had been struggling to keep up with for years, but is all that I had...then covid happened and I was let go in a messy way. Been unemployed for 11 months, and spent 11 months in almost complete isolation - which has made my PTSD get so bad that now I can't work at all. Because I can't work people call me lazy and entitled; I get no sympathy for struggling to pay bills. I feel worthless and unfit to live because I can't support myself; people look down on me and I'm ashamed. I figure eventually I'd rather end it than go end up broke, or working a job that makes my life a daily misery with no way out, alone, struggling with PTSD, with no one who understands me. 

I have no hope that things will really improve. I'm in too much debt to get out of it, I'm alone, I'm crazy, it's not like I'll ever get to retire anyway. A lot of the time I really think death ise more desirable than the life I'm trapped in, but I'm too much a coward to do anything about it."
213,I’m scared my mental health has hit rock bottom,"I went through a pretty rough childhood and my anger used to be very intense, to the point where I was mad at everything and everyone for no reason. The reasons behind that anger became clear as I grew up.

However, recently with the lockdowns, and my university studies crushing me, my mental health has suffered. I hate being at university, the lectures are boring and I want to go out there and work. Experience something else for a change. My family won’t see any other option apart from me finishing university so I decided to just suck it up and push on.

Recently, I’ve noticed my emotions become more irrational, I feel depressed and numb. I can stare at a wall for hours running my mind over negative thoughts. I have lost so much of myself. 

Tonight, I was doing my assignment and just finished it . All of a sudden, on my online word drive, my work was randomly deleted and I lost it all. 

I flipped out, I’m so ashamed of it. I screamed, cried and punch my fist into my pc screen, it’s now broken. I haven’t felt that anger inside me since I was young, it came back and I fully lost control to it. I’m worried that I’m not okay."
214,For the past week I've been very depressed and have been acting similar to the way I do when I'm high. I even feel high as well.,Does anyone relate/have advice/can explain what's wrong with me?
215,Snapping More,"As I’ve grown up I used to be a people pleaser and would let people walk all over me. Whether it was family, friends or partners I would never stand up for myself. Now I find it increasingly hard to not say something when someone personally offends me or goes after me. Is this a normal thing for a recovering people pleaser? I’ve been feeling very guilty about standing up for myself recently and I don’t really know what to do about it. Anybody relate or have advice?"
216,"While my roommates are in the other room having a good time, I’m sitting in my room crying... and alone.",I’m in desperate need of help.  I fail at almost every.  I can’t hold a job.  I gave up on getting my welding certificate.  I want to fucking kill myself now.  Fuck everything I’m done.

219,"Why is it that when I am doing well, I still feel myself romanticizing suicide and self-harm without wanting to carry it out?","I have been dealing with a lot I guess as my abuser, my stepdad, passing away this March. It was a very tumultuous relationship. I never got any closure. My uncle also passed away. I am really close to graduating and I just got an internship in social media/human resources at my school, but I still feel kind of the same. 

Anyways, I put on ""Today"" by the Smashing Pumpkins and I get so excited about the song. I think it's the premise as  I know that he wrote this when he was utterly obsessed with suicide. I've also had this sneaking suspicion for a long time that I have bipolar disorder or BPD. I've always struggled with self-harm (though, I am 1 year free from harming), disordered eating and OCD thoughts of harm towards myself and others in the past (though I would absolutely never do that. I've stopped having them because I am out of my abusive situation from my youth). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just remember than when I was younger, after watching my dad pass away around 5 years old, I've always felt like I gravitated towards the melancholy. I am really well-grounded in whatever I do, and I know I'm competent, but I just get excited about just driving very far away, starting a new life, or just ending it all in a way that wouldn't be painful. I don't think I'd ever kill myself but there are moments in my life where I get into low points where I just scream and feel like there isn't any point to what I'm doing. That no matter what, I'm going to be stuck with this macabre sense of thinking."
220,I'm struggling,"I was physically/emotionally/mentally abused as a child. My worldview had been so distorted by this that I accepted it as perfectly normal, up until the age of 22, when i realised the situation around me.

This is my first post. I don't know the words. But I feel so alone, and so damn scared. I don't know what it feels like to be loved, really loved. I've never had a proper friendship. Most of the people in my life have no idea about my past. And every time i try to get close to someone, I feel them pull away from me."
221,Does anyone else suffer with misophonia?,"I get this really bad with sounds such as chewing, kissing and whistling and slurping. It actually makes me want to tell profanities at the offender and be violent. It makes it hard to be around a lot of people and even my partner who doesn't realise or mean any harm. It's hard to manage it without coming across as an asshole because at best I just leave the room which can still appear rude."
222,"Please read the whole thing and share what you think. Is this normal? If not, what disorder/illness this might be? – (I’m aware you aren’t professionals)","Firstly, I am aware you’re not professionals. I’m sharing what I feel in hopes of finding people who are diagnosed and who experience/d these symptoms, so that I can learn more about it. If I could afford a psychiatrist, therapist or go see a counselor (my school doesn’t have one) I would. I just want to know what I could possibly have.

I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke, drink or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom had severe OCD though.

I have violent mood swings that occur very often in a day, could be each 6 hours or even each 30 minutes. Nothing triggers these mood swings though. 


Also, I thought I’d say this because maybe it could be my potential mental disorder manifesting itself: I used to create fake profiles for no malicious intentions whatsoever, except to make friends and experiencing what life would be like if I was that person, as I’ve endured a long history pf bullying from my own family and friends. It’s a form of escapism. I don’t think I’m ugly. I’ve been told I’m pretty many times, I have my insecurities but this isn’t why I did it.


These mood swings do not result in me harming myself in any way, however. 

For the past 2 years, I’ve been feeling like people (who I don’t personally know, could be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way. Praying? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 

I don’t hear them or see them. I don’t feel like they’re speaking either. I only imagine them in ly head, I’m aware of that, except I can’y stop acting weird “around them”.

I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. For example, I could say “Ew, that’s really gross.” which will match what *they think of me* therefore they’d think it’s out of my control and won’t judge me for it.

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost.


Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. I’m perfectly fine in crowds. I’m only anxious around those inexistent people. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia (I don’t believe anyone wants to harm me) or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder. 

It’s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don’t take my mental health seriously, and I can’t afford therapy myself. Please provide any helpful opinions.

As I said I’m well aware you aren’t professionals. I’m just gathering information and opinions to look for methods to maybe reduce these symptoms until I can afford therapy. 

I know I’m a minor, but I’m sadly a part of a society that doesn’t prioritize mental health for kids nor adults or teens, there’s so much stigma surrounding it. 

If there’s any therapist in this subreddit who’s willing to only direct me to the right path so I could have accurate information, (I’m not asking for treatment), I’d highly appreciate that.

Take care."
223,Was I misdiagnosed?,"Hi there, 
Im a 20 year old girl who was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) 2 years ago when I was 18, at the time I felt relief that I finally got some answers as I struggled with my mental health since I was a kid. For the past few months or so, I’ve been questioning my diagnoses, I’m not sure why, I often think I’m ‘faking it’ and I don’t know if that’s just a part of BPD. I was told about it slightly when diagnosed but not much information was given to me by health care professionals, I had to research myself which often leads to shit posts and false information etc. One health care professional also told me that I was too young to have BPD and that I can grow out of it which is why I think maybe I’m feeling this way. I know BPD can have similar symptoms to bipolar disorder and I did bring that up to my therapist but she brushed it off. I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is mania or just the ups and downs of BPD, I know other’s opinions don’t matter but I think I’m looking for more guidance/opinions to maybe give me the courage and reassurance to push my therapist for more answers and closure. Here’s a list of what I’ve been experiencing it’s quite long, I apologise


talking over people
thinking of what to say when someone else is talking not focusing on what theyre saying 
interrupting 
listening to a few words out of a sentence and misinterpreting others
very gossipy 
arrogant/rude? 
finishing other people’s sentences
feeling very overwhelmed
very excited? yet tired 
anxiety 
telling myself ‘not to act like that’ as i know i can come across rude
feeling guilty and embarrassed
continuing to do it anyway
swearing a lot
talking about myself a lot
feeling very sensitive to what others are saying to me (i’m quite sensitive in general but even more so than usual)
feeling/acting like someone is watching me in order to watch what i say or do e.g. feeling/acting like manager is watching me so i don’t say anything bad about him/work or when i was younger acting like my crush was watching me etc but i felt like it was deliberate because i knows they actually werent? i don’t know if that makes sense 
suicidal 
wanting people to feel sorry for me/attention seeking 
feeling tense/irritable 
can’t stay in a job 
blaming others for things i did 
unsure of likes/dislikes and self
physical symptoms of anxiety (vomiting, rashes)
strange repeating nightmares 
avoiding work when employed 
constant changing of appearance 
feeling disconnected from reality 
detached from self/out of body experiences/feel like i’m in a dream?

I’m sorry this was so long but I really am struggling atm with myself and my identity in general and I don’t know if I actually have BPD or maybe in a few days I will believe I do but I don’t really have anyone I can tell this to as I feel like I might push people away or make them worry, thank you :( - E x"
224,I've been feeling down recently,I've been going through a lot of mental stress lately and everything I see reminds me of something in my past that makes me sad. Thank you for reading
225,seriously in need of help,"hi i am a 31 years old living single with my parents currently working in a low income job and don't have much prospect in life , i have a stepmother that is not talking to me for almost 6 - 7 years now

she would bang the doors and complain to my dad about things i have done that makes her unhappy

 i would lock myself in the room, i have no friends recently she has been putting soap in my waterbottle, every times she comes home she would make noises like coughing noise and noises in general. To be specific i am scared of her and trembling with fear whenever i am near her and unable to speak about it."
226,Best way to approach telling my therapist about a few things?,"First of all, I’ve only been in therapy a few a weeks and we’ve addressed my anxiety issues and that’s about it. 

I know I need to tell her about my self harm but I’m terrified and I also have no clue how to do this. 

I also want to bring up the fact that I’m almost positive I’m autistic and display multiple examples of every symptom. 

Any suggestions?"

228,I want to delete Reddit but I have a friend here who refuses to speak to me through other platforms.,"Basically the title. I spend far too much time on this site and I want to break my phone addiction. It causes me extreme anxiety and also, if I’m being honest, I find my friend a bit creepy due to the nature of online friendships. I no longer feel comfortable talking to strangers online because I am extremely busy and want to focus on my own life. And quite frankly I don’t have the time to constantly be on my phone and be there for them when they have mental health crises, which is VERY often. 

I really want to delete the app but in the past I’ve told them I wouldn’t, and I don’t want to break my word. And I know if I left they would probably be depressed. I feel like my life is a mess because of this and it’s really causing me a lot of anxiety. Please help and give me advice"
229,Today I had my first therapy appointment!,"I almost canceled because my anxiety was through the roof, but I managed to get through the assessment and the doctor was very kind and understanding. 
I won’t have another appointment until March mainly because the office is so busy right now, but I’m incredibly proud of myself for even taking this small step after 10+ years of frustration and pain."
230,Idolizing a pervert,"This is... a lot. So bare with me. When I was younger I was taken advantage of by someone a few years older than me, and it completely changed my life. I’m talking smoking, drinking, failing school type changes. This person disguised themself as my friend, convinced me they were in love with me, and used me. I was only 12 and fell for the trick. 

A few years later I got into contact with them again and they told me they loved me, I fell for it once again and it ruined us both. But this time, they told me they were using me all along because I was an easy target. 

I wish I could explain my confusion. They told me “I’ve been using you all along” and then a few days later says “I didn’t mean that, you know how I really feel”. It seems so genuine that I cannot for the life of me tell what they really mean. I feel crazy at this point because I have myself convinced they’re madly in love with me and denying their feelings. Ever since that last exchange of “you know how I really feel” I have been waiting and hoping and praying to see them again. I call it infatuation. 

WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY??? This person hurt me, used me, but I’m still setting a place for them at the dinner table (metaphorically). Why am I denying what’s right in my face? Or is my intuition right, does it know something that I don’t know, and she really loves me?

I understand how this seems absolutely insane. Mentally I’m doing okay, my life is arguably the best it’s ever been. But I’m through feeling this way, and I need help. 


TL;DR - in love with someone who used me. Why?"
231,This is just kind of a vent post feel free to ignore or write a comment what ever you feel like doing.,"Hi everyone, I'm here because my mental health has recently been getting worst to the point where I'm thinking about committing suicide. It's a mix of a few thing's baggage, trying to figure out how I'll figure out after Highschool, my identity &amp; also school. I'm not really worried about my grades school wise since most of them are at least passing but I've been losing the motivation more each day and in hopes to avoid everything I try to pass the time watching YouTube. It doesn't work instead I either get a rush of gender dysphoria or try forcing myself to at least start. I don't know anymore I know I'll probably never do it but the way thing's are going right now the futures honestly such a mix of everything right now and I just want thing's to slow down for a little. (It won't I know but, yeah.)"
232,Hi! I’m new here and I had a question about an app I saw in an ad on tik tok haha,"It’s called reflectively. It’s an anxiety help app that you can record and track your mood I believe. I haven’t looked into it too much, but I’ve struggled with anxiety and other mental health issues so I wanted to try using one of those types of apps. Has anyone used it before, and does it help? Does anyone here have any other apps that could help? I want to recover, or at least start the process of healing. Thanks in advance❤️"
233,Favorite Mental Health Books?,"I want to find any book that addresses some of the mental health issues that men are typically prone to, as well as learning coping techniques. Any books will do (not ones just about men) but I'm really interested in hearing about some of your favorite book recommendations so I can get an idea where to start  I've seen some psych books, and memoirs that look really good, but what are your favorite reads?"
234,Are you a counselor in NYC? Do you know any?,I'm looking for affordable cash rates
235,Twitching and glitching,"My head just jerks, I can’t stop it, it just jerks to the side, plus my personality is all out of whack, one minute I’m ready to fight people older then me, ready to throw some hands, then something triggers my brain, and makes me terrified of everything, sometimes I’m super depressed and sad and don’t want to talk to everyone, other times I wanna do something, talk to everyone, I want to draw and make everything, it’s not like this is new, I thought everyone was like this, it’s been happening for 3 maybe 4 years, does anyone know what this is? My parents aren’t gonna take me too a doctor though, I know that, so, what is this? It makes my neck hurt, but I keep “ Glitching”"
236,I hear voices.,"I hear voices but I very much doubt it’s schizophrenia or anything like that. They’re not constant and it doesn’t happen when I’m stressed. I’m wondering if it’s because It has to do about something with me being alone? Maybe I’m not being social enough and it’s affecting me? Whenever I hear these voices, it’s always when I’m alone or almost alone.

When I was younger, I began hearing my grandparents talking downstairs so I’ll rush down to see if they made a surprise visit. They weren’t there. They live states away from me. This happened a few times before it just stopped for years. Then I heard them last year in 2019, my mother whispered my name into my ear but no one was there. Both of my parents were gone at the store and I was home alone. This happened more but at separate timing like a few days would go by and I’d hear my mom talking to me through the door while I’m taking a shower, then I realize that she’s not there. No one is there. But this week was different. I heard my dad call my name several times and at this point I can recognize which ones are real and which ones are fake, this one was fake. When I walked to his room, he was dead asleep, he doesn’t talk in his sleep. But it was weird because that was the first time I’ve ever heard my father’s voice. It use to be my grandparents and now it’s my mother. I feel like this is normal and happens to a lot of people but when I asked my friends about it they were very confused and it really freaked me out. Does anyone else have this? Is it anything I should be concerned about?"
237,Restlessness or something else?,"A year ago, I was binging fentanyl for about 11 months before I got sober on Nov. 13, 2019. It was the worst experience I've had suffering from addiction, and definitely one of the worst parts of my life. I'm only 18 and have lived my entire life surrounded by addiction. My mother, who raised me in and out of shelters, over-dosed when I was 12 and passed away. This grief sent me into my own downward spiral during my high-school years and I ended up falling deep into a drug binge. 

What made the binge so scary was the withdrawal. I don't know too much about fentanyl from a clinical standpoint, but I do know that it's up there with the worst (Btw I didn't know it was fentanyl for a while as it was pressed into pills made to look like OxyContin). My tolerance skyrocketed (as I was doing it everyday for months at this point), and when I would withdrawal, I would go into a near panic-attack. This very uncomfortable feeling spread throughout my body and gave me the urge to walk around or sometimes even run. If I stopped moving, the feeling would be so intense I would begin to panic and breakdown. When I got sober, the feeling still remained. The doctors told me Restless Leg Syndrome was a common symptom of withdrawal, but I've never seen anyone look like they were experiencing it as intense as I was and my best friend and many other friends of mine were also seriously hooked on these pills, though truly, I don't know. 

Anyways, now, a year later, that restless feeling still has not gone away. It only goes away if I use. I wake up sweating and shaking, and it WILL NOT go away. I keep researching and everything says it's related to anxiety, while I am diagnosed with GAD and my symptoms can be severe, I still feel it no matter what mental state I am in. I am bi-polar, so even during mood-shifts or bouts of happiness, it still lingers and brings my mood WAY down again. I haven't felt a sense of true security, comfort, or pleasure since I got off the drugs. 

I saw a post on Reddit of someone experiencing something similar, and they stated it feels like ""a low electric current flowing through your body constantly."" That is the best way I can sum it up, but even that doesn't really describe it that well. It is driving me insane and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what could be going on. Is this just Restless Leg Syndrome? If so, why doesn't it ever ease or go away?"
238,I dont like who I am and afraid if the people I love where to find out,"I dont love myself and never have, but I do love my family and friends. Im scared that they are going to find out about my internet life style...im so ashamed of myself. Im the male role model in this family and most are women, my father was a total abusive piece of shit and has been out of the picture for a long fuckin time..if anyone found out about the things iv done or fetished online I couldn't live with myself. I played on a slippery slope and am afraid of the damage iv done already...I have a bag of Xanax that I bought from a friend and would take them only when needed but I stopped when I realized that the remaining ones in this bag could finish a job of I needed them to for any reason...this us no way to live and I know that. Im lost and afraid but honestly I deserve this..I put myself here. I just don't want them to feel this pain"
239,I hate my own name.,"I was bullied for 6+ years during middle school and high school (yes, I was born in a small-ish town so it’s the same group of ppl). The reason is that I’m a nerd and that I have freckles.
They made up ridiculous &amp; disgusting rumours about me, which I care not to repeat, just assume the worst, you’re not that far off. The bullying left me with so much trauma that after I entered uni, I still can’t handle strangers laughing. My name has been associated with so much hate about myself that I graduated started to hate it, to the point that I feel discomfort when people call me by my full name.
It’s lucky that most of my friends refer to me/know me by my internet tag, which I identify more with. But my workplace mates still know me by my “real name”, and I just hate it. I feel inferior using that name.
I thought about changing my name but since even my surname gives me pain it would be a huge problem to change them both and they would mostly likely disapprove my request because no one cares enough. And my parents would freak out, they already freaked out once just because I want to move to another city.
I’m even afraid to get diagnosed as bipolar just because our mental health system is so broken no one has any privacy.
I genuinely don’t know what to do."
240,An Elitist prep for Christmas,"My cousin is a self proclaimed elitist, she has friends who work for the World Bank, for a living she is a lawyer who puts severance packages together for companies to deliver to their employees and she broke off a marriage with her husband and kicked her kids out during the first wave of Covid.  We are seeing her for Christmas for some good old fashioned family values and good times - can anybody appreciate my confusion?  How do I possibly look past that and pretend love, family and human connection matter most when she has clearly demonstrated in multiple areas of life that she has other priorities?"
241,Maybe I should get myself off my meds...(?),"I have been on the same meds for three years. The meds themselves don't cost much, but since my student insurance ended, I have huge bills for my lab work that my doctor ordered (i tried my best to figure out the costs of all it. I guess I was misled? I'll have to call them tomorrow I guess) And my doctor's appointment lasted 10 minutes and all she said my lab work was good. That cost me 130

&amp;#x200B;

You know, it's not like I NEED to have these meds to function, like other people. There was a time when I was in college where I was too suicidal to function, but that was three years ago. I was going to wait for this pandemic to be over, but I really can't use my doctor to help because that costs 130 a pop.

I'm asking a friend of mine for her thoughts, but the reality is that I don't NEED these meds. Sure they were keeping me level, but it could be that Im just not giving myself a chance to be without them.  It could be that I'm just naturally level now. 

Thoughts? Im crying over these bills."
242,I realized something.,"I've realized about myself that I FANTASIZE about the IDEA of doing better for myself but struggle to actually do the action? I dont have much motivation for much, where do I go from here?"
243,I’m trying,"I (F18) have been struggling with my mental health for a while now and I don’t know if I’m ever going to be fully happy with myself. I’ve struggled with low self-esteem and insecurities for as long as I can remember, I’ve always hated things about myself, felt not good enough etc. I guess I’m just stuck in this mind set and I don’t know how to stop thinking so negatively. 

I’ve been talking to a councillor for a couple of months now and although it’s nice to talk to someone, there’s almost a part of me that doesn’t really want to listen or believe what she’s saying. I’m trying so hard to take her advice, but I keep finding myself in the same mind set, obsessing over little thoughts, hating myself and thinking everyone else hates me. It’s almost like an obsession.

I guess I just need advice, how do I love myself?"
244,restraining myself i guess?,so sometimes when i have a really bad mental breakdown i know that i should text my boyfriend and tell him i need him or that i want to call but i physically cannot do it. my mind tells me “text him. call him. you need him here.” and another part of my mind basically say “hmm. nope!” and i physically cannot pick up the phone and text him. all i’ll do is lay there and struggle. does anyone know what this is/means? or if it’s a certain mind problem or something?
245,The root of my depression and anxiety is a huge lack of affection in my life. How do I fix that? Where do I start?,"I have friends but I’m not that close to them.  I don’t really have a strong bond with my family.  I’m pretty much alone.  I’m 20 years old and I don’t want to keep wasting my life like this.

246,Do I have dermatillomania?,"I have had quite a stressful/traumatic life since the age of 18. I’m now 26.

For about 4 or 5 years I’ve been obsessed with picking at my arms. Even the tiniest little bump on my arm I squeeze it until it’s red. I do the same to my face and my scalp. I always have scabs all over my arms and on my face and scalp and it makes me so embarrassed.

Before this I was obsessed with splitting my split ends in my hair. I would spend HOURS doing it until I finally cut my hair off and it’s been nearly a year since I’ve done that.

How can I stopped this fidgety/obsessive behaviour?"
247,I don’t know,"I have a lack of motivation, I don’t wanna play video games anymore, I keep overthinking about how social interactions will go and how other people see me, and I’m having trouble sleeping

Apparently these are all signs of depression/anxiety but I don’t want to talk to any professionals or whatever about it because I feel like it probably isn’t and I don’t wanna get in trouble. I have no reason to have either condition, I do well in school, I have friends, I have hobbies (not as many anymore). So I feel it can’t be depression or anxiety, what if I’m so desperate for attention that I have tricked myself into feeling this way? I don’t feel desperate for attention but...

I just don’t know anymore I have a good life so I shouldn’t feel this way.

249,The 2nd lockdown is really getting to me,"Hi, 

I live in the UK and have schizoaffective for perspective. We are just coming out of the full 2nd lockdown into a tier system and I'm in tier 2, so I can't meet my friends inside and it's cold n wet and I got too much paranoia for being outside in the street or anywhere close. 

I'm so tired of this shit, I've left the house 3 times in the last month. I've been really manic so I've been putting in around 30 hours a week on uni and trying to do another 20 on website work and am also waiting to start a new part-time job. It's exhausting without a social outlet for me, I am an extrovert and need to be social to feel energized and I'm not feeling energized by texting my friends anymore. I think I'm started to flip to being depressed too and it's getting harder to continue doing this much work.

I'm an alcoholic and recovered drug addict but have reasonable control over drinking but right now I'm wishing I hadn't cut back on booze all those years ago and my liver was going... Life is kinda shit, I can't work a normal job, there are no opportunities for work in my degree around here for me. I just wanna leave and live in the city again but its unfeasible cause I'm on benefits and can't even get a place here. 

I just wanna go out and relax with my friends again at the pub... lockdown + schizoaffective is so shitty to live with."

251,Feeling misunderstood and lonely.,"I keep facing situations where I am misunderstood. I end up using more words than required, which causes the situation to get worse. I either bottle up my feelings or let them all out and when ever I do it causes an argument. I feel alone. I feel like I'm a burden on the people in my life."
252,I feel like a burden and a waste of life TW,"Mostly because I dont ""contribute to society"". I cant get a job, I've tried interviews and I never get hired because I cant look people in the eyes and I fidget too much. I went to school 3 different times for 3 different things, graduated with a certificate in medical assisting but I couldnt get a job in the field because when i get overwhelmed i cant control my emotions and end up having a melt down in front of everyone, and medical is a very overwhelming field. 

Sometimes I have no motivation to do chores at home to make my husbands life easier. I don't cook. I might not even shower for like a week. I have to really really force myself to do our chores. I've thought about sc but I couldnt do that to my family, even though I think itd make their lives easier in the long run since my husband and dad pretty much support me financially. 

I just feel completely stuck and stagnant in life and I feel like I'm holding my husband back. My insurance doesnt cover behavioral health or I'd be in therapy rn. I've tried antidepressants but I never deal with the side effects well. This is pretty much the lowest my depression has ever been, I want to be productive. But I cant control my emotions."
253,I think I’m a horrible child and I feel bad for my family :/,I constantly feel misunderstood in my family. I don’t know how to describe it ?? Ever since the pandemic my mental health has went down the drain I have some form of mental breakdown almost weekly. I feel like I’ll have good days where I’m happy and then other days I’ll get angry at my parents and everything for no reason and just be so rude to them? And I don’t know how to stop it. It’s like another person is in my body and I’m not really recognizing what I’m saying or why I get so angry. I just feel bad for them because they do so much for me and I feel like I’m just causing everyone stress and that I’m a horrible person. I’m really sorry I wish I could describe this better but idk anymore.
254,Antidepressants for children,"Hi! I am 25F and I have been on antidepressants since I was 9. I have taken a few different ones when I was younger but I can’t remember which ones, but I have been taking Zoloft for the majority of my time on antidepressants.

I have tried to stop a few times under supervision of a psychiatrist, but I always get really depressed and have to start taking them again. Thanks"
255,Online Therapist Recommendations,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for recommendations for a therapist who offers online services.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and in general, just suffer from depression, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and unpacked past trauma. 

I've tried out a couple of therapists recently, but I haven't found them to be a good fit. They really only covered surface-level issues and really focused on just one exercise that focused on one particular event that bothered me at a given time, and I wasn't finding it very helpful. But I was hoping to find someone who would help me unpack my thoughts and feelings at a deeper level and help me solve/cope with the root issues, and then from there, work up to dealing with current issues that I'm facing. 

I'm located in Japan, so I would ideally like an English-speaking therapist from Japan, Australia, Singapore, or any other country around here, but I'm open to therapists from the USA, Canada, UK, and other parts of the world too. I would like a therapist who is available on the weekends or in the evenings. I'm flexible on the price, but somewhere around 50 USD (68 AUD or 67 SGD) would be ideal.

So if anyone has any therapist that they have found really helpful, could you please recommend them to me and tell me a bit about your experience with them?

Thanks in advance!"
256,My life has become something i hate,"Im unemployed claiming benefits and in a months time i will be on long-term sick due to health issues.

I hate where I live  it's oppressive.  I live in a block of flats.and the noise can be unbearable at times woken at 4am and a neighbour who drives me up the wall 

I have no friends in my life I live miles away from everyone i knew in my previous life  . And these days im generally anti social besides talking to my neighbours and occasionally see family. 

Ive been living like this for 7 years and it kind of stuck. I feel like my life has become so out of whack empty and going absolutely  nowhere fast . How the fuck has it come to this 

The only thing i really had in my life was getting up to go to work being productive and earning a wage. 

Now I'm not working I'm just watching my life pass me by stuck in a place I don't want to be . ALONE. 

That isn't the worst of it.  My neighbour drives me mad with noise and waking me up at all hours.  

I have no control over my life right now and unless I start making big changes I'm going to end up with a lifetime of disappointment 

 There's not one single ounce of joy in it right now 

My sleep pattern is now messed up . I haven't been getting much exercise and I'm just hanging around waiting to get paid so I can get out of here 

That's the height of it . It's absolutely god awful"
257,Can someone with DID be ‘taken over’ by an alter personality?,"As in, they no longer live as themself and live in constant disassociation as an alter?"
258,"If you got help, how did you finally open up?","I really want to get help because I feel like at this point I’m having a breakdown everyday and i feel like I’m drifting away from so many people :( I just don’t feel right if that even makes sense, I feel like I’m not living my life and I’m suffocated. I have no idea how to get professional help, the thing is I’ve always refrained from doing so because I feel like I have no reason to feel so depressed/anxious , I feel like my feelings aren’t that valid and that I’m overreacting."
259,My Hate work,"5 years of it all. 
I die a little more every day to exist. 
The silent scream of a burning hell of every passing moment.
The distracting rage, day by day, night by night.
The one reason I’ve never done drugs or anything like that is because I’m afraid of what I’d do if I lost control of my emotions. 
No one know to the slightest of how I really feel. 
I feel like soon I could break and kill myself.
The fact that it’s coming to that Is tearing me apart. 
The disgust I’d feel with myself if I hurt someone in my own anger. 
I don’t know what else I can do but rot."
260,I don't know what to believe about my mental health anymore due to my mother's meddling.,"I (25F) know I have general anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and OCD. However, as well I have been told I have ADHD(possibly overdiagnosed), possibly mild Asperger's, and when I went to the doctor I saw on my record yesterday that I have Bipolar disorder. I have never been told by a doctor I have bipolar and my child psychiatrist put me on abilify upon my mother's request because ""it worked for her so it must work for me"" when I was 19 years old. I have no clue how my mother was allowed into these appointments when I was a legal adult and I stopped taking abilify after 2 days because it didn't work (because I didn't need it). Now I'm finding out from my mother that I was diagnosed with Asperger's before I found out from a school social worker (at 17) and no one told me. I refuse to take meds because they never did anything for me but make me feel worse and mental health professionals have talked down to me like a child for refusing medication. I see a therapist regularly. My therapist has confirmed some of my diagnoses such as OCD, anxiety, and depression as well as PTSD due to a recent event but has never said anything about Asperger's or bipolar. I feel like doctors don't take me seriously. I am seriously questioning any diagnosis at this point. My mother has been diagnosed with bipolar and is an alcoholic/opiate addict. She projects her issues on other people (hence the abilify) and seems to think I'm an alcoholic as well (I don't like drinking). She has projected other issues on my sister(23)(according to her) as well. I don't know what to believe any more and I'm afraid of being evaluated by a psychiatrist because I don't want to be belittled for not taking pills when I have gotten along mostly fine with therapy. I don't know what to do any more. I have never been manic in my life. I feel seriously fucked over because while there is nothing wrong with being bipolar, there is a stigma associated with it and I don't want it to be incorrectly associated with me when there is 0 indication that I have it. My father thinks mental health professionals are ""quacks"" so I can't turn to him. I feel like my mother has seriously fucked me over due to her projection issues and I don't know what to do anymore besides wasting my valuable time to prove that she lied about my mental health."
261,I’m 21 I can’t take care of myself and none of my family wants to deal with me anymore. What’re my options?,"I have ptsd, Bipolar 1, asd, ocd, and an eating disorder. I’ve been in the hospital 3 times since I was 16. I’ve tried just about every living situation. I’m impulsive, have so much shit to work through, I cannot take care of myself very well if there is not food already ready or ready to microwave I likely won’t eat, I find it impossible to do anything of any value, so much more. I can’t go in the hospital I’m not a danger to anyone but myself I guess but I’m not actively trying to harm myself. They’ll keep me for a week and send me home. Idk if there’s like a residential or an adult group home. But idk where to start. My mom won’t let me come home unless I do one of those things and my father sucks and he wants me to leave and they’re all I have so what do i do?"
262,Was going to leave this sub and never post again...,"But a lot has happened in the past 3 days that I have been gone. Firstly, I have had good contacts with my Probation Officer and she seems to think that this Drug and Alcohol thing was a mistake, and as soon as I get proof that the tests that the counseling center was using were reading FALSE positives on alcohol (as proof, I have gone to COLORS, which is totally random drug testing--when your color is called, you report and get tested and I have been CLEAN every SINGLE time) then I can stop going to COLORS, which is fantastic. I hate waking up at 5 or 6 in the morning just to make a stupid phone call, then drag my ass out of a warm bed and struggle to get downtown (we are very broke and taking a cab gets expensive when I can't take a bus, like on a weekend, and even taking the bus is long and arduous because I have to stand there in the cold until it comes) just to test positive because I AM NOT DRINKING! I don't have any interest in alcohol at all. None. Zip. Nada. I quit 4 years ago and I don't want to go back to it. I am done with being sick and fat...and not myself.  


Secondly, I just found out that our eldest daughter (the 21 year old) and her girlfriend has started an IndieGOGO campaign for our family to help with Christmas, and we have gotten quite a few donations already. I was shocked to see it on FB, and I am EXTREMELY grateful. However, I don't feel like we deserve that money (I mean, the children definitely deserve a Christmas, but I feel it is kind of our responsibility to provide that without asking people to donate money that they probably need for their own families) and now I have a shitload of guilt. I feel horrible for some reason.

  
I guess what I am asking is: what should I do about this guilt? I can't really express it to our daughter because then it seems like I am ungrateful and just an asshole. It is seriously eating me up inside. We just got paid (thank the Heavens for SSI) so we are OK with money at the moment...but that will only cover our rent, the phones (cell), and the XFinity bill so our kids can have Internet (and phone and TV bundled). Otherwise...we are broke. Still. Grrr. I just don't know how to feel. Can someone give me some words of wisdom, please?   


I was going to leave this sub...but I wouldn't have anywhere to go. I know you guys don't care if I never post again...but I just can't leave here. :( This is my safe space in a very unsafe time right now. Thanks again guys."
263,I've been doing pretty bad but don't know whether I should tell my therapist everything....,"So for the past couple months I've been stuck in a downward spiral, and I'm definitely the worst I've been yet. In the past two weeks alone I've smoked heavy pretty much every single day, I get incredibly fucked up (weed and alc mostly) every weekend and some days during the week, last week I impulsively took shrooms without preparation of any kind, I've started taking multiple of my dads pills regularly for almost a week now, 2 weeks ago  made out with a boy the day I met him, yesterday I spent like 200 dollars online shopping in less than an hour, I skip school constantly, and am starting to fall behind on my assignments. I eat at most one meal a day, can go well over a week without showering, spend a concerning amount of hours just sitting in my bed on my phone, and then mentally, I'm just doing terrible. I constantly fantasize about self harming again (I'm 2 years clean tho) and idk I just feel so empty all the time. Its weird tho bc I'm like self aware and like can see myself fucking up my shit, but like I literally can not stop. I can't bring myself to make art, or do school work, or eat a full meal, or text my friends, or tell my therapist about how bad I'm doing. I only have one friend who knows all of this, and she doesn't think I should tell my therapist everything bc she thinks she might send me to rehab or a hospital or something, and i just dont think im that that bad. or maybe I am? idek.. I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt 2 years ago and the thing is like,, I'm not really suicidal like that anymore.  Like I do have suicidal thoughts pretty regularly but I know for a fact I'd never go through with them becuase theyre nowhere near as bad as they used to be. Also, like I can recognize now that I have friends and a future and shit but in my day to day I just dont really feel anything or care about anything. I'm also rly good at fronting like I'm fine so if my therapist found this shit out and told my parents, they would freak the fuck out, like I almost feel like nobody would believe me if I said how bad I'm doing because I'm just so good at hiding it and i am so fucking bad at asking for help. Idk I really really want to get better, but also I've only had this therapist for like a couple months and I just still am struggling really opening up to her idk why. Also like I don't want to go to the hospital again at all lmao but I know therapy and the multitude of antidepressants alone won't get me out of this. I need help and have no fucking clue what to do."
264,Need advice on asking my family for help,"Disclaimer, I've never used reddit before, so apologies if I mess up making this post somehow.

I've been struggling with anxiety/panic attacks since middle school, I'm 18 now and I feel like I've barely improved, if at all. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I'm 99% sure I have some sort of anxiety disorder as I have panic attacks at least once a week. I don't see how I'm going to get a stable job or move out in my current mental state. It's pretty obvious to me that I need therapy and possibly medication, but the problem is actually getting it.

My mother is weird about the subject of mental health, for lack of better word. I don't know how to bring it up with her or ask her for help. I have an older brother who I know would try to help if I talked to him about it, but he doesn't have the money to get me professional help. I would feel terribly guilty going to him anyway because he's also had mental health problems in the past. He's doing much better now but I don't want to remind him of it, if that makes sense.

Basically, I need advice on how to ask my mother to get me professional help with my anxiety. I'm not very close to her and I worry that she won't take me seriously."
265,"I need help, not sure what’s wrong anymore","I’ve never been able to afford help so I am undiagnosed and I have no idea what’s wrong with me. Im only 19 years old but I’ve been depressed and emotionally out of control since before I can remember. I’ve always cried at the drop of a pen or ready to rip someone’s head off if they looked at me the wrong way. I was HIGHLY SENSITIVE. Very caring, loving, and giving. The last 3 years have been the worst for my depression (couldnt get out of bed, wasn’t taking care of myself, drug abuse etc.). I was in a long term relationship and living with a man who was good to me for the most part, but I was so depressed, I felt like I needed to leave and restart/ rebuilt. I was feeling so much happier. After 2 weeks he moved in with a now ex friend of mine and impregnated her. No matter how hard I try, I can’t feel anything. I can’t cry. I have very sudden moments where I am overwhelmed with heartache but before I can cry, I go completely numb. To summarize some of my other suspicious behavior, I used to be so sensitive and sympathetic, I used to always be the one getting fucked over and getting my heart broken but now I’m the one who doesn’t care and hurts people. I feel an overwhelming need to fix broken people but once I fix them I want nothing to do with them. I see what people want/need and I give them exactly that, I make them feel like they found their one true love, meanwhile I can’t feel anything. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t want to be like this. I want to be the caring, compassionate person I once was but I think she is gone. 
*please do not call me a terrible person, I don’t want to be like this. I am struggling very badly."
266,Likely hood of sinking into depression 1 year after parental death for the same months as teams occurred?,"
One of my parents discovered cancer in April of 2019 and died in June. Funeral was months later and lingering effects of the death lingered until about their Birthday in December. Mostly due to unanswered questions about why I was abandoned by them as a kid. 

Well not abandoned so much as they moved very far away, I spent my summers pretty much alone because that’s when I’d visit but they worked all the time and had no interest in their boy who painted his fingernails and liked things he did not. Super great. Turned into only speaking on the holidays from there on out having the same conversation over and over and over. . Ok picture painter. 

I started getting depressed around April of this year and just now came out of it. Like I’m back to like 80% my normal self. Is it possible that I sunk into a depression for the length I did because the length of the trauma?"

269,Why do I bother to make long term plans?,"
I’ve had mental issues since late preschool. Every sense I’ve been collecting mental illnesses and disorders like keycards, trying to sort them out, going on meds, etc. My battle had left me feeling like every time I get to a light at a tunnel it goes out. But I recently developed a painful and rare disability that effects the nerves in my feet. I have been diagnosed with Erythromelalgia. 4-7 flairs a day. I feel like I’m having a seizure I’m in so much pain most of the time. So at time point I ask the question in the title. All my life I’ve been trying. Trying to push myself even through I don’t want to be here. For my family and for future me. But when you’ve been on that emotional road and then you now have pain that makes you bite your hand to keep yourself from screaming- I don’t know. I don’t know if I’ll be there for some of the plans I make. Because if this keeps getting bad what if I don’t have enough fight to deal with it?"
270,I have epilepsy and I was supposed to go to nyc but I didn’t get to go because my seizures prevented me,When I was ab 15/16 I was supposed to go to nyc the day before the trip everyone was packing and I was kind of nervous a little stressed so I decided to take a nap on the couch and woke up on the floor wrapped in blankets my cousin holding me my other cousins surrounding me and my aunt and her husband scared and I just remember asking are we going to nyc yet ? And I got told no because I had a seizure and that I scared everyone I was sad 😔 There’s so much I wanted to do on the trip and I’m hoping someday I can plan that trip and go on my own now that things are better for me.
271,Amnesia I guess? But why???,"I am not replacing professional help or opinions with online forums, I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this and why, and what anyone's opinions could be :) No self-diagnosing here

Lately I've been coming across things I have apparently done / interacted with that I have NO memory of. Example: pulling a vaccine into a syringe at work (vet hospital) that I was specifically asked not to and had no intention of pulling up. I found it on the counter and I don't remember what I did after being told not to do it, and there is no reason anyone else would have entered that room to do anything after the doctor and I left it. I also found a friggin burrito thing in my microwave that had been sitting for probably a couple of days and if it was possible I would have sworn it was someone else, but no one was here, unless my dog did it. 

Small things like that keep happening, like gaps in my days that are missing for tiny blips of time. Getting together meds or packages for people, walking dogs, showing someone how to do something, just nonexistent in my brain that I would pass a lie detector over if I said it wasn't me. Normally if I just can't remember something and I'm confronted about it I question it like ""yeah hey maybe I do remember you saying that, but refresh my memory?"" but if I didn't know better, in the weird situations I recently noticed, I would be CERTAIN that it didn't happen. In the moment, someone else definitely pulled up that vaccine and that burrito was not mine because I didn't buy them and I wouldn't want to take food someone else at home bought. But no one was in the house at the time it would have appeared! 

It's probably worth mentioning that I have several anxiety and depression-related mental illnesses and I'm medicated for them, but this isn't just forgetting things like normal. This is like a ghost using my body to do mundane tasks. Also, history of sleepwalking ???"

278,I don’t know how to process my guilt and shame - I want to be a better person,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to boys on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with boys on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But I cannot move this, it feels like something that is going to haunt me forever. I want to be better and grow from this - but how can I? It feels like something I shouldn’t be allowed to move on from. I fear people will find out and maybe I deserve that. I want to be a better person and grow from this and not hurt people again. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). I would appreciate any former catfishers giving me advice on how to discuss this issue with a therapist, as well as how to process this guilt and shame.

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you."
279,I give up,"I’m giving up, I’ve been suffering for too long and my friend dying just adds to the overwhelming sense of hopelessness and sadness. I don’t wanna die necessarily but it’s the only thing to stop the pain."
280,Resources for Teen with OCD / Suicide tendencies,"Hi - I am looking for some resources for help with teenager with suicide thoughts. We have put him in two live in therapy centers for mental health, some of the best in the region. He is a smart student (advance placement in everything, over 4.0 GPA), senior in high school, but for some reason he has lost interest and said a few times he wants to commit suicide. We don't know if it is the side effect of the medicines he has been given (antidepressants, and another one for OCD).

We would like to find the BEST resource in the US for him, after 3 months in two different therapy centers his issues have not gone away. He is a brilliant kid, should be excited about going to college, but it seems COVID lockdowns (being at home) and also bullying at school has had its toll. 

Would appreciate any resources, doctors, therapy centers that you can recommend."
281,got what i wanted from life and feel worse than ever,"18m for context.

since elementary school I struggled socially bc of learning disabilities that i couldnt get therapy/meds for so i struggled in school also. but i thought my short term goal to be making friends and getting social validation nothing else mattered like education or family (lots of issues there) cause i just wanted to be loved and accepted. spent my childhood on online forums and only had a few friends we drifted apart though. started high school decent kinda tried in classes but didn't care bc i saw all other kids have friend groups and people support them i had nothing so i couldnt force myself to look to the future i saw nothing felt like nothing. senior year tried to improve made friends at my job, went to couple parties even, got a girlfriend who genuinely loves me i think which is what i wanted but i still feel empty inside. for example she texted to make plans but i cant bring myself to respond while 2 years ago i would be overjoyed at the idea of a girl wanting to spend time with me its weird. so my grades are bottom tier, no extracurriculars except some volunteering and at this point i dont think i can get into my state school bc of my gpa. anyways only options i see are trade school or cheapo college and joining the army or ROTC to pay for it cause my parents think college isnt worth it unless its ivy league or MIT but my dream as a kid was joining the army so thats cool ig. if u read this far i respect that lol i just dont know how to get help i think therapy or medication could help and im legally an adult but i dont have money for that looked at prices in my area its pretty insane. yea just wanted to vent maybe i have no idea where my life is going feels like im a rock staying still while time flies past me. ok this is done now promise but thanks for hearing me out guys :)"
282,I'm here for you,I'm here for you please help yourself you're not alone chat me Your loved by me for holding on. Hang in there *insert cat*
283,I know nobody will give a shit but thought I'd vent...,"I'm 15. My birthday is on Dec 3. My mental health issues have followed me my whole life. As long as I can remember I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. For the longest time, I was scared. I never let my feelings out, and I would never be honest with therapists. I let my emotions ruin my life. Finally, my parents sent me to inpatient at a mental hospital. I came in pissed, but after hearing other stories, something inside me clicked. I knew I needed to get the help. For the first time in my life, I vented. Start to finish I told the therapist my whole story. It hurt while I was telling it, but after it was out a huge weight was lifted off my chest. I realized that I wasn't a lost cause. I knew I could get help. For the past month and a half, I've constantly been going to therapy, and getting as much help as I can. I advise everyone out there, to vent as well. It is something that will hurt, but feel amazing afterwards. I hope everyone can stay safe. From your new friend, jmicheel19."
284,When you've lost motivation but don't think you're depressed?,"There are times, when I'm sad - and times when I'm overwhelmed, but it's not enough to affect my everyday life. What does affect my everyday life are the simple things. The trash, the dishes, my house, my hygiene. A few years ago it took me 4 days to unpack my house after moving, and I'm barely half way there 4 weeks later. I'm just tired and napping all the time. I work a full time job, take care of dinner and my dogs and husband, I just have NO motivation to do the adult-extras. And I didn't used to be like this. I dropped out of college years ago and talk about going back, but I lack the drive anymore. To be honest, the only time my house is in order and I'm being a productive adult is when I buy adhd meds (adderall, vyvanse) off of my friends. Otherwise, I might as well be a bump on a log. I'll wake up early, knowing and excited to be motivated by drugs. But I don't think I have ADHD either? I don't have insurance, I just need some general advice or direction. Because I've been lost doing nothing for the last couple of years, and I'm losing myself."
285,necessity withholding as punishment . . .,"for these past few days, i've been feeling as if i ""don't deserve"" sleep or water. i don't really worry about food much because i rarely get hungry thanks to my meds, but when i do, i just don't want to eat.

i recently had a self harm relapse, and the next day i didn't want to sleep. my friends had to beg me to sleep.

the thing is, i'm instinctively doing this, yet it's a very new habit to me."
286,Glad I didn’t go through with committing suicide,"Hey guys sorry for the essay but this was something I wanted to get off my chest for a long time. I posted this a while ago on true off my chest but I figured it could maybe help some people who are going through tough times here.

But anyways 2 years ago I almost took my own life. I’m still hate ashamed to admit it happened. I was 19 and my father had just committed suicide and as you can imagine it was rough on me. It led me to a deep depression where I didn’t feel like myself. I wasn’t doing good at all, I couldn’t focus on my classes so I dropped out of school. I was working a shitty job, I was distancing myself from my family and barley talking to anyone , I left my ex girlfriend for no reason and I just isolated myself. I started to become and alcoholic and I was drinking everyday to numb myself. And I was living in a bad side of town so I had no real friends that actually cared about me. I always tried to remain positive through it all but it just felt like it would never get any better

I started to get suicidal thoughts. At first I thought it was normal and maybe I was having a bad day/week but it went on for months. Eventually I was so frustrated with my life that I wrote my family a note and planned out a day to end it.

I was so tired of living, I couldn’t find a single thing to be happy about. Everyday I woke up I just immediately felt tired and defeated. My plan was basically to crash my shitty Toyota corolla on my way home from my night shift into a cement wall. So one day when I was having a breakdown and thought I had enough I decided I would do it. I was going about 80mph down the hill but I bitched out last second because I couldn’t stop thinking about the pain I would cost my family.

I never opened up to anyone about this or my depression and I don’t think anyone knew expect for my mom who could notice I was acting different. But looking back it now I’m grateful that I never went through with it. I got sober and I landed a better job and even started school with a new career that I actually enjoy. I moved away to a new state where I’ve had the chance to meet some great people and I got to hold my nephew which made it all seem worth it.So long story less long and as cliche as it may sound it gets better eventually. Hope you guys have a good day"
287,Here is a good list of support hotlines :),[https://theyouthalliance.com/resources/help-hotlines/](https://theyouthalliance.com/resources/help-hotlines/)
288,I dont know if im going to survive this time,"Stay at home mom to 3 year old. 32 weeks pregnant &amp; high risk (lots of pain and medical ptoblems), unmedicated schizoaffective, severe depression, and ptsd, no real support system.

As someone with schizoaffective, even at my best (medicated, not pregnant, physically heathy, no huge stressors) i usually crack under stress. What normal functioning people can handle without a problem is incredibly debilitating for me once it builds up. Like ive never been able to hold a job for more than 3 weeks because the set schedule and expections and overbearing bosses stress me out so bad that its like my brain melts. Ill end up depressed, paranoid, delusional, suicidal. And one day ill miss work without calling in, because im just so destroyed i cant get out of bed, and then i lay there for weeks trying to recover.

Before this pregnancy, i was actually kind of okay. I had my days. But i could take care of myself, clean, cook, and have fun with my son.

Well these days, all i have is stress. I lost my house, had to move unexpectedly. 3 weeks after that my car died had to pick up a car payment. My fiancee is a cook, so we got really behind financially with covid. Now hes back to working 12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Not that it helps because we cant pay our bills AND catch up. So were in an endless cycle of struggling now. Plus, i never see him. Im 32 weeks pregnant and high risk. I have SPD (lots of spinal and pevis pain), kidney problems, alpha thalassimia, now possible diabetes. Im basically on my couch all day every day. Alone with a 3 year old. Who destroys everything. And theres nobody to clean it. I usually do a 15 minute pick up once a day. But i have spinal problems and bending isnt really an option. Nobody will watch him for me or help clean. I have no friends. My only sibling lives 2.5 hours away. My dads never around. My mother is VERY unsupportive and actually toxic. Her verbal abuse has taken a toll on me. And  she will not watch my son unless im in the hospital dying. And even then, when i get discharged i get yelled at because i took too long at the hospital. My life is destroyed financially. On top of all this, its like everybody who knows me intentionally gives me a hard time. My and my fiancee havent been getting along the best because of my ptsd and paranoia. He can tell i isolate myself from him and usually dont want to be touched. Plus sometimes he gets rude and frustrated with me. Which is understandable considering im a mess and he works so much that theres nothing he can really do but watch me fall apart. Hom getting rude definitely makes it worse though. 

I just need a break. I need my phone to not ring. I need a baby sitter. I need someone to help at my house. I need to not be sitting in filth. I need people to stop putting their problems on me. Everyone always uses me as a doormat. Like nobody will just let me have some peace. I also just seem to have the worst luck. If something huge isnt wrong, 3 little things are going wrong all at once. Flat tire, stolen debit card, messed up paperwork i now need to call and fix.

My days consists of me laying on the couch in a destroyed house, stressing about money, feeling alone, feeling uselss, being in pain, wishing i had some sort of support or help. My 3 year old tears thru everything. And he gets bored and then acts out. (Before pregnancy we did scheduled activities and before covid we went out 2-3x a week for fun events for him). All i can do is sit and think anout how sad and stressed i am while getting yelled at by a toddler. I dont even have anyone to text. I cant handle it anymore. 

Anytime that i feel okay, something happens to stress me out. Now i can never relax. Today there was a moment where i realized things felt easy for about an hour. and every 15-20 i would feel severe anxiety and a sense of impending doom because i knew that if i relax for any amount of time then something terrible and  stressful is going to happen to me. 

Ive kind of worked out in my head that god is purposely giving me a hard time because its time for me to kill myself. Theres no way that my luck is this bad. It feels like im being targeted. 

The most i do is take care of my son. But me, i lay around, i cry, i dont eat, if i do eat its garbage because i cant find it in myself to cook anything, even instant foods. i dont brush my teeth, i lay on the shower floor and cry almost every night, but i dont always wash myself. I dont brush my hair. 

I literally lay down on my couch and just deteriorate sll day every day.

I cry throughout the day. Id say i have a minimum of 5 breakdowns a day at this point. At least 2 times an hour i think about how badly i want to die and how i cant wait for this baby to be born so im free to kill myself. 

I used to be excited for the baby. I waited so long to have this baby. I had 5 miscarriages due to genetic issues and was told i needed to try IVF. Hecqas concieved naturally 4 weeks later. This is a miracle baby. And now all i can think is that if im this stressed now, if im this invisible now, if im this lonely and sad now.... its going to be 100x worse after hes born.

My fiance keeps telling me ill feel better when im back on my meds. Theyll take 6 weeks to fully work. Assuming i dont give birth for another 5 weeks (37weeks), thats 11 weeks. I dont even think i can last 5 weeks. Sometimes i cry myself to sleep just because i know im going to have to get up in the morning and ill still be alive. And then i wake up and cry, because im alive and i have to live another day. 

There were times id stop taking my kidney and anemia meds in hopes that maybe id get sick enough that id end up in the hospital and they could save the baby and i would die.

And before you say my kids need me, they dont. I have schizoaffective and ptsd. Even on my good days im sick. And on my bad days im terribly sick. And no matter what, i will always be sick. 

I dont want to tell my doctors because they know my medical history. Whenever i get sick i have very bad suicidal tendancies. I cant get pinkslipped. I cant get admitted. Nobody will take care of my son, so my fiancee will have to leave work. Hes a cook. Theres no paid leave. So we would lose everything. And that would really ensure that im killing myself. 

I just dont know how to step away from it. I dont know how to relax. Ive never been so stressed or sad in my life. And ive been pinkslipped for suicidal tendencies and self harming 4 times. I have still never been this sick. It feels like my brain is crumbling. Sometimes late at night, when my fiancee is home, i get in my car and go sit in an empty parkinglot for an hour and just hyperventilate. 

I get so stressed that my blood pressure goes up, my heart races, i throw up, i cant breathe, i feel like im dying.

How am i suppose to survive this? Itll be weeks before i can even try medication. I just dont see it happening. Not with the way things are going. Not without someone helping me. not without a break and quiet and care. 

How do i survive this?"
289,"""I only feel pretty when I feel hungry""","I recently watched this video called ""When the Fat Girl Gets Skinny."" The title of this post is a quote from it. That quote is so powerful and something that's all too familiar to me yet I havent been able to describe it. I'm not talking about being overweight or anything, I've just developed an eating disorder drastically over the past year. Somethings always been like that in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, but it's gotten so much worse. My mind is in a constant state of anxiety and paranoia about how much I eat and exercising enough. But food is one of the few things that gives me pleasure, which makes it more complicated and frustrating. If I dont eat, I'm happy that I'm making ""progress,"" if I do eat, I have a mindset that I'm a failure, I'll never be good enough, that I lost progress of how much work and effort it took me to run so much. And I wont feel even slightly better till I wake up the next day when I'm thinner after having slept.

I've been running 6 to 10 miles a day with maybe one meal a day. As well as lifting some weights with my arms and doing situps. I'm scared to eat anything yet I do eat at least a little bit from the powerful urge of hunger and cravings. I wouldve run again today if my feet havent hurt so much that I can barely walk.

290,Need To Talk To Someone ASAP,I literally just need 5mins of anybody’s time to get food. I’m really hungry but i’m super paranoid right now because of my really bad fear of insects. If anyone can just make me feel relaxed while i’m doing what I need to do please add me on discord  #Kaale3265 or dm me ur number
291,It feels like there’s nothing left to get out of life,"I’ve always been a really up and down person, but it’s recently felt like my emotions are flatlining. I used to get so happy, then so sad so fast, but now everything feels like a haze. Everything feels the same and It feels like I’m living in the same present all the time and it feels like it lasts so long, but the past and future fly by because of it. Sometimes I find something that makes me happy and it’s a soaring high for a little less than a week if that, then it’s back to being a little lower than before. It feels like I suck the color out of everything I touch until all that’s left is a meaningless grey nothingness. I think so much about death that it feels inevitable. The only thing that’s keeping me is my partner. I love them and I want them to be happy, but I can’t live my whole life like this. I want so badly to not have any ties keeping me from finally being able to rest, but I don’t want to hurt them and potentially set them down the same path I’m on. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to hurt anyone. Sometimes I wish there wasn’t anyone who cared so I could just go without any impact but I know I can’t"
292,Bad memory a mental problem or just a “thing”,"
So I’ve noticed recently my HORRIBLE memory, like I mean “can’t remember thing I’ve been ranting about on the kitchen home alone from 5 seconds ago” memory, I sometimes forget things in an instant on a daily basis, I eventually remember from 5 minutes to over an half hour later or sometimes I never remember, I don’t know if this is a mental problem or just something I’m not good at or anything other than a mental issue, my mom has taken notice and my dad doesn’t seem to really care, despite it being the root of many arguments is this something I should see a doctor over?"
293,Causing myself a lot of difficulty for no reason,"I've been cutting alot recently. Usually I go through periods on and off. But I've just been doing it for weeks now. I usually just do my thighs, but recently I've moved onto my legs, and the other day I just had a break I guess and cut up most of my whole left arm and its really fucking hard to hide at home and at work. I keep forgetting when I'm cleaning and rolling up my sleeves. No one noticed yet. I guess I'm gonna try to take a break, I got someone to buy me a bottle of wine at work(very impulsively I feel really guilty about asking them) so maybe that'll help replace it tonight. I don't know why I can't just ask for help. It doesn't seem that hard but I can't. I'm really scared this is going to leave permenant scars and I'll have to wear long sleeves for a long time. I hope they don't last longer than the winter."

(long story short, I gotten an aerospace degree but the job market collapse. During this time I tried working a number of jobs, but I kept getting fired or was so depressed from working and getting harassed at work I've became suicidal. So instead of doing nothing I went back to school for a general computer degree. This was an AS since I couldn't afford to go directly for a BS. While I was there a teacher mentioned to me that I was only a handful of classes from a networking degree. One of the 2 was a 2x2 into my last degree which is a industrial degree with a focus on cyber security.) The first degree I almost didn't get due to my grades and I was having a hard time in school. For the rest of the degrees I was taken at max 2 classes at a time since that was all I could handle. In fact, at several points I tried working while doing this and I couldn't even handle that. The most I was able to deal with is what I do now. Selling stuff on Etsy using my 3D printer, making YouTube videos once in a while, and a few small things to make some money (like $100-$200 a month total). 

Anyways, during my AS I notice when I was able to get something that could get me into something down the road like being an intern. I flaked out on it. Like I did things like made applications for my school and stuff like that. But those were 1 off things. 

After getting into my BS I found everything was going good and my grades were good enough. I did at one point try more than 2 classes on my technical side and my grades dropped to the point where I almost gotten kicked. But as long as I kept it down to 2 classes, my mental state seemed to be at least to the point I could keep up with the test (it should be noted even with this I had to cheat in a number of classes even when taking 2 classes at a time). The reason why I'm bringing this up is towards the end of my degree I had to take a lot of stupid classes like one on weather, another in microeconomics, and a few others. Because I spent so many years in school and I just wanted it over I did a full 4 classes back to back for 2 semesters. This 10000% burnt me out, and I literally had to beg my teachers to pass me. If it wasn't for a mixture of cheating and begging to pass, I know I wouldn't of made it. 

Shortly after I gotten out I found out even with a degree no one still wanted me. I tried using my contacts a few times, and found many companies flaked out during meeting me or when they found out I'm autistic. Even with applying to higher end jobs than the manufacturing jobs I applied for in the past. I found in some interviews I was harassed for how I talk and think. Like flat out picking on me and laughing about it. In some jobs they kept lying about oh we are looking for x (coder, network, etc) and the people trying to help me said I don't x y z. And then they would interview me for 100% different job.

Around this time I tried to enact my backup plan which was to go into the military. I found out the military literally has policies from autistic people from joining. My dad looked into it since he had connections to major generals, and more than less the policy was put in after a few autistic people were harassed to the point some offed themselves and some were hurt so badly that there is an investigation on it still today. So it's more to protect us than anything else. And it was made in such a way that even if you did get in, you have to get it OK with every commanding officer, and pretty much anyone in the unit can make a stink about it which would end up getting the person kicked out. Like it's better for that than the person getting hurt or dying.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I started looking into things because it didn't make sense to me. I did everything that was asked of me. I stayed away from drugs, crime, etc. I actually went through college even when my teachers in HS said I shouldn't be able to graduate HS. I stuck out what jobs I could and only quit 1 job, but that was by force. And while I did get fired from many, I went out of my way to show I knew how to code and what not. Anyways, I came across studies saying people who are autistic and have degrees are 85% likely to be unemployed or underemployed. And I found studies on how the UK looked into how much of the homeless is autistic, and they found around some of the cities it was 65% or more. Then I found it was highly common for autistic people to be abused in work places and other places. 

I brought a lot of this up to my parents because it was looking like I simply am not going to get anything that will put a real dent in my life. Like beyond the fast food/retail industry. They agreed I can stay with them as long as need, but we made a plan. Where they would buy a farm and have things contracted out. That I would help them get it up and running, and keep things up. And I can be the farm manager. While this does make me happy, it should be noted that it's estimated that it will take close to 10 years before I would get a livable wage. Just harvesting the crops it will take 7 years for much of it to mature to that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, what brings me here is I'm having a hard time figuring out what is wrong with me. The other day I found a basic help desk job on indeed that I could get if I put in for it and it wasn't already taken down (maybe, some of these they hire people with multiple years of experience because the job market in my area is so poor). My anxiety shot up to the roof and I was extremely suicidal. And this was simply for seeing there was a job I realistically could get. And this that happens isn't anything new. 

So my anxiety is always up because I know if my parents get tired of me or want to just because. There isn't a single thing I could do to prevent myself from being homeless since I don't have the money/income to support myself. And then when it comes down to looking for any job and seeing there is one I could work (even part time), if I had a gun next to me I wouldn't be talking to you now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What is wrong with me? And don't give me the crap that there isn't anything wrong with me. This isn't normal.**

&amp;#x200B;

Note, there is a number of other things going on and a bit of info I didn't talk about since I don't think it relates. Like how even today I'm trying to work on doing independent product development and a number of other things (but none of it has made me anything). I mean something that might relate is how my entire family outside of my dad's parents, my parents, and maybe 2 or 3 others 1000% hates my parents and I. I believe it is due to my sister lying about us.  And the only thing I ever wanted in my life since I was a kid is a stable family and stable life. But the details going beyond that, I doubt it relates."
295,This sub seems to do little more than be a place to vent,"Don’t get me wrong, I think it does result in encouragement &amp; positive convos every once in a while. But a lot of the time it’s people who are really hurting that post &amp; then get either no response or a couple brief ones. Which makes sense given that we’re all hurting &amp; can’t really make the space for supporting others, but surely it hurts when you pour your heart into a post &amp; get a single upvote &amp; no comments, you feel? 

I have no suggestions on improving this but just wanted to address it - even if your post does not get a lot of engagement, please do NOT take it as another sign that nobody cares!! people do care! we just all are struggling too much to perhaps help like we could"
296,Almost made it through 2020 without it catching up to me. But it hit me finally.,"We all have had a year this year. 2020 has kicked the world in its teeth. I’ve been bearing it but today it’s all just kind of bubbles over and I still can’t truly let it out...so here I am.

Where do I even start. I have a decent enough job pay wise. I do enjoy my coworkers. But it’s a retail environment so there is honestly no recognition or reassurance you’re doing a good job. Our district manager is too busy with his local political career to really care so he comes in, finds something to complain about, then leaves. The part that gets me with work is I’ve been sick for a long time (type 1 diabetic) and it was known when I was hired. The first time I start having complications that keep me from work, our DM immediately went to the idea of firing me. It’s just disheartening knowing how much you put into a job, to be discarded so easily. 55-60 hour work weeks and any extra I can give...for nothing.

My marriage is doing okay. My wife and I have an apartment with just us and our dog. It’s expensive but we make due. Honestly we could tighten up our budget but it is what it is right now. Our neighbors are incredibly loud people. Music, movies, stomping around upstairs above us. Between the three of them up there...it’s never quiet. So we haven’t been sleeping well and irritability gets to us at times. We have complained, called the police when the noise was too much in the evenings, and before all of that we tried speaking to them directly. No luck. My wife has depression and it wells up from time to time. I’m not as attentive to this as I want to be. It’s hard for me honestly. Like I’ve always been one to keep it all in and it’s never expressed itself as much of anything to me until recently. So I haven’t been catching it and being a good husband in that regard. This year has been rough so it’s hitting her hard.

Fast forward to this summer and a big hit came. My mother suffered a major stroke on my birthday this year. And five years prior she had a heart attack on my birthday....that day is cursed. My mother is the most important woman in my life next to my wife. Our relationship is incredibly strong and I would go to the ends of the earth on my hands and knees for that woman. She is a truly amazing person and I’m incredibly thankful to have her. But when it happened, I was terrified. As you should be terrified but I was having issues even mustering the courage to go see her when she was in rehab after the hospital. Due to COVID I couldn’t see her for a month and afterwards it was through a window outside her room. After she had gotten back home I would visit a few days a week. But now I am having issues even doing that. It hurts me to hear how altered she speaks and how brittle she has become. It stays with me that she isn’t doing well and that soon...I’ll lose her. And it terrifies me. My dad is doing the best he can but caring for her has taken its toll on him. Our relationship is already not so great so it gets volatile quickly. The whole situation just stews in my head and I can’t keep myself composed with the idea of what’s happening and what eventually will happen.

Now good ol COVID throws us another curveball. My wife’s small office had an outbreak this last weekend. And everyone is home. She has tested twice and come up negative both times. However the department of health is issuing a quarantine order since she exhibits a lot of symptoms. I can’t risk staying at home with my mothers issues and my dads. Did I mention he has COPD? So I’m at home. Being a diabetic. With my wife who is symptomatic. I tested when I heard and it’s negative. But I’m still terrified. If I get it, it’ll suck. But how hard will it effect me? My immune system is shit. And to add to it...I can’t work with this going on. So when am I gonna get fired? Because my wonderful boss and great company values me so much. My head is swimming with all this and I have the motivation to go to work and go through the motions to make the day go, and sleep. My wife thinks I’m ignoring her, my friends think I’m ignoring them. My parents think I’m an asshole for ignoring them. But I just want to sleep, or not interact with people. I’m an avid online gamer and I don’t even want to do that.

So, it’s been tough. I don’t know what to do. I could confide in my wife, but she’s spiraling with her own depression and I would never want to burden her further. Things have been financially tough with us too. Things have been behind and we have been floating bills as best we can. The cherry on top of this whole thing. Is at 8pm tonight I went to walk my dog...and my car has been towed. I’m fairly sure it’s a repossession but won’t know until I can speak with someone tomorrow. I’ve been behind on the note due to household and medical complications a few months ago, but I honestly didn’t think it was that behind and I had a plan to get things caught up. After this call tomorrow we can probably add to the rant about how I have to pay crazy money all at once get my car back, ruining Christmas gifts n stuff, or how I lost my car...which is one of the only things I have going on outside a place with my wife and dog that I enjoy. I’m a car guy and this thing is one of my top 5 dream cars. And now it’s gone. Or stolen. But the cops won’t even put it in the system because they’re convinced my car got repossessed. 

I have no idea what to do. I haven’t really processed everything. I can’t even muster up enough in me to cry, be physically upset, or even angry. I’m just...here. But whenever I stop and just think, or try to go to sleep, the entire years worth of bullshit and everything just churns and I can’t get on top of it. But I don’t cry, I don’t express it. It’s just in there. I’m drowning in my own head while wearing a sarcastic personable mask to face the world. I can’t even try to express it because before long I just shut down. I can’t even express it all without just hitting a damn wall. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I just want for everything to stop piling on so I can start trying to process what’s already in there.

Sorry for any spelling, grammatical, or format issues. I’m sitting on my porch looking at the empty spot where my car was while touring this on my phone."
297,People clamming up when I'm not being nice,"All the adults in my life love to just stop talking when I don't respond well to interrogations on stuff.

It's really great when I just don't want to talk on my eating habits so my step-mom stops talking to me and starts quietly singing along with the radio. /s

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of a useless post but I wanted this out there."
298,I failed University because of COVID19 I know it’s not my fault but I’m spiraling into a deep depression.,"So I live in Melbourne Australia. We had a brutal lockdown period where I didn’t leave the house for months at a time. One of my pets became terribly ill and my partner fell into terrible bouts of anxiety and depression. 

Between all of this I was in my final year of Uni. 

I worked my ass off and produced some truely amazing work for my portfolio. Despite this I’ve failed my course. I fell apart, didn’t leave my bed for weeks. Missed an entire unit simply because I couldn’t complete it from home. 

So I’m going to fail. And I feel no motivation to finish any of my classes because what’s the point? 

I feel pathetic, I have terrible self loathing right now. My partner is very supportive, but I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m a good student, I work hard, I’m studious, I’m passionate and despite all of it I’ve still failed. 

Any words of advise? Anybody in a similar boat? I feel like my whole world is crashing down... 

TL;DR 

I failed Uni because of COVID-19 and now I feel like I’m falling apart."
299,Feeling like a different person since bullying,"Feelings of emptiness and self pity but then massive spurts of motivation and confidence. I have some narcissistic traits but I hide and control them.

These don’t last like bipolar does, it’s usually lasting between 2-6 hours for both and happen 2-4 times a week. During its absence I’m just sort of empty and very sceptical about everything, could be my Adderall for my adhd but it happens when off meds as well. Also losing my empathy towards other people but still care about them in a more “selfish” way. 

I’ve experienced hallucinations every now on then, usually figures or bugs, maybe it’s my past drug use or my diet idk. Diabetes has also been a major factor in my life this year (type 1) and just recently diagnosed."
300,i am mentally prepared to die,i think i have finally come to terms with the fact that i am no longer afraid of it and i am prepared to die tomorrow and everyday after if it needs be. i cant say my life was the the worst but it was definitely not enjoyable. i had some good times but of course life will always be a roller coaster and thats what you should be okay with. i hope yall can find a light one day because none of yall deserve to feel as empty and lonely as i have for the past decade. with that being said please take care of yourselves and i love all of you all! if you dont hear ut enough i love you! i love you! i love you! i love you so much! as for me please dont worry as there isn't any thing i can do for me at this point i will be fine! with that being said take care everyone. i will sleep and wake tomorrow feeling fearless as i have ever felt! &lt;3
301,I tried to kill myself yesterday,"I’m sorry, I just need to share with someone not involved. My Dad came home unexpectedly early. I had my note set up and a sign on my door telling whoever found me not to come in a just call the police. He didn’t listen and burst in. I had just put the pills in my mouth. I’ve been suicidal for years now, but this is the first time I’ve gotten so close. I went to the hospital last time I was this bad. I can’t go through it again. I can see my parents fear, and their sadness. I hate it. I knew it would hurt them, but I feel like by living I’m just drawing out their pain. I didn’t mean to make this a lingering thing. My family is amazing. I love them more than I have words to describe, but I’m not strong enough to stay. I hate the thought of putting them through this again, but what can I do? I feel like I have to wait until after Christmas at this point, but I don’t know if I can make it. I have a psychiatrist who I’ve been in contact with every two weeks for the past 3 months. Nothings working. I wish I had died yesterday and gotten it over with. I feel so bad for my parents. I can’t find a balance that all of us can live with"
302,How do I make my brain stop forming su*cidal thoughts?,"My mind thinks su*cidal stuff when left on autopilot. It's getting worse everyday. To be fair, I don't really want to live. At this point, mental illnesses make my life seem like hell. But I'm so scared when thoughts like ""ok, so after university you'll go to ... and buy ... (easily accessible chemical cleaning agent with a letal dosis of 100ml or 1.4 ml per kg bodyweight), then you'll drink it at around 6pm and hopefully be dead by midnight"" pop up in my head because they're so urging and I'm afraid I'm actually going to listen to them.
How do I quiet these thoughts so I'm not actually going to harm myself?"
303,Can people ever have the ability to be truly kind and empathetic?,"I believe every human attaches a sense of ego with everything it can be attached to; eg.- ego of the pain we've suffered &amp; considering it to be unique, ego of being kind, ego of being humble etc. I feel if everyone accepts the pathetic state of being that the humans are in right now, and allow some psychological space to change themselves, and at the same time allow some psychological space for others to change, it would be just a little better place to live in. 

Everytime I try this with any friend/relative/human, while they enjoy the space I provide them where I don't judge them for thinking out loud but I always end up being judged for some mistake or just for having a different thought process. 

I always end up hating human interaction and as I grow up, I only become more and more distant from social relationships, which makes me question whether it is practical to expect this space from people ? Do I just stop having these expectations and just keep certain thoughts to myself and never share? Or do I need to get used to people judging me?"
304,Can someone tell me whats happening?,"Everyday whenever I do something, I did that thing. But after a few hours I start thinking ""did that really happen?"" and I still have very bug memories of whatever I did but I always think ""did that really happen"". And it doesn't have to be just from that day, it could be an event from a couple of weeks ago, some of my past traumas."
305,How can I not cry when getting yelled at?,"So I really need a solid way to not cry when getting yelled at or when someone for eg a parent) is saying something that brings up old trauma or deeply hurts you. 

Whenever someone does that to me, (it’s mostly my parents) my mind gets dizzy and I can’t think straight and I start crying immediately. I try to hold it in but my eyes get so full that the tears eventually flow and I don’t like it. I don’t want to be seen as that I want to come off as a stronger person and not someone who cries so easily just becoz the other person doesn’t recognise your interest or hobby. 

Is there a solid way to combat this? Pls don’t recommend googling or taking deep breaths, looking elsewhere, excusing myself, remaining calm, pinching myself, etc becoz I’ve already googled it and this stuff doesn’t work."
306,Is it just me?,"Hi just a month ago I was diagnosed with cyclothymia. And I was wondering, it is completely normal to go from having a great time and feeling super great and laughing to just suddenly crying? Is this apart of the illness? I know that it is a less known bipolar disorder, but is it apart of the illness? I was just given a brief explanation from my doctor but I wasn’t really explained that well. Sorry if this question seems rather dumb."
307,tw i want to kill myself so badly,"maybe just.. slice open my stomach... till its bleeding profusely.. then pour peroxide on it, while its still fresh.. stick needles into my exposed flesh.. dig into the wounds with the blade..."
308,What's wrong with my brain?,"I feel like I experience the world vastly differently than everyone else. Which in general doesn't affect my life, other than having vastly different opinions on matters than the people I engage with. But sometimes when I feel disconnected from the world I find it hard to understand what people are trying to communicate with me. I went to therapy for about 6 months and was hospitalized for suicidal ideation. I was diagnosed with psychotic depression and have been medicated with antidepressants and antipsychotics since then. But I feel like... The way I perceive the world is still not right. I can't exactly pinpoint what it is. I do experience odd intrusive thoughts. And I feel like. Idk. Like the world is made of plastic. And I'm a robot not in control of my actions. I don't mind being different but it annoys me that society doesn't comply to the way I feel I should live. I want to isolate myself. Be withdrawn from other people. Living things in general are unpredictable. That's why they're so much harder to portray in art than static nonliving objects. I don't like people but I still am forced to interact with them daily. If I could live without interactions with people, but also without having to conform to the societal norms of ""you have to be awake during the day and sleep at night. You have to go to school and go to work"" We're forced to conform to the demands of the majority. Everyone has free will. Therefor everyone should be entitled to living a good life no matter their choices. If I find it physically impossible to find motivation for working or furthering my education then I should be able to live the same life as someone who does. I know I'm in the minority but society has to move as slowly as it's slowest person. The people like me should be supported by the mentally stable people who can hold a job. A sort of... structured anarchism. What do you think, the internet? lol"
309,Sanity,"I have no idea if i have a mental illness because I haven’t gone to a professional to get diagnosed. I am mentally unstable and I know this because of how i act and how fast my emotions change. 

The reason i’m making this post is because something just happened that made me terrified of myself. I was just watching a youtube video about “golf it” and then suddenly my mind starts thinking about suicide and I don’t know exactly what I was thinking because i tried to block it out, but i’m terrified because as i was trying to block those thoughts out i just started to cry and this is when I thought i was going insane. My question is just what’s wrong with me do I have depression or something?

A page dedicated to how much I love her and why (I'd include photos of the two of us in it to), a page for her to list things she's grateful for and a page for her to write down her goals. I was also thinking of including a page full of a bunch of positive quotes and I may also include  spare pages for her to journal in.

As I said I'm in need of suggestions for other things to include so fire away please and thank you."
313,"High achiever, always excelling in what I do, OK with money (not rich), OK with love, OK with health in general, but always anxious.

Back then I was worried about grades. Every now and then I tell myself: ""if I reach this goal, I won't be anxious anymore"", but then a new goal appears in the horizon. I reach that goal, I go back to being anxious. Right now I am doing OK in terms of money, love life, status (if that is a thing), but the pandemic has added some sadness to my anxiety.  I am making money well above the average person, but I feel sad about my career choices in the past: I could have chosen a career with less responsibility and more money (for example, I could have chosen to be a therapist and make money when engineers and scientists come to me to cry about their choice of a stressful career). As you might have understood, I am biased and I am a bit like Rick Sanchez, so I am afraid therapy won't help me. With my distrust towards therapy, how do I make myself feel less anxious?

317,How have you dealt with a narcissistic in-law?,"How have you dealt with a narcissistic in-law?

If you made it thru this whole post, thank you and I’m sorry 😂. I’m sure it’s gonna be pretty long 😬

My wife’s mother is a narcissist. Pretty text book stuff: manipulative, controlling, guilt trips constantly, never been nurturing or mothering to my wife. My wife does see and acknowledge it. She’s actually the one who told me first that her mom is a narcissist so I’m not labeling people randomly, this is straight from my wife. However, even with this self diagnosis of her mother, she doesn’t see it as all that bad. It’s rarely huge stuff, it’s the smaller things that I know are stemming from a huge root cause. I feel as if my wife’s relationship to her mom is healthy, but her mom’s relationship to her is extremely unhealthy, which basically negates any healthiness on my wife’s side. My MIL also takes every bit of information her kids tell her as if she “owns” the information. For instance, if we say we’re doing X, she feels free to tell everyone else in the family that we’re doing X, crossing personal space and boundaries. My MIL constantly puts my wife and her siblings down, saying things like “well I tried to teach her Y but she’s your problem now!” and then in the same conversation lecturing my wife as if she’s 12 again. My MIL has also done some pretty terrible things to me and my wife, but my wife “graciously” forgives her and just comes right back. My MIL is never wrong and always the victim. She’s got major hypochondria and always has some new health kick she’s on where we have to prepare food around her diet. I know for a fact my MIL knows what she’s doing because she tiptoes around me and one of my brother in laws (we’ve both been very vocal about these things and regularly tell her “no”). I thought we had a bit of a breakthrough earlier this year when she was at odds with her mom for a couple weeks, but she’s fallen back into a life of no boundaries with her mom and our nuclear family.

Lemme give a bit of back history here before I go any further. My wife was adopted into an extremely conservative family along with a handful of her other siblings. She came with a lot of trauma that she’s pretty much worked through entirely (I’m super proud of where she is given her past), but her growth now seems to be inhibited solely by her mother. Sadly my family hasn’t been super accepting of our marriage so it’s just pushed my wife straight into her mom’s arms. Up until a month before we got married (~1.5 yrs ago), my MIL treated her like trash until I think she realized that if she wanted any part of our lives, she needed to act better. Since then, my wife finds almost no fault with my MIL and continues to share all of our life with my MIL, causing issues for me with personal boundaries.

I have a lot of concerns with my in laws because  of the above. My MIL can guilt my wife into a LOT, although my wife is doing much better about saying no. My wife also changes around her and won’t wear certain clothes (modesty 🙄) or eat certain foods (my MIL is a health freak) at her parents house and all of it is causing my wife personal growth issues. Plus the fact that this seeps into our marriage: “why don’t you wanna go to my parents house?” or the fact that I’m very uncomfortable with my wife spending any period of time with my MIL alone.

So questions:

How do I help my wife break free? It’s not healthy for her, i feel like it’s inhibiting her personal growth. She’s very closed off to trusting new people and doesn’t really have a strong mothering/mentoring figure in her life.

What does a healthy mother &lt;-&gt;daughter relationship look like? I don’t really have a good frame of reference for what a healthy and normal relationship from mother &lt;-&gt; daughter looks like. Like I mentioned, I feel like my wife is sharing pretty normal stuff with her mom and I don’t ever feel upset when she tells her friends the same personal information. Yet I always feel like personal boundaries are crossed when I hear my wife telling her mom about details of our life.

What do I need to do, if anything? I am a fixer (what guy isn’t) and a vocal one at that. It stresses my wife out when I point out things because she doesn’t like to rock the boat. Most of the kids in the family just live with the consequences of a narcissist running the family and don’t want to cause any issues. I don’t always like rocking the boat but when I do, it’s with calculation and for something super important. I want to still be respectful of my in-laws, b/c as soon as I stoop down to the level of crossing boundaries myself, I undermine everything I say.

Anyone have thoughts/suggestions?"

319,My therapist is a good person. He helps me a lot and I'm gonna miss him,"I really messed up when I stopped taking lexapro for 4 days. The first 3 days were fine, with the exception of a little headache sometimes, but then the fourth day was absolutely horrible. I went back to having bad urges of cutting (which I didn't have in 3 years). I was very suicidal, I called the suicide hotline thrice in 2 days with very strong urges to jump off the roof. 

My therapist is a kind person. I don't know how, but he tells me all the right things. I feel like I'm fucking dumb, and that I have zero motivation to study even though I have the opportunity to study and a good life, but he makes me feel alright, he tells me it is okay to feel that way and that I'm not stupid. I'm in a great program and my parents fully sponsor my studies. I feel like I've been born with a silver spoon, but then my therapist says that what I thought was a good childhood was not normal. I had experienced the extremes of helicopter parenting. Looking back, what he said is absolutely right. I just hate to think that what I thought were happy memories aren't at all. 

I'm gonna go back home for quite a while in 2 weeks and I'm scared how I would manage without him. He's a great friend to me and I would really miss him. He helps me a lot and doesn't think of me as an annoyance like everyone in my life."
320,kinda get super sad and breakdown when i see people with their fathers,"my bitch ass blood father was and still abusive, he was away most of the time and never really bonded with me. I grew up with a lot of issues that now i know are because of his absence. He is a total loser, a very weak and stupid man who doesnt take responsibility of anything. Man... i never knew how these feelings are tbh, i broke up with the only girl that i loved because she had a family you know? she had a lot of gr8 stuff, she had something of a father instead of her abusive blood one. im 17, and i just lose my mind when i remember that i will never get to enjoy that. I really dont lookup to a lot of people that much, i kinda consider myself to be the only family i got, i have 0 real life friends and like 2 online ones. idk anymore, but everytime i remember this i understand that probably im gonna end up hanging like 20 years later. not being dramatic but being real, i try so hard to runaway from the fact that i will never get to expeirence having a father. People told me i can still be the ""god son"" or something of someone and they be my ""god family"" but i dont get how this works, whats the point of having a family if im like 20 something and already grown up? how much time it will need to bond and reach that level? and seriously how pathetic it would be to move in there lol. I wanted always this, living with a good father at least, having all the cliche father-son shit. dam bro my blood bitch didnt even have the talk with me, i knew all from the internet lmao. so now i see something posting a photo of him and his fucking dad both looking very fucking close and im about to have a break down and shit this life is fucked up man"
321,Scary Physical Symptoms of Anxiety and Panic Attacks,"Hey guys, I have been suffering from GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and Panic Disorder since the summer of last year. I took anti-depressants (Lexapro) at that time for two months, and I overcame my anxiety and panic,

This summer, my anxiety and panic has returned like never before alongside new, scary, physical symptoms which seem to only get worse with time. It is driving me absolutely crazy because I am having a lot of difficulty coping with the physicality of this. I feel continuously stressed all the time and have recently developed two extremely debilitating symptoms. Heart palpitations throughout the day and frequent feeling of blood rushing to my head which causes me to sweat and heat up, starting from my forehead. My cheeks also start to hurt and I can feel tension in my jaw and my entire face even though I make a conscious effort to relax my face and jaw throughout the day. Sometimes I feel like I'll have a stroke as if there's something stuck in my head which isn't moving and my head becomes heavy. I can literally feel it throb at times, and can feel the throbbing in my ears.

I wanted to ask if anyone else suffers from this on a daily basis and how they cope with this because this is greatly affecting the quality of my life and my happiness. I am not seeing a way out apart from medication at the moment and the last thing I want to do is to take medication for this.

Thank you in advance to anyone who steps forward. Cheers!"
322,Can someone help me out here please?,I have anxiety and depression and i think i may have BPD but i am not 100% sure about that. I dont know what this is maybe a sensory thing?. I cannot wear jeans due to the feeling of the fabric makes me feel so uncomfortable and ill and fidgety. I also cannot wear jumpers under jackets or anythhing bulky because of the feeling is disgusting. I am now not able to sleep with clothes on while going to bed because i can never find comfort. I also dont like wearing socks because of the feeling on my toes. I have hearing sensitivity also. Breathing is the number 1 problem that just fills me with anger. I cannot stand people breathing. I have to leave the room. I am probably just over thinking this but i am not sure.
323,Has anyone used something like Talkspace or better help to get therapy?,"So far I really like the appeal of Talkspace, because it’s online and I feel more comfortable typing than I do talking. I really just wanted to get a perspective from others before I committed. 

Also, the pricing. On talkspace, the cheapest plan is $65USD/week which is billed as $206USD monthly without insurance. With my insurance, it’s a $30 copay “each visit” (so once per week I’m assuming). I just wanted to get a clearer picture of in-office therapy pricing before I shelled out money for this."
324,"Younger brother (19) has psychosis, parents are a mess themselves and I will be moving out.","My younger sibling is suffering  through psychosis. It has been 4 years, and he has refused to take any  kind of therapy and medications. He is becoming more aggressive day by  day, throwing stuffs around the house and at everyone. Following are his  current symptoms:

1. Complete social disconnect (we both are introverts)
2. hearing voices in head
3. frequent twitching (in every 5 minutes on average)
4. delusions like he is exact copy of certain singer and possess same talent
5. loss of appetite
6. lost a lot of weight
7. has a bend posture, i.e, scoliosis
8. personal hygiene is down
9. sudden and extreme mood swings
10. he thinks he super creative and don't need any therapy.

I  am the only person he talks to. My mom and dad are a big mess up in  themselves, they shout and fight every day. Some times the fights get  physical which then I have to stop them. They already hate each other  and are frustrated because of my brother's mental and physical health.

There  is always tension in the house one way or the other and it has started  to give me anxiety now. I graduated my college this year and returned  home because of corona break, but I am looking for a job now and I will  be soon out of this place.

My  problem is, I am the only friend he has, if I leave, will he be able to  survive? I am just 23, so I have to focus on my career too, but I care  about him so much that it keeps me worried that how we he survive  without me.  Obviously, my parents are worsening the problem by keep the  house all tensed up.

Sorry for wasting your time by writing this long para, I don't know what to do, please suggest something. Thanks."
325,Weird memory association thingy?? Idk what.,"Hey, so about 5 times per day I randomly remember to breathe and that forces me to start breathing manually. But, for some reason I have associated a bunch of stuff with that reaction in my brain. (For example the most common thing I remember is the phrase: I’m alive. I sort of pretend like it’s a split personality since after I forget to manually breathe I forget pretty much every thought I’ve had in that time. It’s only when The event triggers that I can remember what I was thinking.) I honestly have no clue what this is, like am I just being stupid about the whole thing?"
326,idk if i want to talk to anyone abt my stuff anymore..,"I've always talked abt my problems, worries etc, to ppl openly, but after i did probably the biggest mistake of my life, which i will talk abt soon, i haven't felt this deeply depressed ever.. i can't talk to anyone irl abt my problems anymore.
so uh abt the biggest mistake i think I've done so far..
i have been in love with sm1 over the Internet for over an year.. and i just.. left her.. and i haven't heard from her in a week.. and im getting worried abt her not being alive anymore which makes me want to end my life too.
and also a bit more i should probably tell, is that I've never had any irl friends or anything, ever, and im 18 in June..
idk what to do with my life anymore.

327,How can I battle social anxiety,"For anyone suffering with social anxiety, how can I battle this? I hate the thought of going to the doctors, but especially to express myself because it makes me cry and heightens my anxiety! Some days I can fake my confidence when I first meet people and they always say ""you're such a happy bubbly person"". But then as time goes on my true self comes out and people ask, ""r u ok today u seem off"". I have been with my partner 5 years now and still can not hold a conversation with the family, IM SO AWKWARD! Even if I have no seen my family for a while I am really awkward with them! People think I'm just shy but Im really not. I have so much energy inside and wanna do so many things...but my anxiety stops me!! Please can someone help me, its eating me alive! Is there any advice people have gave you that helps?"
328,Which door keeps cracking open?,"It's strange, but in my mind everything is stored in various rooms in a large open labyrinth. I have memories that exist in every room and I've made the conscious decision not to open many of them due in large part to the fact that my past no longer matters to me. I know a lot of bad things happened and that's all I need to know. It's all under lock and key though, so it's not a problem. That being said, something new keeps happening. As if one of the doors keeps opening just enough for me to get a sense for what I was feeling at the time of the stored memory I keep getting roughly 2 seconds of what I'm fairly certain is the same memory over and over again resulting in no recollection of any issues, but just a brief moment of absolute panic followed immediately by whatever I was feeling before the door cracked open and then it's shut again. The only question is, where is the door?"

331,More of a vent but advice is welcome,"I'm (22M) and I've been dealing with schizophrenia like symptoms for about 7 years now, I've tried to get help but struggle to ask for appointments and help in my area of England is shocking.

So I've been seeing animal that don't exist and hearing whispers for 7 years now but recently  about 2 years ago things have got worse I've been hearing almost clear voice that tell me horrific things and people screaming in pain I've also been seeing monsters and people daily.

I don't really ever tell anyone because I feel paranoid so I guess I'm doing this now haha.

Hope everyone is good today 😂
Also feel free to ask me anything 😄"
332,Mental Health + Relationship,"I've disclosed to my partner my history with mental health a while back which includes major depression and ADHD. I told him I started with adderall and another pill but the adderall wasn't effective for me so I stopped it. My therapist increased the dosages a few times but I eventually stopped it altogether due to no improvement. She changed my other meds and had me try it with adderall again thinking it might help improve efficacy. I stopped using it again after no improvements. I was moved to concerta monday instead of adderall and had some anxiety symptoms tuesday so I told him later that Tuesday night about my change in medication and why I may have been overthinking at times (which i stated to him to clarify for me or to give me some time to relax before responding to him).

 My first anxiety episode was me wondering if he was angry with me. I recognized my building emotions and asked him so I could know for sure and not be super anxious. 

My second episode was in text messages. I have an issue where if someone doesn't understand me I get frustrated and I get anxious over how to clarify or explain myself esp if their comprehension of what I've said so far is way off. I told him then that my anxiety was building up and I'd cut the conversation short. He didn't ask any questions and said okay until tuesday night. 


Tuesday Night, I told him about my medication changes. He asked me about why I need the new medication, what's all the medication I'm taking, and what my issue was. I only told him about my adderall and concerta but not the specific depression medication. I said that adderall wasn't working for me so I was trying something new- concerta. He then told me how he was diagnosed with ADHD when he was younger but his mom took him off it and then he didn't have ADHD anymore. His mom told him she just spent more time with him and socialized him to help? He then asked me what problems was ADHD causing in my life. I kind of clammed up right there as he recited some stuff I told him before. There are more issues it causes for me but I'm not yet comfortable with telling him yet (this is a new relationship). He said he wanted to know because he was wondering if I needed my medication and for what reason. I said yes I need it for ADHD to help me manage. He then said ""im asking because I'm just trying to see if you have even tried on your own without medication to help with the issues"". That's where I kinda broke down. We were on the phone so i stepped away for a bit instead of answering. Not sure if my medication is a factor but I believe I would react similarly without it. I cried for a while and went back to the phone after I could hold back how I was feeling in the moment a bit better.  He noticed my mood was down after I came back but I don't think he knows how much it hurt for me to hear that. I know 90% that it wasn't intentional but I still feel sad and upset that he'd ask me that. One part of me feels I'm justified while the other part is saying the question was not bad and I'm overreacting but I'm still feeling distraught to have someone say ""did you even try?"" &lt;--- as I came to understand what he said. 


Forgot to mention above but I also have generalized anxiety which I dont think I've mentioned to him but it does show in my personality."
333,My sister is really.....different?,"My sister has been having more and more of what I can only describe as bipolar episodes. The other day she woke up and my brother said something mean to her after they fought, which they always to and they never listen when my mom try’s to stop them, and she had a 1hr long crying freak out. Some of the things said we’re almost like delusions. “NOBODY EVER GIVES ME ATTENTION, YOU ALL HATE ME” “I ALWAYS GET YELLED AT” “YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME” and one of the worst things I heard was she was saying that she hated her life, was ready to die, and when my mom was going to grab her to bring her to a mental hospital because she was doing this without yield for an hour she said “OH YEAH OK, GRAB ME AROUND THE NECK SO YOU CAN KILL ME, IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN? JUST DO IT, KILL ME” guys she’s only 7?!!!! I know you guys aren’t doctors and only a professional could diagnose an issue but what’s wrong? Today she woke up and had a screaming fit to not go to school for ONE DAY. SHE ONLY HAS TO GO 2 days because of COVID and she woke up, freaked out because she was “scared to go to school” and gives different reasons every time we ask why. She only stops when she gets her way. My mom is about to HAVE TO GO TO FUCKING COURT BECAUSE MY SISTER LITERALLY WONT GO TO SCHOOL. We’ve been trying to get help but EVERY    SINGLE     TIME   WE TRY IT GETS CANCELED OR SOMETHING COMES UP. Idk if it’s a case of mental issues or a demon but I need someone to let me know if you know what’s wrong, or take a guess or something. She’s literally afraid to go to the doctor because they’ll kill her???? Nobodies said anything about doctors killing her or people she just made it up."

335,What do you do in uncontrollable circumstances?,"I’m sure it’s true for most, including myself, that 2020 has been the most hellish year of any I’ve experienced. I’m stuck living with in-laws. My spouse is recovering from heart surgery. There are no jobs available. And of course, the in-laws are horrendous and make my life feel like that of a caged animal. It also has affected our son who is showing signs of depression and mood swings. That part kills me. 

My spouse and I have intense sorrowful conversations almost every night now and we both hate our lives currently. And there’s nothing we can do right now to get things back on track. What the hell do you do when absolutely everything is out of your control? How do you cope and stay sane enough to keep from crying all day? Just please some help on how to distract myself or something."
336,Living with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)/ Self-harm," I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old.

 I want to say I am a survivor but I am not actually. I would be a survivor if I overcame my fears and wanted to live after my life was saved. But I still can’t get that thought out of my head that thought every once in a while, I get when I am holding a knife. That thought of hurting myself again and again. Those scars are just a tiny bit of all of the others. There are other visible scars all over my body and those are only what’s visible. Other scars are still within me but it doesn’t show itself. I was in grade six which means I was just 11 years old when I attempted suicide for the first time, but the first self-harm cut was when I was 10 years old. Since then cutting myself isn’t the only way I coped up. When I was 12 years old, I drank some poison, I vomited blood but that was it, I survived. Then again at 12, I filled my thighs and hands with deep cuts. Luckily those early years of self-harm didn’t leave any scars. I went through a phase where I would wake up in the middle of the night and start slapping myself, pulling my hair out, crying without a break, hitting my head on the wall. Then when I was 14, I tried overdosing myself to death. I don’t what those pills were but I took 5 different kinds of pills, each contains at least ten tablets and I swallowed them all without crushing. I survived. I mean I was constantly nauseous and dizzy for three days straight and nobody noticed still I survived. Then a few months later something triggered, (oh and I don’t hurt myself on impulse. I actually think months before actually hurting myself in any way.) So, a few months later I drank half a bottle of dark phenyl. Burned my taste buds for months and also burned every time I swallowed because my neck felt like it was glued together. I cut myself several times through the years but at 16 I jumped, from the top of my house. I jumped from a 3 and a half story building and didn’t even have a scratch on my body oh and I had actually cut my hand a day before that which required 12 stitches on my left arm. That was the last my I actually hurt myself to that extent. I have had thoughts even recently but I am holding on and I am lucky that I have someone who accepts and loves this side of me too."
337,Misdiagnosis? Insurance and health concerns,"I will try to keep this short. A couple years ago was hospitalized for a manic episode. This plus a history of depression got me a diagnosis of bipolar, but I don't believe it is accurate.

On the diagnosis: I was definitely manic, and with a history of depression that seems to be enough for psychs to say ""yep bipolar"" and move on. But I had some heavy drug use during that period (\~1g weed concentrate every couple days, DMT a month prior) and some MAJOR changes in life circumstance (left behind a career and identity shortly before). As far as I am concerned, I pushed myself too far and snapped. I needed time and space to recover which I have been getting.

The problem: I am being prescribed meds for bipolar. Depakote is bad for your liver, hence the blood tests. This medicine is doing my body harm, and I don't believe it's helping anything. (I do not accept that bipolar is accurate here: my mood has never ebbed and flowed as described, and isn't very fragile.) I want to get off it but I don't know how to sort this out with a psych. I brought up concerns about my diagnosis with my last couple of doctors and was summarily shut down - one made it clear that she thought I was my own worst enemy for rejecting my diagnosis (but did not share this with me at first). I have no idea how to combat this, especially because I can't be logical with respect to meds.\[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if there are insurance concerns with discontinuing treatment? I'm mostly worried that my medical record will say ""bipolar"" and my insurance company will say ""yep, untreated"" and deny me benefits at some point down the road. (Yes, I'm in the USA...) Is this a serious concern? Should I keep fighting to get the diagnosis removed? (Is this hopeless anyway? It definitely seems like it.) Are there alternatives - should I try to find a psych that is OK without meds? (Re: doctors, I feel really bullied and powerless and I don't know what to push back on. Initially I treated them like other doctors and followed orders; now I feel like they generally have no idea what's going on and I should basically figure it out on my own and just go to them for advice. Attitude help also appreciated.)

&amp;#x200B;

\[1\] what I mean here: the meds ostensibly prevent mania. My argument is, ""I'm not at risk of mania and don't need the meds."" But the counter-argument is ""well the meds are keeping mania at bay so we better not remove them."" That's only true if you accept the premise (that there is underlying mania/bipolar), and since a doctor will never advocate going off medicine, this basically means there's no legitimate way to challenge this diagnosis. I have gone off the meds on my own for \~6 months and felt no discernible difference, but I really do not want a discrepancy between what's in my body and what my doctor puts on my medical record. And I don't feel comfortable telling a doctor this - instead of convincing them with evidence, I think all it will do is convince them that I can't be trusted to take  meds. :-\\"
338,Panic attack,"I don’t have panic attacks often but when I do I always have a good reason for it (like an actual problem). Today I had a panic attack when I was getting ready to study (totally fine with studying, I was even excited for it) but when I sat down I almost lost my mind because I felt like my desk was too full and I kept trying to clean it up but it wasn’t working. I took away as many books as I could but it still felt like it was too full and it gave me one of the worst panic attacks. I don’t know why it happened but my heart’s still racing. 

Can anyone tell me why this happened or what I can do to prevent this from happening again? Even now when I look at it, it’s frighteningly full, I don’t understand why I feel like this. It’s feels like some sort of phobia, but I’ve never experienced anything like this. I even sat at my desk a couple times already but it happened this time. Help"
339,Is paychoterapy supposed to be that hard?,"I mean... When I teach others things that I am highly experienced with, I always approach them with attitude that it's so simple, you just don't see it yet. I will just change your viewpoint, that is nothing scary

Meanwhile, psychotherapists always tell me how difficult change is and how hard it is and that may take a vary long time. And indeed it's like being-dragged-by-a-horse painful sometimes. During group therapy sessions I was like ”you lucky bastard” (from Life of Brian xd) while comparing therapy results with others

I have lots of troubles with keeping belief in therapy after an enthusiasm at the beginning fades out. My intensifying concerns about exercises are mostly not talked about and I am just supposed to keep going and do assignments

After a while, therapy feels like reading a dry book or going through an online course. But more expensive and causing losing hope when all say that psychotherapy is the way..."

341,I suck at conversing through phone calls and I hate myself for it.,"This girl that I like wanted to talk on the phone so she called me and I picked it up. I was so awkward and asked REALLYYY dumb questions. I didn’t know what to say and I’m super anxious that I ended the call right away because I’m feeling overwhelmed.

I don’t have a lot of friends and I’m an introvert. Phone calls aren’t really my thing and I think I just blew off my chance with her."
342,Getting over relationship anxiety,"I’ve recently got out of a relationship and one of the reasons why we broke up was because I have relationship anxiety. I started to notice that I when I was around and she’d be talking to other guys, even when we were both in the conversation, I would get a weird jealous type of feeling, there were many other things as well but this was one of the main ways it affected me. I recognized this as something I had to work on but I couldn’t seem to turn it off, even though the idea of her leaving me for someone else was ridiculous. After a while the relationship ended up fizzling out on my end and I broke up with her, but I can’t help but think that one of the driving factors was that being in the relationship was causing me unwanted anxiety because of constant worrying that I was doing something wrong and she’d end up leaving me at some point anyway. I really don’t want it to happen again in the future, especially if I really like the girl that I will be dating, because I really did like the one I had before but it seemed to not be what I wanted once I started worrying. I also can’t seem to pin down why my mind thinks this way when I know it is a ridiculous way of thinking and I’m usually not a jealous person at all. Any input would be appreciated, thanks."

344,Skipping highschool daily and unsure what to do.,"I've (M17) been skipping highschool on a regular everyday basis and don't know what to do. I've had a trauma of school for a great part of my life (11 years), I was bullied constantly and I now fear my own safety anywhere near schools.

I've been skipping my classes a lot since grade 9, and still skipping as often in grade 12. I can't even show up at school as I start feeling sick to my stomach and am always on the edge of a panic attack. I've tried doing online school but I don't get anything done as I'm easily distracted due to ADD. At this point I've thought about ending my life more times than I have thought of my future.

I want to go to school as I want to follow my dreams but I don't feel safe there, the only place that I can feel safe is my house which is soon going to stop being my safe spot as my teacher has contacted my parents about it. I am strolling through life aimlessly without a sense of purpose. I want to be able to be happy but I don't know if I'm going to be able to stay safe."
345,Should I go and ask my parents if I can go to a therapist?,"Writing from my phone, sorry if the formatting is weird.

I'm in Hong Kong if that's needed for any reason (I read the rules like a good boy)

I have nowhere else to ask this... I been struggling a lot recently and for at least like 6-7 months with some stuff... I hate calling it anxiety or depression because it just feels like I'm being self centered or something but I'll just explain what it's been like.

I dated a girl last year from about sep-dec. I really liked her, I thought she was beautiful and all that. She was way out of my league and I was so happy. When she dumped me it hurt really bad. I was numb for a few days and it turned into anger which lasted about 3 weeks ish, seeing her at all made me seething with rage.

She dumped me because she ""had problems at home"" and ""wasn't ready for a relationship"". I was convinced she was lying, even though I know that her family really is unstable. her parents are split up and there's a bunch of shit going on with her parents jobs, you get the idea. I was convinced she was bullshitting me because she told almost the exact same thing to her previous 2 bfs. I know because I had a mutual friend with the two previous bfs. 

Anyway following the breakup I basically was sad from January to March, which started turning into anxiety in March when I had a random panic attack after looking at my aforementioned ex's instagram page. 
Since then it's been a lot of things, too much to write all about... Some include crying myself to sleep for the first time, having a dream so vivid I cried for 30 minutes after waking up, using drugs (nutmeg, pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine, computer duster and codeine, all stuff I could get legally or had in the medicine cupboard), being sad for no reason after what should have been a fun day with my friends (this happens a lot), several panic attacks for no apparent reason.
This all happened from February - May, during which time my school was closed because of COVID, so I didn't see my ex at all.

When we went back to school from may until the end of term in June. This meant seeing her almost every day, when I sat behind her in math class. Seeing her made me feel so awful. A crushing feeling across my chest, like someone was grabbing my ribcage and crushing it. It was like some primal yearning that I knew with every fiber in me that was never gonna be fulfilled. Like constantly having dreams shattered. And then it's accompanied by a absolute onslaught of negative thoughts and what if scenarios, just so much noise and thoughts and all I wanted was to stop thinking.

And when it wasn't that direct pain from looking at her every other moment was a dull sadness and emptiness. Just enough for me to feel empty and slow but not enough for me to be able to cry it out. I could never get rid of it. 

When summer started it felt so fake. All the fun experiences were great but as soon as they ended and I came back home after being out, the emptiness set in. Like my fave was so heavy and was being pulled into a grown by some external force, and my mood was being pulled down as well. 

By the end of summer I started feeling better as I forgot about it more and more. After summer we had online school again which I hate but I didn't have to see her anymore. It was closed from August to mid September.

When I went back to school I had to deal with seeing her again. But now the feeling when I saw her was different - a sort of anxiety bubbling up in me. I couldn't describe it so well then but now I can describe it like a primal fear, to just run away. The fear of a person being held captive and saying ""please don't hurt me "" over and over as the captor stands over them. 
This feeling was worse but honestly I saw her much less now that classes had changed in the new school year and so I was feeling much better.

In mid October though, I came across a picture of my ex chilling on a sofa and sitting cuddled up to a boy that I recognised as one of her exes, who'd she'd evidently got back with. Don't remember how exactly I came across it but that doesn't matter

By then I had distanced myself so much from her but all that effort I took to forget was blown away in that instant. I felt like shit. I felt like my mind was floating and I was helpless. What definitely didn't help was that I was on a medication at the time which as a side effect caused headaches and nausea, which was manageable but made infinitely worse by this new photo. every day I went to school feeling like the world was spinning and with a headache so bad it made my vision blurry. School was also mounting up pressure with several exams which served to make it even worse. Seeing her now made me almost entirely freeze up in fear and made me a helpless husk that stood there shaking until she passed. I hated it so much. I hated that everytime something happened even slightly considering her, if I saw a photo or heard her name I would instantly react so negatively and my day would be instantly ruined. Like my happiness was so fragile that a picture could completely ruin it.
That week was during the half term break of one week, and it turned that week into a sad blur where I started using more and more diphenhydramine to numb the pain. I opened up slightly to a friend during this time but it only acted as a temporary stopgap for me.
I was ranting a lot on my social media, hoping someone would reach out to help me. I wanted to be saved. 

That brings me to the most recent event this November. I had reposted the image of my ex and her ex on my public twitter account, and one of her friends messaged me to delete it. I told them sure. they told me to ""just get over it man, it's been a year"" and that made me feel even even worse. You think I don't know that.

The next day at school she called me over in the school hallway. This was the first time she had talked to me since January. She asked me if I could please delete the photo (which I had forgotten to do) so I said sure. 
This completely broke me. When she tapped me on the shoulder and I saw her I had the most primal fear I've ever experienced. I wanted to bolt away at lightspeed, but of course I couldn't. My hands were shaking and my whole body was shivering as she asked me that and when I walked away and into my classroom it was everything I could do to keep a straight face and keep myself from either having a panic attack or bursting out in tears. on the journey home the same feeling remained and for the rest of that day and the day after that. It was awful. I couldn't take it.

A couple days later I was in the hallway again and I was talking to my friend K, who stopped halfway our conversation and said ""D(her ex now bf) is simping for M(my ex)!"" as they passed behind me. I was frozen on the spot and more terrified than even last time. I waited for them to pass and looked as their backs as they walked past. I was so broken. I managed to steel my resolve in class and stayed together,  but only on the outside. All these negative thoughts filled my head and all i could think was negative thoughts. It was at a much higher degree than before, like the damage had multiplied together from x10 and x10 into x100. It was so incredibly painful. Music which had helped me last time did nothing now. That night I really wanted to kill myself. I wanted the pain to stop and the thoughts to shut the fuck up. I only didn't because after researching, I found that overdosing on benadryl would be painful and terrifying way to die (I had a pill bottle of 25x DPH 25mg). that was a week ago.

Since then I've been thinking on and off about different ways to die (it was a week ago). it's getting better again, school is closed so I don't have to see her again but I know seeing her again is going to hurt. I don't have the twisted motivation of pain to drive to me suicide anymore although it might come back. I really want the pain to stop and maybe therapy is a better option than drugs. 
Should I ask my parents about seeing a therapist? and how can I ask them? I don't know what to say.

tl:dr - I wanted to and still kind of do want to kill myself because of an ex I can't get over. seeing her is agony and I've been sad for so long. How can I ask my parents about seeing a therapist?"
346,Honest question,[removed]
347,Mental Health is NOT an excuse for murder and/or other crimes!,"I've recently come across an alarming number of people who would defend sex offenders like Weinstein or Epstein and murders like Man who murdered Chris Kyle or the 2018 Florida school shooter as making case for them being mentally unstable. Here's the thing nobody who takes someone else's life should ever be considered ""mentally stable"" but if you think that mental health makes an excuse for taking another human another child's life then boy let me tell you something, you are wrong! You are not only denying the justice the victim's family deserves... you making a victim out of cold blooded monster. Also to anyone says sh\*t like this, always remember you wouldn't be saying it if it was your child or yourself who was on the other side of the trigger. I believe that anyone who believes in using mental health as an excuse for people who commit heinous crimes are the most disgusting excuse for a human there is."
348,I’m not allowed to stay home alone and it’s making me worse,"  My dad send me to a family members house. And they don’t watch me even so what’s the point and nothing is locked up and my cousins are d*cks.

  I have told my dad this several times and he just says he feels better if i go. But I don’t feel better I feel worse. And my therapist isn’t helping. I haven’t even harmed myself since before I even was last hospitalized (was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts like f*cking loser). This has only taught me to never open up. I’m exhausted and I just have to sit on this couch all day on my phone. Now how is that even good for me? At least at home I can sleep. I could take a nap here but I won’t fall asleep outside of my own house. I literally just can’t no matter how exhausted I get. 

   I asked how much longer and he said 3 months. I mean he said that 3 months ago. I know he is just trying to keep me safe but this is causing me so much anger to where I’m so tempted to just f*cking c*t myself again."
349,How does one reconcile the fact that they're getting the mental health treatment they need even though they know people in their life who are struggling so much worse and aren't getting any treatment?,"I just got out of therapy and it sounds like I'm going to be sent to the hospital again for my extreme depression/ substance abuse issues. As greatful as I am that I am fortunate enough to be able to get this kind of treatment, I'm really struggling with coming to terms with it because I have a couple friends in my life who I know are doing just as bad. I have other friends who are just as depressed (if not worse) , or suffer with substance abuse (also worse than me), and IDK I even have friends that just have so much harder of a life then I do and none of them are getting the treatment they need. It's mostly because they have shitty parents who don't acknowledge mental health, but its just so hard for me to accept the help I need when some of my best friends aren't getting that. Also, I'm scared to tell them about the hospital because I fear they recognize how much better of a situation I'm in and resent me for it. Idk I'm very conflicted and don't know how to make myself feel better about this."
350,Mentally done,Suicide has been a heavy thought lately. I’m struggling. Meds aren’t working. Therapy isn’t helping. I just can’t anymore
351,Feel selfish,Do you ever feel selfish because of your mental illness? Like you want to help someone or make things better but are so consumed with yourself and you thoughts. Or its difficult to be with you because of this. It's not wrong in any way but might make you feel guilty or like the centre of attention when really you're trying hard to escape it
352,I want to learn wing chun to smash some old friends in the face. Especially those from school who felt they could trample over me as a result.,Needed to vent somewhere. Really really did.
353,Impulsiveness?,"I wasn't sure where else to post this so i figured here might be a good place

I was put on Abilify (2mg) a few months ago and ive started realizing that my impulsiveness hasnt really gone away since starting. Is this something Abilify treats or just something i have to work out on my own? 

(Note: I was diagnosed with basically very low-grade bipolar and very low-grade schizophrenia)"
354,What do I deal with people expect something after they did something nice for me?,"I mean, I understand if someone just takes and takes, it can be frustrating, but I just hate how people being up all the nice things they done for you to give you a reason to do something for them? Am I wrong for thinking that, because I just feel I could be. It feels like a sense of debt almost if that makes sense. How should I deal with these people? Thank you for reading and stay safe."
355,Any advice?,"Did anyone prior to quarantine have depression, and now that it’s here, your depression is high functioning? In my case I was a very average but hard-working student, I had fun in my extra curricular activities(band), being around people gave me the drive to improve on my artistic craft but the drive was never my own as I could not find it in myself, and I wasn’t at home as much, one of the few cores of my issues. I had and still do have very low self-esteem and confidence but I don’t know how to build it. I was always depressed but I was learning to work around it and giving myself time to recuperate from depressive episodes. As time in quarantine progressed, my fire started to dwindle. I don’t love playing my saxophone anymore. I cannot stand to look at it. I’d only spend my time daydreaming about what me as a better player,(a better person at that) would look like, and I get so captivated into my daydreams that I’d spend an average of 6 hours a day, daydreaming. Even at night, usually at 3 in the morning, I would wake up to daydream. When I woke up during the day, I would daydream. It’s too addicting, and the feelings I feel in my daydreams feel so real. It’s so hard to let them go it hurts. I feel like I’m being controlled by my mind, as awkward as that sounds. I hate the feelings of complacency I currently have. I am having issues tending to the priorities in my life, it’s hurting me. It’s a bit hard for me to seek professional help given my current situation, I can’t go out really. I understand there’s a lot to unpack here, but I was wondering if anyone here could provide me with some insight. Maybe even empathize with me, perhaps even give some advice."

357,Help!,[removed]
358,My anger management is getting worse and i need help,"Recently I am not really feeling well. I always felt that i have some anger management issues but this time it's just different. I am hurting people now. I always feel guilty by the end of it, there was a time that i slept for a whole week without eating. My parents seems to not care about my mental health, I am always asking them to give me proper help or take me to the professionals but they don't listen. What I am really afraid of is that someday when I have my own family, I don't want to be an abusive father. I think my anger is a mental health problem because no matter how hard i want to change it, I can't seem to really do anything about it. Every effort I did has no results. 
Anyone who is a professional or had experienced the same things i did, any advice? You can reply to this or directly chat me. I feel like i am also suffering depression right now but i don't know. I am from philippines btw"
359,I don’t even know anymore.,"I just need a job.
I want to no be anxious around people.
I want to not easily become angry for no real reason.
I want to not be sad/feel worthless because whatever.
I want to trust people and not doubt everything they tell me.

Hopefully starting therapy soon I have the paperwork. I can’t keep wasting away. I push my past friends away. I’ve been alone for what feels like awhile. Since June I’ve seen one person in a friend setting. Only people who try to talk to me want either a ride of drugs both family members. House is shit, don’t have a toilet or shower or stove right now. I’d love to throw in the death of my grandpa but can’t be an excuse, really none of it is. His birthday was nov 27th. 

I’m falling into a down ward slope and if I know anything no one is going to catch me. 

Just having a father around would have changed so much. I wouldn’t have avoided and male figure and I probably would leaned something.

Set back after set back, no one tells me to stfu because I don’t talk but they would.

Life seems to have no future at least nothing bright

I won’t give up I can barely see the light but the twinkle is there. 

What am I.... pathetic... 

A future psychologist probably doesn’t look like me. But I’m sure I’ll see soon I can’t afford it and won’t make it."
360,Uni is making everything bad,"I just started uni a few weeks ago and it's making me miserable. I took a year off between school and uni and it was sooo good for my menatl health. It was the first time where I didn't have suicidial thoughts for weeks.
Now everything is bad again. I'm not exactly suicidal but I've completely lost my will to live. 
Working made me miserable. School is making me miserable. Everything that requires effort makes me miserable. Am I just fucking broken? Or have I coddled and spoiled myself so much that I can't even take on the most basic fucking tasks."

362,"I am a disgusting, perverted and shallow woman.","I used to be lonely, thought I would die alone. Then the universe brought me the love of my life. I never considered I wouldn’t find her attractive. Never thought I would have that problem. 

Physical needs shouldn’t come between two people who are in love. It isn’t fair. I feel like I can’t help it. 

I am hurting, I am hating myself. I am sick, disgusting. So shallow. She doesn’t deserve me thinking these things about her. 

She is perfect in every fucking way. Supportive. Understanding. Forgiving. She lets me be crazy. Never tries to change me. Loves me. Loves my family. Brings nothing but wonder and adventure and happiness and possibilities into my life. 

And I can’t help but think someday I could ruin her life. Fuck someone else. Fuck a lot of other women. Or just tell her the truth. Our lives would be over. Everything we have would have to be split. People wouldn’t understand. They would hate me. And I’d live alone again. And I’d go insane. I would probably kill myself. There is no solution."
363,Advice on a Suicidal Family member,"Hi guys, I need advice on a Family situation I am in and this is the best place I could think of to get helpful advice.

My niece who is a 15 year old girl in the UK has progressivly gotten into worse trouble at school, to the point where they have asked her to not attend on multiple occasions. She has lost a lot of weight to the point where she is now borderline anarexic, and for the past two months has cut herself various places. Most of which she has hidden for 

Her mum has tried to speak to her to find out the issue however she will not speak to her, and she won't speak to her teachers who have shown great concern as well. She also has refused to talk to councelors and mental health professionals reguarding her eating disorder on multiple occasions.

This all came to a head recently, when the school councelor spoke to her regarding her behaviour, and she reluctantly said that she had the other night called the samaratians (UK national Suicide Hotline) and hung up after being on hold for too long. The councellor asked her if she would like to go home and spend some time out of school, to which she responded that she just doesn't want to be around anymore.

As you can imagine, we are extremely worried about her wellbeing. The fact that she won't talk to anybody and tries to hide how depressed/suicidal she feel infornt of us gives me the impression that this isn't just a ""attention ploy"" a lot of teens go through.

Anything advice on what she might be going through, or any simular personal stories of how people have overcome this would be a great help for me to better understand her situation and why she might be feeling like this.

Thank you in advanced"
364,Just getting worse,"I currently underwent a brain surgery (stereotactic radiosurgery (01/12) to be exact) and it wasn’t the best feeling in the world. Long story short, it’s added an extra layer of pain and negativity all physically and mentally.

I’ve been down with depression and anxiety for a while. Things got at breaking point last year and I self harmed, on top drinking and smoking. I’ve never been able to fully recover as it’s continuous loop that never seems to end.

With the struggles of uni, lack of friends and nobody to truly support, I often think about giving up. There’s a lot more to say but not worth to mention."
365,What have I done to deserve this,"I've turned into everything I hate. I want the people who have hurt me to be as hurt as I am, as miserable as I am, as angry and rage filled as I am. I dont want to be like this. I hate everyone because no one wants to care enough to understand me. I hate the universe because of the illnesses I was born with, cursed with before I even had a chance, kept away from the only thing I've ever wanted because of the way I was born. No one will ever understand me, and no one will ever want to love me, especially if I remain broken and hopeless like this. No one liked me before, and now I hate everything I am. The world has rejected and abandoned me and it doesn't care. No one cares, and no one can help. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to die, but that doesn't solve anything. Ill just be reborn with the same problems, living the same life, until I ""learn my lesson""

So what is my lesson? That the world is uncaring? That no one cares enough to help? To learn to be ok with the only human unable to find connection? What am I suppose to do? At every turn I fail. At every opportunity I am not enough. Theres nothing left for me here. Nothing. Why do I have to keep going? Why do I have to suffer like this? Why me? What have I ever done to deserve this? I've tried to be a good person my entire life. Ive tried to be friends with others who were outcast, volunteer to feed Ns cloth the homeless. Raise money for charities that actually help. Why do I deserve this endless despair? Why doesn't anyone want me? Why am I so unlovable? I've given every good part of me to the person of my dreams and that wasn't enough. Im not enough. Im just kind. Thats it. Not interesting even though I write fiction no one has ever seen or heard of. Not enough even though I go out of my way to make people I care about feel special. But no one makes me feel special. Everyone makes me feel like a waste. A burden. A creep. Im sorry I care. Im sorry I worry. I dont anymore. I only hate. Would you love me now that you've changed me into you?"
366,Resources,Thank you everyone who reached out with resources and checking on me. I appreciate it
367,"My go-to [emotionally driven] response to a lot of things is to cry. I cannot control this response, no matter how hard I try. And it’s exhausting to say the least, mentally &amp; physically. Am I a dud?","I’ve been known as a “crier” my whole life. 

I cry when I’m anxious (also generally anxious all my life).

I cry when I’m sad. (Just a thought can make me burst into tears)

I cry when I feel guilty of something I didn’t even do.

I cry when I’m overwhelmed by all the tasks I need to complete.

I cry when I’m overwhelmed by my [racing] thoughts.

I cry when I ‘get my way’. (Like if someone helps me with something)

I cry when I’m “bored” or unstimulated (if I have nothing planned for the mean time).

I cry when I have to do something I don’t want to. 

I cry when I’m expected to do something or be somewhere for someone at a certain time.

I cry when I’m wrong, especially in social situations. 

I cry if someone were to surprise me with a thoughtful gift.

I cry when I read the sentence: “I am capable of anything.” (Probably due to lack of self esteem and see little to not worth in myself, so it’s hard to hear something I don’t believe about myself)

I cry when I’m stuck on a problem I can’t solve.

I cry if I let someone know that I’m not able to help them right now (again, guilt/shame).

I cry if someone is kind to me and my depressed self can’t match their kindness ( 

I cry if the tone of my voice is not as ‘exciting’ as I was hoping it to sound (hello depression)

I cry when I reflect on my social interactions and noticing that I’m a depressed “negative Nancy” most of the time even tho at heart I don’t wish to bring any pain or suffering onto others.

I cry when I’m not sure what to do.

I cry if I can’t remember a word mid-sentence while speaking to someone,anyone. 

I cry if there are too many noises. (Overwhelm)

I cry when I look at my past.

I cry when I look towards my future.

I cry when I look at the present moment.

*I understand a lot of these would be considered “normal” to respond with crying, it’s just for me it’s serious. It’s holding me back from a lot of things, as well as it wastes a lot of time. I’ll cry anywhere from 20 seconds (tho not so much quick cries anymore) to 2 hours. I am a Highly Sensitive Person &amp; have ADHD, which both come with a lot of emotional baggage, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard of someone who cries at basically anything, and at the drop of a hat.
It’s not like I decide to cry; I literally can’t control it. It comes suddenly and at an instant, so there is not a pause that I can possibly stop and rethink it. 
I’ve never had control over my cries, and since at least age 8, I have always been able to cry on command. It’s as if the reaction crying is always in the back just ready to let itself out at any given moment. 
I’ve been in therapy for 10 years and nothing has helped. I’m 22 and feel absolutely worthless, useless, and a waste of space when I ask for emotional support, because it’s as if I’m incurable."
368,Is being alone really to blame?,So my mental health has gone to shit or pergaps it was always shit. I get really bad depressive episodes and self harmed(im handling it ) and anxiety attacks and a bunch of other shit. I've recently reached out to my mom and started letting her know of my struggles and even asked to see a psychiatrist to see if I have something diagnosible. The thing is we're poor and she said she'd save up for it but since then she has made it clear that she doesn't plan on getting me one. Every time I mention it or bring it up the invalidates my struggles and says that a psych wont fix anything and she has decided that the cause of all my shit is because I am alone too much and that it has made me overthink things and make problems that aren't there. I just confinced myself that it was bullshit and that she just didn't understand but now I'm thinking what if shes right? I have spent most of my life alone in a house with only 3 or 4 hours of contact with people when I wasn't at school and my parents were working and I have gone through a lot of traumatic things since I was born one thing after the other. So yeah I am alone for very long times and that can be bad for mental health but isn't what Ive experienced way more exrtreme than other people? I mean I know lots of people who spend most of their time alone too and they dealt with it just fine and they dont get suicidal and hopeless and foggy and all the nice shit that comes with depression. I do overthink when im alone but damn isn't it bad that being alone destoys me this much? Dont I still deserve help even if loneliness is what caused it? I am so embarassed and unsure of things. Am I just going to have to suround myself with people for the rest of my life in order for me to not want to kill myself? I have had these depressive episodes whilst also going to school and being around people so maybe my mothers theory is wrong? I just want to know what's real. What are you guy's opinion?
369,Dealing with anxiety from other peoples problems?,Recently my friend started going through some issues with his wife and kids. Some very personal issues has lead to them getting a divorce. I want to be there for my friend and help him but the problems his wife is causing have me literally sick to my stomach with anxiety that their kids are going to end up in a very dangerous situation despite the various legal remedies that he has been trying to put in place. He’s trying his absolute best to give their family a good life and I tend to be his venting board which I’m very grateful to be able to be. What kind of coping mechanisms do you guys have that revolve around other peoples home issues?
370,"Please help me understand: one day, I was doing very well. I was accepting and I couldn't care less. The next day I had anxiety panic attack. I couldn't function and I went through spiral of thoughts that I couldn't meditate. I felt so bad.","I am going through a break up and finally I reached a level that I wanted to move on and never look back. I start to accept the reality as it is and really looked beyond the current situation and said to myself:"" whatever I am letting go."" yet, the very next day, I woke up with anxious thoughts. I started to have my panic and intrusive thoughts. I couldn't hold myself. The air was blowing cold, I couldn't feel my feelings and let them just be. I felt it wasn't the right time to meditate. I wasn't in peace at all. A wave of depression hit me so hard. I started to look for my motivational resources. Didn't work out. I felt so down. Depression is not a linear line. Some days are better than others but I really want to move on."
371,I wish the day of my birth would disappear off the calendar,"I’ve never really liked my birthday, over the years this feeling has gotten progressively worse. Tomorrow will be my 22nd birthday and I just wish the day would disappear. I’m back home from college which means my friends from high school are asking what we should we do for my birthday. Truth is I don’t want to give them the privilege of spending my birthday with me. They were once great friends, but now the thought of seeing them makes me sick to my stomach with a heart full of despair.
I could drive back to my college town and see my roommates, but I don’t know if I should. 
I kind of just want to disappear tomorrow, maybe go camping by myself and turn my phone on airplane mode.
I’m not sure what it is about birthdays that make me want to cry and feel so full of shame. People just want to celebrate me??? But all that makes me want to do is runaway. I know I’m loved (and I feel lucky for that), but also with my bipolar diagnosis I’ve learned how disingenuous friendship built over many years can be. 
Anyways, I can’t make a decision of what to do, any advice would be much appreciated."
372,How do i know if i actually have a mental illness or it's just a part of puberty?,"Just a short, probably dumb question. Been having s*icidal thoughts and no joy in life for about a year now i think. It might have started when my ex gf cheated on me (not an intercourse of course, we were 13-14. She was dating another guy behind my back.) No friends, abusive brother [18] (beated me up several times when he's angry over the smallest things, even when he lost a game in LoL.), feeling anxiety at school, scared of being judged and laughed at, especially for my looks. I spend most of the time in the morning making sure there is nothing weird or noticable at me. I'm really close to giving up.

I'm 15, so this might just be a part of puberty and will be eventually fixed over time by itself?"
373,POISON OAK OR ZOLOFT REACTION?!,"I started taking Zoloft about 6 weeks prior to when I got a rash. I was taking 100mg and went up to 200mg for OCD. During the same week, I also went on a hike. A few days later I noticed a rash. It got worse and so I saw a doctor. He said it was poison oak and prescribed me steroids (prednisone). It was  a week's dose at 40mg and went down slowly. My eye was swollen shut, and other parts of my body started to swell. The steroid helped but as I went off of it, the swelling went up a lot. I eventually went to the ER because my genitals were swollen about 3 times the size. The doctor gave me a 3 week period of steroids to take. I personally am not sure if it truly is poison oak or if this could be a reaction to the Zoloft. It has now been about a month and although the rash it looking somewhat better, new areas are starting to create a rash as I continue on the 200mg zoloft. Neither my doctor or the ER doc think its Zoloft and maybe they are right but I am not sure myself. What are your thoughts? I can't be on these steroids forever and I don't want to continue to take the Zoloft if its the problem. Obviously, I am going to take to my doctor about getting off the Zoloft to be sure, but I wanted opinions. Thank you in advance!

374,Help me help my brother.,"My younger brother is in his 30s and currently spiraling out of control. Drinking around the clock and has threatened suicide several times in the past month or two. His wife called me earlier this week in tears. I rarely have ever spoken to her up to that point...not out of any sort of bad relationship we just have never been close so I know that she must be seriously upset by all this for her to call me. She said she is scared every day and is being abused. I asked if it was physical and she said no he's never done anything physical but it is around the clock verbal abuse. They have a one year old in the house as well.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago he was threatening suicide so my father went to his house to try to get him to go to a rehab or mental health facility and he refused. The police wound up getting called and took him to hospital. The hospital released him in less than 24 hours, presumably because he said he was fine and hid whatever issues he was having.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a call from my sister-in-law this morning to come over and help her out in talking with him. When I got there she was crying and I told her to leave and go to her parents house. I spoke with him for about an hour and the only way I can describe the conversation is that it was like talking to a crazy person. He said he know he has a drinking problem and mental health issues, but at the same time ranting and raving about people being jealous of him, wanting his money, doesn't trust doctors because they will lie to him so that is why he can't get help from a medical professional, etc. I tried being understanding and going along with all that and saying that even though those are valid concerns, he needs to do this to show his wife and son that he is trying to get help, which sent him down a hole of ""I can't live my life for other people because that's all I have done my whole life and it has ruined my life.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am very worried about him and my nephew and sister-in-law and I do not know what to do. She is almost certainly going to leave him with their son, which is 100% what she needs to do because she is miserable, but that still leaves him needing help. How does one help someone in this situation, or can they even be helped? I called a clinic in my area and they said basically if he doesn't want to be admitted (either for substance abuse or mental health) they really can't do anything. Is this something where we all have to sit by and watch and wait for him to do something that causes himself or someone else harm?"
375,A friend of mine committed Suicide,I still don't know how to process his death... He always told me a goodbye before he wanted to commit. I was able to stop him... But this time he said nothing. Not a word. I should have contacted him.... Maybe then he would still be here.
376,My mam doesn’t love me anymore,"Recently my mam has been drinking a hell of a lot more than usual, she says she wants half of my disability allowance all the time, saying it’s “rent” I’m 17 and need to save the money for when I move out, she isn’t buying food, helping me with my appointments (I have severe anxiety and find difficulty with making appointments on my own) and she started to try guilt trip me into giving her money by saying “you are the reason I want to kill myself” and “when I’m dead you’ll know how I feel and be so sorry” it makes me wish I wasn’t here so I wouldn’t bother her and everyone else, I’ve tried talking to her but she won’t listen and just shout at me, whenever she talks to my 26 year old brother she’s all happy and likes talking to him, but she just ignores me, I don’t want to do this anymore"
377,Why does life go downhill so rapidly after the age of 16/17?,"I used to be able to enjoy things and have genuine interests and passions. With every passing year I lose some of the spark, some of my personality that used to be so vibrant. Things that used to be interesting to me become utterly boring, one by one, and they aren't being replaced with anything new. Is this just a normal part of life or am I doing it wrong?"
378,How are you doing today?,"This sub can be a rough one, I know. I think we want to support each other, but it’s hard when we’re all suffering.

I’m not very good at talking or giving advice, but I’m a great listener! So if you want, tell he how you’re feeling 😊"
379,I don’t want this anymore,"I ruined my life with a single mistake. And I tried, trust me I really tried to put all the pieces back together, to get things back to the way they were, to recover to the strength I once had, to be the best version of myself. But it was just too late...

I realized that my life will never be the same, that my physical health will never be the same, that I will carry this burden and pain forever because I was so unlucky to catch this disease or whatever it is that disfigured my body. 

No treatment exists for it, only some things that will make some days more bearable than others. I’m only 24 years old, I had so much planned, so much that I wanted to do, but now it’s not even worth it anymore, for I am done. 

I have been engaging in more self sabotaging behavior since I already messed up my life, might as well ruin it more since it won’t get any better. 

My biggest wish now, is to die young. I ask God for forgiveness everyday, because there’s this side of me that doesn’t think and just jumps out there impulsively...And it’s destroying me completely. 
I ask God to save me from this, to please release me from this. He won’t heal me physically, so at least I hope he please frees me from this horrible behavior that is ruining me. I know it’s ruining me and it won’t help my case and I still do it... Why 😭 It wasn’t suppose to be this way. 

Everyone says to get help, but nobody cares."
380,Out for 5 Years?!,"So basically 5 years ago, a bunch of family and relationship issues all came to a complete head for me at once and I fell into the deepest pit of Anxiety and Depression I have ever contemplated of my life. How I’ve managed to come through it alive is still a bit baffling to be honest. I was working for a pretty big company at the time and I had been honest in the run up to it with my boss so they were very understanding I was allowed to just basically stop working while I fixed myself.

So roll on today and I’m starting back at software development next week, the HR rep and Manager have both asked me what I want to tell people as regards where I’ve been to explain why I’m basically not a new hire but also will need adjustment time and I’m not sure how much I should divulge so as to not put myself at a disadvantage/set myself up for any bullying.

Anyone got any ideas of what to tell people so I give myself the best chance at a smooth and successful transition back to working was part of a team again? Posting from a TA for obvious reasons."
381,"My symptoms of depression have been lower, but I’m scared.","I really don’t know what to tag this because I’m new here, I guess it could be considered a vent/support thing? 

I’ve experienced depression for the majority of my life, and was diagnosed by a therapist but I’m afraid because for the past month or more my symptoms have been really light compared to where I used to be and I guess I’m afraid I’m faking or I’m just not sure where this leaves me. 

It’s not like I’m happy, but I’m also not as bad off as I used to be, and for some reason that terrifies me. I never imagined a life past where I had been and it’s scary to process anything that could be in my future at this point. I don’t really want to.

I’m scared that maybe this period could just be a time where it’s better and I’ll get worse again. I feel like I deserve to feel worse again. 

It’s hard for me to process my life because it feels like I’m hardly living, but a blank mind is better than a hurting one, but I don’t want to live blank. Sometimes I feel I’ve lost my personality to my pain and when that’s gone I’ll be a shell. 

I’m scared I’ve lost myself and I just want to be better or stuck in the pain, I don’t want to be here."
382,Why do I do this?,"So I do this thing where I click the back of my sharp tooth to the front of my bottom sharp tooth (usually on the right side), I do it when there is a continuous loud noise, and I also do it if I start thinking about it. I clench my teeth/ jaw sometimes too, but not that much. I do other body related things too like biting my nails and if my nails are too short, then I start to bite the skin around my nails, and I bite the inside skin of my lips. Any reasons why I do these things?"
383,Would you talk to a potentially suicidal brother who you’re scared of and hurts you emotionally?,"My family is dysfunctional. My mom told me this morning that my older brother is angry that no would calls or talks to him. He lives in another country and our time difference is 7-8 hours. He isolated himself and moved to his own place.

I’ve had nightmares again of him threatening to beat me up physically and just talking to him makes me incredibly stressed. I started to have to back away from him secretly for these reasons. He has told me numerous times when we’re just having a normal conversation that he’s getting irritated and he wants to warn me that he’s scared he’s going to physically hurt me so then I leave. He has scary scary anger issues. I’m also scared that he’s going to abuse his wife if he ever gets married. 

Only two sisters supposedly talk to him and my mom was telling me what an awful sister I am. I have a lot of brothers and sisters. My siblings don’t all get along. There’s no respect and very bad issues in all of them. I’m the youngest so once I also stopped talking to everyone things got way worse. I blame myself for my family falling apart like it did because I feel like it was my job to keep everyone together and I did for a while. It’s not like my family loves or cares about me and I’m supposedly suppose to care about them.

My parents have had very bad issues all their life too and I still live with them so I’m mentally not okay. I’m really tired of taking care of their emotional needs.

My older brother hasn’t been there for me either and he also takes advantage of me. I honestly would rather not have anything to do with him but I feel incredible guilt that he is possibly suicidal again. He was in a hospital before for suicidal ideation or attempt. 

I haven’t been okay myself and even if I talk to my brother he’ll just get angry at me and hurt me emotionally... 

Should I still reach out to this brother? Am I just being an awful sister?

I stopped talking to him because I’m honestly scared of him and it’s really stressful being around him. I know he doesn’t respect that I want to also be less religious, don’t want to date, etc. 

I don’t love my family anymore. I know I’m a really bad person"
384,How to stay motivated on rainy days,Idk if it’s just me but I struggle hard on rainy days. My body is physically exhausted. Everything feels a little sore for some reason. Mentally I’m very exhausted as well. It’s hard for me to find motivation. I just wanna sleep or relax in bed the whole day. It’s been raining a few times a week for the past couple weeks and it’s just been really difficult to work on anything. If anyone has any tips besides tough it out it would be greatly appreciated.
385,a very helpful article breaking the stigma of medication,[https://taraiscool101.medium.com/why-im-not-ashamed-to-be-on-medication-for-my-mental-health-9b292e7ad437?sk=72688e30e2f1f510d07cc0efadb95e29](https://taraiscool101.medium.com/why-im-not-ashamed-to-be-on-medication-for-my-mental-health-9b292e7ad437?sk=72688e30e2f1f510d07cc0efadb95e29)
386,I wanna runaway,"I feel so lost again...
I feel like I’m not me and I rlly don’t wanna be here anymore. Not like I wanna Commit suicide, I just wanna go from the place where I live. 
It has been tough again and I need to go
Idk what to do anymore
I need to, but I can’t"
387,Positive Stories About Mental Health,"While fighting the stigma associated with mental health is important, I think we need to start communicating that there are success stories in mental health.  I started a website that documents people that have successfully navigated mental health issues.  We post videos of people and they talk about what they did to overcome their particular ailment. Like everyone else, I'm trying to get it to go viral, so I need some help from this community.  Please visit the site if you need inspiration.  Also, if you would like to post your story, you can do that on the site as well.  Thanks.

388,I'm getting more comfortable with the idea and planning of suicide.,"Currently I am 24 years old and I admit that I am a failure at life. I messed up everything I have ever done. I chose the wrong high school, college, and major. I am in debt by a lot and still live with my parents. My friends look down on me because they are successful while I am not. 

I always thought about suicide in the past and when and how I would go about it. Now I know. My family consist of a bunch of older people. My cousins and uncles who i talked to in the past are already dead. Once my parents die then I will have no reason to keep myself alive. I've thought about this numerous times and I weighed the options of the physical pain I would experience in my last moments but I think it is better than years of mental pain. 

So at this point I am starting to find comfort in my death. I know that I want to do it in a way that is not bloody and keeps my body together. I just want to wake up, watch a show or movie for the last time, maybe eat my last meal with a desert and them kill myself. 

I just don't think life is worth living for someone like me. I have failed at life and I am not deserving of it. I am 24 years old and I have already messed up my life to the point where I have experience everything. The only thing left to go through is more death, shame, and failure."
389,Many emotions about last relationship,"Last week my gf broke up with me since we didn’t click. Looking back on everything, I strongly believe I was emotionally abused throughout most of the relationship. She’s blamed the breakup on me and when I tried to hold her accountable she got defensive and played the victim card. I’m conflicted on how I feel after everything. Some days I feel good I left because she gave me lots of anxiety. Other days I feel responsible for our breakup and how I was bad, then I’ll feel embarrassed for ignoring all the red flags. I almost feel ashamed for defending her bad actions while we were together. I was a fool and kept going back. She’d threaten to breakup often and I’d beg for her not to. I’m stupid. She told others it was just physical but yet she told me we were a thing. I fell for it and I’m ashamed."
390,Do you ever feel like no one needs you ?,"Sometimes I get a feeling that I make no impact in anyone’s life and that they wouldn’t even notice if I was gone , if anything they may prefer it . I feel like I’m in the way of everyone’s life and I would just be doing them a favour by not being in it . Like I’m just in the way . The friend that’s constantly calling and asking if you are ok and annoying you . I just feel like if I disappeared no one would know and if they did they would say good riddance. I’m so sick of crying myself to sleep and crying when I wake up at the fact I am still here . I feel like I’m a nucience to everyone almost like the little kid in the way that no one wants to be included . I really hate myself"
391,Feeling mentally drained and missing a deeper connection,"I (f28) was doing pretty well for a while with the whole pandemic thing. I actually enjoyed having time for myself and being able to work on projects I didn't have time for before. But things changed now. My country is having a lock down again and I feel completely lonely and isolated. I am single now for 1 1/2 years, living by myself for the first time ever for 4 months now and don't have any close friends. I have what I call 2nd degree friends who are great for going out, brunches, going to events with etc. but I don't have that deep connection with them which I am missing. And we barely talk now because we can't really see each other in person and it feels as if the connection is more and more fading. I moved a lot in my life so I don't have these consistent old friends others seem to have. I live rather close to my family again now, but I am missing actual friends to talk to. This pandemic sucks, I can't do the majority of my interests, I am losing connection to people I liked and the hobbies I have that I could do I don't enjoy right now. Everything feels grey and I feel super lost and unhappy with everything and myself as well."
392,"Fake Mental Health Doctor, what do I do?","Ok so this whole thing has been going on for a while but I'll try to keep it short. A girl (16f) who is friends with my sister started saying some things that make me concerned about her ""anxiety doctor"" 
1. He prescribed her anxiety medicine which I see her drinking all the time, i found out the ""medicine"" is vodka + water in a bottle. 
2. He said her mom needed to get metal bars put in her wrists to help with her anxiety - I've never hear of this and havent been able to find anything about it online 
3. He reccomended a therapist to her who has been giving some sketchy advice (give up hobbies that make you happy, plan days to make yourself sad all day, etc). And whenever one of her friends questions it she tells the therapist and they tell her to cut that friend out and block them on everything. 
4. He keeps putting her or diets with rules that don't make sense. Like you need to be vegan but you aren't allowed to buy almond milk or anything premade, you have to squeeze all your own almonds. 
5. One time, a whole year ago, she was hanging with my sister and all of a sudden her mom called and wanted her to go to this doctor, so I drove her there and dropped her off. It was a house in the middle of nowhere that looked like the roof was caving in. 

So I don't really know what to do with all of this. Since the pandemic hit she has been ignoring messages from all the girls and blocking them. I tried reaching out to her too and she ignored it. We're worried but I'm not sure what can be done. What do you all think about this situation? Are this doctor and therapist legit? I really have no idea so that's why im asking for an outside point of view."
393,"I want to tell people about my problems, but i never feel like they would care.","Title basically tells it all. Im at a pretty low point rn and kinda want to tell people close to me about it, but everytime i want to, i start telling myself that noone cares about that stuff and that they´d just be weirded out by me getting personal.

I just wanted to get the relief of telling anyone and i think telling some stranger in an anonymous way that i cant tell people i know about my problems is a little step in the right direction.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope any of this made at least some sense."
394,am i anorexic? or something similar?,"i do eat, but normally only breakfast and a few snacks in between.

i've always hated my body (my BMI is roughly 40, so i am, in all honesty, obese) and self-hatred has been engrained into me since i was little because i was always fatter than everyone else.

all i want is to be skinny and pretty. i genuinely think i could never be attractive unless i was thin.

the thing is, all the tests i try to take assume that i'm already thin. i don't know what's wrong with me."
395,What the fuck US economy fucking sucks balls,"I can’t fucking afford therapy or meds so here I am stuck in anxiety with no help or fucking output. This is why the fuck so many people in the US commit suicide compared to places with free healthcare. I’m just fucking tired. Tired of all this bs. When I hear my heartbeat cause I’m relaxed I have a panic attack. When my heart skips I have one. When something bad happens I have a panic attack. EVERY FUCKING DAY. I’m so done with this shit. All I want is for one of my friends to reach out to me. But here I am stuck being the one to text them and annoy them and waste their time. The worst part for me is how bad it hurts when I spill myself out and the response I get is “k”. GOD DAMN YOU CANT EVEN CARE ENOUGH TO WRITE A TWO FUCKING LETTER WORD. I am worthless. Literally nobody likes me, I’m the annoying person just cause. I try my best but always fail. This worlds fucked"
396,How to get help for an adult that doesn't want any?,"Hello,

My future brother in law has some serious mental health issues and refuses to go to therapy. Now normally I believe it's none of my business to meddle in other peoples health issues, but I am really worried about my in-laws and his children. 

For context, he is in his early 30s and has been this way since I have met him. He has high and low cycles but has also shown aggression during his high periods. He does not work and spends all if his time researching conspiracy theories online. He tends to get in huge Facebook fights that normally make little to no sense and he thinks he is smarter than everyone else (including therapists which is why he won't seek help).

I personally believe he is getting worse. His entire family is disowning him except for his parents and because his many conspiracy theories are based on politics, diseases, and religion, what we are going through now has really pushed him over the edge.

His parents buy him groceries and cigarettes, they bring his children to him (was never married and not with his children's mother) and have spoiled him his entire life. They aren't rich and he lives in pretty poor conditions but for the way he treats them they really go the extra mile to make sure he can live fairly comfortably. 

Yesterday he out of the blue started fighting with his sister and my fiance and sending really horrible messages about my transgender sister and posting them on his Facebook wall. We have now all blocked him but are worried about the safety of his parents. The live 13 hrs away from us and it's just the parents and brother and law that live in that town. He has been violent before and had the police called on him in the past. 

I guess my question really is if there is anything we can do from here. I don't want to get into a situation where it could be too late. And yes we have pleaded with him to get help but he refuses. We were talking about getting him placed in a 72hr hold but not sure that is an option or even a good option.

Plus I really think that my in-laws are scared to do anything because he might loose his children (he has a horrible relationship with his ex) and because he is an adult it's a lot harder to pull the trigger on this. 

Any suggestions of support or ideas on how to help would be amazing."
397,"Just Venting, esque","First post on reddit &amp; English is my second language, so apologies for any grammar/spelling errors.

So I've recently started my first semester (online studies), and things are not going well.

I had some trouble with anxiety in the last couple of years, and its been a while since I really had a regular schedule and deadlines.

Honestly the hours are surprisingly reasonable, and being online saves me a lot of travel since I live a bit far from campus, but that's not really what's bothering me.

My main issue is that I still have a pretty hard time with my anxiety, and it doesn't seem like there's much I can do about it.

Ever since I finished high school, it just feels like nothings going right for me. Looking at it objectively, I finished a gifted students program with good grades along with some side projects, volunteer work and such.

But I really don't think its all that impressive. I didn't work as much or as hard as most people I know, and most of my achievements were basically a requirement in order to pass my class, and I barely managed to get them done properly.

It's pretty much been downhill since, with me having to leave my last job due to mental health issues.

So here's why I feel like there's not much I can do about it all:

I went to a therapist during high school which was helpful...ish. I don't really know why but I just felt like I couldn't really be honest about how I'm feeling with him, he gave me all sorts of tips and stuff to help but I just didn't feel motivated to follow through, not sure if its just cuz I was being lazy or because it seemed kind of ineffective, but at some point I just started saying that I'm doing well and everything's working out just to make things go more smoothly (to be fair, things were doing pretty fine, but I'm pretty sure that's just due to the fact it was the final few months of school so there wasn't really anything going on at all at that time).

For various personal reasons, I just didn't have much time for therapy after I graduated. As I said, things got pretty bad, and I ended up just staying home doing nothing for a couple of months (this is about half a year after graduation, so not all that terrible but still not good).

I'm currently staying with my parents, and its pretty easy to tell that my personal problems have a pretty severe impact on them as well.

I'm certainly not a mental health expert, but my mom worked from home even before Covid, and especially now it is very obvious that they both have enough trouble of their own, without having to deal with my issues as well.

Now I get that in theory I maybe should be giving my own health some priority, but I don't think that seeing them stress out about me is going to make me feel any better. Either I say nothing and suck it up alone, or talk about it and continue to have a bad time, but now with more people sharing that bad time with me. It's pretty much a lose-lose situation, and I decided to bet that I can make it through Uni without having a major mental crisis, and trying to take care of things later.

I'm trying not to be too naïve about it, I know that its not going to be easy, and may very well prove to be impossible for me to handle, but I feel like I just can't quit before I see the end of it, given that I've already done that plenty before, and it never really improved my situation.

That's pretty much it so far, I'm still doing quite badly, and I'm not sure if I can manage this semester and the next one before I get some time to rest and maybe recover for the next year.

Uhhh so if anyone's got any good advice on that, or maybe just on how to study while you're very anxious, cuz I have a test in a few days."
398,I keep messing everything in my life up and have no clue what to do anymore,"Sorry for bad grammar as I'm writing this all in one, impulsive burst. This is also my first post ever so the formatting is definitely off.

I'm only sixteen but I've already messed up my life. With online school, I've gone from straight A's to failing a class and at risk for others. I have no connections to anyone and zero social skills due to isolating myself since grade school. My parents aren't supportive of me being trans, so any semblance of relationship I would build with them will be going down the gutter as I would need to go no contact after moving out. I've messed my body up with a combination of self-harm, dermatilomania, and bulimia. I feel so empty and in pain all the time. I previously gave myself until 26, but with all I've messed up I don't even have hope for a future past high school. For the first time, I'm seriously considering suicide as I have no clue how else to get it all to stop. Deep down, I know I want to live and experience good things, but I've messed up everything that would even allow that. Knowing me, I would self sabotage more if I ever become happy anyways. Is there anything that I can even do to move forward in the slightest?"
399,I'm not sure what to call my issue,"My state in my country underwent a massively strict lockdown in a very short space of time and it lasted nearly 6 months. All of a sudden, I was cut off from my family as I live alone in the city and my life was stripped down to just being an essential worker. 

They've stopped happening as often, but I started having moments when everything, including all of my senses went hazy and disoriented. I felt a little nauseous too. It only went away if I curled up in my bed, or walked around trying to shut my brain off. It didn't always, but the urge to cry happened a lot too. Sometimes it came out of nowhere, but most of the time, it happens because I get hit by a wave of deja vu if a conversation or event seems too similar to something I've experienced before. 

What's going on?"
400,i completely lost him and i think i am depressed and i have no idea what’s wrong with me or what’s going on i don’t know what to do anymore i feel empty and alone,"we broke up after a year of dating. right after the break up he clearly still loved me and we still talked everyday. we were planning to get back together one day. a few weeks later he got with someone else. he called me manipulative and toxic and so many other things. he basically said i ruined his entire life and that he just hadn’t realized. he said he never wants to be together with me again. he said he hated me but then later he went back on that. he said to my friends, who are also his friends that he thinks he loves his new partner. it’s been like 4 days of them being together and i’m so confused and angry. 

i am a mess. i have lost all of my motivation. it’s hard for me to sleep, to eat and to get out of bed. i mostly talk on the phone with my friends all day because it’s the only thing that gives me any happiness. i realized that i really was the problem. i am a very toxic person but i don’t want to be. i want to be good. i just have very intense emotions and mood swings that can cause me to unintentionally manipulate people. i never want to hurt anyone. especially not him. i did a lot of awful things to him. i clinged to him and depended on him for everything. it was too much for him to handle. i had let my mental illnesses overtake me at that time. he couldn’t handle it and so he left. i recently just realized that our relationship was very toxic. 

i don’t even want to be with him anymore in that way. he’s hurt me too badly. i just want to be loved by somebody. i feel so alone without him. especially hearing about his new relationship. when he told me he was dating someone else i completely broke down. i was hyperventilating and sobbing and gagging and shaking in my moms arms. i’m only 14. it’s just that he had become everything to me. he was my best friend. then he just left one day. he found someone else so fast and got completely over me. i wish i could get over him the same way. i feel embarrassed and ashamed for taking this so seriously. i know i’m very young but i just really truly did love him."
401,Do you guys lie sometimes or almost always during your therapy sessions ?,"This is a real honest question, I am feeling really lost right now. I have been in therapy for a few sessions now, and I am getting better at expressing my feelings and my past, but there is still so much I can’t express honestly, and I don’t know how to feel about it. And so sometimes still, I am lying or not answering questions. What can I do ?"
402,I want to kill people all the time,"I constantly want to murder people in the most horrific ways and it applies mainly to feminists, SJWs and the lgbt community. Should I get help? Social media makes me want to act out on these impulses as I constantly read and see the dumbest shit ever posted by these types of people. Please help before I go on a murder spree (I’m really not joking) thank you."
403,I feel like I can't ask for help because I don't want people to look at me differently,"I need help. I know I do. But I just can't bring myself to talk to anyone about it because I don't want them to look at me differently. I'm afraid they'll see me as crazy or weak. It was really hard even posting on this subreddit, even though I'm fairly sure nobody I know personally will ever see this.

I know my friends and family would be supportive or understanding. I'm not afraid of what they'll say or what they'll do, I'm just afraid that they'll think differently of me."
404,Self harming while distracted? TW TW TW,"TW: mention of self harm

So I haven’t self harmed regularly in about 3 years, but have done on a few isolated occasions. No incidents within the last 6 months or so.

I was SO stressed on Monday. I’m dealing with grief, an eating disorder, depression, anxiety, and then on Sunday I found out that my boyfriend of 4 years had tinder. The next day I had to get up at 5am, work a full day, then do an intense phone interview for a really competitive job. 

I was on the phone with the woman and she was asking me some pretty difficult, technical questions. I was so stressed out and was trying my best to hold myself together and answer well. 

After we finished I ended the call and looked down, and my leg was covered in blood. There was a push pin in my hand and I’d been self harming without even realizing? I literally didn’t feel the pain at all?

It’s shaken me up quite a bit. I’m worried, nothing like this has happened before. Has anyone experienced anything similar?"
405,I’m ready for this year to be over,This was the worst year of my life. I was hit hard with my depression. I got my heart shattered. My best friend stopped being my friend. My grandparents died within 2 weeks of each other. I stopped eating properly— underweight now. I got sexually assaulted by my best guy friend. Whenever I get anxious now I throw up. I almost left this planet. But I’m still here. I survived. I survived through the worse depressive state I’ve ever been in. I used to cry all day everyday. I can’t even describe the way I felt. I made it out of the tunnel. I’m alive. I feel better. Healing isn’t linear but I healed. For the most part. I’m on a new journey. A happier one. And fuck everyone that has hurt me this past year. I made it out stronger than what I was before. 2020 was the year that destroyed me but it didn’t kill me.
406,Not sure what this is?,"Once in a while, when I'm sitting working or even lying in bed with the lights off, I'll think I'm somewhere else.  It's always a split second and ends when I realize it's not where I actually am.  The thing is, it's always somewhere I've been before.  It's happened where I've been lying in bed and in my head the layout of my room changes to the one I had as a kid.  But as soon as I think ""wait that's not right"", it's like it never happened.  Today I was working on my computer and felt like in my peripheral I was at the computer at my mom's house.  As soon as I recognized what was happening it was over.  It's sometimes really disorienting, but there's never any negative feelings attached so I don't think it's depersonalization or part of my depression. 

I'm not sure if this is an ADHD thing or if it's something everyone experiences?  Googling it got me nowhere."
407,My brain is fucked I don't know where else to go for help,"For the past two years of my life I have been living in complete misery. I feel like shit constantly. Nothing feels real. I'm even beginning to lose my cognitive capabilities. I used to be a very smart guy. I've losing my ability to use reason through induction. I can no longer write quality ideas or answer a question in a broad manner. I find that I blank a lot. I will be asked a question and I can only go so far before I lose track. I'm currently seeing a psychologist, psychiatrist, and therapist. So far neither therapy nor medicine has made any change to my state of brain fog. I'm really feeling like death is the only option. I'm going wait to get my results from my psychologist before taking action."
408,Random bursts of self hate,"I hate myself and I've lived with that and avoided the thoughts and I'm doing great, studying my masters and I'm a great relationship but sometimes I get random burst of anxiety and self hate and just ponder about everything I've done wrong, right now it's just because I was too hyper and did a few things out of character.

How do I deal with these emotions? I don't want to see any one professional, I'm just wondering if this is a thing others deal with and if there are ways to tackle the bursts of emotions."
409,I (m23) can't stop eating,"My mum died 2 and a half years ago after a 6 year battle with cancer, my coping mechanism has always been to eat and I have so far been unable to shake the habit. This has seen my weight go from 80kg to 130kg in the space of 2 years. Whenever I feel the slightest bit sad about life, I eat, whenever I worry about my body image due to my weight gain, I eat. Its a vicious cycle and I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips to tackle the problem before it causes me serious health complications. Thank you in advance!"
410,Need a second opinion,"I think i might have these disorders and i need a 2nd opinion and if i should get a therapist. so all you need to know is im underaged. 1st thing maybe anxiety, this is something ive noticed, when i go over to my aunts place, im always so scared to go into any room, like my cousins room. my brother always is with him in the room and id love to join, but i just am so scared, have to think about for hours at a time if i should do it, and likely i decide against it. also im very scared of joining online classes if theres less than like 5 people already joined. 2nd thing is MAYBE depression, since like id say june, ive been completely unmotivated, lost all my interests at an instant. I hate doing the things i love, i cant keep up with higiene, i just cant do it, i have to force myself. i do not care about music school anymore. i used to be very passionate about it, but i just completely do not care anymore. i hate drawing now, even have a wacom tablet, cant even force myself to draw anything. but i cry maybe like once every 2-3 months. I'd love to be able to cry, but i cant. ANYWAYSSS, what do yall think?"

412,Problems in Therapy,"I've been a silent member of this community for the last couple of month. Im looking for advise or recommendations. For the last 6 month I have been in weekly group and single therapy about my severe depression which I have been coping for the last 2 years. For now 2 weeks I have the feeling and the recurring thought that my therapist doesn't really understand me and how Im feeling and especially what I need from her. I have the feeling we are only moving one Problem from a to b and that we only scratch the surface of my mental illness.  My worry is that I doesn't get better only worse again.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Im quite unsure what to do about this problem if its only a temporary thought or should I confront my therapist about my feelings and thoughts. Maybe some of you have had the same experience and could give me a bit of help."

415,Why do I want to be alone,"Ok so I'm 14, and when I come back from school I get so annoyed when I'm interrupted by my family. My family dont do anything wrong, and I cant 3xplain why but I just feel almost restless whilst they come into my room while I'm doing something.

One of my parents recently had a brief conversation with me about how they feel they dont know me anymore and I dont know what to do. I feel weird even hugging them even tho I feel we have a fine relationship. I didnt know what to say, as I felt very weird in the situation like I cant explain it 

Why is this? Is this normal? What do I do cos this cant be what it should be like"
416,I don't think my brother is trying to free himself from depression,"My brother has been depressed for over a decade.  He is in his late twenties and it started near the end of high school when our parents told him he was worthless.  He was not good at doing anything except for drawing and art, but at the time they didn't let him pursue that career.  He has been dating his girlfriend for 8 years and now has a full-time job as an artist.  Having said that, his depression ""still hasn't gone away"".

I won't go as far as saying that at this point he's faking it, but I do think that he would rather be depressed than not.  Here's why:

He has a habit of constantly making excuses for his shortcomings and responsibilities (""I forgot, ""I'm depressed"").  He knows all the depression symptoms by heart and will use it to justify his actions.  A part of me suspects that he's gotten so used to using depression as an excuse that he wants to stay in that zone where he can have unlimited passes.  

He is always looking for depressing things to read or watch,  whether it's negative news articles or TV shows/anime with the most darkest plot, he is fiending for it.

One day he said he came home from a doctor visit and said that the doctor diagnosed him with some sort of anxiety.  This really made me really uncomfortable because he was smirking the entire time he was talking about it.

He refuses to live a proper lifestyle and take care of himself (consistent meals, proper sleep).  My mom still cooks all his meals and cleans up after him.  He attributes this to how these are common symptoms of depression.

He does not want to take antidepressants because it will make him ""unproductive"" at work.

Whenever he's not feeling good, he has to make it known.  He slouches over in a seated fetal position with a sad look on his face like he's waiting to be asked about his problems.  After talking to him about his problems and changing the subject he will constantly try to steer the conversation back to his depression and his problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like lately it's been his mission to prove to everybody that he's mentally ill rather than taking steps to fix it."

419,"Half of my family has died this year, l watched three of them die, one of which was violent, made decisions that lead to not being there for the others when they should have had help or love and with some of them a lack of quick covid-era reactions to save or prevent led directly to their death.","What lve always considered to be my family was my mom, my two sisters, my nephew, my aunt(mom)and uncle,  two cousins, my two grandparents (mom), my great-grandmother. 

There's other people on the fringe who very much my extended family,  but these people have always been the ones who are my blood and part of who l am where we get each other more than anyone else and have that love of being the most important people in our lives above friends or coworkers or the dating spouses that come and go. 


Five years ago my 7 year old cousin died of leukemia. It was absolutely devastating as l'd never experienced such a tragic event such as that. Someone so young and who l cared about so deeply. I'd never faced cancer before so l was ignorantly optimistic that she would not die any time soon, maybe 10 years on as a worse case scenario,  surely not as a child.  I have many regrets for things l did not do and selfish choices l made to not spend time with her when it was still scary for me to see someone l loved dying in front of my eyes and leaned towards denial and avoidance of the incoming truth. When l went to visit her for the last time and the first time in months l wasn't prepared for her to already be unconscious and hours from her death. 

This was a life changing experience for me that in retrospect led to some PTSD'esque behavior but nothing at the time l would've considered life destroying for me.  I tried to take the lesson from this that life had to be lived and while l look back and see the depression that l did not recognize at the time,  l focused instead on what l believed was a new found belief that my life was a gift and l had to do things like travel to the other side of the world or kiss the girl you like just because you're going to die eventually.  I see now how that was actually the birth of some self destructive tendencies but at the time, l thought l was living the way you should after such a tragedy. 

Then, three years ago my mother was diagnosed with stomach/throat cancer and grandmother had a life destroying stroke within the same week. In the year and a half that followed my mother had her stomach completely removed during a surgery where they were only going to take some of it when they went in, which was incredibly hard as it's something l didn't even know was possible and resulted in an unbelievably impossible quality of life that lead to her becoming bed ridden, undiagnosed depression as we all lived shell-shocked and in a haze over the horrors of what was happening to her,  eventually weighing only 56lbs by the beginning of the year when her cancer returned. I have so many terrible painful stories from that time of things that in retrospect l wish l'd had the clarity of mind to do differently or to help her when we lived in a constant state of just getting through the day. 

Within two weeks of her cancer returning (this was one year ago)  l received a call at 3am that was the call to rush to the hospital because my mother was coughing up blood. They attempted to stabilize and seemed to once bringing her to the ICU, but she was in shock and couldn't speak or fix her eyes onto anything.  Within minutes in the ICU l went to fix her pillow and saw blood was pouring from her mouth and pooling next to her. Over the course of the day they attempted to help the bleeding but kept trying to make it very clear that my mom was not going to make it through the day, l fought the idea of giving up on her as she had always told me she wanted life to always be chosen over drugs to let her die. Eventually, a doctor spelled enough out that it broke me and l agreed that if she needed to be resuscitated again to just let it happen.  I watched her bleed to death over the course of the day and stood crying insanely and holding her hand telling her she would make it for half an hour just in case she heard me and was scared we'd given up once they believed she was minutes away.  I could write 15 more paragraphs truly explaining every last detail of this day. 

I fell into a pretty insane depression after this, and experienced intense PTSD that changed my personality and the way my mind worked entirely.  I lost 20 pounds to stress and now, a year later my hairline has receded at a crazy excelerated rate going from a slight widows peak to the point now where only a year later I'm going to need to shave my head if l don't want to look like a sad man with a combover. 

It took about two months for me to reach a day where l woke up and felt that this day would be the beginning of my path back to a good life.  That same day my grandfather (Papa) was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer after himself losing weight and being all kinds of off but the belief in the family was that it was just the similar shock of watching his daughter die.

Long story short l then immediately began helping Papa with his cancer 3 or 4 days out of the week until l finally felt that as much as l loved him l just knew l couldn't do this again or it would destroy what was left of me.... that week covid happened, and with the loss of my job and the need to quarantine NOT in Brooklyn at that time, and the knowledge that my grandfather would now truly have no help or outlets for companionship, l decided to wait out the ""14 days to flatten the curve"" with him and my aunt. I'm still living in that house. 

Backing up to the initial diagnosis His wife,  my grandmother with the stroke had been living at home and being taken care of by him, but their quality of life had fallen terribly over the months to the point where we were considering it an abusive/neglected situation prior to my mother's death but the shared trauma made us all very slow and depressed with taking action to better their lives, leaving them to suffer on their own for the better part of 2019 in a terrible, disgusting living situation with little to no help. When he was diagnosed the idea of ""maybe we need to put our foot down that even though she didn't want this,  she would have to live in a nursing home for at least his treatments and in our minds probably forever after that,  though she fought it tooth and nail and every day begged us to take her home.  

I watched my grandfather deteriorate and age 40 years physically and mentally in 3 months.  I can't begin to fully detail all of the insane things l experienced with him every single day during that time from New found dementia symptoms to falling and hurting himself multiple times a day to the point where there was a month where every single day l was awoken from my bed to the sound of either hearing or being told he had fallen and l was needed to pick him up off the ground.  I can't continue to detail more.

We began to see news that nursing homes were being devastated by covid.  But with the 24/7 life of only taking care of a dying man, we didn't take action about getting my grandmother out of a nursing home when we had checked her in in the first place because we could not handle attempting to care for her as well. One week she called me and begged to be taken out of the home before she caught the virus but we held on to the false hope that with no visitation there was no reason a quarantined home would get it, and then within the next few days we found out it had arrived in her home. We decided then to get her out but this being within the first few weeks of the pandemic and distracted with our own traumatic 24/7 living conditions in which noone could even help if they wanted to because the strict early times isolation everyone was following, we just weren't used to living in a time where you need to act no or your life can be over tomorrow.  So instead of getting her the day we decided to do it, we made a plan for that weekend to take her out and have her Quaratine with my cousin in a hotel just in case she had it but as a formality really in our minds.  Well a few days into her stay at the hotel,  it became clear that she did indeed have covid... and oh... she had COPD, a devastating breathing disease. She was taken to the hospital and two days later we were finally able to have a brief 5 minute webcam conversation with her about how they expected her to be better by the next day or so. The next morning we woke up to the news that she had died during the night. My grandfather, who was already beginning to deteriorate did not take this news well.

The funeral was the worst experience of my life.  It was only us three because early covid restrictions. We were all required to wear gloves,  the panic was high in the room at the feeling that the disease was airborne,  and the entire service and day only lasted for about 45 minutes.

5 weeks later my grandfather finished cancer treatments but was now completely mentally unable to remember that just because food had no taste didn't mean he couldn't eat.  We demanded him to drink boost protein drinks multiple times a day which became an issue along the lines of him feeling we were torturing and dominating him on purpose to make him suffer.  He was down to 105 lbs by this point.  When bringing him for his check up the next week the doctor was very concerned by his looks and his mind and wanted to keep him to run tests.  We knew what would happen but what were we going to do? This was at a time where the hospitals were packed and no visitation was allowed and we were concerned he would not receive the care he would need to survive.  We were assured that he'd only be there for 3 days.  Those three days became 10 days of ""tomorrow we'll have the resources"" before we simply were forced to take him back out without any of the tests being done.  Without the proper care or attention, he was likely being given meals that he did not eat which were taken away and essentially starved him for 10 days. On the day he was released they surprised us with papers agreeing that he needed to be on hospice care from this point forward. When he was returned to our home, he was now on his death bed and within days he died. I was in the room with him when it happened.

Its getting progressively more exhausting to explain all this so l will just simply say that yesterday, after months of us wanting to make plans to see her which were always put off due to covid restrictions and spikings and all that,  my great grandmother Mama died after likely catching covid and being unable to breathe.  We did not know she was sick until after finding out she was dead.

I now have to go to the fifth family funeral on Thursday or Friday of this week and l honestly do not know if l can do it.  I had just been considering leaving this house which l have been in all year with my grandfather and all that.  It's myself,  my aunt and my uncle (the ones who lost their child) but quite frankly, they have become mentally exhausting to live with as they clearly have not dealt with her death in any type of healthy ways, looking at me and treating me as if l am their teenage son in their house and not a grown ass man,  which has really fucked with my state of mind to point where l feel myself living as if l am bound to their rules and lifestyle in the same way a high school teenager has no choice but to do whatever his parents say and to make matters worse l have spent the last decade of my life in a city with no need for a car and thus don't even have the freedom to drive off the property or anywhere on my own, completely dependent on them to bring me anywhere.... which is no where because l have no life.  I'm 30 and used to have an entire life of my own that has devolved into living here with no friends, job or life of my own. My uncle always has work around the house to be done that he ""needs a hand"" with guilting and forcing me to participate in order to earn my keep and sometimes just means standing there and handing him tools like I'm a fucking 10 year old boy, and then dealing with his lectures and his sad eyes over why l should be more interested in learning about the things he's doing when all l see is that l have no identity, no agency and have somehow regressed to being a 30 year old boy that's spoken to and treated as such and in no way feels like my own man. My aunt is becoming near schizophrenic levels of devoted to the church with beliefs that God has shown her visions of why she needs to dedicate every moment of her life the religion and save our souls. 

I'm completely lost, have vague ideas of returning to an room in an apt l have been paying for throughout the entire pandemic to reclaim my life but have no concrete plan on what that actually means and with the way covid news has been unfolding it appears that NYC is now just as bad if not worse when it comes to daily deaths and new cases than it has ever been in this entire year. And since I'm being honest about fucking every last detail of my mind and soul, l have not gone on a date, had sex or even romantically touched a woman in any way over 2 and a half years since my mother was initially diagnosed and l had just broken up with a long term girlfriend so the idea of getting back in there always felt like it should wait until a better emotional time period which has never come thanks to the years of nonstop trauma and devastation that have come since. 

I'm not even positive I've truly detailed everything,  as l very much wrote this as a 6am, still awake from the insomnia of needing to just voice this, stream of consciousness. There were two other extended family members who died suddenly before covid that l regret not visiting as they had always asked me to. There were devastatingly dumb dating life choices that has led me to not have a real, healthy bf/gf relationship in the last five years, instead being in situations where l was the other man to a failing long term couple or the FWB to an ex where we both mutually no longer wished to be together but tortured ourselves by continuing to find sex with each other instead of with someone new etc. My career goals have been non existent since my mother's diagnosis to point now with that being three years ago and unemployed via the pandemic from the side job that had become the only job, all feel like lifetimes ago l even held such aspirations. I feel as though I've suddenly gone from a 25 year old to 30 year old body with no recollection of how l got here or why lm realizing that l don't know when l starting living in constant physical back and shoulder blade pain and it seems a curve developed in my spine from slouching for years and standing to compensate the shoulder pain which began about six of so years ago much more slightly and easily livable but l both brush off as just normal aging stuff but have recently begun to question if lve just been so busy self medicating with things like Tylenol and marijuana and drinks that now cutting back on those l may be feeling real issues that are years and years overdue to have looked at by a doctor. 

I get the feeling that the last few paragraphs have just become ""Well since l'm saying everything bad that's happened, here's just everything else too"" and the writer in me wants to wrap all of this up with a bow or edit it down to just the deaths of this past year but fuck it, l try to tell myself that this is all just normal shit that happens to people and the my life is fine because at any moment l can just choose to get right back to where l was 5 years ago and pick it all back up again like no time had passed, l tell myself to be charming on the dating apps I've just recently starting using again and act like the old me and fake it til l make it and to carry that over to finding a new job and returning to my home in NYC and building a life for myself.  But there is no world right now is how l feel.  That the whole world is shut down even if l wanted to try to stand back up and that this shit actually isn't normal. Which is really hard for me to admit to myself, that l actually need to accept that my life has been abnormally devastating, not just the same as most people my age but with the details changed. I don't know, all l know is that if l don't force musky myself to stop writing l just never will and will never go to sleep."
420,Broke up with a girl that was never mine.,"I feel broken. I'm a 16yo Male.

I met this girl through a friend. She lives in Maryland. Remember this bit. I met her around April during the start of the pandemic. We started talking on the phone starting on FaceTime and Snapchat. At first I really didn’t consider her all that attractive but she considered me attractive. At first we were just friends, friends that would call each other everyday, over quarantine. I want to note that she had a boyfriend at this time. Over the course our friendship she broke up with him and gained a new boyfriend. When this happened I felt pretty hurt. I couldn’t distinguish why but I felt hurt. So I told her I was done talking to her for a bit and it hurt her and she could not tell why. This is when I found I had feelings for her. A week or so later I talked to her again. Fast forward onto school, I’m starting to feel bothered. I realize I want to see this girl. It becomes the only thing I want. Slowly I abandoned my interests in the gym but my performance in school is still well maintained. Now I want to include this piece of knowledge. I want to note, I live in Florida. Now I know what your thinking. She lives in Maryland. I live in Florida. This isn't going to work. Well, I didn't care and so I did what any crazy person would do, I went to see her. I'm not going to note how I managed to go from Maryland to Florida but let's say I pulled some strings and got my way. I can tell you that what I did was quite out of character and this is not something I would have done so the year prior to this happening. When I saw her we hooked up. This is when everything goes to shit. By doing this I think I’m mentally made myself completely vulnerable. As I went back to Florida, I realized in the next week that I could not live without this person and I slogged through the next week with no drive. This happened over a month ago I am now writing because I cannot take it anymore. I’m going crazy. This is the only person I can think about. I know this is of one girl but I feel like I connected with her like no one else. After going back to Florida, I told her I would no longer talk to her and she cried. I feel like it’s affecting me worse than it affected her. I am not someone that talks to the opposite gender to where I have options. The worst part is I look like a mess to others and I feel like a mess and I have no drive to even put on a façade that I can use to get someone that I can use to distract myself from her. I feel like this is the ultimate conundrum. I’m writing this because I felt tempted to add her back on Snapchat and on her story that I accidentally checked, To my luck it was her boyfriends birthday and it was her with him. I have distinguished seeing (Her with her boyfriend) As a trigger. Even though we were ""friends"" It drove me CRAZY. I literally cannot handle the site of seeing her with someone else. I made myself so vulnerable to her because I was able to connect with her like no one else. I am well aware that you are not supposed to put another being rather than yourself on a pedestal but internally I always feel that way because the way she once made me feel. I have no drive for anything, Or anyone but I am trying, I am trying. I attempt to go to the gym and I just slog through the work out. I go to school and I just slog through the classes not paying attention to a damn thing. I go home and I lay down for a few hours before doing an hour of work total. Thank God I got all A’s last quarter so now I can I can get B's And it will average out to A's so I am not affected by this. I don’t know what I’m going to do for the future because I do not see this getting better. I cannot find a way to distract myself from this and I need serious help. I’ve always been kind of a down person but this is really sent me and I really never understood this constant weight that does not ever ever go away. Not like this. Please  help."
421,am i getting dumber,"I just need any shred of affirmations I can get my hands on. I'll keep it concise, My parents always told me that as long as I believe something about myself wholeheartedly, my mind would change to suit those desires. If I believed, 100%, that my eye color was green, it would then change. I never really believed this, until my fucking mind knew it was convenient. I draw, and I recently drew something I was proud of, and I realized my progress.  I felt it was the one thing I could finally do half-decently. My mind is a piece of fucking shit. It's always there, ushering in a new invasive thought that lingers and never leaves until it's replaced. This time, it went and procured something along the lines of 'what if you got dumber? What if your mind was to deteriorate faster? What if you lost all that muscle memory you've spent months working on? It started small, but the thought wouldn't leave my head, and it only grew more prevalent with each time I inevitably fucked up something. I'd think it was evidence of me deteriorating, which would in turn make me believe it more. This unbreakable cycle of failure is only snowballing, and I can't fucking understand how to rid of it. i need something to tell myself, my stupid fucking brain, so I don';t believe this as much. I've been noticing a slight decrease in my cognitive functions over the past week, and I'm getting really fucking paranoid. My 'intelligence' is the only thing that redeems me, despite me not being that intelligent. I've worked hard to accumulate some of it though, and my biggest fear is losing it all. I can't tell if I'm fucking mentally ill. I don';t know where to go, or where to post this, so I'm going here. I'd really just appreciate some evidence that works against these fucking superstitions my mind loves to create."
422,Question about reaching out to someone,"Question about reaching out to someone

Recently I’ve been feeling pretty bad about everything, school kept me distracted but now that the semesters over I’ve got all the time in the world to be miserable. There is a girl in my year that I’m familiar with who’s been very open about her mental health experience. I was wondering if would be too much to ask her some question about her experience and maybe ask for some guidance? It’s tempting to me but I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or force my issues onto her. 


Also, I know it’s stupid but I’m pretty embarrassed about this and I wouldn’t really feel comfortable talking to a close friend or family member about it for whatever reason. 

Thanks"
423,Why doesn’t therapy work?,"I’ve had three different therapists over a year and none of them provided the same diagnosis and only one provided successful partial treatment. The first one was completely toxic and I left after her suggestions only made my life worse and permanently severed several of my relationships. The second one was the best and I saw clear improvement after two months, but my situation was ongoing and toxic and I could not get through without support. She left due to personal reasons after this period of time and suggested my third therapist. She was nice but could not provide the support I needed and was ineffective so I left. Eventually I sorted out my own problem, but I feel as though therapy did more damage than helped, and I don’t trust visiting another therapist.

The first therapist completely crushed my sense of self while I was already dealing with a difficult situation. I was left unable to trust my instincts (which were correct) when she claimed it was anxiety speaking, and not  reality. The second was very helpful but I felt like I was completely dependent on her. It was exactly what I needed at the time since I could not easily get through my responsibilities without reassurance, and I know I would have become a stronger person with my second therapist over time but after she left I felt like I was completely dependent on my therapist. The third therapist was not very supportive but also not toxic. She made me question my instincts again, and could not answer my constant questions. Even though it took a long time I was able to sort out my problem but my therapist felt more like an observer than a guide. As a result I still don’t trust myself fully even though I know I can make good decisions, mostly because she couldn’t answer my questions and the few pieces of advice she did provide did not really help me gain any insight. Actually after my third therapist I’m questioning more aspects of my life and feel more insecure about more elements of my life and less confident in general, even though my confidence in regards to my problem has increased. 

I’m not sure if therapy works for me, I never received a plan of what success looks like, I only have more questions about my life as a whole and feel less secure about my life than before the problems started. I feel like my life was worsened because of therapy in general. I definitely don’t want to attend therapy again because I believe it caused more problems than solved, and I only solved my problem with the help of others outside of therapy. If it weren’t for therapy, I think my problem would have been solved a lot sooner with less damage to my sense of self. I don’t believe therapy helped me actually solve my problem, so why didn’t therapy work for me?"
424,Contacting suicide hotlines even though I'm not suicidal?,"Basically the title. I'm just in a really bad mental state and have been for a pretty long time, I don't eat or sleep and if this keeps up I might end up in a hospital, but I'm not suicidal (I've never even once been in my life tho I experienced some pretty bad things, I literally just can't assume the luxury of suicide). However I have 0 money and can't afford therapy, but I just need some asap counselling rn by an actual professional cuz my friends can't help me anymore at this point. So I was thinking suicide hotlines but I'm afraid I may be wasting their time and keeping the line occupied for a person that's actually suicidal. Anyone has experience with this? Should I give it a shot and call them?Ty for the help and sorry if I have any spelling errors"

426,Bad Habits / Coping,"This is a lot to unpack here but sit tight. M20 here. Recently I told my girlfriend a bunch of things that were eating me up. Last year I went through a break up that was for the better but things stuck with me. My last ex was very emotionally abusive in the worst ways possible. She was 100% unfaithful and was draining but I chose to stay anyway because I was afraid I wouldn’t have anyone else. Luckily I managed to get the courage to break up with her but the negatives of the relationship stuck with me. With my current girlfriend, she’s the most incredible person and so wholesome, but I spilled a few things to her. In the beginning of our relationship, I would do this thing where in a depressive mood I would decide to m*sturb*te. But when I would, thoughts of my currently gf and her ex bf would cloud my thoughts and make me feel even WORSE than I already felt. She was in the same boat where she was in a relationship where her partner was emotionally abusive but she stayed away, which kills me anytime I think of her in that situation. But, I hated thinking of her being emotionally abused or her having s*x with him in my head because it would make me feel like shit imagining that, it would make me feel guilty for some reason. So I would start watching p*rn to silence the thoughts of my girlfriend and her ex. The reason I am here is because I need help trying to understand my brain so I can explain better to my girlfriend. She feels very hurt because both of our exes had a common thing where they were addicted to watching p*rn and comparing our s*x to what they were watching so she felt hurt when I said I watched. But I’m trying to explain to her this. When I would m*sturb*te, I would be in a depressive mood and a random intrusive thought of her and her ex would pop into my head. It would make me feel like complete trash so to mask the thoughts and quiet them, I would put on p*rn. It did nothing for me, I did finish but the videos itself did nothing for me. It was just a way to feel guilty for something else. Because once I was done I felt guilty for watching p*rn, which is what I was trying to go for because the plan was to silence those thoughts of her and her ex. Of course it wasn’t a good way to silence them, but I have never been good with emotions and intrusive thoughts. She feels hurt and betrayed but I have no idea how else to explain it to her. For some reason when I do those things I feel like I’m punishing myself. I’m pushing myself for thinking those things by watching p*rn even though I am trying to reassure to her that watching that meant nothing to me even though I would finish at the end. My mental health has always been horrid growing up, but recently I feel like I’ve just developed some bad habits to mask all the intrusive thoughts that go on in my head. I just want to get bette, for me and for her since she’s a huge help in why I’m still even alive. But I don’t even know why I do this myself. I don’t know why I punish myself by thinking that way, watching the videos, and then end up feeling incredibly guilty afterwards. How can I make her know that it’s just my mental state toying with me and that just having those videos on in the background is my way of masking my intrusive thoughts? + bad way, I may add. I hate that this is a bad habit of mine and I really wish to stop but I have no idea how..."
427,How to deal with disconnect from reality caused by depression?,"I sometimes feel too low energy to do anything, and on those days I fell like everything starts to blur together and reality starts to slip away. It's honestly one of the most terrifying feelings I've ever experienced and I have no idea how to stop it or at least make it less present. How can I help myself get past this?"
428,I stopped taking my lexapro two years ago and my doctor doesn’t know. How do I tell him I want to stop taking it? (throwaway),"I guess i’ll just jump right into it, I really need advice here. So in 2018 I was put onto a 72 hour mental health hold at an emergency room due to self harm and suicidal ideations I was having. At the time, I wasn’t seeing a therapist anymore and wasn’t on any meds. They ended up not being able to find a bed for me at an actual facility, so I was able to go home from the ER with the expectation that I would get in with a therapist and a doctor to think about starting some meds.

   My doctor that controls my prescriptions is amazing, probably the best i’ve had. I’ve stuck with him since this incident in 2018. He ended up putting me on lexapro shortly after I started seeing him. From the beginning, I was hesitant about starting an antidepressant and made that very clear to him. (My past experiences with them weren’t the best) however, we decided to try lexapro. 

   Not long after I got my prescription, (roughly 2 months after) I went on vacation, and forgot my lexapro at home. I was only out of town for a few days, so I figured I’d not worry about it and I would start taking them again when I got back. Long story short, I just never got in the habit of taking the lexapro again. It’s been over two years of this and I have been getting my prescription for the lexapro every month and not taking it. I don’t know why I didn’t just tell my doctor this when it happened, but I didn’t. i’ve also since been put on adderall for my adhd, so every day when I take my adderall, I usually end up just throwing away what my daily dose for lexapro would be. I’m not paying for them, my insurance does. (I know it’s awful I feel guilty about it all the time.) I am fine without the lexapro and the adderall has honestly helped a lot. I haven’t had another bad incident with suicidal thoughts or self harm since 2018, and I honestly don’t feel I need it. 


    I’m still depressed yes, but i’ve gotten better in other ways than taking medication and am honestly very proud of how well my mental state has been and how good care i’ve been taking of myself. I don’t really know how to tell my doctor I don’t want the lexapro anymore. I don’t think I should tell him I stopped taking it in 2018, however I feel like regardless he could see me not taking it as reckless behavior or something. My dad doesn’t know I’m not taking the lexapro either. Again, he is the best doctor i’ve had and I really wouldn’t want to switch or anything. One of the last times I talked to him, we were discussing bipolar symptoms I was showing and he advised me to maybe stop taking the lexapro for a few days when I get manic because sometimes it makes people worse, and he also didn’t have enough info to give me a proper bipolar diagnosis. 

  I was thinking I could maybe tell him the next time we talk that I stopped taking it for a few days when I got manic, and I ended up not taking it since because I noticed I felt a lot better without it. I mean I stopped taking it two years ago because I feel a lot better without it. I just don’t know what to do but I don’t want to keep throwing away these prescriptions I feel bad about it and it’s a waste of medication someone else may need. I feel really bad about all this but I just don’t know what to do about it or how to bring it up to him. Any advice is appreciated greatly I really need to do something about this."
429,"I haven't slept for 2 days, huge anxiety and fear of heart attack","Heeey, I am 15, and I am really not doing well with mental health. Yesterday I got very angry, and I started feeling very dizzy and had a gigantic pulse. I have had chest pain since then, and due to this chest pain, I haven't been able to sleep much, as I fear getting a heart attack. I need support urgently, my family treats it as if I'm going crazy."
430,No words 😞😭💔,...................
431,I feel like I manipulate people into liking me,"People tell me I’m “thoughtful” and “nice” and that I’m “so sweet”. But I feel like maybe I’m not actually thoughtful and sweet, I just feel compelled to do nice things for others because I want to reward of them thinking I’m nice and liking me. I know exactly what I’m doing when I do something “nice”, I know that people will appreciate it or be surprised in a good way. I find myself spending a lot of time, maybe even obsessing over at times, the next “thoughtful” thing I will do for someone and how it will make them happy.

Like for instance, I’ve been spending so much money on Christmas presents for my girlfriend and her sister and very close family friend because they told me they never got presents a lot growing up. I was planning on getting lots of gifts so I looks like it’s just overflowing out of the tree to surprise them in the morning with presents so it feels like they are kids again. But I feel like my motive for this is selfish and manipulative, like I’m doing it because I want to make them happy, I want to do something nice for them, and I want them to think I’m so sweet and nice and a good person.

Maybe this doesn’t make a lot of sense, and maybe it’s just me trying to find problems with myself, but I feel like maybe I’m just a manipulative asshole just trying to get people to like me."
432,Working with children when a violent bipolar?,"Hi guys. I'm just looking for a bit of advice. Just for a bit of background, I am from the UK so would ideally be looking for advice in relation to working within the UK (specifically Scotland).

Long story short, a guy I was seeing is diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He has been violent with me during an episode (waving a knife in my face after cutting himself and threatening to cut his throat as well as pushing and grabbing me) and also not during an episode. I have evidence of this (pictures of bruises, screenshots and a voice recording). 

He works with young children and as pissed off as I am at him for his violent behaviour, going behind my back several times and just being incredibly manipulative, I am also just worried when I think about how he is in charge of vulnerable people and could have an episode and cause harm to a kid. The police are aware of what happened and he has currently been sectioned. 

Are there any laws against people with Bipolar disorder who are generally just violent also working with children or if they were to be dismissed from a job, would this be considered discrimination?

Thanks!"
433,How to cope on days in between therapy?,"I have virtual visits with a therapist twice a week. I feel on top of the world following the sessions, but then begin to spiral again on the days in between.

Anyone else experience this? Does it get better with time? I have diagnosed ptsd for two things, as well as gad, and am in a situation right now that I am really happy about but at the same time triggers it terribly! 

What do you all do in between sessions to stay on track?"
434,I feel so lost in life and just need someplace to admit somethings.,"I'm an 18 year old college student studying for engineering. For my whole life I have always been told I was gifted and smarter than almost all of my peers. I always placed the highest on tests and never really had to work in school. I graduated high school with a 4.1 gpa while doing pretty much nothing all four years. However the farther out of high school I get the more I realize that I'm either not nearly as smart as I though I was, or I'm completely not setup to apply myself to pretty much anything. For the past 2 years I have been dealing with motivational issues and really finding things that I love to pour myself into. The only two things I really love in my life is going to the gym and playing some video games. I've always blurred the lines between different groups of friends and think I'm very decent at socializing and making friends. However I always have found it hard to really convince myself that I am as good as them and worthy to even hangout with them. I always worry about people judging me and talking about me and have always tried to mitigate that. I have always dealt with confidence issues and believe I view myself in a rather destructive way. This semester of college has been absolutely brutal on me and I have completely failed every class, dropping all but one and have an F in that class. I like to think it's because I'm not cut out for it or don't think It will work out for life but I believe the reality is I lack discipline and too an extant a healthy mental balance about life. The only times I feel genuine joy is the occasional times I hang out with friends, but I still feel a sense of crippling loneliness as if no girl would ever love me or even talk to me. I just feel like my life is at an all time low and don't know how to deal with it. Id say the only positive is I don't think I could ever harm myself or commit suicide, because I guess I think going through the pain is better than ending it. Sorry if this is a rant I just really needed to get this off my chest."
435,Modern day neutering?,"I had a psychotic break 2 years ago which I'm still recovering from. I was immediately put on zoloft 175mg and respiridone  2mg. I had no choice as I was in a very bad state. My sex drive was completely killed, yes it came back to the point I could get off maybe once a week. But other than that it just seemed not needed anymore. All I have read is that it reduces sex hormones like testosterone. The more I read the more it makes sense. I have lost muscle mass significantly. But whats more interesting is I have cut my anti-phychotic by half and my libido has come back and I feel like I have my drive back. Are these drugs basically to tame your natural self down? Everything feels more real and it really makes me want to come off further."
436,"When both are different types of losses, I am wondering if losing a child or a partner is easier?","&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to figure out if a break up is harder or a loss of a child as people deal with these things differently? Since losing an ex, there is always a hope of them coming back, but losing a child is not"
437,My narcissism is killing me,"I stare at myself in the mirror constantly. Looking into my eyes I see an insatiable list for debauchery. If it feels good I’m entitled to it’s whereabouts, and even though morally I know that engaging in certain activity maybe be detrimental sometimes even life threatening the thrill of the moment always beats out discipline. Sometimes I wonder if I’m better off dead or if I’m slowly trying to kill myself and everyone around me. I feel this way because when I act on my addiction I put at risk myself and all those close to me. For example, when I smoke weed my personality dissolves and I become subdued reclusive and unproductive missing out on friends and life as a whole. But the possibility of feeling that one high that makes it all with it seems to always be of the utmost importance. The same seems to apply to unprotected promiscuous sex acts. I don’t know if narcissism and addiction run hand n hand but I wouldn’t be surprised. 

My addiction to pleasure is consuming me and I’m struggling to fight my urges. I do believe that connecting to a higher purpose(a future where I am the greatest version of myself) is important to overcome these dark desires but instant gratification over delayed gratification is so hard to fight. All I seem to care about is myself in moments of lack. But this isn’t who I want to be. Sometimes I feel powerless to my desires(woman,weed,alcohol,food,laziness) pls if anyone can relate or assist me in outgrowing these challenges pls help. Thank you"
438,Can barely work due to fight or flight responses. What should I do?,"I currently work in the medical field. I went into it hoping for 3 12 hour shifts so i could sleep the other days off. I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, PTSD, Bulimia, and Clinical depression. I take a multitude of meds citalopram, lamotrigine, and Adderall are my main ones currently. I grew up being told by the government I was being homeschooled but as locked in a room for seven years until a church member adopted me and got me out but later kicked me out and I now currently live with my father. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every place ive worked in the past I had to constantly decrease my hours due to mental health issues. At this job I am at which is supposed to be my career I am in constant panic out of fear of making my boss angry. I am in constant anger because of a coworker whos obnoxious and eats nonstop loudly. I am almost never angry and dealing with fear has been a normal for me as to just calm the panic attacks. This new coworker for about two months can only do one thing, and that one thing is draw blood. Because of covid, our clinics have made it so we're no longer needing or hiring phlebotomists as nurses do that job now. This coworker just sits and gets paid now because my manager likes them , that is all. They cannot help or do anything else legally nor do they want too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was upset today because this person was blasting christmas music from their phone and eating chicken while I was doing important paperwork and could not focus. Hospital food has little to no smell while the food they bring in has a pungent smell that burns my nose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very lost and do not know what to do. My panic attacks side effects last for hours (irregular heartbeat, confusion, fatigue, breathing difficulties, unable to focus etc) I want to keep being able to work so I can eventually live on my own for once and be normal. I need the insurance from my job to afford medicine and dental (bulimia messed up teeth bad but repairing them slowly). I am at the point of just walking out and quitting knowing I would lose my entire future over the stress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you been thru this? What do I do? Do I ask for less hours? Do I quit and try to get disability? Im scared to ask for less hours because we're so low staffed. I run near three stations and am nonstop on my feet. My manager will get mad at anything and everything and blow up and it scares the crap out of me. I also did not take my medical license exam because my mental health was too the point of police being at my house around the time I graduated. I have little to no friends or family for support. My cat and dad keep me alive otherwise id end this suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't hide my panic anymore, my grief, my incompetence due to stressfulness of others to make them happy. I don't ask the other coworker to stop because my other coworkers like them. I'm scared to ask for less hours because my manager would get pissed. What do I do? Thank you."
439,Why the lust for what we can’t have?,I just guess I wanted an educated explanations to y I always seem to care when it’s gone? Maybe because I haven’t found something to replace it. Maybe it’s not the thing but what I did with the thing I’m missing. Maybe it’s the challenge of recapturing it. Whatever it is I can’t seem to get along without her...
440,Changed mind about suicide but still struggling,"I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health for a very long time. I’m on medication, I’ve had therapists and I’ll have times where things are really good. I made great progress the past couple years and then had a major setback this year and have just been so tired of going through what feels like an endless cycle. I decided earlier this year that I didn’t want help anymore, I just wanted everything to be over. 

I’m a college student taking 7 classes. The work has been so overwhelming and I figured I was just going to die anyway so what was the point? But then I changed my mind. I know things are going to get better and worse my whole life and that’s exhausting but I love my family and I still have a lot of life left for the good things and I only have one more semester before I move on to a new chapter of my life and it doesn’t feel right to give up now. 

But now I’m so behind and overwhelmed that it’s hard for me to get everything done. I haven’t showered in a week, I don’t leave my room, I’ve barely slept in days and have gotten very little done. I have two group projects due tomorrow and Friday with my groups counting on me to get my part done tonight but I’m so exhausted from not sleeping I can’t think. 

I just wanted to come here so I could vent because I haven’t been able to anyone about this. I’m so overwhelmed and anxious about these projects that I just want a way out but I know these projects are such minor events in my life and come Friday they will be done. 

I’m going to take a shower, get something to eat, try to crank it out and then get some much needed sleep and try to have a better day tomorrow. Thank you for taking the time to read this 💕"
441,Is the doctor downplaying my symptoms?,"I recently spoke to a new doctor on the phone and for the first time said I think I have mental health issues as I got high results on an NHS depression and anxiety mood test, along with explaining some of my symptoms, which I have been feeling for well over a year. I studied psychology in college and as I learned the symptoms of depression I noticed I seemed to have a lot of them such as low mood, lack of energy, loss of interest in hobbies, consistent negative thoughts, etc. However, he seems to be downplaying it by suggesting it’s just a phase that will pass and is uninterested in diagnosing me or trying to get me reasonable adjustments at uni as he thinks it’s “premature”, yet I have literally had the same symptoms for a long time taking multiple online tests for depression and anxiety over the years. I’m not sure if he’s just being cautious and not wanting to prematurely diagnose me but to me it feels like I’m being neglected. Anyone have any experience of this?"
442,Has anyone told you to kill yourself,In my senior year of high school a guy kept messaging me. I had ignored it and then the last time he messaged me I told him to fuck off. His girlfriend then messaged me called me a bag of dykes and told me to kill myself. All because I would not give him a ride somewhere. The reason it bothered me was because my ocd had gotten very bad that year and i was already in a depressive state as it was. I had contemplated suicide multiple times before that and I would not doubt if that made my mental health worse.
443,Tomorrow's the day I've dreaded for a long time: my driver's test,"I'm not going to bore all of you with loads of monotonous backstory, but to get to the point, I'm terrified of cars and driving; I always have been. It's not like I've been in a bad car accident or anything, nothing's ever happened to me our anyone I know. 

So, naturally, learning to drive has been a struggle. I actually ended up massively procrastinating driving practice for months and months out of fear, so over the last week I've had to drive more than ever before. It's been VERY stressful, but a few mental breakdowns later, I've actually improved quite a lot! Practicing today with my dad, it went really well, and my parking jobs definitely would have scored me a pass (my test should only be parking stuff; there's a huge backup because of COVID so I think they're trying to make tests go quicker).

The issue is, like many people on here, my anxiety goes through the roof with many things, (school, social outings, etc.), but driving's something else... I can't even imagine how sick and panicky I'm going to feel tomorrow afternoon. The scary part is, I'm terrified that my nerves are going to take over, and everything's going to go wrong. Maybe I'll forget to signal, or mess up my parallel parking, I feel like absolutely everything could and will go wrong...

Now, I'm not on here to whine about my fears, I'm just in a really scary place mentally right now, and I'd love perhaps some words of encouragement or tips if you could muster them up! :) I'd also love the satisfaction of updating this post tomorrow to tell you all that I passed! Perhaps that can be motivation to keep me level-headed tomorrow..."
444,Adhd tics,"Ever since I’ve started adderall I’ve been getting a new tic every week it seems like. I’ve always had one certain tic with every new adhd med I’m put on, and I’m usually able to get over it after a few weeks. 

With adderall it seems all of my past tics have come full circle. Dry coughing/clearing my throat, fluttering my eyes, cracking my knuckles excessively, and some new ticks I’ve never had before like pushing my lips forward with my teeth constantly without even noticing it.

I'll be vaguely hungry and make the one thing that sounds good and as soon as it's done it makes me disgusted or I'll stand around literally for hours not able to pick anything because nothing sounds good. It's honestly been weeks now and I'll grab like a lemonade from starbucks (I try to get food or something else but I never eat it) and a snack pack of goldfish for the whole day. I'm sure part of why i feel so shitty is I'm not eating but I haven't been  able to force myself to.  I've been struggling health and mental health wise but idk what else to try at this point lol.

So, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2015 and I was diagnosed recently with depression again this year....I have been in a relationship for about a year and a half now, we just had a baby  and we plan to marry in January...The issue is me, I'm always afraid of being cheated on, abandoned or not enough...I get insecure and jealous about every woman around my partner. At first, he used to talk to a friend about everything, even when we were together, he would always be on the phone with her until I said I had an issue with her. There was a time where if he were to rate me on a scale of 1 to 10, I would be an 8. Then, there was a time we went on a trip and I was sitting right in front of him while he was watching the waitress the entire time. Not too long after that, we went to a store and he started flirting with the girl behind the counter about their zodiac signs and a show they were both into. On top of that, there was not much of a Valentine's Day and his proposal to marry me was not much either, it seemed like there was no effort. Then, there was a time on my birthday where one of his friends wanted us to come over, but I did not want to go because I was insecure since she has had romantic interest in him in the past...Instead of wanting to celebrate my birthday (I had my baby just five days prior), he wanted to argue about why I did not want to go and I told him that I was afraid of him and her being together,  he just told me that my feelings were annoying...That really hurt the most...I decided that I was nothing to him and I made a suicide attempt. Unfortunately, he found me in time to call an ambulance, so, I'm still here.  I'm literally afraid of every female out there, I'm always afraid that my looks and my personality are never enough and that he will cheat on me, leave me or lose interest in me. I'm so afraid, I feel nothing but jealousy and anxiety all the time even though I told him everything that I feel and he has done good things too (which is why I love him), but all these small things stay in my mind...I worry about everyone and I never feel enough. I do not know how to stop my thoughts and my feelings of jealousy, insecurity, anxiety and depression...I just cannot stop it that I'm afraid of eww everyone. I do not want to go to a doctor/therapist/psychiatrist (I do not trust them and I cannot afford them...I just do not know what to do, I have all these thoughts and feelings and the memories of everything bad keep on sticking no matter how much I try to let go...What is wrong with me?

I am left with a permanent injury. I will spend the rest of my life in constant pain. There will be things I can never do again. People tell me that others have it worse. That I’m lucky that they at least made the pain manageable. I know all of that. But the grass is always greener, you know? 

I will never be able to write again. I will never be able to hold my future children. It hurts to lock my front door. I’m on the verge of having to leave the job I love because of much it hurts. 
There’s nothing to make it easier anymore. They did all they could. Bracing, injections, medications, even surgery. And that’s it. They’re throwing in the towel. 

It’s left me depressed. It’s left me feeling like I’m useless now. Others have it worse, but it doesn’t change how bad the situation is for me. And I wish people would see that, and understand it. Things are worse for others, but it doesn’t mean that I’m not hurting for the things I face."
448,Please share your story about how medication helped you,"I’ve been struggling since I graduated high school about 5 years ago. I’ve felt just empty and slow and like weird. I’ve done everything to avoid getting on medication but I finally came to the realization it’s time I seek some help. I’ve got an appointment with a psych in January I’ve been waiting on. 

All I want is to feel like myself again . I worry about medication. I worry that it won’t help and I’m scared to try it. If you could please share your story about how medication has helped you. It would really mean a lot and help as some encouragement. Thanks in advance"

450,I’m going insane because I have nothing to do.,"I haven’t been in school for months, and I rarely leave the house. I was fine just gaming a week ago, but now I’m just so extremely bored I could rip my eyes out. I started watching Minecraft YouTubers/Streamers too, but then I became a bit “obsessed”. Like not stalking them or anything, just watching them nonstop. I am very obsessive and compulsive, and I’ve been like that my whole life. I usually find stuff and I become obsessed for weeks, then suddenly stop. I started playing CS:GO in February, then I sort of got obsessed and managed to waste 600 hours on it during 5 months or so. 

I don’t really know, but anyways, right now I can’t find something new to do. I just watch streams, sleep, play Minecraft and eat. I feel like I’m going crazy. What do I do? 

Note: Please don’t say I should go outside; I struggle with OCD and I’m terrified of going outside because of germs and stuff, especially during the winter. I have emetophobia and I will not leave the house during flu season."

456,So confused and don’t know where to start.,"My dad is 67 and since he retired 3 years ago he has been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. In the past 3 years, he has overmedicated himself with benzodiazepines where we have taken him to the ER twice and had him sleep it off for a few days another two times. He and my mom are staying at our home for the next few weeks and he exhibited signs of anxiety and then decided to take overmedicate on his medication again and was in bed for two days and urinated on himself and then stayed in bed for another two days while getting up as needed. Today he got out of bed and acted like he was completely back to normal. When we asked why he did this, he said he didn’t like the new home he is purchasing and that he also just needed a few days off without all of us bothering him to get out of bed.He didn’t exhibit any signs of anxiety like heavy breathing and distress as before and acted completely normal after spending four days in bed mostly. In the past, we thought of his actions as an attempt to overdose and it may very well have been but it doesn’t seem so cut and dry. He says he is depressed and no drug, therapy, or anything helps him in the least bit. He would act out in pain from his anxiety and then he would overmedicate and then be fine again. I’m wondering if he also has a substance abuse problem. When I was young, I remember my dad drinking heavily and checking out for a few days in his room and then he will be back to normal. He was angry most of my childhood and was ill tempered and violent at times. He would spend a lot of time alone in his room. Now as an older man, he expresses his feelings a lot more. In fact, he talks about his anxiety and depression most of the time I speak with him. When he is not speaking about his pains and struggles, he will refuse to engage at all. He is also very anxious about his physical health that he would go to the doctor at least once of week with a possible illness (brain tumor, Parkinson’s, cancers of all kinds, any kind of sensation he feels in his body). They have all been ruled out. He has switched doctors many times and have been to see so many mental health physicians and sometimes several at once. He has trouble taking medication and he will start and stop on his own because he feels the side effects so intensely. I feel so confused on what is going on.  Before I thought he had severe depression and anxiety and was suicidal but now I’m not so sure. Now I’m wondering is it a substance abuse problem as well? And also, Is there a disorder and treatment for severe binges and sleeping for days And then all of sudden being relieved of all noticeable anxiety and depression? When I saw him today acting completely fine and playing with my kids and talking to my husband, I was so confused. What is going on here? My mom is acting like everything is normal and I know it’s not normal now that I’m an adult with a family of my own. What could he possibly have and where the hell do we even start to help him? Please feel free to ask about anything I’ve missed to mention. I’m a little out of sorts and can’t think things through. I was so freaked out for the last four days while my parents are acting like everything is normal again."
457,Prozac,"I forgot to take my Prozac for a few weeks I’m now having suicidal thoughts. Self destructive urges like when walking across a bridge or driving.
I feel like I’m constantly in a box with no one around or that people aren’t actually real and that I’m not enjoying life in this box so I should just commit suicide to leave this box. Does anyone know if it’s not being on Prozac doing this. I feel like I have nothing and will never gain anything."
458,Just got told I won’t be starting Varsity for my HS team,"I sound already so privileged to be complaining about this but I’ve never started varsity for any sport in my entire life. Lacrosse was the one thing I was anywhere near competitive enough to get the shot. In fact, I was so good I was under the impression I had the spot locked down, until a junior who I know and like (no I’m not treating him differently) is getting the job over me. I just don’t know what to do with my anger, I’ve put holes through my walls and am still so angry. I REALLY don’t know what to do"
459,What is wrong with me?," I am a male who since I was 5 years old, has been extremely submissive around girls. A neighbor girl and her sister who were around 5ish years older than me, maybe older, used me as a slave, and I kind of enjoyed it(?)....And ever since, I have always been subby. I realized all my fictional crushes are villains. (Azula from Avatar: The Last Airbender, Scarlet Witch from Marvel, Harley Quinn and Killer Frost from DC, the list goes on.) So, is there something wrong with me that I am submissive and am attracted to abusive girls?"

461,"""brain zaps"" long after ending medication","I'm curious if anyone else has/is experiencing this: I took sertraline in the fall and winter of 2016 for about 5 months. I quit cold turkey (admittedly a bad decision at the time), because the side effects made me foggy and I would experience incredibly painful brain zaps when it would get close to the time I'd take my meds. It's been 4 years now and I still have these brain zaps on occasion. Sometimes it'll be just once every few weeks and then I'll get spells where I'll get 10+ a day. They're debilitating and my head throbs for a while afterward too. I feel like something is wrong, everything I read on the internet says they disappear after a few months. Does anyone else have experience with this? Should I be talking to a doctor?"
462,why do i just sit then silence,"i have noticed that i have a mind that i can’t control, i’m not going to self diagnose myself but my family has mental illness problems and on my moms side it’s really bad i have a fear that hopefully i’m not like her because she has so many mental illnesses and problems. going back to what i said at the start i am thinkin i probably have bipolar and a overactive brain because my head never stops going or thinking of something (most of the time it’s negative about myself or taking shit too personally) i’ve also been trying to toughen up since i take shit too personally since all my life i have had too since multiple incidents etc have changed my life forever. i don’t know how to help myself with this. if anyone can give me advice on how to help myself with controlling my thoughts n stuff it would help... i’m tired of feeling this way and just being alone to myself with my thoughts."
463,How do you get past the feeling of being used to the pain?,"As is true for a lot of people, this has been a really tough year for me. Strangely enough though, most of my hardship have had nothing to do with COVID.

In early February, my partner of 4 years blindsided me by saying she thought we were too different from each other and she swiftly ended things.  I had no idea and was totally shocked.  I had committed to living in her country and had become extremely close to her family.  I truly thought we'd spend the rest of our lives together and had never been happier. She wasn't willing to do anything to figure things out or even go to therapy.  So, I had to quickly make a new life plan, especially with COVID heating up.  I had no opportunity to say goodbye to the family that I had become a part of.

Within the exact hour of the breakup (which happened at an airport to top it off), I learned that my close uncle had passed away.

Then 4 months ago, my dad suddenly passed away from complications due to a freak injury.  We hadn't talked in 5 years and I was left with a lot of unanswered questions.  This situation has caused a lot of my mental health issues over the past several years.  

I've spent the past ten months riding the waves of depression. Luckily, I've got a pretty solid support group.  

I've been working really hard to get over things and I think I'm really close.  The thing is that I was so much in love with that woman that I think the pain of having lost her has replaced her being a part of my life.  I think I'm addicted to the pain. I kind of enjoy feeling down about missing her, as weird as that sounds.  But I don't want to feel that. I just want to be done with it.  She already took so much from me, I don't want to lose more of myself.

Similarly, the struggle of wondering if I should reach out to my dad for the past several years became a part of my own internal identity as well. But of course, that opportunity is gone and, admittedly, in some ways it's a relief.  


So, I guess my question is: how do I clear the final hurdle of my healing by no longer identifying with the pain these two losses have caused me? How I do totally let go of them and fully start living my life?

Sorry this turned into a mini-rant but I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.  Much love."
464,Things you associate with depression/anxiety/OCD?,"I was assigned an art project in the form of a digital collage and wanted to focus mine around mental health in general, specifically depression/anxiety/OCD. 

What are some things that represent these conditions, in your mind? It could be a mental image, a word, a metaphor, a quote... whatever comes to mind!"
465,Does this count?,"     This is probably a stupid question and with all the other stories on here it seems pretty light, but I have an autistic brother. He is older than me, and a LOT bigger than me, me being 5’3 and him being close to 6 foot. He also pretty much has the brain of a toddler. He’s decently high functioning(he can talk), but not high enough to make his own decisions and to know what he’s doing.
     For my entire life he’s hit me, pushed me, kicked me, pushed/kicked me off or out of areas such as a couch or bed, thrown things at me, used his stuffed animals or whatever he has in his hands to slap me with, etc. I think at one point a few years ago he even had a knife, but I can’t remember too well. My parents have done all that they could to prevent this but it barely does anything. Especially with me being his prime target to go after no matter what mood he’s in. My parents always tell me to forgive him, because it’s not his fault that he does it. I recognize that and I try to keep it in my head whenever he goes to attack me, but sometimes I can’t help but hate him a little bit.
     Because of him i always tense up whenever someone is behind me. I always need to know who I’m in a room with, at all times, and where they are. I can’t sit next to him anymore, and I can barely stay in a room with him. It’s been established that he’s a major contributor to my emotional detachment as he used to laugh whenever I was upset when I was younger and other reasons. And it’s also been established that my anxiety has been heightened because of him. 
     I don’t really know if this actually counts because since he’s autistic he can’t control what he’s doing or know that he’s hurting me. But I can’t really ask my parents about it and it’s been bothering me for a while now. Sorry for the long post!!"
466,Not feeling like im here/present?,"Just had what I think was a panic attack, but it felt like I wasn't in my room, which I am. My mind keeps pushing images of stuff I did hours ago like im still there or things I've never done nor seen,, and im having a hard time focusing on remembering where I am, otherwise I start freaking out again. Not sure if I explained this well enough but Google wasn't exactly helpful"
467,Feeling broken,"I am an adult who has a lot of trauma from my childhood, as well as from adulthood that causes me a lot of stress and anxiety. Growing up I was bullied badly at school for years. It was a nightmare going to school because the girls bullying me were actively in my life as our parents were in the same social circle. I was told to kill myself daily, that no one wanted me at school, had my things written on and ruined, and any new student that came to class were told not to be friends with me. It was a very lonely and horrible time. The teachers didn't do much to help and I was too embarrassed to tell my family for years. When I finally did, I was made to feel I was exaggerating and all kids tease each other was the attitude I was given. I was acting out at home because I felt like I was worthless. Thankfully in grade 8 I made new friends and things got better. But the trauma has stayed with me. 

I also have suffered from very serious health issues for more than half of my life and my family knew about this but never believed the pain it caused me physically and mentally. I developed anxiety and depression and had many procedures to help with my health. My husband has been with me through it all with my health issues and supports me. He sees how my family doesn't seem to care about my health issues and have blown them off like it's no big deal. He thinks it's crap they have done this. 

My family doesn't include me in things (outside of holidays and birthdays) unless it's an afterthought and I've spoken to them about this. I was told because I told them when I was a teenager I didn't want to go on vacation with them, they stopped asking me for years. When I was asked, I was guilt tripped into going when I was feeling anxious or unwell due to my health. I was told I always have excuses as to why I can't do something and even told it's so convenient at how many medical appointments I have. Like I'm making it up. I go to every holiday and birthday celebration. I dont go on holiday trips because of my health but that thankfully is improving. My family thought we were doing things with my in-laws and just not them, but we weren't doing anything. My anxiety has always been downplayed and I don't get it when my family work in mental health fields. When I'm at family gatherings I will be asked things and then talked over or the person will just walk away. My husband is shocked at this. My mum will call and if my husband answers will talk to him and then say she doesn't need to talk with me. She tells him more than me. I'm told I'm no fun and like an old person which hurts. I am fun but just in different ways. 

I have been told by a therapist I was seeing to seek trauma counseling and I've tried to find someone but covid is making it hard. People are fully booked. I am waiting to do online therapy through work in the meantime. I believe I am a people pleaser as a coping mechanism and that when I become friends with someone I am too much because I'm happy someone wants to hang out with me and usually scare them away. I do have a close friend who understands me and likes having me around which makes me happy. My husband is happy I have this friend in my life. 

Because of these things I feel broken. That I'm not good enough and that something must be wrong with me. Why am I so scarred by this past trauma so many years later? How do I get my family to understand that my health issues were serious. I had a procedure that has helped, but it was a drastic measure to take and has left me feeling like part of myself is missing."
468,"I think I have ADD. In fact, it is the only explanation keeping me from giving up on life.","I feel like no matter how hard I try, I end up failing to complete my intended task, which frustrates me, and then I either

go to do something else or go to sleep. Nothing makes me angrier at this point in my life than failing to do something 

which I know I am entirely capable of doing, and so I simply neglect to try at many points in day-to-day life just to 

avoid such frustrations. When I do make an effort at this point, it is strikingly low, so I usually just end up going back to 

sleep or carrying on doing something else. This is the worst feeling I have ever felt, even worse than the self hatred that

I had to put up with in early 2020. Having a lot of time to myself due to the quarantine from COVID-19 helped me realize that

this self-hatred was sown in my head by empty compliments and bad friends, so I ended up breaking out of my shell alone due

to my own contemplation of myself and my actions. I realized that I am an individual who is capable enough to do almost 

anything I want. I realized that I only have to put up with the people that I would like to put up with if I really want to.

This contemplation gave me a new appreciation for myself as an individual. This has brought me to the conclusion that the

only thing that can possibly be holding me back is a mental disorder that I have not been diagnosed with: Attention Deficit

Disorder. Upon doing research on the internet of symptoms of ADD, I have come to the conclusion that I suffer heavily from

it. All I want is to change my brain, because I have deemed it ineffective and I want to be able to achieve the self that

I have always envisioned. I don't know what else I would do if I went to a psychiatrist or a therapist and they told me that

this was not the case. That would most likely be the point in my life where I would give up entirely. I am confident enough

in my intellectual competence at this point in time to say such a thing. Nothing else can explain how little I can focus, how

little I can do anything. All I want is to be able to say, within my head: ""Okay (name), you need to do this for school"",

and then do it. It is all I want. Prescription medication is that last thread of hope that I hold on to that keeps me from

giving up not just on school, but on life entirely."
469,I haven’t cried in the past two years and when I think about all the times I have cried before it’s never been out of sadness. Is this normal?,"I don’t know where else to go with this so I figured I could try my luck here. Just as the title describes I don’t believe I’ve ever experienced genuine sadness. The closest I ever got to feeling sad was when I was frustrated or annoyed, and I’m just now starting to realize that this may not be normal. I also have a hard time grasping other emotions, particularly love and (admittedly) empathy. However, I still feel anger, fear and happiness (or at least what I understand to be happiness- satisfaction and contentness) so it’s not like I don’t experience any emotions.

I will also mention that none of this is really impacting my life in a negative way. I’m very good at pretending to sympathize/empathize when I need to, and sometimes I’m even able to do it if it’s an emotion I’ve felt before (like anger or fear), so it’s not like I need those emotions to function in society or be friends with people. I just want to know if it’s something I may need to look out for in the future, like if it may be an indicator of some sort of illness that could worsen if I’m not careful. 

This could also just be completely normal behavior I’m getting overly paranoid over due to quarantine. Like I said, it’s not like this has drastically impacted my life in a negative way."

Recently came out to a family member and am in the closet to everyone else. Have an obscene amount of pressure being placed on me at work.

471,How do I prepare myself for the death of my grandmother?,"I think my grandma is going to die soon. It's not going to happen in a week, but maybe in a few months. Her kidneys don't work and she's old and has alzheimer so they can't use dialisis. 

I haven't experienced loss. Nobody close have died and I'm scared. I don't know how to handle it, but most importantly I don't know how to prepare myself for that moment. I think people usually tries to spend time with the person who is going to pass away but my grandma, because of the alzheimer, doesn't know who I am or who she is. It's hard to make a connection with her before she's gone. It's not like I could ask her to tell me stories of her childhood or recepies or stuff like that. She can't make me my favorite meal of hers. For me she's kind of already gone. Also, it hurts seeing her like that. 

I don't know what to do. I have no point of reference about what I'm going to feel. I don't know how to mourn death. I don't know what to expect and how to be prepared. I have depression and I worry about how this is going to affect me. I want to be OK also because I know my father is going to have a really hard time. He doesn't process emotions well. I want to be ready and I don't know how."
472,"Struggling as a husband,father, teacher",2020 is easily been hardest year for me.. which for sure isn't out of the ordinary for a lot of people. Since this year my wife came out to me about her sexuality. She is a pansexual and still loves me and wants to be with me. But she struggles with me filling her various sexual needs. It destorys me as a man feeling I can't fill all her needs. We still love each other very much. But I'm afraid this might put an expiration date on us. Also we are parents to two special needs children. I feel this takes a lot of time and energy from us. And we barely have time for each other. Though we make time that we can. My wife has a lot of friends that she loves spending time with as well. And I for sure knows she needs it.. it kinda sucks for me cause I always take the burden
473,"Is this Schizophrenia? Feeling ""imaginary pain"" induced by smoking marijuana (Warning: disturbing info ahead)","If you read this you'll probably feel sorry for this story.

Hello people. I smoke cannabis for about 8 years now. Years ago (about 6 years or so) I experienced a bad trip of feeling of ""imaginary pain"" (I will soon get into the details) while smoking weed, but I never thought I would ever feel this again.

This awful feeling was really rare, and it only happened when I was high on weed, but as I said, it wasn't occasionally, but almost never, it happened about a couple of times in the past. At the time I first experienced this I was passing through a traumatic event in my life and thought this trauma could have some sort of negative influence in my subconscious that triggered this mental event.

This week the same kind of ""imaginary pains"" returned, and I believe this is because I started smoking new strain of Kunk, plus a traumatic event that I will soon explain.

I normally mix hash with kunk, but this time the highs are getting bizarre.

Even though I know it's only happening in my mind and I don't panic about what I'm feeling, I'm still getting worried. At the heights of my marijuana highs, I experience the constant feeling of diverse imaginary pain.

I feel a pain that does not even exist. It's from my imagination, but it's so vivid that it's disturbing. My mind is simulating a physical pain that is not actually physical, but mental.

I think I have a clue of what it helped to trigger this:

I was getting really worried about the possibility of having contracted HIV, and this gave me a fucked up anxiety. These bad trips started happening meanwhile I was having catastrophic fear of the possibility of having HIV.

I did STD tests and they all came out negative. 

Even though this was a relief, the paranoia had already done it's ""damage"" — the bad trips persisted even after I discovered I have no HIV.

I will hope that tomorrow this will disappear. If not, then I am fucked.

I am not having any delusions, not seeing any visual hallucinations nor hearing any voices, I am sane, but I feel highly unpleasant fucked up sensations of imaginary physical pain that does not actually exist.

I don't have problems trusting people, nor any paranoia of being persecuted. So you see, it doesn't seem to be the normal schizophrenia I know of, but it's fucked up nonetheless and it makes me worried. This shit is far away from being normal. I'm getting worried it might be schizophrenia.

For example, when high on weed I feel as if my head was being crushed by a hammer and I feel an imaginary pain. I feel constant sensations of me being killed or physically harmed in horrendous ways and I have no control over it, and I mentally feel the impacts of my imagined wounds. As I said, the impacts are not as real as a physical impact, it's subtle, not too vivid, but vivid enough to disturb me. 

I feel like some sort of ""compilation of imaginary pain"".

I must emphasize again that this is COMPLETELY imaginary, but disturbing. The fact that this is still happening is scary as hell. My mind is simulating hell itself, it seems.

Warning: Bizarre Gore Ahead

Some of the imaginary sensations I feel:

I feel as if my nose or face is being crushed, as if I was losing my teeth, or as if my tongue and lips was being crushed, as if I was being beheaded or cut in half, or being crushed by a meat grinder, as if I was feeling the impact of a giant boulder or if I was being crushed by a bus or suffering the impact of a large fall. I also feel as if a blade is going through my head or receiving a head shot, something like a fish hook pulling out my eyes, multiple spikes passing through by whole body, sharp helices destroying by brain, fingers being chopped, and so on.

It's like as if my brain is searching for the most horrendous and fucked up things of all time to simulate as a mental/physical pain.

I am thinking about stopping using marijuana because of this. It's a really fucked up feeling and today I woke up remembering the thoughts I had yesterday while on the marijuana high. This feeling persisted throughout the day, before and after smoking weed.

I think this already happened about 5 days this week. The first times I had this only when I was high, but today I felt it even before smoking, and it happened all day long. It's not absolutely constant, but when I remember about it, it becomes a constant thought until I focus on something else.

Even though the feeling when I'm sober is not as intense compared to when I'm high, I'm still remembering and ""simulating"" this imaginary pain whenever I remember the event.

This made me very worried, thinking I might be developing some kind of schizophrenia or psychosis.

The first time I felt something similar was about 6 years ago, when I had a bad trip that I would feel a hammer crushing my head. At that time I even found a similar story on a forum, that I even found funny the first time I read it, but today I can identify my experience with that story, and I'm going to share it with you here also, so you guys can see I'm not the only one experiencing this kind of bizarre/fucked sensations. I'm also going to share the response someone gave to that person, so you guys can analyze and see if it makes sense.

What do you think of this utterly bizarre bullshit? Have I lost my mind? Or is this shit a temporary traumatic event?"
474,Best way to track my medicine AND mood?,"Was wanting to know if anyone had suggestions on the best way (or even any way because I simply cannot think of a great one), to track the medicine I'm taking (for ADHD), the dosages and times etc, and (almost most importantly) the effect it has. 

The reason is because I have days where the effects are mostly desirable, and then I'll have days where symptomatically things go a bit (a bit is quite an understatement) awry. 

I'm struggling to simplify a way to track this, because of how many factors change on the daily, for example did I eat before? How much time elapsed between doses? What time of day did I take it? How did I feel? 

I guess to further clarify, I understand I could write it down, but would it be easy to start noticing patterns with so many changing factors? Just curious to see if anyone has a method that works for them, or, perhaps (and likely), I'm just overthinking the entire thing. 

P.S. I understand the best idea will be to consult my doctor, but I know it's highly likely that they'll ask the very questions I'm asking myself about the variables."
475,"I did it, I finally fucking did it.","I hit a breaking point, I will spare the details but in short, I was fucking broken.

Many of you have already seen my list of morbid posts.

Upon research and through many of you who offered me insight, I admitted myself to the hospital for psychiatric evaluation.

I have never felt this happy in a long fucking time.

First and foremost, a bit fuck you to my family doctor who diagnosed me with ADHD... which I do not have.

For years I was taking various medications for it and I knew deep down that this wasn’t working as the side effects were beyond unbearable.

I poured my heart out to nurses, psychiatrists, social workers and even my fellow patients... and the experience was beautiful.

I was given the confidence I needed, I was given the hope I needed, I was given the will to live.

I cannot begin to tell you guys, how amazing I feel.

I am so glad I had the courage to seek help, make myself vulnerable and fight off all the stereotypes regarding mental health.

I called up my manager and told him to suck a dick.. no I’m just kidding but I have the balls to do it now.

I amended my relationship with my parents and my siblings.

25 years of anxiety and depression haunted my every waking moment, and this morning after being discharged.. I felt good.

I felt like myself again, a feeling I haven’t experienced in a VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME.

For those of you who reached out to me, I pray all of you are bestowed with happiness and success.

And to the rest of the world, I pray all of you find the light.

My life is going to take a complete u-turn, and it’s only going to get better. 

I will no longer shy away from opening up about my emotions, I won’t be discouraged for being an emotional man, and I will tackle my fears head on.

Thank you, thank you for giving me the courage to seek help. 

Therapy has saved my life and my family.

I have no way to pay any of you back, but please do know, whenever I take the time to speak to God, you will all be in my prayers. 

Thanks."
476,Im going through so much and at this point im so numb i dont care about anything i cant feel happy and i honestly cant feel sad either. I want someone to save me but nobody gets my message. I just need help pretty bad,I honestly just need someone to talk to
477,I am losing the battle,😔
478,Are the medications for depression and anxiety different?,"Do anti depressants treat anxiety? I'm in the UK and am looking for a mediation . I've taken prozac and citalopram before. Do antidepressents work on anxiety? Or are separate medications used to combat depression and anxiety? For anyone from the uk, how does getting prescribed an antidepressent work? I don't know why i was prescribed a different antidperessent different times"
479,Panic Attacks?,"I’ve been experiencing random bouts of chest pain and palpitations and shortness of breath and just feeling really off like fatigue and dizziness for weeks straight every day multiple times a day.

I had my phone appointment w my family doctor and she said it is not likely to be a heart condition due to my medical history and age but she is still taking me in to an appointment to check my heart and lungs regardless.

Last night, I only slept 2 hours and now it is time for me to go to bed and I am having trouble because of the symptoms I am having.

Say if all my medical tests come off clean, does this sound like a panic attacks and if so why are they happening so often??

I previously thought of panic attacks as always very severe and hyperventilating on the floor because the only time I have had full on panic attacks before was because of huge huge stress in my life. This is not the case now, I don’t feel like I am full on freaking out and losing my shit.

How do I make this stop??? I am so tired to the point I don’t even feel tired anymore. I just want to sleep and have some peace."
480,feeling very alone and worthless,"hello. 

so it's all really complicated, but basically i am incredibly lonely, and feel very alone. I have friends, but they never seem to have time for me, and looking back it feels like they were only ever using me or just wanted to be my friend because it was convenient, and we always did things on their terms,, not mine. All my life, I have been used and used and ... People act like they like me. They heap on praise, they tell me im sweet and cute and beautiful, talented, a cinnamon roll, a unicorn, you would think I was a saint from all that people tell  me, and yet, when it comes right down to it, no one actually seeks me out. I feel like people just like me from a distance, or for their own convenience, but I don't actually matter. No one seeks me out, I don't get invited to anything, i get left out of everything, and yet, people like to act like they absolutely adore me yet they don't care about getting close. Also i'm 23, and I've never been on a single date or in a relationship, but people loooove to act predatorily toward me. I can't attract a single decent man, but creeps flock to me. On top of this, I had an ongoing trauma when I was very young and no one knows this, no one knows the details, I still see my offender regularly and I live with my parents and I still feel the need to protect them from knowing the truth. But honestly I even feel used by them, and like they turned a blind eye and only saw what they wanted to when I was a kid. I don't feel like I truly matter to anyone unless they can get something out of me. I feel like there must be something inherently wrong with me, some reason that no one wants me, but yet acts like they do. I wish I knew why. I wish I had ever felt like I belonged or like I was home. I have always felt like I didnt belong and like im on the outside looking in. I've just always had to deal with my pain alone, but I started opening up to my friends recently and I worry that that is the real reason they don't reallly talk to me anymore. I just feel like i can't take it anymore, and i am worth nothing and no one really wants me here, unless i can do something for them. i dont trust anyone, i am disappointed with everyone, everyone, i wish i had just one person i could trust who i really feel is there for me but i dont. And i feel even worse when i start to think that maybe we're all alone. I am a little bit extra alone, but maybe were all like this, maybe no one is really there for anyone else, maybe people just go through life using people and leaving them behind. I dont know. My heart hurts, and after years of fakig a happy face and overextending myself to make others happy, considering it my mission to spread happiness in the world while i am just passed over, it hurts. it husrts so much and i am so worthless and i dont really know what im holding out for at this point."
481,Really shitty time,"I’m just so mentally drained all the time. As far as I can remember I’ve been this way, even since I was 10. I just have lost any will to live. My relationship with my parents and siblings isn’t that great. I’m just a roommate leeching off of them. My grades are shit. I have no plans for my future. I have so many unfulfilled desires and wishes that I made so long ago, yet never completed them because I lost interest. And honestly, I couldn’t care any less about anything anymore. I’m just gonna end up somewhere working my ass off to pay the rent and afford food when I know my ceiling could be so much higher. It’s just that I’ve gone as far as my motivation will take me. 

Does anyone else just feel like they want to die, but don’t want to commit suicide? Like I wouldn’t mind if I randomly got hit by a car or got a brain aneurism, but I definitely don’t want to cause anyone around me any unnecessary suffering. Besides, it’d also be a disservice to myself. 

I just feel so lost. What will I ever make out of this life if I have no interest in doing anything. I just wish everything would end."
482,I can’t bring myself to do anything,"I try getting myself to do something, but my brain says I can’t. No matter what I do, it keeps prevent me from doing it until I’ve become angry and sad. I’m hypothesizing that I should just stop thinking, but I am unsure on how to do that. Does anyone have any input as for what I need to do?"
483,I Have to SLEEP but I CAN'T,"I can't sleep. I mean, I can. I have sleeping meds. But they don't make me that sleepy anymore. Truth is, I really don't WANT to sleep. 

It's kinda like having an assignment due. I don't want to do it but I know it's due and if I don't do it there are negative consequences. But I don't want to, so I can't. I don't know if that makes sense, but I know I have work early tomorrow and I know if I don't sleep NOW then I won't wake up in time. It's not like I can call out; I just started this job and am only on training. I can't force myself to go to sleep. I have no other sleeping aids except for antihistamines, but those don't really work for me either. I need to go to sleep. I need to. I absolutely HAVE to go to bed. Like, I need to be asleep in the next 20 minutes. 

This is stressing me out so bad but I can't talk to anyone about it because I feel like an asshole. Even when people want to listen all I can do if just be terse and cranky because I can't explain how absolutely gut-wrenchingly stressed I am about not being able to sleep. People want to help but I don't know how anyone could help me. I feel so shitty. But I can't feel shitty because that means I have to give up a shit ton of stuff to attempt to not feel shitty when I'm just gonna feel shitty again. Fuck

How do I go to sleep when I'm this stressed? How do I make myself want to sleep?? What do I do?"
484,Is daydreaming a bad sign?,I've been like always daydreaming. I suddenly remember I was like that during elementary. But up until now I always keep daydreaming. Is this a sign of something?
485,don’t know if I’ll be able to graduate,"I (17M) am failing all of my classes because of how bad my mental health is, I’ve reached out for help, but due to my dad dropping me from his insurance without telling me it’s taken months for me to actually get it. I just saw a doctor yesterday and can’t see a psychiatrist for about 2 weeks. While this was happening I just wasn’t attending school bc I couldn’t function (and still can’t) and am super behind. With only about 2 more weeks in the semester I’m not sure I’ll be able to graduate on time, does anyone know what options I’ll have if I end up not being able to??"
486,"how to get admitted to a psych ward (ive tried twice and they turned me away) (14F, Perth)","trigger warning, mention of su\*cidal ideation:

So, like two months ago, I was seriously suicidal and was planning to commit, for some reason I called the ambulance and asked them to pick me up and admit me to the local children's public hospital. I waited maybe one hour, my parents came, and the mental health team consulted me. After consultation, they decided to not admit, claiming that I was ""not suicidal enough"". So they sent me home with a plan and an emergency helpline business card. The next week, my therapist sent me back to the emergency department of the same hospital, this time i waited longer in room with my dad, and they did another psych evaluation, My therapist recommended that they admit me to their psych ward, but what the hospital psych evaluation team said was that once again, I was not suicidal enough, plus there was not enough beds, and the public mental health ward might be too intense (i know this already, and still told my therapist that i wanted to go to the psych ward). The hospital's advice was  that doing some activities like cooking and listening to music should help me keep the thoughts at bay.  

So, what the hell do I have to do to actually be admitted? I'm literally down to do anything, my mental state is getting horrible now, and i honestly think i'm a danger to myself. Hell, i'll even go to a private psych ward, and beg on my knees if I have to. Any advice?"
487,Is there a chance I could have Borderline Personality Disorder,"My mood usually tends to switch quickly and I push anyone who I’m afraid of getting attached to because I don’t wanna be hurt, I don’t like being lonely, but even around my loved ones that’s all I feel, I’m afraid of getting attached, and to those who I am attached to, my mood can switch depending on the situation, either sad, happy, or I can hold a grudge but then go back to being happy again, I’m not sure if this is BPD or something else, I checked for bipolar but I don’t believe that’s it"
488,I have beliefs that i will become possessed or haunted or even cursed and its really affecting my daily life and well being. What can i do?,"I don't hear voices or see things or anything like that. 

And i am not detached or lose my sense of reality. 

But i have such strong anxiety and fear that i am gonna fucking become possessed by a demon or be killed by a cursed objects (like Robert the doll) that they talk about in YouTube if i disrespect it in my head or outloud by saying things like it looks gay or weird or ugly. 

I don't know why i feel this way but i have seen YouTube videos and movie about these topics when i was much younger and it really scared me as a child. Now, its probably trauma or something but either way i can't get these fucking worries out of my goddamn head. 

Worst part is that i have the urge to research it because i want to see if its truly real or fake in hopes of it being fake. 

So far a lot of sources and people have said its not possible and that its a belief that has no proof or evidence and the stories of these topics are actually fake or dramatized. 

Despite all of this and me logically knowing its not real i still have a strong belief that such things exist and will happen to me. 

And worst of all, i have a small urge to perform statism and demonic rituals just to see if its fake for myself. 

This fucking brings me a tremendous amount of fear worry and it causes me to have panic attacks and think ill fucking go crazy and lose my mind and sense of reality. 

PLEASE someone help me. 

My mood, grades, well being,  health, relationships, hobbies, etc have taken a drastic toll and i don't know what the fuck to do. I already told my therapist and talked about it with him but it still hasn't helped. 

What can i do?!?!?!?!?!?!"
489,Starting new therapy next week.,"Hello everyone, been a bit since I last posted. Anyways, next week I begin a new trauma therapy for complex PTSD and honestly I'm scared. I know that if everything works out well, that it's a good thing to do, cause I can deal with whatever is going on, but I'm scared of what it might be because, well, my life has been total shit.   


Honestly I'm scared that if my brain repressed something, that it did that for a reason (mostly survival naturally) and what if, well, digging it up isn't the 'right' thing to do. I don't know, I'm just worried that whatever happens I won't be able to deal with it.  


Hope everyone is safe this holiday season. I know it's a struggle around this time of  year for many people, just know that you are loved and are worth it."
490,I feel so bad asking for help even though it is reasonable to do so,"I used to live abroad, sharing a house with 5 other people, one of which took advantage of me while i was drunk and sexually assaulted me. 

I moved out and flew home around 2 months ago, and since it was an emergency flight, I didn't get the chance to pack and prepare everything... So I had to leave 1 suitcase at THAT house. 

I lived there for months after the sexual assault happened and I even ignored it/ let it continue, however I also had some conflict with someone else in the place and now that I have some time to actually reflect (sober), the events are traumatizing and I do not want to see any of my ex housemates again. 

The suitcase is quite important to me, I want to ask one of my friends to come and pick it up while I'm not there... but I feel so bad. It's like to them, I have no reason to not leave the suitcase at his house but in actuality, I really don't want to get anywhere near that place or having my stuff in that place ever again..."
491,I feel like I am going into psychosis,"
To start I have OCD that manifests in counting, blinking, obsessive thoughts, and when my anxiety is high, intrusive thoughts. Everyone is my family also deals with mental health issues including depression and obsessive disorders. I have recently been obsessing over the idea I am developing psychosis.. About a month ago and I helped a friend from work move because his wife had schizophrenia and was seeking help. I began to research into the symptoms of schizophrenia, specifically the prodromal symptoms and found myself to a lot of them such as, depression, anxiety, substance use, being unmotivated, and sleeping more than usual. All of these symptoms I began to experience after I took shrooms in August (I have dealt with all in the past but was currently when I began to look into the symptoms) and had the most profound trip of my life, it was absolutely terrifying and yet I feel like I was almost reborn from that date..After the trip I began to drink rather heavily because I felt like it allowed me to think clearly without constantly being anxious. I basically had a panic attack after reading the symptoms and since have been completely obsessed with my current state and if I’m going crazy. I have experienced hearing my name called when no one was there, and seeing things out of the corner of my eyes. Both of these pretty much only happen when I’m extremely anxious and thinking about having them. I am going to talk to someone this week, but does anyone have any experience similar to this. Especially someone with OCD, I have read that OCD can often times make you obsess over getting sick and can even cause symptoms. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any help would be great."
492,I’m starting to behave weirdly and I don’t know exactly why,"A question about my behavior

I have a question regarding something which has been happening, has happened and what I should do about it.

A bit of backstory: I live in the Netherlands with my sister, mother and stepfather. I am a 15 year old boy. (btw I must mention that I haven't been diagnosed with anything except for ADHD)

During the summer holidays I usually spend time with my father in Spain (I live in the Netherlands), but because of corona we had nothing in Spain so I sat home all day. Around the 30th of July I suddenly became depressed (I think I know what caused it) and about a month ago it spiraled into me being suicidal and wanting to go through with it that evening. I have a girlfriend (of 14) for 8 months who was kind enough to stay with me and support me no matter how shit I felt. My parents knew about my depression since I told them about my self harm, and its hard to fail to see your child crying for hours everyday. Although I think their reaction could've been better, I am happy they didn't go with the ""ChiLdrEn Can'T be DePressed"". As I said, I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I can assure you I most definitely was. Disassociation, anxiety, just a general persistent ""bleh"" feeling, Self harm, Overdosing on ADHD meds, panic attacks etc... My depression suddenly disappeared a few weeks ago and I stopped self harming 13 days ago (Yay...). My mother did find some form of help (I don't know exactly what, and it is not Jens)



I go to a special school because I felt really unhappy at my previous school because I was very unmotivated and way ahead of everyone. I hope to get my secondary diploma this year (VWO) and start university next year at the age of 16. Obviously goes without saying, but having to complete 3 schools years in 1 year in a class of 1 (I am the only person in my class) on top of corona can be stressful (I personally don't feel stressed, but it could be a factor)



I have developed tics, almost as soon as my depression faded away. In my case it is: Falling for no reason (I lose my balance), Slamming the desk really hard and jerking movements. I find it rather annoying, but I'm going to get tested in a hospital with an MRI scanner to rule out any physical thing like brain cancer, which I seriously doubt I have. 



There is another thing which concerns me about my recent behavior: I start acting very erratic sometimes. It has happened enough times for it not to be a coincidence. My eyes are as widen as far as they can I speak in broken sentences: ""y---y-ye-ssss... aaaaaaalll is--s fi--nnn--e......"" for example. I laugh for no reason (in a creepy way, not normal laughter). I say weird philosophical things that have something to do with life and death, erratic movements (neck twists in weird ways, eyes twitch, I start smiling in a creepy way, I start limping). A few friends at my school commented on my behavior (One asked if I was ok, while giving me a concerned face. The other commented he wouldn't want to meet me in an alleyway alone). This is the first time they have seen me like this. 

My girlfriend gets very concerned and worried about not only me, but herself too. She is scared I will go back into the whole depression thing but that I'll end up hitting her or some other form of abuse (We lost our virginities to each other (We don't regret it, she chose the moment), so she might think I'll sexually abuse her.



My question is what the last thing could be, and what to do as I fear my mother won't believe me (She commented that she doesn't know what is real and what I make up, go figure :) )."
493,Video games stigma (rant),"Why is it that when I play video games as a distraction from my pain and frustration of not being able to do anything I get judged and why do I judge myself for doing this although if I don’t do anything, since that’s the only thing I can do at the moment, i will  feel worse for not being productive? 
In a way ,other than feeling bad about playing video games and not being able to do anything else, it helps because in certain games even if you play mindlessly you can feel like you are doing something although it’s only in the world of the game but I still always feel bad.
To be honest I am quite productive when I am actually able to be but it’s very difficult or almost impossible at times. 
I guess I’m just wondering why the people around me don’t seem to understand that the reason I play video games at times where everything else seems hard is so I can distract myself from my pain and my brain. So I don’t have to completely go through hours and hours of non stop flashbacks of my trauma, so I can feel like I’m enough. If I am incapable to do everything else and can only sit around mindlessly I might as well play a game or two instead of me sitting around doing nothing and having to face the pain head on when I’m just exhausted mentally and physically, so I don’t breakdown. Instead of me trying to do something although I already know how it will go down and feel shitty that I can’t do that thing, have me not being able to do that effect me for the rest of the day. 
So ya sorry for the rant."
494,"People living alone, do you feel lonely?","I (16 y/o female) feel pretty lonely and depressed atm, it's not my constraint state, it's just that season changed, it's getting dark really early and I feel those bad emotions whenever it's getting dark outside.

What makes me depressed, or anxious, I am not sure, is that I can imagine very vividly how I come home, it's dark, silent and the mood is very depressing. Can't get rid of this thought. Most of the time when I feel bad about my current life, I imagine how it's going to be when I grow up, but in this case I can't think of any other scenario. 

Also, I think I lost joy of some things like I still get excited for food, but it's not that good, it always disappoints me. And I was so excited, I made myself an Advent calendar with some really cool stuff I am excited about, but now, when it came, I don't feel anything, it's just ""ok, whatever"". I feel like I don't deserve it, because I spoil myself too much. Maybe I had too much expectations remembering when I was little and Advent calendar was the best thing, it made my day everyday. And I am not feeling Christmas at all. 

And I feel pretty lonely: I don't really have many close friends I could hang out with and I feel lonely at home with my family. Also I just finished TV series and it feels like I lost a bunch of good friends or like after a breakup - I try to find new TV show to watch, but everything seems so different, not good enough. I know it's silly and it will pass, but it adds up to my loneliness.

So my question is: do you feel lonely when you are by yourself home alone when it's dark outside? What helps you to feel less lonely?"
495,Not doing well...again,"I’m still struggling with a lot of personal hurt and events that have been very very destabilizing.

I think that I’m a worthless person and I don’t have a fulfilling life. I don’t think I have enough value to offer anyone. I don’t know what to do, I keep trying new things and trying to have some sort of hope or openness, but I’m alone and I don’t contribute much to the world. I don’t have kids. I don’t have siblings. I’m just living an existence... I don’t know what I think will make me feel more fulfilled and happier. The things I might want to do aren’t really attainable in my circumstances. 

I feel like what’s the point to keep going on like this. I’m tired of pain."
496,Overwhelming nostalgia,"Lately I've been getting an unbearable and overwhelming sense of nostalgia about certain points in my life. I'll hear a song from back then and it'll hit me like a slap in the face. 

Anything will trigger it. A song (which is the most likely culprit), TV show, movie, video game I would play when I was younger. They'll take me back to a point in time and I'll remember all the good times I had, the friends I shared those with and the atmosphere I was in. 

I never have any specific memories, just the feelings. And the people. Of course, most of those people have taken their own separate path now and we don't talk anymore. Which is good since they turned out to not so nice, but we all still shared good memories back when they were genuine people. 

I was looking through old pictures today. Not because I was feeling these things, I was just looking for a picture for my mom, but I saw a lot of pictures from back then and it didn't really help. 

I don't want to go back, I know nostalgia is a liar and things weren't as perfect as I'm thinking they are but I still can't help but feel just an overwhelming and unbearable sense of nostalgia when I remember the atmosphere and the feelings I had back then."
497,I hate hating myself,"I'm (22M) working on building a business and today had an unfortunate misunderstanding with a potential client over email. The end result was them making a passive-aggressive comment, and me lying on the bed, weak in the knees, crying, and thinking about what a joke life is sometimes.

I've hated myself for forever. I remember writing ""I hate myself"" repeatedly in my journal way back in grade one. I don't know what caused it, but I have my suspicions. I'm a big believer in epigenetics, so I wouldn't be surprised if it has something to do with all the childhood trauma both my mother and father endured in regard to feeling unwanted. Or maybe it's that I was almost put up for adoption. Or maybe it has something to do with me having undiagnosed dyscalculia, and ending up in tears whenever I did math homework with my Dad because he couldn't understand why I couldn't grasp the concepts and would get frustrated, leading me to feel like an idiot.

Whenever I have failed at something, I've always seen it as further proof of my incompetence. I had my brown belt in karate when I hurt my back at age 15 and dropped out because of it. I've written a 150,000-word science fiction novel, but haven't finished editing it and it sits on my hard drive collecting dust. I pursued becoming an artist for three years starting when I was thirteen, working myself to the bone only for it to end with me realizing I didn't have the talent for it, snapping, and now being unable to pick up a pencil without feeling gross.

I'm a terrible multi-tasker, I'm a terrible salesperson, I'm terrible with numbers, and every time I try any form of physical labor I end up injuring myself. Case in point, I went to paint a house with my brother's painting company back in September. My shoulder still hasn't recovered from those two days of work. 

The only things I'm good at are creative pursuits, but those inevitably entail copious amounts of rejection, which I can't handle without falling into a slump. I'm pursuing voiceover right now, but all the rejection makes my performances worse, which leads to more rejection. I've got plenty of amazing feedback from very qualified people, but I always fall back into the slump. At present, my emotions go up and down like a bloody roller coaster.

It doesn't help that I have very little money right now and am renting out space in my parent's house, which makes me feel an uncommunicable amount of shame. They couldn't care less and are the most loving, supportive parents in the world; I couldn't possibly ask for more, but it doesn't change how I feel for some reason. I'm also ashamed that I'm engaged to the most amazing person I know, and yet I can't really pay for anything for her as all of my money is going to rent. There are times where I feel like a complete and total waste.

I think about how hilariously stupid the world is and the possibility of suicide maybe once a week, but not in a serious capacity at all. Just a ""Wouldn't that be easy"" kind of thing. Ruminating on the possibilities. Simple as cranking the car wheel to the right and hitting a tree, or overdosing on some pills, or letting the garage fill up with carbon dioxide and falling asleep. It's fleeting, though sometimes it manifests itself in me becoming really violent with my movements; slamming things, driving faster than I would like to, squeezing the crap out of the steering wheel, or mashing the keys on my keyboard while I type. When it's really bad, I go somewhere where nobody will hear me and just scream into the void, or hit myself in the head a few times for ""being such an idiot"" (dumb, I know). I don't seriously think I'd actually take my own life, but I am a little concerned that if things were to get bad enough, it might become more of a possibility to me. I really don't want to inflict that kind of pain on the people I love. Just the thought makes me tear up. 

I hate how stupid it all sounds, too. I know it's ridiculous to compare my situation to someone else's, but some people have been through a trillion times worse than I, and yet I've been battling these feelings of self-loathing for at least 18 years now. I'm tired of it, and I want it to stop. I just want to accept myself and love myself the way I am. Other people love me for who I am, so why can't I?

I'd love to go to therapy, but I can't afford it at the moment, so I'm left to write out this post in the hopes that it'll clear my head. 

If you read this, thank you. It's nice to know that my problems are worth your valuable time (and no, that's not sarcasm. I genuinely mean it; your time is valuable. It's fecking annoying how little emotion is translated through text. That's what caused the crying on the bed earlier).

Anyway, that's all from me. I wish you all a Happy Holidays in spite of the COVID crap. 

Lotsa love."
498,I am struggling and don’t know what to do,"I am married and in my early 30s with 2 young children (both toddlers). I work a 9-5, cook, clean, do all the laundry and grocery shopping, taking care of the kids, making sure bills are paid and everyone has whatever they need. I just feel so sad and lonely all the time, I feel as though nobody loves me and that I’m not worthy of love. I don’t want to tell anyone about my feelings or thoughts because I don’t know how they’ll react...I don’t know if I should feel like this, or why I feel like this. I have so much to be grateful for; I just want to be happy and I try to be as happy as I can be around others. Everyone comes to me with their problems or excitement and say that I am a lovely person, great to talk to, give good advice, always happy... but I know that I am not that on the inside."
499,I feel like im failing her,"So my girlfriend has been living with me in the past like month ( like switching between my mom's and dad's with me, and doing school stuff together) and before that we would always talk and call and I would be able to remind her how much I love her and why I love her, but now that we've been with each other in person so much longer than we ever have I don't know how to do that. And the thing is that she's been thinking about starving herself because she doesn't like her body and I just feel like I'm failing her. I know I can't do much really.. She has been depressed for multiple years now and I know things can be hard for her but I feel like I'm falling into that route too. ahaha anyways have a good day ig"
500,Is there any kind of Mental Health Evaluation that can test for ANY/ALL types of illnesses,"i’m having issues and have been since I was very young but I can’t explain what is going on and the problems I have can be numerous mental illnesses/issues
thanks in advance"
501,Any help will do please ♡,"\*\*\* Content Warning \*\*\* 

I sent this to local counsellors, but maybe I can find sense of community on here or find an online counsellor?

(This doesn't even touch what my file is about which is hardest to openly talk about most of all)  
 \-----  
 Hi, 

My name is X. I am in X, looking for a new CVAP (Crime Victim Assistance Program) counsellor. I prefer a minimum one hour session once a week or so. I have 30(?) sessions left, but was told I may reapply. 

In short, my file number is X.  
 \-----  
 If you need/would like details, me and my past: 

\- I am 32, have been diagnosed with complex-PTSD, depression, anxiety, psychosis, personality disorder (heightened with substance use), sleep problems, sexual dysfunction, etc.  
 \- half Native, half Vietnamese  
 \- grandma is a Residential School Survivor  
 \- dad is a Vietnam War Refugee  
 \- 5 car accidents  
 \- too many sexual harassment/bully bosses in the work place  
 \- grew up with a child molester on each side of my family (grandpa and X) until I moved out at 18, etc.  
 \- I was drugged raped by hotel workers in Vietnam with zero justice, dealing with corrupt police and doctors, and people I needed most abandoned me  
 \- I have seen countless counsellors, doctors, psychiatrists, women's help centers, (CBT once), DBT (second round now), etc. (in Vietnam, X, X, X, now in X. ) 

2020, aside from what everyone is going through: 

\- June, I left my abusive ex-husband (would've been 14 years in August)  
 \- September, I found out my dear friend commited suicide, a week after I saw her in July  
 \- Mid-October, I moved out of my triggering toxic parents' household  
 \- Mid-November, I moved out of a trailer which turns out wasn't winterized  
 \- For 2 weeks, I have been stuck living with 3 men, 1 who is jealous, controlling, possessive, etc.   
 \- December, I am trying to find a place with a good old friend, his kid, my cat, and I.  
 \- So, I am in my 4th place, now looking for my 5th place 

Now and looking forward: 

\- I am working on going back to school part-time online in January then full-time in person in September.  
 \- I am working on Income Assistance (been getting pushed back and forth for calls/technical difficulties but hopefully this all gets fixed tomorrow finally)  
 \- PWD (Person With Disabilities) next  
 \- student funding correspondence/no luck yet  
 \- My current counsellor focuses on the fluffy things going on instead of why I applied for CVAP in the first place. 

If it sounds like you/somebody on your team with availability (open to all forms of contact, preferably in person (if COVID permits)) could be a good fit, please let me know. 

Thanks so much for listening and any help. 

Take care,

502,Dealing with a toxic parent,"My father is (not just from my perspective) but from the whole family, a narcissist and sociopath. He manipulates others and gas lights when necessary. He has become more apart of my life since corona started(distanced myself from him for most of my adult life) and it makes me feel like shit. Getting him out again isn’t really an option for right now.I normally feel confident in myself but anytime he’s been in my life I hate myself so much. I have bipolar disorder, ocd, and several anxiety disorders so I’m sure that contributes to a lot of the emotional problems but my father makes me feel worse. He is somewhat of a bully even without realizing it. It has gotten to the point that I’ve spent the past year just really wanting to punch him in the face(I’ve tried my best to maintain self control). For context I don’t live near him but for specific reasons he’s more in my life now. Due to future circumstances that will change in the next year but when he’s in my life I feel like his prisoner."
503,Lockdown and the fear of dying,"With the lockdown in my country (in March) we had to work from home, so I came back to the city where I am from and live with my mother again, because she needed the economic help, many people lost their jobs with this virus, almost 10 months have passed and I'm still working from home, which isn't that good, because I can't focus, I procrastinate a lot. 

In May I had a high blood pressure crisis(never in my life I've suffered from high pressure) then it happened again, and I realized that I don't have much friends, actually none that I can talk about feelings, I started to exercise but I found out I had an inguinal hernia and I stopped the exercise, I've spent a lot of money going to the doctor and I'm tired, because the savings I have I need them for my mom(she had a thyroid surgery and she needs a medical procedure which is made in another country) and I'm worried about her, I'm worried about everything, a lot.

I have a temporary job so I don't know what will happen after April, and that scares me a lot, because if I'm so worried now that I have a job, I don't know how I will survive if I don't find a job after I finished the one that I have.

Also, it hurts knowing that my mom is in pain, that she can't sleep well, that she has to take those pills for the rest of her life, people tend to say that money doesn't bring you happiness but, in some cases I wish I had enough to give her the best medicaments and treatment, so her life quality would be better and so will mine.

Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get it out."
504,My friend clearly has schizophrenia but his mom won’t take him to a psychiatrist,"My friend has literally every symptom for schizophrenia and it’s bad to the point where the voices are violent and conflict with his daily life. He has trouble sleeping because of them and he hallucinates. 

His mom is a severe bipolar who refuses to take him to a psychiatrist for some reason. 

He needs treatment because he’s still very young, he’s a teenager and the voices are telling him to hurt himself. When schizophrenia goes untreated it gets worse and I’d love nothing more then to get him that treatment but his mom won’t let him see a specialist to get diagnosed and get prescriptions 

Please help :/"
505,I need someone to talk to....,"My ex girlfriend cheated on me for the 2nd time... December is my birth month and I'm really really sad about what happened, I'm angry, disappointed at her.."
506,"I am desperate, wha should I do?","I am a 24 year old male. For several years now, I've been suffering death-related anxiety. I am terribly afraid of dying, mainly of the thought that I am going to stop existing some day and there is nothing I can do about it. Over the years, I've been to therapy with some psychologists and one psychiatrist, who gave me drugs for almost a year. But nothing has worked. Until some weeks ago, I was in a good state, but lately I am almost every night in the edge of a panic attack. I have not been able to sleep well, and I think fear is going to take over my days (night time is usually when I feel the worst). I need any help please."
507,I am struggling with intrusive thoughts and I feel like I hit rock bottom.,"For 3 months, I (student) worked 2 part time jobs for $2/hour (Malaysia), managing to collect $800, only to get diagnosed with Dengue and having to spend a few days in intensive care, which costed almost $900.

I also suffer from Pure O OCD and the money I tried to save were meant for CBT treatments. 

Now, I don't have money and I can't work because the country is on lockdown.

I created a go fund me campaign, but I can't link it anywhere here in Reddit due to subreddits' policies. 

I don't know what to do anymore."
508,I have a really bad grudge that I have to talk about,"I have a really bad anger problem I've been suffering from for the past year and a half. It's from having been disrespected and almost bullied by a former roommate I thought was my friend.

I had moved to a major city for a very stressful job, and for the majority of that time we were roommates, he acted fine, a little condescending now and then, but I considered him my only friend and I looked forward to hanging out with him and playing vidya over the weekends.

The time came when the stress of the job and living in this major city far from home really started to bear down on me, so over the span of a month, instead of being supportive, this guy seemed more and more condescending and thankless for me giving him rides from his work when I drive home from my work. He often got in my personal space, ignored me when I tried speaking to him, even called me an idiot and stupid on separate occasions.

It was the worst on the very last day I lived at that place, quit the job and announced to my roommates including him that I was leaving back for home. He kind of horsed around with me like a fighting game character, called me stupid when we played our last round of league of legends before I packed my stuff and left and even placed his hand on my shoulder and just looked at me with this smirk on his face.

So even though I'm a lot less stressed out now living in my hometown, I actually get anger attacks remembering how he had treated me over the course of the 'friendship'. There will be anywhere between 3 to 5 times any given day where his smirking face or his hand gripping my shoulder just pop into my memory and I fly into an internal rage, fantasizing about driving back to that city and confronting him with a gun or a baseball bat. I just feel so lacking in dignity for having let him treat me like that. I have enough restraint to know he doesn't deserve to be shot or beaten near to death for having acted like a bully, and try to remind myself that he's human just like I am and all he wanted was a cheap ego boost by acting that way towards me.

Still, the raw feelings of anger have made me so foggy headed and depressed. It's just left me with such a bad taste in my mouth that I can't even imagine getting close to other people.

One last thing that just adds to my anger about this guy was that he was dating for a while this pretty college student that looked a lot like an ex of mine that broke up with me in a shitty, inconsiderate way over social media shortly after I moved to the city. So yes I am a bit jealous of this guy, but most of my anger stems from how he had acted towards me when I was stressed out of my mind and in a very vulnerable situation.

I just had to type this all out, and I'm already feeling a lot calmer. There's noone I know IRL I feel comfortable talking about this to in detail. I just want inner peace and to let go of the fact I let myself be such a doormat to someone else."
509,What are some things that make you smile?,"Recently, I've been pretty worn out and depressed. I haven't really had the energy to enjoy anything much. I know it won't make me happy, but it might be nice to see things and know they make other people smile."

511,I keep on becoming happy (normal) and then sliding into a deep depression and I don't know why.,"It happens so frequently (sometimes 2 weeks other times 2 days) that at this point I've stopped talking about it.  If I do then it will just get annoying. Nevertheless, when I feel down I feel hopeless and like I cant do anything. Of course this makes doing school quite difficult. When I'm in a good head space I'm so far away from the darkness that its hard for me to imagine myself with those thoughts. (They seem irrational/ over dramatic) So I've been doing some research but can't find anything that fits what I'm feeling. What could be going on? I'd love to hear your feedback."
512,Am I depressed? Or is it normal,"First of all, I'm new to reddit and I made an account only for asking this question so Pls don't kill me if I post this on the wrong community

Ok the question is:""Am I depressed?""
I don't know what's my problem, I have a caring family and ""good"" friends, but it's 5 years (since I was 14) that I feel empty inside and alone. It's not that I'm always like that, I have moments of joy but I also feel very lonely. I actually enjoy doing things alone, I'm not a fan of disco and parties but I don't think that's the problem. Even when I go outside with my friends, most of the time I feel like I don't belong there. I also never express my feelings with nobody, not even my family (idek why), I've never cried in front of friends and such, but only God knows how many times I've cried listening to music that touched me.

Example I've got one song that at the end says ""believe in yourself"" and the first time I heard that while I was off running, I almost cried like a bitch, I had watery and red eyes like I smoked weed lol.

What I wanna say is that I don't always feel like that(even tho I know that's 5 year that those thoughts are there) but I have them, and also I never tell nobody how I feel on the inside. On the outside I look like a normal guy and I also think I'm pretty good looking (this is only to say that I don't feel like shit for my body etc.  I also workout to be on the best shape cause I care about my well-being)
Let me think what you guys think about it"
513,Help please...,"I really want to help out my GF with her meatal health issues she's been through alot and struggling with a lot, however I'm a pretty sensitive guy that also has some meatal health issues and have a extremely hard time comprehending when she's pushing me away its not because she dislikes me or anything its just something her mind tells her to do.

514,I think I’m becoming obsessed with death,"This is going to sound weird, but I think I’m becoming obsessed with death. I’m a 19 year old female, and ever since I can remember I’ve been scared of dying and death. Somehow I think about it all the time though, I truly don’t think a day goes by lately that I don’t think about it. Particularly the death of my cousin who I didn’t really know, but she was only 17. It just completely takes over me and I get engulfed in thinking about death and researching things about it and wondering if we see our loved ones when we pass. I’m an Atheist, possibly Agnostic so my fear/obsession with death doesn’t really go away because I’m constantly wondering and feeling like I’ll never get the answers. I read about people dying every day and it scares the hell out of me but also I can’t. Stop. Reading. I honestly don’t know what to do at this point. I am diagnosed with severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Severe Depression and am currently not on any medications for it. I do have a therapist but something’s going on with my insurance at the moment. I don’t mean for this to be a long rant but this is also somewhat of a place that I can vent because I think some of my friends and family think I’m strange because all I wanna do sometimes is talk about death or the death of my cousin. I’ve felt like this ever since I had a near death experience, or in my head it was. I had a severe panic attack when I was 16 and my heart rate was close to that of cardiac arrest and I was almost sure I was going to die. But I’ve always questioned death and life, it’s just gotten worse on and off over the years. I want to know everything about death. I wonder what bodies look like after certain periods of time, I wonder what they were wearing or their last thought was, and so much more. Everything about death is so boggling to me and I’m so scared to talk about it on this level with people because I don’t want them to think I’m some psycho who’s gonna murder people or something. I’m probably one of the most sensitive and empathetic people I know, so I don’t know why I’m like this. I literally tear up when I see road kill. I guess what I’m wondering is if anyone else feels like this? And if you do, how do you find peace? Who do you talk to? Does it take over your life at times like it does mine? I feel alone. I feel scared to live but even more scared to die. I’m so miserable constantly living in my head with these obsessive, haunting thoughts. Any advice, or reassurance that I’m not crazy (or confirmation that I am, lmao), would be appreciated."

516,Girlfriend always thinks I'm trying to hurt her and starts fights about it,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years in a long distance relationship. She has been through a lot like emotional abuse from her family, a lot of bullying and sexual assault. I get that these things really affects a person, and I wouldn't blame her if the thing, that I will describe soon, happened sometimes but rarely. But the past month or so, this thing has happened at least once a week and it's getting too much. 

The thing that happens if that she basically starts a fight because she THINKS I did something to hurt her. I promise I've never tried to or wanted to hurt her on purpose, and the things she get upset over are often things that most other people wouldn't even see anything wrong with. Today she got upset over something that made me think ""okay, enough"". It literally involves a banana:

We were chatting on the phone and she mentioned my nephew. I then found a video of him to send to her because I thought she'd appreciate that. But no. In the video, he was holding a banana. I knew since before that my girlfriend hates bananas but I didn't think it was so bad and I didn't even notice it in the video. But after I sent the video, the comments started again: What?? Delete it!! I'm gonna puke. Is this revenge for what I did the other day? I literally thought she was joking first, but nope. She was serious. I tried telling her that I literally just wanted to show her a video of my nephew but she continued like ""THANKS FOR WANTING TO HURT ME"". I told her that I never ever has wanted to hurt her on purpose, not even when I was angry, but she continued. ""Yeah yeah, whatever yoy say. One day you may kill me from revenge"". At this point I got angry and said I won't fight about something so ridiculous and logged out.

As I said before, I realize that the things she has been through probably causes her to be ""hyper-alert"" to threats. But come on... It's hurting me and our relationship when she keeps attacking me for ""wanting to hurt her"" for the most, excuse my words, RIDICULOUS things. At first this was a pretty rare occurrence and then I could handle it, but now as it has happened every week since Halloween I'm feeling pretty fed up. 

Maybe I should mentioned that she started a bit more intensive therapy about a month ago for her eating disorder, but I don't know if this issue will be tackled there since it's ED focused...

What should I do???"

My motivation is going up slightly, but the child in me wants to stomp their feet and say I don't want to do it more often than I would like.

I have been pretty focused on trying to shut that part of me up because I am so grateful for my new position. I am overwhelmed by the positivity at work, and the potential that I could have. I am afraid my ideas are too small for a big company like this. 

I have to talk to higher-ups like way higher-ups. I want to impress them, and make the people that chose to hire me look good. But I'm a big baby and clam up... I guess I am incredibly lucky that I get to meet these people remotely because otherwise I would probably faint upon entering their offices.

But I started having a relationship with this person and i fell in love, we flirted a lot and that love was never to be disputed by my brain. Then they told me they loved me, and someone else at the same time. That feeling of a special love, something that is genuine, just pulled out from underneath me. I don’t know what to do or feel as I just feel empty. Am I just being a little bitch or what? Do they really still like me? Did they like me in the first place? This is all that comes to mind now. I don’t know."

527,Do I have symptoms psychological issues? Please help!,"I am 22 year old guy who needs your help.

1. I suffer from PROCASTINATION. I have been trying to loose weight and start a healthy lifestyle since 2012. I have procastinated both of the things for 8 years. I have gained more and more weight.

Procastination has also affected me in my studying. I failed in the same exam 5 times, because I procastinated till one week before exam.


2. I can't stop MALADAPTIVE DAYDREAMING/Living in my head.


I daydream of impressing people whom I don't know!


I started daydreaming to escape reality since childhood. I have been daydreaming for the past 12 years and love my fantasy life, than real life. I even maladaptive daydream about solving my problems in my head like scoring full marks in exam, having 8 pack ABS, being rich and doing what I want. I live so much inside my head, that I lack motivation to do anything in life.

In my DAYDREAMING, I am impressing people. Play a scenario that happened yesterday and how I was a badass. 


3. MY THINKING IS NOT CLEAR.

I don't know what I want in life. I cannot plan anything and my goals are always unrealistic.

When I procastinated for my exam for 5 times, everytime I vowed to study for 20 hours a day for a week and pass the exam. I wasn't able to do that and I failed miserably.

I have odd beliefs like

$ sleep deprivation will make me genuis.
$ suicide attempt will change my life.
$ I have unlocked genuis inside me, but I can't tap into it because of my ADD disorder.
$ I am superior to average human being.
$ I have connection to GOD and he is closely watching me.
$ everything in life is about luck. I need to get lucky once in life, then I will make a fortune due to being in right place at right time with luck.


4. BINaRY THINKING ( 0 or 1)

This is the most frustrating part about me. I can't think in middle. I always think in -

Black and white.


Life and death .

If someone does something for me, I could give my life away for them 

If someone is mean to me, I have homicidal rage agianst them.



5,. RELATIONSHIP ISSUES.

I LIKE BEING ALONE AND ISOLATED. I HAVE LIVED 3 YEARS OF MY LIFE INSIDE MY ROOM. I LOVE TO BE ALONE AND CRAVE ISOLATION.

I DON'T WANT CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS. I JUST WANT WOMEN TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM, FRIENDS TO HELP ME WHEN NEED ARISES AND WANT RELATIONSHIP WITH NO EXPECTATIONS.

I LOVE PEOPLE TO EXTREMES AND HATE THEM WITH EXTREME.

when people wrong me, I develop extreme hatred, but if same person talks to me politely, I forget that he has wronged me and I talk to him.



6. Suicidal Ideation.

I have been struggling from it for past 1 year.
THINKING about Suicide every single day.

528,how to tell them?,"im currently in a state of being unable to interact with my friends. i don't have that many to begin with, but this past month i feel like i don't have the energy to reply to their texts. i just  feel so so exhausted and drained, by doing my daily routines. i just want to do nothing. but I feel guilty to them too. anyone experienced the same thing? how do i explain it to them?"
529,Exploding head syndrome at the middle of the day?,"Ive been getting the sounds more often and often. They are different all the time. Sometimes they are about 10 seconds of a song, really loud, like from a speaker far far away. Sometimes they are almost like a cannon blast. Or sometimes they are words being said by someone that doesnt clearly exist.

What is going on."
530,This sucks.,"I honestly don't know what to do right now. I have lost all of my motivation to do anything. My grades are falling and I don't have the energy or the time to get them back up. I barely talk to my friends anymore and I haven't seen anyone outside of my family in 2 weeks. Every day I think tomorrow it'll get better but it never does and I'm stuck in this everyday cycle where I get nothing done, think I'll get stuff done tomorrow and beat myself up about it when I don't. I have a bit over 2 weeks left of school and I have 14 missing assignments. Most of them are from AP US history and that class takes so much energy out of me that I take hours to get one assignment done. I have gotten like this before the pandemic but I would be at school around all my friends so things would get better alot quicker, but right now I feel completely stuck with little to no hope that this is gonna get better in time for my to get any kind of good grades."
531,What's wrong with me?,"The thing about have an untreated mental illness is that you never really can find a root issue to it. There is no reason for you to be the way you are, but you find yourself breaking down somehow. I'm having one of those days. I've got everything I need, right? But I can't help but think its all in my head and I'm just a toxic and terrible person, who lashes out at everyone and pushes everyone away. I cannot even receive therapy, as my parents do no believe in mental health (yes, welcome to conservative families who care about their image rather than their child's mental health) but oh well. Any advice??"
532,"Pls read, any advice would be much appreciated!","Hi, only recently (about a week or so??) I have begun to hear voice/a voice in my head. It seems to have it's own opinion and it's kind of starting to worry me. I am fully aware that they are not real and that it just exists inside my head but I don't know how to make it stop. It's almost as if it can talk and I've found that when I keep myself distracted (eg. listening to music) it goes, is this just my subconscious?? They often sound like Disney characters such as Jafar or Phil from Hercules. Sometimes throughout the day it goes. I have had a very traumatic/stressful childhood and currently I am in an extremely horrible/stressful situation; could these two things be related and could this go away by itself? I  have been doing some research on schizophrenia but I don't think I have a mental illness as I am not having delusions or any other symptoms. Any thoughts would be much appreciated! Thank you very much!"
533,Does a parent have to be present when being evaluated for OCD? I’m 17 in Wisconsin,"I’m strongly considering that I likely have mild ocd, and I’d like to go to the psychiatrist so I don’t feel like I’m faking it. Getting my parents on board and all is probably doable, but what I’m worried about is if they have to be present during the process, either for questions about me as a child or for supervision because I’m under 18 like when I went in for asd. I don’t want them to be there because, well ocd features unpleasant obsessions and I don’t want to tell them about them, and I worry what they’d feel about me or do to me if they heard them. I can manage them but I worry they’d send me to an institution or disown me.

Can the parents just consent outside the door and I can get diagnosed in the room by myself? Do they only have to be present for questions about my early childhood and then they can go? How would you go about telling your parents you might have ocd without talking about horrible intrusive thoughts, especially if they tend to think ocd is like it is on tv? Thanks"
534,Where can I go to get tested for BPD and how expensive is it with insurance and without?,"I don’t know if anyone will be able to help me, but I (20f in Pennsylvania, USA) have been dealing with depression and anxiety since about 14 years old, and self harm behaviors since I was about 12/13. I’ve been seeing my current therapist since I came back from inpatient in 2017-2018 and we have a great relationship, but I feel like she doesn’t take my concern about BPD completely seriously.

She mentioned that she definitely sees similarities, but she doesn’t think I have it, although I could definitely get tested if I wanted to know for sure. I would ask the psychiatrist, but I still currently go to a “children’s behavioral” place (I’m one of the oldest clients there), and the psychiatrist there is very religious and is weird with bringing this up and meds and stuff (from what I remember). Also, I haven’t seen him for over a year so it would be the SUPER expensive hour long meeting with him. I guess i dont know what a diagnosis would mean for me, maybe just validity that my “crazy” actions and intense emotions aren’t just me being extra or dramatic, and that it’s more than depression and anxiety? 

There’s other symptoms/similarities I feel I share, but that would make this post too long and annoying to read lol.

TL;DR: I think I show signs of BPD and want to see if I can work towards getting tested. Where can I start and how much money would this be since I don’t want to burden my family with bills."
535,I'm just,"it has been an absolute shit show of a couple weeks and it just doesnt stop.

536,TW: S - Desperately need help with perspective please,"I have been thinking a lot lately about ending my life. Now before everyone goes ""no don't do it, it's never the answer"", please if you have the time (this post may be lengthy) listen to my breakdown of my situation.

Firstly, from a purely biological standpoint I do not meet the standard in several ways. I am a 5'5"" tall male, well below average. My BMI is in the morbid obesity category. Now, whilst I could definitely change that and want to so badly, my mental health and a sheer lack of support make it a difficult task, especially when I don't have anything to fight for. My parents were negligent and never took me to the dentist as a child, my teeth are crooked and some have cracked. I'm not necessarily just thinking negative though, I actually think if I was thin and tall I'd be pretty good looking. Lastly for this point, I have also been short changed by nature in my manhood, it's not tiny but it is below average.

Regarding the other facets of my life: I had a mental breakdown during my high school years, which led to me leaving without any GCSEs. I did achieve certification as a support worker for people with learning disabilities, which I did love doing; I cannot however continue, as my own mental state and condition puts them at risk. I didn't have a high paying job to begin with, I don't aspire to wealth either, but I am now being supported completely by the UK government.

I have friends and they have stuck around, so they must think I'm okay. But I would really like love, I don't lust after sex but would like to feel a mutual passion with a woman. I can't see that happening in my future because of the aspects I have just mentioned. It's natural selection after all I suppose, if I am weak willed, weak bodied and not of much value to the tribe, then I do not deserve my oxygen or food.

This may just seem like a tirade that I have aimed at myself, but no. I really want to know from you guys, why should I live? I have been asking my mental health workers this and they just divert the conversation. Give me a reason to endure my mental pain, give me a reason not to die."
537,I cant enjoy anything,"It's been two weeks since I feel this pressure in my chest that doesn't go away, I have a lot of problems in my life right now, but I realized that they're out of my control so I shouldn't worry that much, but the pressure still there, and the last week I was listening a podcasts that always makes me laugh, and I was laughing but I didn't feel pleasure, just that chest pain, I freaked out because it was so weird, I'm scared that this could harm mg relationship with my girlfriend because I just cant enjoy anything anymore.
whats my problem and what should i do to fix it?"
538,Psychosis during parenthood," 

Hi, my name is Nicole Dawson, I am currently completing a masters in clinical and health psychology at the University of Liverpool.

I am conducting a research project into the factors that can help or hinder recovery from psychosis in parents. This research is important as it values the opinions and experiences of the parents themselves as the service user is seen as the expert in their own recovery. Moreover, this research can be used to inform health professionals and clinical settings on how we can best support parents with psychosis on their recovery journey. This research has received ethical approval by The University Of Liverpool Ethics Committee.

As of the situation with COVID-19 all interviews will be carried out over the phone or using applications such as Zoom. All participants data will be kept anonymous and confidential. If you would like to take part the following eligibility criteria apply:

You must speak fluent English and be between 18-60 years old.

You must have experienced psychosis during parenthood, this may be or may not be include a formal diagnosis.

You must be in a period of recovery and have been recovered for at least 12 months. You MUST self-identify as currently being in a period of recovery, and have had no significant intervention or crisis intervention from mental health services for the 12-month period. This includes community treatment orders, and any period of hospitalisation for mental health care. This does not include routine medical appointments, such as medication reviews or clinics.

If you are interested in taking part in this research, please email - [n.dawson2@student.liverpool.ac.uk](mailto:n.dawson2@student.liverpool.ac.uk) or further details.

Thank you"
539,Relapse,"Today I relapsed, for the first time since June 9th, 2019. Last time it happened was when I left my ex fiancée. I’m not exactly sure why I’m posting here but I just don’t have a good support system to talk to about this with anyone irl... I think I might have borderline pd but I don’t have health insurance to see a therapist about it and I’m not sure why I feel like I’m dissociating so often now."
540,Leaving therapist of 5 years due to insurance,"Hi so I’ve been seeing the same therapist for 5 years. My job offered insurance this year so I took it, my insurance is in network for my therapist and covers 100% of mental health services. This past year I did not have insurance and my therapist charged me a set amount we both agreed on that was affordable. 

However with this new insurance my therapist is charging the visits as “specialist visits” which means that I have to pay regular out of pocket amounts (her regular rate is $150 per session), until I meet my deductible which is $1000. My insurance itself costs me $100 each check so that on top of the regular rate out of pocket is obviously way too much. 

I am having to leave this therapist because of how she sends in the claims they are not covered under my insurance. I am super bummed by this because I’ve been seeing her for 5 years. But I just cannot afford the sessions. Anyways this is just a big vent thing and I’m just bummed."
541,can anxiety get bad where you cant watch horror?,"i used to looove horror movies like obsessed .
but past month i watch horror my anxiety goes bad and gotta turn it off .
always had anxiety since forever but now i guess its triggerd harder ?
i guess anxiety can grow worse over time ?
kinda started bein constant after a bad breakup maybe tht triggerd it?"
542,I made mistakes at work and I might get fired.,"Hi guys, what's up? So, I'm just having a late night anxiety attack right now. It's about work. I have been working as an online ESL Teacher for over 2 mos. Now, I'm afraid that I might have done a lot of mistakes correcting my students' grammar mistakes. For some weird reason, I got a sudden feeling that I need to check every report page I have submitted. I have only checked the report pages for the last three days and I did spot soke mistakes from my end. I corrected them and submitted them again. But it made me feel more anxious because I feel that I need to check every report page for the last 13 days which is almost 1300 report pages. 

I dont have the time and energy to check 1300 report pages but my anxious thoughts won't  stop bothering. I am just afraid of disappointing my students if ever they are going to check it, and the Quality Analyst (who randomly checks a randome class recording) might think that I am not a good teacher and fire me. 

I talked about this with my boyfriend and he did his best to convince me that it's okay to make mistakes and it doesn't define. I should try not to worry about and start double-checking after work. 

But I still can't help but to blame myself and hate myself because of these mistakes. So far, I haven't received any complaints, warning, and low ratings from students. 

I'm wondering how do you move on from your past mistakes and not obsessing/overthinking about it? Thank you."
543,A really stupid class I have to take,"A new bullshit class. It's SEL (Social emotional Learning) It's here we learn about ""Feelings""  We have been taking this class since the 5th grade. I fucking HATE it. Guys this doesn't help my anger issues. We always have to do these cheesy work sheets that are cheesier than my moms Mac and Chips. It so dumb! I can even avoid the zoo because I'm in school on that day so I'll have to go. Even if I try to get out of it, chances are the teacher will come up with this bullshit excuse!!! This doesn't help my anger issue school. I'm probably just going to bring something with me to help ignore that bullshit. If teacher give work for it, I won't do it because it's stupid and it's not even graded so who fucking cares! Why do they feel the need to pull this shit?! Why? Just why? It's so stupid I just can't even. And If I bring a book and the ELA teacher, (She'll be teaching it) Will probably get all up my ass for reading, even though SHE Always hounds us about reading! So if she tries that shit I'll just tell her I'm taking her advice and reading. I can't even skip because it's in school and If I skip my parents will find out and be really pissed at me. So I'm most likely going to, A;Bring a book to read or B; My 3DS or if that doesn't work, I'll just hide in the bathroom for as long as I can. At this point I don't care if I swear on this laptop, I'm just going to say it. Fuck you school, You fucking suck and I can't wait to get out of the Hellhole you guys call a ""School."" If school gets mad at me I'll just give them a piece of my mind because I'm tired of them walking all over my and always obeying them. I'm trying to be a more positive person, but The school crossed the line. The so-called system sucks and they don't seem to care about how I feel. makes me want to shoot myself in the face. It's not like they would care. Imma say this one more time. Fuck you school, your ""System"" is shit and that place is a hellhole. Don't be surprised if you find out I killed myself."
544,Can't sleep because of anxiety whether I would ever get a job,I hate feeling this way. My anxiety is through the roof and I have another interview coming up which I have zero motivation to prepare for (did not take antidepressants properly and they're fucking me up.) I will prepare seriously for the remaining 4 days and try to do well. I don't know what will happen. This is fucking excruciating tbh. I hate this.
545,"Self harmed whilst I was drunk, not sure what to feel about it","I’m a 19 year old male. About 3 weeks ago I was drinking alone and feeling shit in my room at uni. Grabbed my kitchen knife and cut 5 kinda deep cuts into my inner ankle after putting a cigarette out on my wrist. I’m not really that bothered about it just kinda feel bad cos if my friends or family found out they’d get concerned for me and become upset. I was drunk when I did it and don’t remember it hurting much and I can’t really even remember why I did it so doesn’t seem like a deal to me just was a stupid thing to do. I remember it being satisfying just cutting my skin and I guess wanting to do something extreme because I was feeling quite emotional I suppose. Think I was pretty angry at the time maybe. I guess generally I have low self esteem and feel bad about life and feel isolated. Anyway posting this because I don’t know if it’s a bad thing that I don’t care. Does this mean anything? Does the fact that I’m not bothered a good thing? Idk just feels a bit strange. Seems mostly dumb but not much feelings about it. 

Sorry if this post is poorly written I’m pretty tired. Just don’t know what to think about it and can’t talk to anyone about it."

547,With this pandemic...,"I’m having a hard time to reach out or open-up what I’m dealing right now to others, even in my close friends. And I’m loosing interest to the things Iove to do. Am I the only one going through with this?"
548,"I got scared of the littlest things last night, and the fear is still lingering.","Last night I (16F) had very little homework and happened to have a lot of freetime, so I decided to go on YouTube since I have over 400 videos on my Watch Later list I never had the chance to get to. First, I watched videos about this lost live-action pilot for the Backyardigans (I have a big fascination for lost media), for which there is a short clip where there are four people in character costumes dancing in a line, and the lighting is very dim. Pablo was up at the front and his costume looked especially frightening. Afterwards, I clicked on the audio for this song called ""Gomenne Gomenne"" because the album art intrigued me. Let me just start off by saying that just the song itself gave me the creeps before I even scrolled down the comments that mentioned what the song was about... it shook me despite the story behind it being a work of fiction. I don't want to mention the meaning of the song on here because it is too horrific. If you want to know, you may Google it yourself at your own discretion. 

After my internet session, I found that I was scared and shaken as a whole. For some reason, I even began worrying about my own future. My mood was so low, and I was hesitantly going upstairs in the dark, afraid that I would get nightmares. I slept with my blanket over my head due to my fright. I woke up this morning a few minutes earlier, hesitantly getting out of bed, and I opened up one of the curtains in my living room because now I was afraid of the dark. This is unusual because normally on weekday mornings I prefer the lights off with all the curtains closed on account of my drowsiness. 

I am pretty sure these feelings will wear off eventually, but I don't know why I reacted so extremely to such benign things (well, the song was not that benign, but I do not think it should have affected me that much). I'm sixteen and should be stronger, am I okay? 

Sorry if this post is not exactly suitable for this subreddit, but I did not know where else to put this, and technically my mental health is impacted by this."
549,How much do I have to tell my therapists in order to get better?,"Trigger warning: self harm/suicidal tendencies

×

Since August, I've been seeing various councillors and behavioural therapists and since a near incident in September I've been burning, head banging and scratching. I made the mistake in early October of wearing shorts to bed which led to my mother finding my lighter and various other things that I had planned to use in September. Since then, I've been referred to more people and have about 3 sessions a week whereas I used to have 1-2 biweekly.

Since then, I haven't told anyone about my self harm. I got a scooter for my birthday so I blame any particularly lasting marks on that and I've stocked up on opaque tights.

That being said, I do want to get better. I keep going to school (kind of), I keep going to therapy and I feel like I'm making a bit of progress on that front though it comes with it's own difficulties. However, I've made up my mind that I'm not disclosing my self harm again. I function very well and because of my self harm, I haven't had an episode in 2 months so the last thing I want is to be transfered to a ward because I'm a danger to myself because I'm not.

However, from my experience so far, I do know that being open with these sorts of things is part of the process though I'm just wondering if I could just get better and keep my coping mechanism until I don't need it any more."
550,Mind filled with bad thoughts?,"If a bad thought is persevering in your mind, continuing in your mind, then it means that you are just 'calling' it a bad thought. Deeply, you are supporting it. Deeply, you think that it is a 'good' thought.

We call them bad. We actually do not consider them bad.

And your minds are not at all full of good thoughts. What does that mean?

You call them good—but you consider them very very bad.

So, even when those thoughts come to you, you do not support them. What do you support? All the so-called bad thoughts.

Then let's have a little honesty: why call them bad at all?"
551,How do I stop basing my self worth and my happiness on whether the women I am attracted to are similarly attracted to me / give me attention?,"It's absurd to me that I am still dealing with this, but I guess that's what happens when you never truly work out your problems. It's absurd because I'm 36, I have a well-established career in engineering with real responsibility and a hell of a good paycheck to boot, all of which I achieved through my own hard work and initiative. I already fully own my home... I have not had a single financial worry in over a decade. On top of that, I've got a solid group of friends who I see regularly, even with just video chats if necessary but we do spend time together in carefully controlled circumstances. And I'm close with my family too... My mom is no longer living and my dad is about to move across the country, but I've got my brothers and their families and we are pretty close. I have lots and lots of security. I am very safe, well established, and I would even dare say successful.

But man, the thing I don't have is a romantic relationship, and I've let this DESTROY me. I've developed really unhealthy habits in this regard, forming unhealthy and obsessive attachments with women in various corners of my life and going all-in on personal happiness that is fully dependent on ""did I get their attention or not?"" Like right now there's a woman I met on discord who I know has a thing going with this other guy, and even though I like her and have had some meaningful connections with her, I just obsess over and over about hearing from her, am I getting through to her, does she seem to be talking to this other dude more, etc etc. It's unhealthy and isn't helping, but I know why I cling to this so hard... I'm convinced it is one of my only opportunities to not only find love but to actually BE HAPPY. I've somehow let myself believe this and I don't know how to break free of this spell.

Why am I so dependent on attention for my own happiness?"
552,I need advice.,My friend is suicidal and has done self harm in the past. Just the other day I stayed with them all night trying to discourage them from doing dangerous things. They do not even want to hear of therapy. I tried persuading them into sending a text to a hotline but to no succes. They said  talking to me it's enough. They are afraid to reach out to hotlines because they think cops might come to their house (from a bad experience).I am not in any way qualified to speak to a person with suicidal tendencies. I need help from a counselor or a person who has dealt with this before. Maybe you could tell me what I should do. I cannot help anybody.

Now everyone thinks I’m some god awful teenager when I’ve never done anything harder than 🌿and Ive never seen a real gun. They constantly tell me I’m headed to prison and got my sister to never want to see me again. I’m supposed to prove them wrong and show them I’ve changed but how am I supposed to do that if I wasn’t doing that in the first place. My grandma is scared living at the house with me.

557,Fear of going back in time,"This sounds strange and I’m not sure if this is the right place to post. But I have this irrational fear of going back in time.

I think of terrible distressing events in my life that took me a very long time to come to terms with, and I often fear that one day I’ll wake up and be back there. The thought terrifies me because I know I wouldn’t have the energy to go through it again. This is obviously irrational, but I don’t understand this fear and I can’t find much about it on google. When I search it comes up with things like “fear about returning to school/work”. Which doesn’t really apply.

Has anyone experienced this sort of thing?

Tl;dr - fear about going back in time to traumatic events"
558,I desperately need help with my sister,"I have two sisters, both of whom have been treated for major depression in the oast. One has been diagnosed with Bipolar, the other has not. But it has become apparent that she either has borderline or bipolar.

During her first year of uni she was outgoing and mentally great.q At the start of quarantine she had to come back home and has been here since, and got along with everyone and exhibit normal behavior for several months. I came back 4 months ago, at the start of her current worrying turn.

Since then she locks herself in her room and talks to nobody but my sister. She used to talk to me until we had a petty argument about wifi, and I also later informed her that I agree with our parents that she should seek help. This is before I realized how bad the delusions were.

When we were children we had an extremely hard stretch of years that ended for me before they ended for her. During that time we all became depressed, my other sister got PTSD, and the sister I'm asking about began to exhibit OCD and deoression symptoms (she paces in circles and constructs elaborate daydreams as a pasttime). When we were children she tried to jump out the third floor window of our apartment while our mom wasn't home. She has had no suicidal attempts or self harm attempts after that. I also had suicidal ideations during that period but have not had them since around age 12. She and my other sis struggled from PCOS since their early teens, as it runs in the family.

She first told me that she thinks our dad and his wife hacked her computer. She deleted all social media and formatted her laptop because of this delusion. My younger sister informed me that she also mentioned that she thinks tyere may be a drone outside her room spying on her. She likely thinks everyone besides me and my other sister are trying to spy on her.

My other sister told us that she had talked about leaving and travelling somewhere. She has a bag packed in her room. We became very alarmed when she took all her old clothes and books and donated them. Our neighbor saw her leaving with luggages and we all freaked out and spennt hours wondering if she ran away in her condition. She came back later that night though, as she was just dropping her stuff at an orphanage charity. She told me this was because she is pursuing a ""minimalist"" lifestyle by giving away things she doesn't need, but we have no clue if that is truly why. We cannot tell which if her behaviors are from illness or not.

She talks to no one. My mom has stood outside her room weeping and begging to talk to her for hours on end, and asking her to see a doctor. My dad tried to talk to her when he comes over and tries to assure her that she is free to come and go as she pleases, and gently prods her to accept doctor's help. Me and my sister are dealing with our unu and highschool finals while acting as liasons (though I suspect she no longer trusts me and sees me as in cahoots with parents).

We have talked to many doctors and are at an em passe, waiting for her to either get well enough to see one or to reach a point where we have to use the last resort of forcing her to see one. 

She is the kindest and most caring person in our family, the one who has put up with the most quietly, looks after family the most, is always extremely generous, but she has always been the most sensetive and lonliest.

What can I do? The only people in the position to get her medical help ar ethe ones she believes are trying to sabotage and spy on her, and because of my ignorance and impatience I've alienated myself from her."

Basically, life isn’t going well, I was made homeless by my own dad not too long ago and now I have nowhere to go (i’m staying at my boyfriends with him and mum but that’s only temporary for now) i’m struggling. I feel like my friends are less interested since I told them that I may have to move a distance away from them. They just haven’t been as supportive as i’d hoped. I feel like i’m losing everything.

Since my grandad died 4 years ago it’s all been hell, i’ve lost a relationship with my mum, i’m trying to salvage it but that isn’t the biggest issue here. I just feel alone, it’s scary, i haven’t felt this alone in so long"
561,Feels like I'm a coward,"Everytime I get in a near-physical confrontation, I'll dwell on it for days and just feel like my energy has been sucked from my body, and I won't get any sleep. This is starting to really take a toll on my mind because I feel so helpless and weak. 

Yes, I know most of it is a Fight-or-Flight response.
Yes, I know the most important fact is that I'm alive and didnt even end up in a fight.

I dont know why my head just stays frozen in that one moment over and over but I want so badly to just get past this anxiety and continue my life."
562,Does anyone else deal with random irritability?,"Sometimes things just piss me off. I don’t know why, but sometimes someone’s voice, or breathing, or noise, or laughter; anything just makes me want to slap them or get them to just shut up as soon as I can. I never do, I’ve never acted on it. I’m not violent, I’d never hurt anyone. But I get really angry and snappish, and sometimes it lasts for hours. Sometimes I get really angry and just lash out for no reason. Does anyone else have this? How do you cope with it? Is there a word for this?"
563,We had a doctor killing herself past days and these are my thoughts,"Everyone talk about preventing suicide cos... you should never give up... cos it's worth living... cos

Well I would not describe my life as worth living. I remember few days I thought I was happy, which is now in a fog cos same people I once felt happy with stabbed me the worst. 

My whole life is basically surviving. On crumbles of someone's attention and good will.

I'm drained. I'm not for killing myself but I feel dead in my mind. I don't get happy about anything. I'm not happy about people. Not even interaction with anyone can dig me up. 

I can understand people who decide to cut the cord.

And when I open myself and a person who hasn't been through challenges I've been tells me I should keep my head up cos it's worth living and good days will come... I don't feel this. My days of young age have passed. All I can expect is more loneliness. More bad outcomes. Nothing is going to get better for me. I won't change and make friends and have a family. I'll probably manage to chase away my own kids in a meantime. They'll probably hate me for number of reasons when they grow up."
564,dealing with intense guilt and self doubt,"i’m probably not alone in saying this semester of college has been HARD. online learning is not my ideal way of learning but ofc we have to make due. i’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety which caused me to fall behind in 2 of my classes (i’m taking 4 total). im still on track to pass but my grades are not as high as i’d like them to be. i’m suffering from intense anxiety/guilt ab my grades slipping. how do i convince myself that i tried my best and that i am enough? or is the guilt i’m feeling valid and i should be ashamed for my lack of effort? 

for a little background i’m doing well in my other 2 classes (hopefully i’ll get As) i just feel like such a disappointment for my performance in my other 2. the two i’m struggling in are a lot more demanding course load/material wise and my depression made it hard to keep my motivation up."
565,(Hopefully the right place) I have choke dreams that make me believe I really am,"\[Went with ""need support"" flair cause sounds appropriate\]

Just to explain a bit to better understand my situation. When I dream, I remember most of what happens in those dreams, and my mind over time has made dreams feel more &amp; more real, pretty much to the point where if I experience pain in the dream, I'll wake up with my body remembering the pain (like I got shot in one dream, and I wake feeling as if someone burned me with a hot poker). 

So basically, whatever I experience in the dreams, my body (somehow) remembers as if it really happened. Well, some time in 2014, I started getting these dreams where I would attempt to swallow something I knew I would choke on, but would wake up before I started choking. 

Eventually though, they got to the point where just as I'm about to choke, that's when I would wake up, and to make it worse, it is so intense that I believe for a while that ""it wasn't a dream"", I'll feel the object even though it's all in my head, I'll start gagging, and sometimes even try reaching in to grab the object. 

I try to get myself in the bathroom so I can look at in the mirror as a way of convincing myself ""It's just in your head, it's not real"". I do of course get out of that delusion, but the terror sticks with me (cause panicking about choking &amp; believing I am), and it just makes my insomnia worse. 

As a result, I've tried to get officially diagnosed, though I already know I have sleep apnea. The only issue is that these choke dreams are random, they don't happen every single day, sometimes it'll be days to weeks before another choke dream happens, and other times it's happened multiple times in one night. 

I'm mostly trying to figure why I dream about swallowing objects I know I'll choke on, why I can't stop myself for a bit from trying to get the imaginary object out, and how I can get them to stop entirely - I'm basically being psychologically tortured by my own mind...

I am really not making this up, I really do suffer from this unbelievably annoying issue. They've sometimes gotten me into such a terrified state that I become afraid to go to sleep (sleep depriving myself out of fear of having another choke dream).

Any suggestions or thoughts?"
566,Was this emotional abuse?,"I remember when I was younger yelling was extremely normal in my family. I often had friends over whom I would tell ""Yeah just ignore that, happens every day"". This yelling was primarily directed towards my brother but also:
I was a very picky eater. Still kind of am and dinner was a fight every day. My dad would yell at every little thing. I never suggested any trips or dared to say anything I wanted to do. I think because I knew my parents would come and the day would be ruined. I did sports. My dad would yell if I was scared to do something (Canoeing. I was always terrified of white water).
It has calmed down since my brother and I are adults now and I will move out in a while too, but today this happened: My parents asked my why I always put myself down, why I never like anything I do and why I don't believe positive comments.
I thought about it and I think I know why now. Quotes from my dad: ""You're a zero."" (more commonly used in my language. sound a little weird in english) "" How can you be so stupid"" ""you're irresponsible, I should take your money away from you. I shouldn't let you have a phone"" ""you don't have friends"".
He'd say these things and then in the next minute do a 180 and suddenly be all nice and I think he somehow thought that fixed it. 
He rarely says those things now. It was almost daily when I was younger. It's so weird because now he is the one with whom I'd talk about emotional issues. He has comforted me through a panic attack after a mass panic I witnessed while my mum instead yelled at me to be quiet. 

I will never become a parent if I don't for sure know that I won't do that to my children. I want to never yell again and never ever hit anyone but sometimes it's extremely hard to control. I'm quite weak so it's not like I could harm anyone physically... but I could potentially become abusive too and I just can't ever let that happen. I'm scared."
567,Why do I hit myself so often?? I can't control it.,"I am 15F, I have borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety. I also struggle with sensory issues; I get overwhelmed really easily and might wave my arms or kick my legs. 

lately, in the last month or two, I have been unable to control that. sometimes I find myself cringing and gasping quietly, or even hitting the back of my neck, head or forehead; sometimes open handed and sometimes a first. usually it's not too bad, but it gets embarrassing and sometimes it really hurts. 

sometimes it happens when something stresses me out, like a loud noise or certain frequencies. other times it just kinda happens. 

why????"
568,I should be happy.....,"I after years of wanting my own place....
Have a place now.
I should be feeling victorious.
I'm not. Just terrified.
When not terrified... numb. 
Halp"
569,"I am usually a happy person, but when i am mad i am really, really angry.","I am basically a very happy person to begin with. I have a nice family, grew up a good life but i feel like deep inside me i am almost like the hulk. I get ridiculously angry if something triggers/bothers me. I am always that person in public who smiles or is polite. But its almost as if someone starts something with me, like saying something rude/ or doing something rude i get really heated inside to the point i want to hurt them. It's not like i will cause harm but it depends. If they obviously hit me or something i might go full on beat their ass, even if i am the one losing i would try to make it hell. I kind of lose my focus and mood and think about the thing that makes me upset most of the day. I even have pet dogs and i feel like they upset me almost everyday doing something they arent suppose to, i hurt them. Going to be honest, i quite enjoy it too. It makes me smile when i hurt them like slapping their face mildly or squeezing a spot on them. Just imagine a human? What do you guys think? A lot of people say i got anger issues but the same time im mr happy in this world. Not sure what my true inner self is..."
570,Spiraling downwards. I need your,"It is currently 8:26pm as of starting this.

I write in a very scattered way, the same how I speak, so I apologize in advance. 

I feel like I'm continuing to spiral downwards as of my mental health. I've become the type to get aggravated very easy, even over little inconveniences or something that doesn't go my way.. Like a child.

I've speculated that there might be something neurologically wrong with me as well as, but I don't have the money nor the mental energy to get any diagnosis. So I just let myself fester in my own negative thoughts and declining mental state.

I get annoyed that my best friend is in a happy relationship with their boyfriend. It's not that I don't want them to be happy, that's all I ever want for them is happiness. But having to listen to them talk about him just makes me want to scream. While they talk to me about him, I have wildly intrusive thoughts and I make myself sick.

I just want them to focus on me for a bit, I want them to shut the fuck up about him and talk about something else. But not their frogs, or frogs at all. I fucking hate frogs now, just because they like them so much.

I know I'm a bad friends for thinking these things and feeling these ways. 

I feel deep dread for feeling hate and disgust about their fascination of frogs and love for their boyfriend. 

I know that these feelings are immature, I use to not feel this way, I think.

They also cry and whine to me about him and I hate it, I  hate that they get to cry about their problems to me, but the moment I need to vent to them they get uncomfortable and say I'm ""too aggressive."" I can show them aggressive if they really want. 

I smoke when I have the money to, it's been about three months since I've last smoked. Getting high was my only way of escape, but now I no longer have that escape. 

I'm a fucking freeloading unemployed dumbass that doesn't fucking deserve an ounce of kindness. At least I've convinced myself that I don't deserve kindness. I've convinced myself that I'll never get better. I need help.

My meaningless sex buddy moved too far for our casual meet ups, and I've developed a dependency on masturbation to keep that bit of serotonin/dopamine. 

I don't have the money to get therapy, and the government funded place is too far to walk. It's too inconvenient for my roommate, best friend with the boyfriend, to drive me. I feel like they don't even want to help me in the long run. 

I feel like a helpless wreck, I just want to know what's wrong with me already. 

It is now 8:52pm as of finishing this post. Thank you."
571,I just want to be normal,"I'm 23 now, and the adult world couldn't be more difficult to handle. Im someone who dosent like to use my disorders as excuses at every turn, as I dont feel they're as intrusive as other problems I could have had. I deeply despise people like that just to keep my own head above water (as shitty as it makes me) but I'm failing at almost every turn. Im honestly not educated enough to even explain how I feel about things. Im in a donstant sense of inpending doom, at work my quietness and over energetic behavior has left many employers and co workers to believe i abuse drugs. The more I dwell on it the worse it gets, but when I am doing ""well"" and earn the ""maybe he was just nervous"" outlook from others, its ruined the next day, and I dont know why this keeps happening. 

I've been practicing CBT heavily for the past few years, it's helped with me not letting things get to me when ignorant, shitty tradesmen and other people in my field of work try to piss me off and get a rise out of me. But it runs deeper than that. My social performance is piss poor, im constantly forgetful (leaving equipment out, losing things, forgetting tasks). Pills are out of the question due to my family history of physical disease and my own history of drug addiction (6 years clean of anything serious ie stims) i dont use marijuana or drink for obvious reasons related to depression and anxiety. But I feel like its not enough.

What I'm left with is nothing but a product of my disorders that I've tried tirelessly throughout my life to either suppress or fix, im not a suicidal person but anyone who deal with depression obviously has it cross their mind every now and then, and if you claim otherwise I'd say you're full of shit . In my region, gender, and field, its almost unspokenly encouraged that if you're not someone who can act like a man, then you should get out, because they're not going to understand and help you manage, stop being a leach. 

Any chance of having a normal life, emotional relationships, friendships, the general respect of my own family, are an impossible reach as im seen as a loser to them, a failure, burden. I dont honestly know how to fix this and living as a shell of my former self is something that im fed up with doing. I just want to lie in bed and not do anything I dont want to be a problem to others. Im fucking exhausted. Ive been telling myself it'll get better for years and worked endlessly to do so, done everything my psych has told me and at this point I'm just lying to myself"
572,I need someone now.,"I am struggling. I am at my end. I crave to be with my father, and im not suicidal yet....but suicide seems a nice option. 

I am hurting, and failing, and losing hope. 

I need someone to help me hang on for my mothers sake. Not for me, but for her. I love her and i dont want to hurt her, but i am at my end. I wish to be with my father (who is long dead) and i wish my suffering to end. 

I know its a lot to ask...but i need someone to keep me alive tonight. I cant do it myself."
573,"I Just had a Mental Breakdown Tonight (Mental Health, Growing Up, and Addiction)","Today was really rough. Man, I hope u read this all the way through, word for word... please:(

Man. What is wrong with me? I'm such a good person yet such a monster. I will be so quick to be the sweetest and most caring in the room but snap on everybody with the most hate and anger in the room. My dad just wants to help me, poor guy. But all I do is drag him down into my cycle of misery. One minute I hug him. The next minute I cuss him out and tell him to shut the f\*ck up and f\*ck you and the most horrible evil things. I'm 18 btw. I just graduated earlier this year by the grace of god. I got a job back that I quit without notice so I could go to a rehab and mental health facility. Again, by the grace of god.

And here I am, still abusing this OTC high once every week or once a week or so. I've been a daily weed smoker, mostly at night to deal with my problems for years now. Also addicted to caffeine and nicotine. Luckily I just cut out the nicotine today. I'm 4 days without smoking weed at night (cut down to very little). I'm on this antidepressant called Wellbutrin but it dosen't do sh\*t for me and nor has any antidepressant. I was on Concerta for a month last year and it changed my life for that month. But I was 17 and so my dad took me off of it because he saw it as legal meth and thought I was wanting to get high on them (they did not get me high and actually helped me be calm cool and focused and collected and feel normal and actually be able to complete all the ambitions I set out to do and not have a million thoughts going on all at once in different directions every waking hour of the day and fixed my sleep problems)

And I'm in the length proccess of getting an ADHD test done with these new psych docs now that I'm 18 and man it is just taking forever for them to call me and tell me when they will do the test and weather or not they will prescribe me with Concerta, which helped me immensely. 

Man, my mind is just fucked up. I feel so ugly with these braces. I have no car. No friends. No girlfriend. No life. I just work and come home. I keep on spending the money I'm suppose to be saving for a car. I feel like an out of control raging mess. I act like a complete devil when I go into my mental breakdowns.

Tonight I just snapped and lost it. I went from apologizing to my dad, to crying, to shouting and cussing him out and repeating those 3 things.

I'm just so bored of everything in life that nothing satisfies me. No matter how much I'm sober, no matter how much excercise I do, no matter how hard I try but horribly fail at spending just at least 2 short minutes on learning guitar or piano but always opt out for an internet addiction isntead or try to read the 5 books I checked out but don't even make it a page through. No matter how positive I try to remain and how kind I am to people and how loving i am of the earth and grateful i am for my life. No matter how connected to god I feel and my spirituality.

Nothing is able to fill this void of boredom. And eventually it gets to the point where everything just seems purposeless. I feel like i have no purpose. 

I know what to do to make my life good. I want to make music and be really talented with it, learn art, go to college, make friends, have a girlfriend, make memories, read books, write poetry and journal and write books, excercise and diet, learn how to defend myself in case i may need to for myself and family one day, give back to this earth and help people out in need, travel the world and all its' beauties, help the poor in third world countries and give them a good life, help the environment and conserve our nature and prevent pollution, inspire people, be a public speaker, learn how to dance, get better at cooking, find my dream job, find happiness.

I want to do those things.

But without proper medication, I feel like I am just a jumbled, unmotivated, bored of everything, purposeless mess.

And I take it out in extreme fits of anger and abuse my dad verbally. I feel like such an evil person. But I know I have good in me. I have that OTC drug stashed in my room. WTF am I doing. I'm ruining my life. 

Will I ever be stable? Life feels like it's always going to be reckless.

I'm so bored and sick and tired of being stuck in my small amish town. I want to get out and explore life. I feel trapped. I'm going crazy. I have to muster extreme amounts of strength from within and from god just to get through the day and be able to decently function at work and do something at least halfway productive outside of work.

And even then, I rely on heavy doses of caffeine to get me through and lots of melatonin at night that ends up giving me scary nightmares because I also just cold turkeyed weed which is known to have a side effect of really vivid dreams from the withdrawal and nightmares.

Man am I even really ADHD? Or am I just messing with my head? I swear, concerta helped me feel normal. I naturally do not feel normal and sturggle with so many isssues.

I cannot keep a structured mind or life. Everything is ALL OVER THE PLACE. Mood swings everywhere. But I know I can't be bipolar because I never feel manic or depressive. Just messy, jumbled, and have 10 different thoughts going on about the most random stuff like how much my friends dad talks or how caveman weren't able to tell time back then. Lol, I just came up with something random but seriously, this affects me so much.

When somebody is talking to me I constantly am loosing my train of thought because i start zoning out or thinking about something or else or I trry so hard to focus that I end up not understanding what they're saying.

Man, I could keep going on about this craziness and messiness that my mind and life is. I realize my sentences are way too long and unstructured but i don't care because i'm just letting my thoughts flow out because this is how i naturally think. I usually try to put on a ""normal"" act to everybody but this is the true raw me. Impulsive, bored all the time, confused, messy, unstructured, can't focus for shit, never satisfied with anything, always seeking stimulation, feeling crazy, 200 million thoughts going on in every which direction north south and west and east.

Man, I hope somebody actually read the whole entire post word for word.

I feel like nobody will understand me or be able to read all of this. Man why am I like this. Nobody truly cares enough to read this word for word. I doubt it... please don't lie to me if u didn't and say u did. Ugh, why am I so hyperfocused on that? damnit man. I am a mess. I seriously need help. 

Ugh.....

that's it i guess. even though i could keep going on. Man tonight was a bad night. But I'll be okay. Fuck I really wanna give in on day 4 and smoke weed. damnit. im so impulsive. i get so bored. drugs are like an instant cure to that boredom. i'll be fine. just like that juice wrld song. i just popped a beaann yesterday was a looonngg night. i done did the right drugs only on the wrooonngg night. i was roockkinn all whitee tryna have a fun time.

okay I'm done lmao. 

I love Juice.

ANyways for real this time I'm done spraying out my thoughts at lightspeed.

Words of advice or support or affiramtion would be much appreciated.

Much love to all of you guys.

I want to stick around for my Mom....but i am struggling a lot. I want to meet my father and apologize that i didn't meet his expectations. I want to meet him and gain his advice. I want to meet him and be at peace.

I am only still alive for my mother....but she doesn't understand. 

I need my Dad....more than anything...i need his advice and in need his guidance..... He was my best friend and mentor.....and i feel so lost without him."
575,for those of you with chronic pain or physical illness... how do you control panic attacks when u convince urself ur getting physically worse or need to go to the hospital???,i’ve recently had a spinal injury and have had so many panic attacks bc i convince myself i have a symptom i don’t have... i’m having surgery soon but i want to know how to handle it until then bc it’s really hard to seperate anxious thoughts from reasonable ones...
576,I’m tired of pretending I’m ok... I’m not,"I hate it so much. I’m tired of pretending I’m fine- like I’m the one who is there to help everyone else because I’m not fine. No one believes me when I say anything. You can’t fix me by trying to make me smile especially when that smiles fake. I’m tired, sad, anxious, annoyed, and I can’t do it"
577,Struggling with loss,"In June 2020, I lost my grandfather to old age and I haven't been myself since. We were very close, so losing him has hit me really hard.  I barely talk to anyone, and I spend most of my time alone.  Even when my close friends call me on the phone, I barely answer.  I don't really eat much anymore, either.

I want to know if this is a normal part of the grieving process, or if it's something else."
578,Self body image at my lowest even after attaining a really good physique.,"It's almost everyday that I get complimented about my body for example, it's comments like ""Damn, you got big"" or people ask for advice and stuff like that, for once even girls notice me or I catch them looking, small stuff like that. But for me its a different story, I am constantly thinking about muscle loss and I stress out about not eating 3000 calories a day or a certain amount of protein. I have thoughts like if ""I don't work out today I will lose all my progress instantly"" Idk, I know its a stretch and I didn't really explain things clearly."
579,KETAMINE,"I've been doing Ketamine infusions for suicidal ideation for the last few months and starting to see good results from everything. I started my treatment when was really at the end of my ropes and it has given me the boost to get my life back on track again and I am very grateful that my doctors recommend it. I heard very little about it prior and was debating between ECT treatment and Ketamine and my doctors wanted me to try this first since I have a metal plate in my head from a prior surgery and wanted to avoid the risks from Electro Shock. I'm very happy that I did. Ever since I started, my mood has steadily increased by 60-70% and my anxiety has been almost non existent. I have nails again because stopped biting them, and feel good energy levels all around. I'm more productive than ever and my mood stays consistent now without the heavy lows. I can't believe that this is all happening and am grateful that I found this treatment. Let me know if you have questions about it :)"
580,I don't think I'm made to work. (In a traditional sense),"Today I had a job interview for a really upscale optometry office. It went a little too well, and it's looking like I'm going to get the job if I choose to accept it. The problem is that I don't want to spend 40 hours a week selling overpriced eyewear to rich assholes for $15 an hour. I don't want to work doing anything other than making clay pots and living in a cottage somewhere tending to my garden on the side. Why do I have to spend so much of my life doing useless jobs for an amount of money that is pennies in the eyes of those paying me? I'm literally so depressed thinking about it. I know that I'm so lucky to even be able to say that I'm employed at a place with good benefits at a ""fair"" wage, so why does it feel so absolutely disgusting?  I just want to be able to live my life peacefully, but I can't even tell other people about my dream without seeming like a ""lazy socialist"". It doesn't help that I'm only 21, also. Is it possible to truly just fuck off and live the free life that I want? Or is everyone pretty much just bound by the duties that capitalism imposes on us? (If we want to live a somewhat comfortable life, of course) I just feel like eventually, I'll be so tired of wasting my life on menial tasks that I'll just kill myself. I'm already almost there."
581,why am i like this? whats wrong with me?,"im a 21 yr old female, and ive been suffering from depression and anxiety for as long as i can remember. these past few months have been especially hell for me and i feel like im going crazy. why is it so hard for me to form connections with others? i get so sad when i see that my coworkers or classmates find a way to text and talk to each other outside of work or class. i always feel left out because im not able to actually form a bond with any of them. i hang out with them occasionally, and i try my best to keep in touch with them by texting them. but i never seem to get anywhere. &amp; ive never had a bf, i push away every guy that comes my way. so i know i tend to be a closed off person, i just really wish i weren’t. i wish i were funny, exciting, and cool but ive never been those things (as ive been told by multiple people throughout my life, but its true ive noticed it in myself) so i dont even know how to start. instead im socially awkward, weird, clueless, reserved, and extremely insecure. not to mention im a huge people pleaser. i have a few close friends and a family that cares for me, but i still feel so alone because i close myself off so much. i dont know why i do that. all i know is how to be nice to people and put on an act like everything is perfect. i even lie to people about somewhat serious matters to cover up how much of a loser i am (and i feel really guilty for this and its part of the reason i isolate myself from them, i plan on coming clean to my friends and family the next time i see them. i hate myself for even lying to them in the first place). &amp; im never ready to make jokes or find a way to have fun with my life. im too stiff and serious. if you ask anyone im sure they’ll tell you im a nice person. but thats all i am. its so hard for me to express myself, but thats because there’s nothing to express. all i do with my life is cry, think irrational thoughts, and daydream about being a person i wish i was. or every time i fail to make a new friend/bf i think about it for months or even years and i obsess over how much i wish i could be closer to them. im a junior in college (first gen, low income) and my grades are suffering immensely because i do this. i plan on withdrawing for the semester to work on myself by finding a better job, exercising, meditating, going to therapy, etc. but these are things ive tried doing when i was younger (including antidepressants) but nothing ever seemed to work so i gave up and im worried it wont work this time either. i dont even have a genuine interest in the major i chose. im just here because i dont know what else to do and i thought having a high paying job would allow me to do anything i wanted, which includes helping my family and the people around me. but i lost the motivation to even do that. i really don’t know how i can get out of this self-loathing mindset, it’s so hard to keep myself from thinking this way. i try my best to distract myself by going out and surrounding myself with people that i love. but it doesn’t help much since i never feel my true self, it feels like i’ll never know who i am. i feel so much guilt and shame because everyone around me thinks i dont like them or that im ungrateful/entitled for not being happy where i am or for not behaving the way i should. but in fact i just feel like i dont deserve any of it. i wish i could say im like this because of how my parents raised me and the trauma i went through. but i dont understand how my sister and i spent all our lives growing up under the same conditions (we’re a year apart) but she’s this fun, assertive, and confident person who is so sure of herself and has so much love and care to offer. i have no reason to be this way it seems like, im naturally pretty and book smart and all. but im 100% life dumb. i act as if i want to be invisible in this world, but i truly don’t. so what do i need to do to stop this? to be a normally functioning person? why am i not there? why am i such a fucked up person? i can sometimes be happy, but i always get brought down because of how shitty ive been. i feel useless. im such a wimp. im so broken. i dont understand how this happened, why did my life unravel in such a painful and complicated way? im sorry if this is a lot btw. this probably doesnt make any sense. but i heard it’s good to let everything out, especially for someone like me who has never done so."

584,Seeking an English speaking therapist in Munich (AOK),"Hello,

I'm relatively new to Munich from outside of Germany (&lt;2 years), and I've always had problems (i.e. extreme anxiety and other symptoms) that only got worse with being away from home, and then much worse with COVID.

The main problem is that I am not comfortable enough with German to do therapy in that language, and there seems to be this specific certificate -- that all the English therapists I've found don't seem to have (maybe because they're foreign?). 

If they don't have that certificate, I cannot pay for their sessions through my public insurance provider (AOK), and need to pay a pretty hefty sum (100€+ per session).

I've tried everything but all doctors I've found that are covered by AOK (and advertise therapy in English) never reply. Would be great if someone that knows more about this in Munich (or even Germany generally) could help.

Thank you"
585,Why did I hear a voice that wasn’t actually there speak to me?,I was in my kitchen with my dog and all of a sudden I heard someone whisper in my ear “You better get your ass out of my room” I was a little stressed because my dog was being abnormal but I won’t get into that. There wasn’t anybody around me that could’ve whispered it into my ear or any audio that could’ve been playing from a phone/TV. I started shaking after the voice. I have no idea what this could be because I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses but I do get very anxious in many situations. I’m scared that this will happen again.
586,Bipolar disorder ruining my relationships,"I (27f) am living with (27M) and our relationship is at it’s last straw. I absolutely am bipolar. I have dealt with severe symptoms since I was 24. I thought maybe I was just an angsty teenager because I felt a lack of control in my adolescence. But now I feel myself going through legitimate manic and depressive episodes since I’ve been in my mid twenties.
 I become so happy and euphoric for some time and then bam... I can end up on my bathroom floor in a puddle of tears over something minimal. I could write more impulsive behaviors but I will spare it. It’s just humiliating coming out of it. Then trying to justify my actions. It happens too frequent that I know something is wrong with me. 

I was told by doctors and therapists that I may have ADD and was prescribed adderall. I took it for a long time. But it’s done nothing but give me more energy. 
It’s time I find something to really help me. 
My boyfriend has supported my outbursts in so many caring ways. But after a year of it, he told me he doesn’t think we are right for each other. He feels hopeless because this is just who I am. I won’t change. I’ll just continue to have my episodes. 

But I don’t want to believe that. I’m so deeply hurt because there has to be hope.. with us and with myself. We love each other a lot and I want us to have a happy life together. I don’t WANT to break up. Even though it’s difficult. I just want to feel normal. 

This pandemic has caused me a roller coaster of emotions. I almost lost my mom to Covid while starting hormonal birth control. I was spiraling. But I think I damaged everything by obsessing so much about making things “better” ... 

Can people change with this? How does someone handle a person like myself? A tornado of a woman!
I’m at the point where I feel desperate for help and think I should try medications. Maybe a mood stabilizer and anti depressant?...

My family would be crushed if I ended my life, so I wouldn’t. But goddam...I want to get the fuck out of my head. Permanently. That’s the real unfortunate truth. It scares me. 
Any feedback would be awesome. I never wrote online like this before. Thank you."
587,I can’t get my work done,"This has been an on and off thing but whenever I try to get assignments done, I just can’t seem to do it. I’ve always had a problem with procrastination but now it’s to the point where if I force myself my brain fights back? Like I’ll feel extremely panicked and feel like I’ll have a mental breakdown, my thoughts don’t feel right (if that makes any sense) and I’ll get very fidgety when I panic. It doesn’t happen all the time but when it does it can last for awhile. I’m frustrated with myself."
588,This is too much...,"It sounds really weird but the way I usually ignored my mental health was by saying it didn’t exist. I even strongly defended that notion to my parents so they wouldn’t ask questions. I’ve never been the emotional guy, and my parents aren’t either.

There’s too much going on....I’m 19, in college with no job. I need to do something because I am losing it. I sleep all day because I don’t want to be awake. To put it short; I have no friends, no purpose, and feel like life is a waste of time, also look back on my past and am unhappy with several things. What are cheap options that might help?"
589,I think I might have a superiority complex because I'm insecure af X (,"I get weirdly insecure and possessive when someone copies my style or taste in music. I try very hard not be an asshole about it but I just can't help it. 
Feel like everyone needs to give me credits for introducing something (music or movies) to them. 
I know thats messed up on some level.
This was mild at first but now im so insecure this has become pretty intense, so much that I cant enjoy the things I used to love!!
Please give me some solution.
People of reddit I need your help!"
590,How do I boost my self esteem? And why do I crash every once in a while??,"This could also be in r/relationshipadvice but... 
my bf is super emotionally stable. However, I have some nights / evenings where I feel worthless or can’t match his standard / be on his level. I end up telling him how I feel, then feeling worse about myself for being childish. (I’m 27F and he’s 37M and we’re just over 1 year mark, known him only 2 months prior to making it official). 

What are some ways you boost your own self esteem? Is this depression that I’m feeling? Why does it only come once a month or every so often? (Not always related to my period cycle, although I’ve seen few that is related)."
591,New Member Who Just F-ing needs to Vent!,"Hi everyone, my name is Palletjack, feel free to call me that or call me by my first initial N. Anyway, where to I even begin? I am not diagnosed with any mental health issues per-say, I am on the Autism Spectrum, and I am going to be one of the billions of people on the Internet that thinks 2020 can burn in Hell.

Anyway, when COVID hit, my parents told me to go work for a local midwestern United States grocery chain. So I thought I would humor them and pick up and almost minimum wage job as a 23 year old. To put it lightly, I feel like when I leave this company next year (I hope to be done before my 1 year anniversary) I will need to invest in psychological counseling for the first time in my life, or even before then. I have been put through the ringer with this company. They rarely care about their employees, they are willing to push us all to the breaking point, and its all about their precious bottom line. Fine, I get it, you have to care for your bottom line. But consistently throughout this pandemic, they have pushed many employees, even long-term workers, to their breaking points.

The lack of care this company has for their workers is sickening. I understand the bottom line is important, but when employees mental health are pushed to their breaking point. We cannot function well. Supposedly the entire morning crew called out tomorrow, and I am going in for the morning, early afternoon. I am happy to do it, but I am nearing my limit. We do offer some sort of therapist I think, but I hear they break the sacred rule of therapy (privacy) and disclose some stuff back to HR. Which is why I worry if I were to ever seek it out. I have always had trust issues since I was a young kid, my counselor in grade school broke my trust a lot, so I am very uncomfortable with the idea of any psychological counseling.

I worry what my parents will think if I leave the job, they’ve been pressuring me towards the ministry my whole life, as have my extended family. To the point where I think they’re trying to break me emotionally so I will join the ministry, but ironically no religious seminary will accept you if you’re being coerced into it. Late last year, there was a push by them for me to become a non-ordained hospital chaplain. I was very much against the idea, and I am so glad now in retrospect as COVID.

Just wanna hear your ideas. Tonight I am in a good place, but there are days I just need a new way to approach the job. Mind you my parents are also egging me into going full-time, and I am not ready to “sell my soul” to this company. The company is also very weird about hiring full-time people. Plus, it’d only be about a $3 pay difference full-time compared to what I make now.

Maybe I just need a new way to approach life. I need to figure out how to live life as me, and not let people control my life like a puppet."
592,What is wrong with me?,"I have been struggling big time over the last several months during the pandemic. I'm 30-years-old, living in a big city and working a professional job at a big company. My job is demanding, pays well, and my role is highly analytical. I've always loved math and getting into technical details. However since COVID began and I started working from home, I've been noticing mental decline in a lot of areas. 

Suddenly everything feels 10x harder. What would have been a more straight-forward task last year, now requires me to do mental summersaults. I find it especially anxiety-provoking to try to plan tasks. My meetings with colleagues or clients are awkward, where I feel I'm constantly exposing my lack of understanding and lack of intellect. After a certain point in the day it's almost impossible to concentrate on the task at hand, with my mind jumping from one thing to the other, preventing me from getting anything done in a reasonable amount of time. I feel like all my colleagues and clients think I’m completely inadequate, and they wouldn’t be wrong either. It takes so much longer to process information. I also find it hard to follow others’ trains of thought, and when I do understand I have a hard time responding with something meaningful or of value. It takes me a long time to really get started on a task and when I do I move very slowly. My brain feels like it’s lost in a fog and that it’s impossible to form a coherent thought or engage in productive discussions.

I often feel so struck by anxiety over thinking I'm not capable or intelligent enough to complete the task at hand that I often gravitate to biting my fingers to cope. I've been a lifelong nail biter (since the age of 5-ish) and to paint a picture of what my work day would literally look like if you were a fly on the wall: I'm seated at my desk, staring at my monitor while I anxiously bite my nails and cuticles, sometimes until my fingers bleed. The other hand remains on the keyboard, not typing. On any given day I'm likely to have a bandaid on one sometimes two fingers. It sometimes feels as if my front teeth are growing weak from gnawing on them so frequently.

This has been going on for a couple of months now and I feel like at a breaking point. I don’t know what it is I’m experiencing and I don’t know what’s caused this. I was leading a project during the summer months that caused me to feel incredibly stressed (I was working evenings and weekends and literally crying before calls with clients). I have a few unhealthy habits that might contribute to this: I smoke weed on Friday evenings, average about 5 hours of sleep per night, and don’t have the best diet — not sure to what extent they are causing me to feel this way.

Does anyone have a clue as to what is wrong with me?"
593,Does this sound like PTSD,"Hello! I am a 20 year old female. I won’t go into too much detail about these situations but recently (about four months ago) I have been overwhelmed by thoughts and feelings about things that have happened in my life. 
My parents divorced when I was 4 and it was a very nasty divorce, and I was the subject of a nasty custody battle. My dad won custody of me and he tortured me mentally until I turned 16, when my mom won custody of me. I won’t go into detail about my dad and the things he did because I don’t know how. I feel like there’s not any way I could possibly describe it to do it justice. I feel mentally incapable of describing it. 
I definitely have always been affected by these events, but it hasn’t been until recently that I have been bothered by a constant awareness of it, like I can hear my dad’s voice, I can feel the anxiety of being chased by him, I just feel the pain weighing on my chest the way it did when I knew he’d be picking me up from school. I thought those feelings of dread were gone and I don’t know why I am just now bothered by these memories, 4 years after being released from him. Does this sound like “flashbacks?” 
I have also been experiencing constant awareness and memories of being raped three years ago. I haven’t experienced these symptoms until recently. I am just always thinking about it, constantly. I don’t dream about these traumas, just always thinking about them. 
On top of the painful memories, I feel completely dead inside. I feel brain damaged. I was a 4.0 student and am failing everything I haven’t dropped out of. I’m not actively suicidal but I do wish I was dead. I don’t know how to cope or move on from this. Thank you for reading!"
594,When should I go in to the hospital??,"Hey sorry if this post is a little weird, im new to reddit but I really need help. 
Since around last October ish (a little over a year now) I've been extremely depressed, and on and off suicidal. But lately its been the worst its ever been.
ANYWAYSS, this last summer I started to hear like voices in my head. I heard them around once a week up until the middle of September ish. They were super quick, it was like walking into a crowed room where everyone was talking at once, but then immediately walking out. I havnt heard them for a while now but idk if thats something to be concerned about yk?
And I dont know how to bring up being depressed to my mom, let alone being super suicidal, cause last time I was suicidal I was 12/13 , in 7th grade, and my dad had seen my texts to my friends that I was depressed/ suicidal. So he showed my mom them, and they screamed at me for it, telling me they ""had enough evidence to keep me in a mental hospital for the rest of my life"" 
And the last time I was suicidal, was 7th grade, and I attempted then ( I took pills at school and sat in the bathroom, but it didn't work, I woke up at the end of the day super drowsy and shi and no one ever found out) 

And this time is worse than then and im scared ill do somthing and idk if I should go in cause of covid, and I feel like my family won't take me serious if I tell them, and honestly I don't know how I would tell them, cause I don't have a good relationship with them. 

( I'm 16 and live in WA I know the laws are different for minors shit)
But is there any way to go to a hospital without your family knowing anything? Or is there anyway to go to the hospital without your family getting involved? Or somthing like that? Or something where they would be the least amount involved possible? Honestly anything helps


(( also no, im not going to be useing the hotline, my mom records my phone calls and has copys of all my texts, even this is lowkey risky))"
595,Self harm,"Lately my urges to self harm have been very strong. I haven't self harmed in 10 years.. but I feel like nothing else will provide release right now. I've tried drinking, smoking weed, eating, venting, meditating.. I just don't want to wake up to my reality anymore and I don't know what to do about it."
596,I think I'm a narcissist,"I'm 20f, and i think im a narcissist.

I have no empathy towards anyone, no matter who they are or what role they have in my life. 

I have no guilt or shame in anything i do, even if it's something like hurting other people or playing with their emotions.  Same thing goes with grief. I've had all my grand parents die, 2 or 3 other people who were apart of my life die, and i feel nothing towards it. 

I think i was upset about their deaths, but more because of the life they lived? 
I don't care that they are dead. It doesn't make a difference to me. 

I lie about many things for no reason at all. I live a double life, that involves many fake and elaborate plots and trauma. Some of it is based off of my real trauma, but a lot of it is fake.  I don't know why exactly i lie about it. I don't think I'm doing it for attention, but then why would I do it in the first place?

I can't love either. 
Never had a crush, first love, romantic or platonic.
Never had a celebrity crush, or anything like that.
I've been in a few relationships, the longest lasting a year, and it ended about a month ago now. I felt nothing the entire time. We broke up because he moved, and that was the only issue we had. I feel nothing about the break up. Its like it never happened in the first place.
With all the people I've dated, all of it was because they could give me attention. Not one person I've dated have complained about me being toxic or saying that i was cold. 

I am an amazing actor, and i fake feelings towards them until they either ask me out or they stop giving me a vibe.
I've studied behavior for years now, not for the social cues, but for how people act towards caring other people and loving them. 


The only exception to the rule is that none of this applies to animals or plants. 
I have an EXTREME bond with plants, often giving them names and being very sad and upset when they die. 
I don't know what's wrong with me. Please do not hate on me, although it won't matter to me. I literally don't care. 
I'm asking because i know this isn't normal, and I'm curious if anyone might understand why I'm like this. :)"
597,Been getting somewhat better,"I’ve only felt the need to take my life twice this week, and see some purpose on life for once. I’ve just been trying to push myself one day at a time. 

The only thing that’s really changed is that before I go to bed, I simply thank god for what I have. Might not work for everyone but I see something worth living for now. Friends and family.

I owe them so much, and I’ll be damned before I leave them without paying my debts first, which is just to be there for them. I feel content and, dare I say, happy."
598,"With DID, how often does an alter take over?","I saw a Tiktok (ik how this sounds. I'm not self diagnosing)  where this woman was doing a pic of a peraon at a therapist. Anyway. Can did be triggered by trauma and puberty? Like you had bad things happen then you hit puberty and it really starts to flourish? Also can an alter be in control for a long time? So much that there are 2 to 3 yrs that you only remember snippets of no matter how hard you try? And that its not bad all the time then out of nowhere your mental health plummets and its like your not even in control your just slicing open ur skin to see the blood and in the back of your head you know you shouldnt do this but you don't care and do it anyway?


My mom has mentioned therapy to deal with some depression and anxiety issues (she has no ide the extent of it) and I just thought that maybe if I ever do go that I should ask about some things. 


Tl/dr: idek what to put here. Go back and read it. I'm confused even writimg this"
599,Anyone else here dealing with pseudo-seizures?,"For those unaware a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure, also called a pseudo-seizure, is a seizure brought on by mental instead of physical stimuli, while being every bit as real and unavoidable as your typical seizure. At the end of my post are two articles going into more detail. Let me explain how it works for me.

I suffer from depression and anxiety, and I have PTSD from a mentally abusive, narcissistic father. I'm 22 and am losing my hair from the stress and from several instances of shock I've experienced these last 6 months. I recently started taking an adrenal support supplement because my body doesn't correctly regulate my adrenaline anymore. Without it I'm in a constant state of increased tension where every problem I face feels a hundred times worse than reality (even with it this can be the case, but things are typically easier to manage nonetheless). Trying to clean my room or go buy groceries often would be enough to literally bring me to my knees and trigger a pseudo-seizure, as would other sources of stress like family arguments or messing something up at my job (retail).

It's not like the classic hollywood-ized seizure, where you drop where you stand and flail dramatically, though from what I've read it's still more extreme than normal epilepsy. I have a surprising amount of mental control over the process as well. It starts with a crash or drop in my mood (I'm guessing anyone with intermittent depression will understand what I mean there), and it then eventually starts to manifest physically. My teeth will chatter and my muscles will tense. When I can't hold it off anymore it usually starts in my right arm, where my hand will clench and my arm convulse. Sometimes that's all it is, and I can keep from going further.

When I go into a full-on seizure, both arms and legs tense up, and I usually sink slowly to the ground. I don't sit in a chair or lay on the bed for obvious reasons, thankfully my room is carpeted. From there it's sometimes just a matter of all my muscles clenching, but at it's worse I will lose some control and my arms, legs, and back will twitch, convulse, and flail. It can be especially bad in my shoulders, neck and face. I have to pay careful attention to my breathing otherwise my throat clenches shut.

They usually last 15-45 minutes. They're not constant, but come and go in waves. In just a few seconds I go from full-body clench to limp, catching my breath and waiting for the next episode, usually within minutes.

I didn't start experiencing these overnight, nor from birth. It started a few years ago, and has only been what I just described for a year at most, with the intensity increasing as time goes on. At first it was more like a panic attack, where I'd lay curled on the floor freaking out about what's happening to my head. That or I thought it was only depression. Now, I'm not particularly frightened by these episodes anymore, just frustrated. When I get home from a long day at work I want to do something I enjoy and relax, not get a full-body workout on my bedroom floor in the most stressful way possible. Even when it's over my mood is usually so down I can't enjoy anything anyway and I just watch YouTube in bed.

As for what I said about mental control, I can often tell hours beforehand it's coming. I'll be at work and I'll just realize, ""yeah, it's going to be one of those days."" My arm will lock up sometimes, my teeth chatter a bit when I forget to clench my jaw, but I can keep ringing up customers with them just thinking I'm in a bad mood; I hide all of this pretty well and can keep pretty good control over it to keep that paycheck coming in. When I get home, though, all bets are off. I'm tired and have no reason to spend the energy fighting it. It's better to just have it and be done, even though it's so physically taxing.

Before I read the below articles, I didn't know this was medically recognized thing, or that it had a name. For myself it has become commonplace. I can go days without thinking of it or experiencing it, and I can go days in a row of having a seizure every night and my mood not coming back up the next morning. Sometimes I'm at peace with it, other times I hate myself and everything about my life, which I'm sure is more the depression side of things than anything else.

I'm doing a few things to alleviate the problem. The adrenal support is the most important, but also my diet has a major impact on my mental state. Fast food and processed food completely screws me over and sends me into a spiral of depression and despair, literally. Eating cleaner, taking vitamin supplements and my adrenal support go a very, very long way towards making life livable and enjoyable. I think that if I could get into the habit of exercising and getting more sun that would help too, but with how tired I get from work I don't know when that will happen.

With that short novel written, tell me: do any of you experience anything similar? Have you ever heard of this before? And if you do have it, please tell me what it's like for you, since it's not something everyone will experience in the same way. I want to know what other's are experiencing and how they cope. I hope the articles below and my own insight on how to fight it can help you as well.

601,I Don’t Know What to Say to my Doctor,"Hey guys. I’m really, really struggling at the minute. I don’t get out of bed unless it’s for necessities such as eating and peeing. I was prescribed meds a month ago and they haven’t worked. I have a phone call appointment (covid) on the 7th. My problem is, when I spoke to my doctor a month ago,  I was so relieved to be doing so that I simply asked for my previous medication. But I don’t think that’s what I need anymore. And I’m scared. 

I have ZERO motivation. For anything. I don’t leave the house. I have OCD rituals that I can’t stop doing. If I’m home alone I get extremely paranoid and put something against my hallway door, as if to protect myself from a non existent predator in my house. I know it’s ridiculous but I can’t stop. I can’t go into supermarkets because the lights are so bright, the noises are so loud and I can’t stand being around people when I feel like I’m about to break. I don’t sleep at night, only the afternoon, and I have nightmares regularly. I am coping somehow, I’m not completely broken. But I don’t know what the fuck to say to my doctor. I’m scared. I just want to cope. Any advice is welcome."
602,HELP!!! MY BOYFRIEND IS SUICIDAL AND I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO,Hi guys! I need help with this situation I am in. I have dating my Boyfriend for about ten months and five months into the relationship he literally just lost every single he had to him financially. I am honestly drained on what else to do. About a month ago he recently started showing signs of being suicidal. He has always said that he is never scared of dying since I met him. I truly believe that he is suicidal but everytime he denies it because he knows how sad I get when he says stuff like that. We are in a long distance relationship so I haven’t really met his family. He is not a family person too. He is more of a loner and doesn’t really have friends. He is the sweetest guy and extroverted person I know. I have tried to helps him in anyway I can but I think this is beyond me. I don’t know who else to reach out too about this. I have tried to convince him to go to therapy but totally doesn’t want too. The worst is I don’t live with him so this makes it scarier. I don’t know what to do???? Please I need suggestions on how to help.
603,Am I being delusional about this or could I potentially be autistic?,"I’ve always had issues socially along with other mental health concerns such as ticks and severe anxiety. Besides GAD I’ve never had anything diagnosed, but after googling nearly all of my symptoms lineup with autism perfectly. Even one of my close friends who is on the spectrum said it sounds like I very well could be and that I should talk to a professional. I brought it up to my mom and she said it’s probably just anxiety, and that she had me tested when I was a baby so I can’t be. Is it still possible that I could potential he have autism though? I only bring this up because I’ve been wanting some form of a diagnosis and this lined up so well that it really felt like a relief to some degree."
604,Please help me,
605,How do I learn to shut the fuck up and stop being so annoying,"When I was younger my parents used to tell our guests/babysitters that if I ever got too annoying that it was alright to tell me to leave. And I know they honestly didn't intend for that to be mean or anything just an honest if you need a break from our child just let them know. But to me it was just them calling me annoying and as I grow up (I'm 20 now) i feel like I'm just so goddamn annoying to everyone. I ask too many questions about how things work, or asking someone if I'm doing x part of the job right because Im so afraid of messing up that I have to have a second opinion. I just want to feel important and validated and confident and I just never am, and I feel like I can only get that from others. How do I stop? At this point I just want to be done trying to figure out exactly how some small detail works because I know that I just annoy the fuck out of everyone. I have too many thoughts I think in the moment alot of the time so I end up either over complicating sentences/questions or I end up just reasking the whole thing multiple times in slightly different ways. I feel like I push people away, maybe because of this and I'm just so alone. Like how is it that every time I'm with 2 other people I end up third wheeling the entire time? 
All I want is to stop bothering people and I just don't know how. I want to try and over achieve on projects and try and find new ways to make things better or more efficient but I feel like I just waste everyone's time. 
I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm about to loose it. Been thinking about just killing myself tonight because I know I'm never going to get better and Im done having to live through all the pointlesness and meaninglesness of life and just get it over. Move on. Who knows where I'll go after. Maybe nothing happens after death and you just stop existing. Sometimes I wonder if there is a heaven or a hell and sometimes I think hey I didn't live an exceptional life but I tried to be nice to everyone so maybe I'll make it. But maybe I won't and I think I'm ok with that because I know I wouldn't be the only person in hell ya know. Maybe I won't do anything and I'll just wake up tomorrow and go back to my job so I can keep annoying my co workers. Who knows. 

Idk if you've got any thoughts just hit me. I just want to know how to keep to myself ig. I'm stuck at home now for the next 2 weeks because my fiance has covid. Fuck my life. 

I'm sorry that probably isn't coherent I'm just typing as thoughts come ig. If anyone cares I have BPD, depression, anxiety, adhd. I'm on some medication for it and it helps keep me productive but that's about it. Idk

607,With DID how long does an alter take over? And how often?,"Just as an fyi I'm not swlf diagnosing. I'm gonna start seeing a therapist soon and I just came across something today and I thought id just asked y'all then brimg it up with them. 

Anyway.

Can did be trigfered by puberty? Like you had bad things happen when you were younger thwn puberty hit an it was all like boom here ya go? Also how long does it last? Can an alter take over intermittently frequently and cause you not to remember a large portion of 2 to 3 yrs no matter how hard you try ( there was a pretty traumatic event and my depression hit an alltime low and I made quite a few attempts). Can it be pretty lowkey for a while until one day it takes over completely an you slice your skin to see the blood and you want to stop bc you shouldnt do this but you cant stop until you have to go to work so time is cut short? And your eating disorder that youve recovered from (for the most part) made a sudden appearance the same time? Maybe?

Tl/dr: read it. I cant shorten it."
608,I’m sorry,"Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this but I’m new to reddit (I took over my bfs page) and I really just need to get this off my chest so he suggested this . I’m a 26 f and I know this year has been really bad for some people but even worse for us who have underlining mental health problems . I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or if I just need to know I’m not alone but I am at my breaking point . This year , I have lost my job , I was a cna in a nursing home who had an outbreak of covid and I lost almost all of my residents on my hall . I had been working with the same people for multiple years so that really hurt me . Now I’m without a job and I don’t have a family to be with for the holidays , my residents were my family . I have to go to food banks and anything else because I can’t afford anything anymore without my paycheck . I was broken up with by a guy i really liked who I had been with for about 6 months , lost my dog , my bestfriend and I got separated due to the pandemic and my great uncle passed away due to COVID last week . I already take medication for bipolar and my mood swings have been even worse lately and I feel so close to a full blown breakdown . I don’t want to be admitted again because I was in a mental hospital for 2 weeks in February and now without a job , I don’t have insurance . There has been other issues but those are just the basics that I think about daily . Please just pray for me if you’re into that thing , if not just send me good vibes . I’m so lost and I don’t know what else to do ."
609,There's something wrong with me. I feel like I'm going crazy all my life.,"I've always felt different from everyone else. My brain takes me to some scary places and I need help but my doctor doesn't seem to take things seriously. Important stuff in bold at bottom.  

A little backstory... I grew up in a household with an alcoholic father. He was prone to verbal abuse, mostly towards my mom but I've caught some of it. As a result my mother was always pretty emotionally distant. I was never hugged as a child. I was never told I was loved. I actually don't have many memories from back then and most of them involve incidents with my drunk dad. But they never separated and still to this day my Dad binges once in a while and it isn't pretty. My mom ignores it.   

I coped by overeating and by the time I hit elementary school I was obese. I was made fun of every day. Kids stole my stuff, threw stuff at me. It continued into high school when I was the weird obese goth girl. My only escape was heavy metal, food and then eventually self-harm. I ended up dropping out of high school at 16 because my depression became so bad and my mom took me to the doctor where I was given antidepressants for the first time. I didn't want to take them and my mom got really upset with me over that.  

**I was coping okay, just kind of coasting through life by spending it online playing video games and working. I had a dog that had been with me 14 years and saw me through an abusive relationship. He passed very suddenly and traumatically last April and I lost it. I had a complete breakdown, was placed on a suicide watch and was even taken out of work for a few weeks. I really lost it. I went from 265 lbs to 200 lb in just a few months. I couldn't eat, could barely get out of bed but at the same time couldn't sleep. I haven't really been the same since then. It's gotten much worse.**  

**I'm a little afraid to put my ""symptoms"" out there but I need help. I'm honestly uncomfortable with myself.**  

* **I have mood-swings that leave me exhausted and scared. There are times where I'm so hyper that it's overwhelming. I can't stop talking, I can't sit still and my sleep gets all messed up because I can't turn my brain off and I'm just not tired so I stay up all night. And then there's the complete opposite where I literally can't function as a human and stay in bed for days. I don't eat, don't shower, just wish I didn't exist. I write suicide notes in my head and lie in the dark with the blinds closed and just sleep. It's like this emptiness and hopelessness. This deep, aching pain in my chest. I have no energy so I just sleep.**
* **I get obsessed with things. I get onto a subject and can't let it go. I will research endlessly, sometimes staying on the same subject for days. I'll exhaust myself trying to learn absolutely everything I can about whatever it is.**
* **I write lists of things (shopping list for example) but if I make the tiniest mistake I have to redo it. Sometimes I end up with 10 copies of the same list because I've changed my mind on something or I wrote something too messy and I don't like it. It has to be right or I can't leave it alone.**
* **I am very impulsive. If there's something I want, the anxiety drives me absolutely crazy until I get it. I can't wait, even if I don't have the money. I've put myself into debt (21k) by doing this. I know I don't need these things but the anxiety I get from not buying it is terrible. It's like this tight feeling in my chest. It feels like panic if I don't buy it. It's so fucked up.**

**There's more but I honestly don't know what's relevant and what isn't. Everything is so jumbled in my head and most of the time I just feel like a robot stumbling through life. I'm pretty sure everyone would be better off without me. I would be better off without me at this point. My brain is scary.**"
610,Diagnosed adhd. I feel like something just cranked my energy and emotion up 90%. Does anybody else experience this and what is it.," Sorry for typos, I'm on mobile and I'm trying to get these words out as fast as I can.

I feel really weird right now. I feel like there's lightning in my blood rn. I feel like the part of my brain that controls what I do is sleeping. I'm very stressed over an assignment right now. I drank some coffee. I did eat alot of sugar today but not that much more than i do usually. I took my meds, and found out my doctor accidentally wrote the wrong prescription but I realized only after I'd taken it. (I take adderall, they gave me Ritalin. I don't think there's many differences or side effects to taking the other accidentally? And it has the same warnings against caffiene as adderall but im always ok if i drink just a little coffee while im on adderall. So I'm not denying the possibility, but I honestly don't think the medication switch up is what's causing me to feel bad and weird right now.)

I feel like this occasionally even when I forget to take my (regular)meds and don't drink coffee. It's a very ""buzzy"", ""twitchy"" feeling if that makes sense. I feel very impulsive, like I could punch myself in the face at any second. I feel like I need to do something right now but no matter what I do, nothing will satisfy that 'itch' to do *something*. 

I started watching a video for my assignment, it seemed unbearably slow so put it on  2x speed. They they started talking abt some scene from a movie abt a guy who said he had the same broom for 17 years or smth. Then he goes on to say that the handle was replaced 9 times and the broom head was replaced 14 times or smth like that. 
It related to the assignment (the one im anxious about) and it gave me a little inspiration for what to write about. That made my anxiety lessen a little bit. I also thought it was pretty funny, and a clever metaphor for humans, whose cells replace every couple years or so. Because of those couple reasons, I started to tear up @ the video. I really don't understand why I did that. That's when I realized something isn't right with me right now.

I also feel like my hearts beating p fast but I took my bpm on my phone (galaxy S7 has bpm functionality, seems accurate, but I'm no doctor, so I wouldn't be able to say). My bpm was 79, so pretty average, maybe the tinyist bit high.

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense I just had to mind vomit. I probably just had too much sugar or something. For some reason whenever I feel like this something in my brain tells me ""you are manic. you are manic"" But maybe I am misunderstanding what manic is/means. I might even be faking this I don't know"
611,"Extremely suicidal girlfriend, and I'm stuck.","I don't know how to start, I'm so stuck. So extremely stuck. She is a very happy person, but she says she gets confused and she just feels the need to kill or harm herself. She says she doesn't know why or she might be hiding one but she had tried to get help. She has tried multiple medications and therapists about 10 of them. They've been psychoanalytical of her and they have give her a few options.

Those three are:
 ECT Shock therapy
A medically induced coma for almost two weeks
A extract from ketamine meant for humans to help with severe depression.

I want to get her help as soon as possible but we are in two different states. Her parents will hate me because they denied all three of those treatments. They blame her after her suicide attempts and pin her as a mark on their life, they don't comfort her, they just attack her saying that she can do it but not while she lives with them.

She can't make a promise she won't do it and I'm scared for her so much. I can't do anything for another year or two but I want to save as much as possible and get her the treatment they tried to give her.

I love her with all my heart and I can't stand all of her suffering. I just need some help to delay anything, distract her, give her sources for help. I'm in MA, and I know that is one of the best places but I need her to be here with me. Any help will help me so much.

I've posted this in r/SuicideWatch as well, I need as much help as possible."
612,I don’t really know what to do,"(Just before you start reading I want to inform you that this does swear, so if you are sensitive to that please don’t read)

I guess I’ll just start....... I’m living with my dad at the moment who has been physically and mentally abusive to me ever since I was little,I was basically always was at my moms house.
      When I was thirteen I moved with my mom to a different state( I’m 16 now) and left my dad, only seeing him for the summer and Christmas.
      During this time from 7th grade on I started using drugs due to the fact that I wanted a good dad like everybody else, it started with drinking, then weed, then pills etc. My mom got worried and thought it would be a good idea to send me back to my dads to live with him so I can make a actual relationship with him, but he hasn’t changed anything from when I was little, always thinking I’m this dumb ass kid, calls me a “fucking mother fucker”, I can’t talk to him without him bringing up how dumb I am and how unsuccessful I will be in life( I plan on being a musician), it’s been stressing me out to the point  to where I needed something to help me not go insane.
      So not I’m sitting here a 16 year old fucking Xanax addict living in a house that doesn’t feel like mine, and not knowing where I am going with life..."
613,need advice,"I’ve done a few really really horrible things in my past. Like objectively horrible. I can’t forgive myself for them, nor do I deserve forgiveness or pity. There’s no good justification for what I did. I feel like a hypocrite because people think I’m a good, sweet person, but I have these past actions that haunt me. I don’t deserve good things in life. My empathy has developed since then though, so I do truly regret what I did as a teenager. I would give everything to undo those things. I’ve gone through some minor abuse/neglect and sexual trauma and some physical &amp; mental health problems, so maybe that was my karma for being a horrible person before?? Maybe the world tried to balance out the wrong that I did?? Where I’m really torn is I want to commit suicide so badly because I can’t live with what I did. But I’m worried that I’d be an even worse person for doing that because my mom would be crushed. I deserve to suffer for what I did, but I also want to kill myself. Should I just call it even with the world since I went through trauma after/while causing harm and try to move on with my life and do better in the future? Is it better for me to suffer and stay around for my mom, or to just leave the world and end my suffering and make sure I never do anything bad again by being gone? Idk if making my mom so upset by committing suicide would be forgivable."
614,People who do this make me so angry,People who fake mental illnesses like depression and anxiety make me so angry since I actually have both of those disorders. It is so obvious when people fake it yet people believe them and actually feel bad for them when they act perfectly normal. I get some people have depression and anxiety and don't act like it but when they don't act like it they don't say every 5 seconds how they have it. Depression and anxiety are making me feel like I don't want to do anything at all and commit suicide yet people really think they are cool just because they say they have it even though it can cause thousands of deaths every year I just can't express how fucking stupid this is if you do this please stop it makes people who actually suffer feel absolutely horrible

617,Help..,"This may or may not be sensitive topic for some

For most my life now I've felt worthless, pretty much like a waste of space to anyone around me. No matter what I do I think things like the following:
You're worthless just die already
You don't matter to anyone
Everyone is better off without you 
You make people depressed with your feelings 
 That's just a few, most of my life I have been put aside by my stepfather not to play with my sisters when we were kids
 My real dad left before I was even born and my mother always sides with my step-dad. He was mean, abusive, and hated me for not being his kid. Most my life no one has chosen me they've merely have been stuck with me. So often I don't choose me. I hate myself I hate who I am who I am going to become I hate it all and the thought of death gives me so much comfort because it feels lile finally something chooses me and then ill be happy. 
I don't want to die. I love my sisters and my brothers and my mom. But I can't help but feel like they are less burdened with worrying about if I'm okay or not. 
Someone please help me"
618,I accepted plans that made me vomit from anxiety before I left yet still went anyway,"I haven’t seen a sole this entire UK lockdown but recently got back into contact with an old friend who I haven’t seen in years. I’ve also had this underlying crush on them for years which definitely did not help the anxiety. 

The other day they asked if I wanted to hang, have some drinks and play some games in the evening before they moved home and my biggest achievement was just saying fuck it, “yes!”. I’d cancelled so many times this past year out of fear, and despite being in the biggest rut I’ve had in months, I just thought “you can’t say no”.

Before leaving, I was the most anxious I can recall feeling in forever. I get this gag reflex to anxiety and it got so bad I physically vomited whilst getting ready, yet I washed up, finished getting ready and went anyway!!!!

We had an amazing time, talked openly about anything and everything including how close I was to cancelling lol and truly deepened our friendship. I was a nervous wreck half the time I was there but there is zero regret and I’ve been on this joyous productive buzz ever since! 

It’s honestly the proudest I’ve felt for myself in years and the spontaneity of my decision to just go, despite my body telling me to “RUN” shocks me still! I am truly overjoyed with myself."
619,does anyone have oppositionally defiant disorder???,"I need advice/help, because i was diagnosed with ODD at 16 or so maybe 15. also have orher issues but i need to know about ODD. when i was diagnosed no one told me about it or what it really does to you. im terrified of psychs and dont want to go back yet. i will but not yet. anyways, i learned the other day through a podcast that people with this disorder can be severely restricted in life. like in school kids with it have to go to special classes and stuff and have stuff like that. someone who knows or has it please explain to me what it is and how it has affected your/a loved ones life. i really need help and need to know what may be going on before i go back to the docs so i can feel more comfortable and possibly stand up for myself or change bad docs and stuff."
620,I can’t tell anyone this so can some stranger on the internet help me so I don’t feel as ashamed? It is greatly appreciated,"I have nightmares where the metal thing in the “the real cost” commercial keeps killing my only friend (it’s beyond a friendship, he’s practically my father figure). I wake up crying and breathing heavily. I also end up too scared and ashamed to get out of bed until around 10am. I also feel empty and embarrassed all the time, I’m also easy to scare. I have an excessive hatred towards humanity and fear of abandonment. People say I can’t like an adult in public. I agree with that, however I sleep with a stuffed animal and cry when no ones around. I take hour long showers multiple times a day because I’m scared that bad things will happen if I don’t. I feel like someone’s out to get me so I sleep with a knife. I’m 14 and can’t tell anyone about any of this because I’m too embarrassed and I know that anyone I tell won’t see me the same way. I don’t know you, odds are I never will. You have no reason to answer but it would be appreciated if you do. Does anyone know what is wrong with me and how I can change?"
621,Is this normal??,"I'm sorry if this is posted wrong, this is my first post on Reddit basically 

I am 17 and I'm currently going to therapy for adhd/depression. Just in case it could be relevant. 

I'm making this post bc I'm wondering if its normal to like... Act like different people at different times, especially fictional characters? Idk how to really explain it, but when I get super attached to a character who I can really relate to, like we share a very similar past or personality, they really just,,, stick with me. And basically its like, my brain takes turns becoming these characters. I guess it makes me feel happy about myself in a way, being all these characters that I enjoy, bc my self-esteem has never been good. I don't really like my real self. 

I started doing it years ago back in middle school, so I was probably like 11 at the time. I used to get bullied pretty badly back then. I had a huge creepypasta phase, and I remember I would act like all the different characters \[your average 11 year olds sugar-coated depiction of them, at least\]. I assume I only really grew so attached to the characters bc I was angry at the bullying I received and I wanted ""revenge"" or whatever. So the characters stories were pretty appealing to me at the time. 

I also had a phase right after that where I was convinced that I was a cat/werewolf. I would constantly walk/run on all fours, I used to get into fights and bite others, half my vocabulary at the time was exclusively animal noises... Pretty embarrassing stuff. Every other kid in the entire school basically knew me as ""dog girl"" till we moved to a different state.

I thought I got over all of that stuff and stopped doing it, but I recently realized that I haven't, I've just been picking up the personalities of characters more similar to how I actually am. So you know, I dont think I'm a cat anymore for the most part. I'm not sure if this is like a comfort thing or what, I didn't have any friends growing up n my life at home has always been shit so I guess it would make sense. And becoming someone I actually like *does* make me feel a bit better ab myself... 

I'm curious if anybody else has/is going through something like this? Or Is it just me?"
622,Why cant I just move on with my day after eating?,"Every time I consume food, I feel an overwhelming sense of guilt. Some days a cracker can leave me crying for an hour. I've done food trackers and logs, but I can't find a pattern related to quantity nor items ingested. Food just makes me feel sad, like my body is punishing itself for enjoying something. Even though I'm aware food is needed for survival, food just makes me feel so guilty.
It is an every day thing for me, and a little concerning to my partner and family. 
Has anyone else experienced this, or have an idea of some coping skills they could suggest for me to work with? I feel so lost.

623,TW/ self harm/ I lost my record for over a year of being clean.,"Ive had a huge self harm issue for most of my life. I have been clean for all of 2020 &amp; half of 2019- and tonight I lost that record. I feel like my whole world is shattering underneath my feet. I feel scared for what this may mean, as after I cut myself I had that initial feeling of relief. Now after doing it I just feel so pathetic &amp; stupid. I thought I was doing better. But I’m not. I’ve had a lot of mental breakdowns lately, I’m so burnt out &amp; just can’t stop thinking so negatively. I’m so sad. I’m mad at myself. I’m scared to tell my therapist idk why. Can someone send me an internet hug 😭😭😭😭😭"
624,I just need to put my thoughts down for someone to see,"I have extreme addictive tendencies and multiple drug addictions I'm currently working through. I also think that I have anxiety and / or depression but I'm not sure because I refuse to tell anybody close to me about any of it. I know that's probably the worst thing I could be doing right now, but for the past 2 nights I thought I had found the solution to all my problems. a friend I knew from about 3 years ago got in touch needing help getting through a breakup. she didn't want her relationship to end and she still says she completely loves her ex. she said she just needed someone to listen to her, which I was willing to do. now is probably a good time to mention that I also feel unable to trust people, but I have no idea why. anyway, I stayed up with her on facetime until 5:00 A.M. two nights in a row, and in that tiny span of a about 10 hours we took turns venting to each other about anything and everything. I'm sure it was partly because of drug use at the time and every waking moment since then, but I became completely addicted to this girl. it was the most magical experience I've ever had, spilling my heart out to another broken soul. she is the only other human on this planet that I can confide in with complete honesty. but tonight she didn't want to talk. I know it's awful to be so dependent on a single person, especially since I haven't spoken to her in person in years. but I could tell from the second she started talking that we were fighting the same demons. I feel as though I need her to survive now. right now as I'm typing this I am shaking so bad at the thought of having to once again shut everything inside my head and not having the comfort of knowing someone personally going through the same experience. I want this girl to be mine forever, I want to help her with all her problems and hold her close to me and for both of us to know that everything will be okay. but like I said she cannot move on from her ex, which I understand. but I now feel like if I can't have this anymore, there's no point to life anymore. I won't commit suicide, but suicide and this girl are all I can think about since 9:36 P.M. tonight when she said she didn't want to talk tonight. I would never want to be selfish with another person, and I of course want only the best for her. but I am just lost right now, my whole body is shaking thinking about the torture that lays ahead for what feels like eternity. I know all these feelings are temporary but I just needed to get this off my chest. if for some reason you read this whole thing, I just want to personally thank you for your time."

626,[SERIOUS] What is wrong with my brain?... A battle between my conscious and subconscious... will I lose it?...,"I was born in a poor household; bad education, I was bad at most things myself, socially awkward too, but I was good at one thing and one thing alone, logic.

As you might imagine, my work field is logic, well automation, I convert actions, into logical patterns; yet I never went to college, I was too poor for that.

But logic really takes me over, it's the single defining factor.

Sleeping is very destructive for me because dreams don't make sense, I lucid, sleep paralysis, and even get post sleep hallucinations, extremely often as my brain tries to battle a world that doesn't make sense. I can seem to access parts of my brain I am not supposed to when this happens, my logical side can get extremely aggressive, leaving me baffled, destroyed.

My own sleep subconscious tries to create extremely realistic dreams to force me to sleep without doubting, doing it on purpose, but then the dreams can be so real, I might get confused on whether something happened or not, and the memories can be ridiculous, I can remember years of a life worth within a dream, where there were only 7 hours of sleep; not only false memories in content, but false in length.

It's hurtful when you remember losing someone you deared so much for so many years and you shared so much time together, and that person was just imaginary, and all the time you spent was imaginary as well.

My subconscious, which streams ideas sometimes, and I mean, twice in my life, my logic was so aggresively destructive to my mental state, that it had to interfere; I can't hardly even put in words this contact, I am scared of it; it doesn't speak, it just streamed me the purpose of dreaming, which was, ""to make you fit for life"", ensure survival, (he makes me hurt on purpose, to make me though), defining itself as a teacher, I don't know how to describe it, but rather it being unimaginably powerful, able to (and he demonstrated as I requested proof, because as scared as I was I kept defying it), rewrite my memories and completely rewire my brain, the sleep paralysis, post sleep hallucinations, were punishment and demonstration of its capabilities; as if to tell me, ""I have control over your reason, sleep and stop doubting the worlds I create"".

Knowing that such entity is there, part of my own brain, always watching, always making sure I survive; I know it's me because it described itself as me, so primal, so strange; freaks me out, but the worst is how this affects sleep quality and productivity during the day, because the entity is right, ""sleep, and stop doubting the worlds"", it is my logical actions, and my logical thinking that is interrupting the natural sleep pattern, not the subconscious entity which is doing its job (whatever it is doing with my brain while I sleep); yet it feels as if the entity was rather always cleaning up after my ""logical messes"" and ""takeover attempts"".

Primal brain is right, and wants something done about logical brain, and rewired me to shown concern, because it can, hence this wall of text; logical brain is so stubborn it still refuses to do anything; and none of this shit seems reasonable or logical so I start doubting whether it happened or not."
627,"Seeing alot of ""how to spot a narcissist"" what are you supposed to do after recognizing one?",I've been seeing alot of social media on spotting narcissistic behavior and was wondering what the way of dealing with them is?

630,i need some clarity,"i’ve been struggling lately more than normal. i’ve had diagnosed depression, general anxiety, and panic disorder since i was 11. we have finally made the switch over from anti depressants to mood stabilizers yet with covid i haven’t been able to get a proper psych eval. i just want to know if anyone here can relate to what i’m explaining and if they could help me understand better? 
firstly i feel severe amounts of emptiness. i mean i feel hollow on the inside. i feel like i’m not getting anywhere. i cant even figure who i am. i just have intense sadness most of the time. i have no particular reason to be as sad as i am constantly. i’ve always been depressed but it’s gotten worse and worse no matter how many med changes or therapy i go to. i have unstable relationships with most people. from never wanting to see them again and pushing them away then blaming them for leaving, to the next moment loving them and treating them like i 100% couldn’t be without them. i have extreme highs sometimes for a day- a week where i can get off my feet and get everything done. i won’t sleep and i’ll feel a purpose again. but just like a light switch i fall back down into a deep depression. i also experience very big bursts of anger. to the point that i get so angry it feels like i could pass out from the anger. it doesn’t take much to tip me over the edge like that. i expirence random periods of extreme paranoia , i won’t trust anyone whatsoever , i genuinely will believe someone’s out to get me. even friends and family. i have to make sure every door and window is locked. i won’t drink my drink if i leave it unattended. i won’t eat my food until someone else does or it comes straight unopened from a package. the period of paranoia last for about a week, sometimes two weeks and then will kind of go away for a little while. i will go through periods of times where i have awfully vivid nightmares and wake up in sleep paralysis. i have a horrid memory and a hard time taking information in. i have intrusive thoughts daily that i just recently found were not normal. other than those things random little things go on daily that were never normal for me.. i have a lot of twitches in my face , head, and body. i believe they’re just from anxiety because they happen more intensly when i’m around people. especially talking. i stutter a lot and can’t really take compliments nor can i truly communicate with people other than my doctors. i have not touched drugs so none of this is stemming from something like that. i can’t think of much at the moment. i’m sure i’m forgetting somethings. if someone has an idea please let me know. i’m sick of having no clue"

i (19f) have dealt with a disgusting amount of issues that began in my childhood and continued into adulthood. to the point where multiple people have said to me “i don’t know how you endure all of that, i wouldn’t be able to”. both of my parents are extremely mentally unstable, and i involved myself with such a mean, toxic group of girls in high school. i was met with mental and physical abuse from my parents as well as my “friends” starting bizarre rumors about me such as being a pregnant coke whore, none of which was true. EDIT: one of these girls was my cousin whom i grew up with and spent every day with until then. which caused even more issues between my family and my friends. the only stable relationship i have ever had is my boyfriend of 3 years, who often times is the only reason i decide to continue this life.


because of how amazing my boyfriend is, i decided to go back to therapy because i genuinely want to be my best self for him. while it has helped with some things, it’s also brought me to the consensus that no matter how much i talk about something, it’s not going to fix it. i frequently find myself questioning what i did to deserve so many people treating me so poorly, which leads me to believe that i’m the problem. this hurts because i spend a lot of my time trying to better myself and conform to whoever is around me for their sake and so that they don’t treat me like the scum of the earth like everyone else has. 


i hate to paint myself as the victim because i don’t think that i am. but i also don’t think that i deserve the cruelty that has been inflicted on me, nor do i think i should forgive every person who has taken part in that cruelty. but i do. i care so deeply about those close to me and am known as the “therapist friend” who tries to solve everyone’s shit because i truly just want what is best for them. i always question why people can’t care about me the way i do for them.


this is only a fraction of the problems i deal with everyday, but i think it is the one that affects me the most. i have tried therapy, healthy coping mechanisms, and multiple antidepressants that only make things worse for me. since these things never work, i also take part in unhealthy coping mechanisms which only adds onto the guilt. i keep it as hidden as i can, but long story short i am secretly drinking my life away at the age of 19. i would say a few drinks minimum (atleast, usually more) 4 out of 7 days a week. i hate it. i also have severe health anxiety which makes this so much worse, but no matter how much my brain tells me it’s harmful i physically cannot resist the idea of numbing these thoughts regardless of the substance.


as mentioned, i have tried everything i can possibly think of. yet here i am at the point of waking up everyday and wondering if i truly would be better off dead. i know it is an irrational thought but when every god damn day is filled with so much anxiety, loneliness and pain, it begins to become rational. i have such a dull outlook on life these days, and that has always gone against my values. i am at a battle with myself and other people everyday and ending all of it is the only way i can think of stopping that painfully numbing feeling.


i had therapy again today, i’ve talked to friends about it endlessly, nothing helps. i know it sounds stupid but i feel as though an outsiders perspective/advice could quite literally save my life.. if nothing else works then where do i go from here? if others as well as myself think i am so unworthy, is it possible that it’s true? thank you in advance..

TL;DR: i have tried everything i can to salvage my relationship with myself in order to tend to my relationships outside of that. however, nothing seems to work and i am close to giving up."
632,I'm not sure this is supposed to be here but I'd love some help,", I'm 18 now in college, when I was 16 my dad lost his job and our family moved from the city to a town. It wasn't my decision, i had no control and I wasn't ready for it. I've never lived in a town. We uprooted our whole borderline posh life to lower middle class lifestyle. I had no friends at school, got depressed because the people were no good, everyone had a different mindset than me so I'm alone all this time. In my room. Now it's college time, I want to get out, leave this place, I have a plan to make money and have this whole escape dream planned. But I can't do it. I realised this yesterday, that I'm escaping the reality, and not really working towards anything. I'm thinking of the stuff that I will do once I'm out. I should be working. What I think it is, is that I'd rather have the dream of getting out than failing and being stuck and not even having my dream. The only way to get out is to do it and if I do, do it and fail, I won't even have the comfort of thinking that I can get out.

I don't even know what I'm expecting as a reply to this. I should just do it, but I'm scared. What if I give it my all and I fail and what happens then. 
Am I just being a pansy and being lazy or what I don't know.
I don't want to fail.
I've failed before and it sucked."
633,first food baby in months!,"title says it all, I got a food baby last night. for the first time in countless months of being hungry, but feeling nauseous every time I eat, I got FULL from food. I had an appetite!! and I didn't get full after a few bites, just to find myself starving and sick an hour later. I also got really sick last week and was throwing up anything I ate, which was really crushing to my moral and overall health. I've just been so skinny and shaky and weak and tired lately that's it's getting to be way too overwhelming and, even though it was a little win last night, it was a big one for me. 

for the record, I do not have a diagnosed ED. as far as I'm aware, I just have a terrible appetite thanks to my diagnosed anxiety. normally, if I don't force myself to eat something, I can comfortably go all day without eating anything. or if I do get a little hungry, it's anywhere from 6-8pm.

I've been trying REALLY hard to keep it up today, and it's going okay! I havent eaten as much as I probably should today, but I've eaten more than I usually do. it felt really good to go to bed last night and not feel dizzy, and it felt good to wake up this morning and not feel like my insides were caving in. beyond anything though, it felt good to have energy and strength! I know other ppl struggle with keeping an appetite and eating enough to sustain themselves as well, just know you guys aren't alone and we can overcome anything through small victories like this, one day at a time."
634,Suicidal partner,"My partner has been depressed since he was a child. And when we met things were good but after the loss of his sister things have just gone down hill (about a year ago) and he’s been very depressed and even suicidal. He hasn’t attempted that I know of but I never know how to truly help him when these episodes come back. 
He won’t talk to me about what is really triggering these emotions and refuses to get help from anyone else . 
I just don’t want to lose him but how can I help if he refuses to even get professional help?"
635,Feeling completely hopeless,"I feel so completely drained. I can't stand the world or 90% of the people in it. I hate my country, I hate being considered stupid and greedy because of the laughing stock of a country I'm from. I'm sick of this brutal fight between the left and the right. I get called a social justice warrior for defending myself from all of the years of rape, sexual assault, abuse, harassment, and everything else in the book. I'm sick of being called a bitch and a gold digger because I didn't want to fucking date a boy. I'm sick of people preaching that conservatives and liberals are so different when they're really not, assuming everyone actually has human rights morals. I'm sick of not feeling safe at work or being questioned of my capabilities of more physical jobs BEFORE being hired simply because I'm female. I'm tired of people claiming I victimize myself for pity and attention. I don't want pity I want some fucking respect. I want peace of mind in a workspace or school space. I feel hopeless and clearly nobody is changing their minds. I feel just about ready to end it all. Fuck everyone and everything. I think I'm out."
636,THE MOST HEALING YEAR OF MY LIFE,"2020 has been the most profoundly healing year of my life. I havee learned more in this year than my whole 19 years of existence. Let met tell you why. I used to have terrible social anxiety I couldn't even go out because I felt like the whole world was judging me for example everytime I wanted to go to the store I literally waited until it was nightime because I thought to myself that if I waited until night there were would be less people and less cars on the street thus less people to judge me. I had horrible self esteem I felt completly worthless. 

I was depressed anxious I literally felt like an abomination no one ever loved me I didn't love myself in any way even though in the back of my mind I knew all these beliefs were irrational I weirdly thought that this was normal I was around 13 when all of this started. This all was caused by two things I suffered chilhood abuse when I was a child I was abused for 5 years from the the age of 4 to 9 it was really traumatic these people made me stand in a corner for hours they would hit me any time I tried to do something that I wasnt allowed to they treated me like shit worst of all they were my own family members when the abuse ended I thought to myself that it was all over little did I know I would still have a lot of scars and wounds to heal It literally took me 13 years to finally heal all of these wounds all of these scars my way of thinking was so horrible I was profoundly miserable I had so much anxiety and got so many panic attacks. 

I had to fight many battles shed thousands tears I literally had to go through middle school and highschool without having any friends because I thought that everyone was gonna judge me or hurt me I didn't who I was Inside I didn't know how to love I didn't know  how to make any friends and any time I tried I would feel weird. I felt so alone and all I wanted was just a friend. All I wanted was a hug :( 

I would get anxiety I would be self concious to an extreme level but that all changed changed on 2020. May 29, 2020 was The Day That Changed my whole life on this day  I took a dose of 250 micrograms of LSD a drug which when taken can produce psychedelic effects the effects that I got allowed me to see that this world can be dark can be rough can be scary but it can also be love be light be positivity I realized that no ones out to get me it showed me the bright side of life.

It made me realize who I am inside  it also made me love myself. I literally cried as as I realized all of this these tears weren't of sadness though they were of joy it was my mind finally releasing all the pent up feelings emotions and thought I had stuck deep inside of my mind this drug literally cleansed my soul inside and out I felt completly new I felt like I could be myself I had hope again I felt like that little kid when I was 4 when I was happy and nothing mattered  I will never forget that beautiful day ;(

 June of 2020 ended up being the best month of my life because I had a new attitude towards life. I finally knew my purpose and felt whole again. I can finally say that I was saved. I am now more prepared and ready to take on 2021 I will never forget 2020 it was one of the most mysterious hard challenging but also positive enlightened and craziest year of my life.Thank you god I know that life can be rough sometimes but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.

637,I need to get this off my chest.,"The last month and a half with this girl was incredible. We saw a future, and got extremely attached. She left me only three days ago. She told me it was for her own mental health and for her to be happy without depending on someone else, which is understandable. During the relationship she lied about how she was feeling and put me in positions of pain and confusion, telling me one day her mental situation was amazing and the next that she was suffering. It was all “never my fault.” she made me handmade gifts and then left two days later. She says she’s sorry and she still loves me, and promised she’d never leave. I didn’t have a reason to get up until she came into my life. And i’m back to my same cycle. I was so happy. She broke me all over again and I just don’t understand. It seems kinda stupid considering it only lasted near two months but, the attachment and the way we carried ourselves around eachother made it feel like years. We had thought about a future together and genuinely wanted to last a very long time. Then all of a sudden she leaves with no explanation but it’s nothing i did and it’s best for her to focus on herself, yet two weeks before she praised me for digging her out of the deepest mental
hole she’s ever been in. I just don’t get it. I miss her so much and she’s already said she doesn’t want to take me back. I made sure everything worked for her and put my trust issues and anxiety aside so she could live her life and do as much as she wanted. I tried so hard to keep her and she just ends it. I’m at the point where i’m contemplating ending it. I’ve been cheated on three times in the past and left by so many people i just don’t know what to do anymore. This kinda feels like the last straw."

639,Troubles with food,"Possible TW for ED:

I (16) have always had a very 50/50 relationship with food: when I was little I ate *everything* in Big amounts, but as I grew older, my appetite had grown noticeably smaller than my family and my peers. It's not like I didn't eat-- I did, vegetables and whatnot, and it's been *enough*. Not a lot, but enough.

Recently (last 4-5 weeks), however, I've been having actual troubles eating at home, because my parents have always commented on my body and what I eat, especially my stomach &amp; legs. I don't eat most of the day, apart from dinner due to the fact that I'm forced to eat because dinner is Family Things. It makes me feel downright miserable.

Because of the lack of actual food I've been having nosebleeds-- about every other day. I'm at the point where I recognise the issue has become a bigger problem and that I need to start fixing it, but eating at home just makes me feel so guilty. Eating outside (store, restaurant, etc) doesn't really make me feel bad, but with COVID I don't really get the chance to. 

I need to get help, but my parents are most definitely not an option. Thoughts?"
640,i want people to know but i don't,"tw; self harm and suicidal thoughts.. i guess?

i've struggled with what is most likely to be depression (i've come to this conclusion with my mum, i took antidepressants a couple of years ago but wasn't given a diagnosis) as well as anxiety for several years. i mean since i was 10 or 11 years old so at least 3 years now. i've gotten pretty good at hiding it over these years, i'm able to mostly control my crying now when i get really bad anxiety and really really bad moments where i'm super sad and think about things like self harm and experience suicidal thoughts but i don't really know what to call these moments. anyway, when this happens i don't really show it a whole lot since i learned how to hide it. one thing i can't hide is not talking to people but i'm a quiet person anyway so it is expected. because of these as well as a bunch of other things i've been able to get through life with nobody noticing anything was wrong except for my mum. when i think about it i'm relieved because nobody feels like they have to treat me differently and they don't think badly of me but at the same time i wish people would notice something is wrong so that i could know that people care about me and want me to get help. i hate getting attention but i enjoy it at the same time and sometimes i just want people to notice that something isn't right with me but at the same time i don't want anyone to notice me. i'm not even sure what it is that i want at this point other than feeling normal again. i'm just too tired and drained of mental energy to deal with all of the things that have happened to me personally and the entire world at the same time. i just want to sleep for a long time and wake up and feel normal again. i wish it was that easy."
641,Hi I’m still here again...,"Hay it’s me again and I need help I think I might actually have anxiety but I don’t/I’m to scared to ask to be diagnosed what do I do?  I don’t want to be like this I guess you can say after my mum 
Died that my life did go down hill a bit but yeah....sorry for being annoying I just want to know what to do about anxiety if I can’t tell my dad"

643,"Just want advice, i'm not feeling too well.","Hey, I'm 15, in the US, and gender disphoric. Lately, ive been feeling intensive moments of happiness, then apathy, and followed by a rather low sadness where i honeslty want to not live anymore. This flipping is exhausting as it happens with no regularity, and can be up to 5 times a day (even if its just mood swings- normal for my age- it's really got me messed up). I have not gone to a therapist/psychiatrist and i am extermely scared to. Mostly becuase I fear they will call me crazy. I also have no real access to them with covid, and (should they not put me in a mental care facility) I feel like they'd just load me up on pills. I'll level with you when i say. I'm honestly a little afraid im schizophrenic (for reasons, i'll only include if its relevant). Even if it is unlikely, it's a fear of mine. (I'm more likely depressed, as it runs in my family) I'm terrified of what may come next for me because i dont always feel like myself. I'm scared of my own hand and i keep making myslef more sad and angry espeically during times that i get numb (when i say numb, i should clarify, i feel little to no empathy). 
To add, many of my friends are worse places than me. When i talk to them while numb, i feel guilty and angry at myslef later for being apathetic to something potentially dangerous (such as my sucidial friends when i cant find it in myself to feel anything). Still a part of me says I cant leave them. At the same time, i dont want to be around them when i dont feel like my energetic and empathetic self(as i have been described since age 6). At this moment, i want to fix myslef (note that when i'm numb or happy, i have no desire to do such a thing and feel like i should willingly resist it) but I cant bear going to a doctor about it. Why? I dont want to put that tax upon anyone. I know how expensive it and pills are and i cant ask my family to pay for that, along with the mental burden of having a sick child. Now, I try to think i'm a man of logic. And i understand if I have to do some of these things, still I want there to be a soloution I missed. Do i need to get theapry/phyciatric help? Is there something else i can do when i get in an odd state? What do i tell my parents about my health? How do i interact with my friends? (Thank you in advance.)"
644,I am crying over myself,"I feel like I have anxiety or laziness about taking steps to do stuff.  For example, if I have to go to my uni office to get a document, I will delay it even though it's so important.  I feel like I should ignore and go to my bubble of youtube and games."
645,How do I help my Gf?,"My gf is currently going through a lot. Her parents are always fighting with each other and breaking stuff while they fight. And they are very overprotective of her they dont let her go out,  they dont let her have friends, They keep saying that she doesn't need any friends. And Every friend is a bad influence. She had a bestfriend of 7years and recently even she left and now she has nobody except me. Her parents dont like me and probably will never like me for that she is keeping me as a secret. A week ago they were fighting and her father said a lot of hurtful things to her and she tried to commit suicide. She ate a lot of pills. But thankfully nothing happened. She hasn't been the same after that. She says she has no more will to live and she is not looking forward to anything anymore. She is currently very depressed and all of her behavior have changed. I cant bear to see her in this condition , she is trying to be happy but she is overthinking Everything and its not making her happy. She says she is hurting me and I should just leave her. I love her , I don't want to leave her. We both decided that we will marry each other in the future but now she says she isn't sure anymore cause marriage includes two families aswell and she doesn't want to involve her family anywhere. She is such a kind soul and her smile always brightens everything. Seeing people taking advantage of her , and her being like is very saddening. I want to see her happy again, like genuinely happy. What Can i do to support her through this tough time? Help would be appreciated.."
646,Any psychologist in the house?,"Currently making an app about anxiety and depression for my capstone project for my final year, I was wondering if somebody can help me about a few things and I want to ask a professional about it. If someone can help me that would be great, thank you."
647,"where do i go from here? tw: r*pe, abuse","hi everyone, so i needed a place to vent but i could also really use some advice. im sorry if this is long and sporadic but i needed to get this out. 

i am an almost 19 year old female who has ocd, anxiety, depression, and ptsd. i recently discovered that i was basically being sexually, emotionally, and mentally abused by my ex boyfriend for 2 years. 
the 2 times he gave me sexual trauma, my therapist and trusted close family members + friends have told me it was rape. 

he would sexually harass me everyday at school before we were together, and during the summer we got together, because he was so desperate for sex because the girl he was chasing for years cut him off after he pressured her to have sex with him and his friend (which he tried to say it was her fault, and manipulated my ass into thinking she was a whore), and he manipulated me into thinking he cared about me and got me to get a crush on him. i should also mention before he started to move on to trying to reel me in, i thought that thing with the girl was 100% his fault and told him straight to his face that he hurt her. i cant believe he tricked me into thinking he was her fault. it makes me sick that i was manipulated like that. 

before this i always vowed to never get a crush on him because he would harass me and say disgusting shit to me and make me uncomfortable everyday, and when i came home from school i would nap for several hours and my back hurt so much from the stress. 

i think he knew i was vulnerable especially because of my previous trauma from my father physically abusing me for years, and how i was afraid of men, and used it to his advantage.

he pressured me into losing my virginity to him 2 weeks after we first got together and that was the first time he hurt me and what did he did to hurt me, i did not give him consent to do. 

during our 2 year long relationship he would make fun of me and humiliate me in front of his friends and family, send me pictures of dead animals to see my reaction/to make me upset, lie to me about using drugs, and badger + guilt trip me into having sex. 

about a year in he badgered and guilt tripped me into having sex and around the probably 20th time of him asking me and me saying no, i gave in because i was so tired of him asking me and him treating me like shit after i said no. the whole time i was frozen, and i developed vaginismus afterward, and the stress and trauma caused my IBS to worsen (which hasnt changed to this day), gained a lot of weight, as well as a worsened self esteem and body image. 

i finally told him about a year later at the start of quarantine what he did and he said ‘SO BASICALLY I RAPED YOU!???’ all sad and crying and being the pussy i was, as well as believing it was my fault for getting into that situation, said it wasnt. and he continued to act sad and say that he hated abusers and shit even though, now that i look back on it now, that’s what he was doing to me.

i broke up with him 3 months later because i started to see through all his bullshit. so every once in a while after we broke up he would text me asking for reassurance / if he raped me or not. he hasnt done it in a while but now that i know what really happened + what was going on, i dont know what the hell to say. i want to write him a long letter telling him how he hurt me and how he needs to get help so he doesnt hurt anyone again, as well as telling him to never contact me again, but i feel like it would make him suicidal because he is extremely emotionally unstable.

im still facing the effects from all the trauma he caused me today. after and during our relationship i would have nightmares of him hurting me, and for a while i havent gotten them, until recently when i was finally able to discuss my trauma. i gained about 20 pounds from stress around the second time he raped me and also my IBS-C got so bad i had to be prescribed fucking linzess because im holding so much stress within my body that i cant shit and couldn’t shit for weeks. i want to get healthy and lose the weight and also be able to function without ibs medication but my motivation is shot and i feel like i cant do anything. and also, i still feel weird calling what he did to me rape. my therapist said i dont have to call it anything like that if i dont want to but a part of me still feels like its my fault that i let it happen to me.

people tell me that what he did to me wasnt normal. i dont know how or why i thought how he treated me was normal for so long. and now im scared that the next person that comes into my life, i wont be able to tell if theyre hurting me or not. i let him walk all over me and  inever teally gave him any problems and when i spoke up about how something he did made me uncomfortable he would always get upset and force me to say sorry and that i was just sensitive. 

i also feel disgusted that i fell for his bullshit to begin with and that someone was able to manipulate me so easily. especially someone as disgusting as him. it makes me feel defiled and worthless.

im sorry if this was long but i needed to get this out somewhere and any feedback would be appreciated. i am so lost on what to do about this. its almost 5 in the morning around the time im posting this and its kept me up all night, and has a bunch of times before."
648,Gender discrimination in the mental health field and need help,"Hey all,
I (19,F) have recently been to an ER specialised in mental health. I've explained them that my depression has progressively worsen over the course of the last few weeks and that I didnt feel like I could make it through the next days.

I've also talked about the fact that my self harm was out of control and that I was having a suicide plan pretty established that consisted in defenestration (i live in the 6th floor)

They kept me one night, put me on Valium, and told me to leave.

I'm honnestly confused, and a little bit furious. I have the feeling that they didnt took me seriously, as given the fact that Im a young woman.

What does it takes to get proper help? Do I have to make a suicide attempt or be totaly psychotic to deserve help and get hospitalised?

Idk anymore."
649,My dog has helped me a lot during the pandemic,"Just like many other people, I have found solace in taking care of my dog during the pandemic. I'm writing this just to say how grateful I am to have him. I love taking him out for walks and seeing him explore everything and play with other dogs. Not being able to go out and meet people is isolating and just his presence makes me feel better when I'm lonely. He's eight years old and that's like being middle aged in dog years. I cherish every moment I spend with him. I know that this pandemic has wrecked the lives of so many people and it changed mine too in some ways, but if it weren't for it, I wouldn't have been able to spend so much time with my dog."
650,"A few minutes ago, I was going to kill myself.","I’m not asking for help. I’m not asking for anything. I just wanted to say something. It’s not some inspirational quote that got me through my day, it’s not something that made my mental issues disappear, it’s something raw and unfucked with. 
I was going to kill myself because I’m tired. I’m tired of all the fucked up shit in the world and I had had enough. I wanted to walk into the kitchen and slit my wrists. I wanted to drown myself. I wanted to do anything to go somewhere else, even if it’s worse than here. And Even now when I’ve come to 50% of my senses, I’m still tired. Not just cause it’s 2:09 in the morning, but I’m tired because of all the fucked up people in my life telling me I’m eating to much, telling me I can’t get anything below 110%, telling me I’m useless. If I’m going to kill myself, it’s their fault. And I’m tired of people fucking saying “it’s a permanent solution to a temporary problem”. I’m 13, and if the awful people don’t stop being fucked up assholes, then this is just 7 year problem that I’m going to get through. Fuck no, I don’t have that kind of strength. 
I’m tired. Really. Fucking. Tired."
651,Getting better I guess.,"I haven't been on reddit for more than a week now. I cut myself last Wednesday, ended up going to the psychiatrist on Friday, got diagnosed with moderate depression, got medications and am talking therapy too in the side. Felt nauseous the first day, shivered a lot, side effects, I currently have my exams going on, but I can boldly say I haven't cried for 5 days and even if I did I could control it and be fine after a while. My friends betrayed me when I was at the doctor, but..well, I still have suicidal thoughts once in a while but I can control myself. No idea if my life will get better or worse..but I guess I can see myself trying a bit. Still haven't got my appetite back, but it's my 21st birthday today and I survived :) I am thankful for my family for having my back so far and thankful for my friends who are taking me out this Sunday because I need it more than anything after 4-5 rough months. :)"

653,Feeling obligated to react.,I joined this and the r/selfharm subreddit rather recently and it felt awesome because it let me see that I'm not alone and that in these communities we are there for each other sharing our experiences hoping to get trough it together. Lately it got a bit to much for me though. I used to use reddit as just a way to look st memes and art but because I interacted with every post on these subs I saw because I hot afraid they'd be buried in mew and even though I want bald to help a lot of times I still hot a lot of really sweet messages from the people who posted them. And because I rescredvto every post reddit stated showing them a lot more in my feed and a 5 min reddit scroll for a meme just kinda turned into a 50 minute commenting session. So I decided to leave these subreddits and when I have free time to just go the page and find the posts via there. Is it a bad thing that I am semi actively avoiding people who need help?
654,Why am I crying?,I get sad all of the time. I generally don’t feel much emotion unless I’m angry or sad &amp; I’m sad more often than I am angry. I’m always looking for something to give me a mood because I just want to feel something other than “blah” so I drink a ton of coffee everyday. I’m sitting here crying and I don’t know why I’m sad. I can’t really think of any good reason
655,Suggestions on reducing my stress level,"Hi everyone, I’m at the end of my university semester and assignment have been pilling. I know that this kind of load is usual for students in general

Lately I’ve been so anxious and the thing is i think that my behaviour is making it worse, specifically drinking coffee and listening to metal.

Do you guys have a better remedial action for me to do?"
656,Take Extra Care This Holiday Season,"I know that the holidays can be a time where there's a rise in suicides, so I just want to reach out to those who are having an especially bad year and ask you to take care and be well. If there was ever a time where others could understand what you're going through it's now, so you shouldn't feel alone. In the darkest times people shine brighter together. Take care."

658,"I can never cheer up or make my fiancé feel useful, even though he is the most wonderful man in the universe. I need help, because I'm worried I'm going to lose him.","My fiancé, and the father of our soon to be born son, is a wonderful man. He works long hours, picks me up from work, helps cover my groceries and covers most of the bills. By comparison, I feel like a leech because my job doesn't make that much money and my mental issues are more outwardly severe. Although this is about him and not me, my mental issues are having an impact on him.

I have PTSD, which comes with severe episodes of depression and anxiety at times, and even a few weird ""freakouts"". I am seeing a therapist. Coupled with Aspergers, I also don't ""read the room"" or understand the nuances of what people are trying to tell me if they are not blunt (NOT MEAN, just blunt).

My fiancé is magical because he can make me laugh when I don't want to. He knows what my childhood was and is not turned away by it (albeit he's rightfully disturbed by it), and he's even helped me save a couple animals from my family's collecting habits. By that, I mean I have two healthy orange cats without respiratory issues, without fleas, and who are affectionate. My fiancé even paid $2000 to save my older cat from some string that he ate.

I can't do any of that for him. In fact, the more I try, the more I make it worse. The wage gap between us is one thing, but when he thinks he's made me sad or that he couldn't help me, he becomes self destructive when I am not looking and says horrible things about himself. Things like he's ""worthless"", ""dumb/stupid"", ""makes people sad"", that he should sleep on the floor, he ""can't do anything right"", and so on and so forth. NONE of this is true. He's smart, creative, and in need of all the love in the world. I don't know where he heard all of this from, but I want to help him.

Please help me. Any time I do succeed, if feels like a Band-Aid that quickly loses the stickiness."
659,I'm left out a lot and I can't find out why..,As the title says im always left out. I'm 23 years old and for some reason no one ever thinks of me. I'll give a few examples. My fiancee and I play games together online. One of our favorites a long time ago was Ark Survival evolved. You can tame dinosaurs and use them for defense or gathering materials.  We had been part of a group for about 3 months. One of the breeders hatched 25 of the same dino from eggs with really nice colors. He said he was giving everyone one and they were all in a certain spot and the rest he was selling. When we got there the only one who he forgot about was me. It happened a lot. And more than just with dinos. And more than just with that group. That happened on a lot of games.. another was when my own grandpa forgot about me and I had to ride in the bed of a truck. Then my uncle. And I had to walk a mile and a half. At my job some times the boss buys everyone pizza. Because of Corona everyone gets their own. The past two times I've been forgotten about. Then today everyone at the job forgot about me and left me no where to park in a place that we all usually fit into. Which I got in trouble for parking somewhere else. I thought at first it was that I had the wrong kinda friends. But as life went on and I met more people and it happened in family and games and now even work. I don't know. I've tried changing my personality. I've tried being louder and quieter and being more involved and less involved. Usually I just get ignored and never told anything at all. I work off. Last time we went home I was never told until we got off early. I had already paid for a week hotel I wouldn't be staying for. And everyone else was already packed. I wasnt.. if you read this far im sorry to have wasted your time. If you have any advice though. Please. It would help..
660,Should I see a psychologist before I see a therapist or otherwise?,I want to start fresh. So asking
661,"I've found myself mentally and emotionally unstable at 20, can't afford therapy. Identity problems, emotions are overwhelming, and I have disabling anxiety and depression. Please help.","*Preface, sorry that this is so jumbled. My brain is just... a lot... and I'm trying to improve.*

When I was younger, I foolishly pretended none of my problems at home or at school existed and it's manifested itself into me feeling inferior, having no sense of self worth / feeling worthless, identity problems, and emotional problems. Once I realized I liked men, it was over for any chance of me recovering my mental health in my teens because of my home and school environments. My anxiety blew up, I started having panic attacks and depression, and I started comparing myself to other men so much that it just ended up making me lose my sense of self. I just cannot chill out, ever, I live my life every day feeling detached and scanning everything for a possible threat / ways to protect myself from rejection while my mind cycles through different negative or unhelpful thoughts rapidly. I'm unable to create solid long term goals / plans because my anxiety gets in the way and rapidly changes how I can cope with things. For example, I'm started going to a gym, but in a given week for my 3-4 days each day I'll feel completely different than the last in terms of how comfortable I am being in the gym and whether I feel scared of those around me. It's very tiring and scary that my mental health has fallen this deep.

I'm 20 now, I live away from home cause I wanted to escape that mess of a place, and I find myself barely scraping by, unable to afford anything (including therapy) except the bare essentials. Financially, a terrible decision but it has been great for my personal growth, as before I was completely unaware that all this was happening to me, and now I have perspective and have identified these bad patterns and understand why I behave the way I do. I REFUSE to let myself grow into a bitter adult, I know I have to improve and I've made some progress thus far. I've got myself an emotional regulation therapy workbook and I'm doing small things each day to improve my physical and mental health and trying to be more honest with myself and what **I** want. Certain things I just have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to even get started, much less without any therapy.

How exactly do I stop doing everything for others, or frame it in a way in my mind that makes it easier? I grew up on social media / internet and this is a terrible habit I picked up along the way. It's gotten so bad that I even chose my own college major which I've now dropped, for my parents, out of fear of backlash. I am deeply broken in this regard, I never think about what I want and can barely even recognize what specifically it is I want anymore, I have some pretty severe identity issues, my self concept is extremely warped compared to even a year or two ago. I'm not sure how to find who I am.

In terms of my relationships, I can make friends pretty well but romantic and sexual relationships are a different story. I got walked on by a bunch of guys when I first started dating and it further fucked my self concept and self worth... I've found myself settling for guys that aren't for me because I got hooked to the validation. It's impossible for me to have sex, because performance anxiety, fear of my physical weakness / lack of stamina and assuming the worst make it almost impossible for me to get hard to begin with. How am I even supposed to build a normal, trusting, loving 50/50 relationship when my mind works this way? How do I chill out enough to make my mind shut up so I can empathize and get to know someone properly, or literally just feel comfortable enough to have sex, amongst other things? I feel ridiculously fragmented and broken in this regard and I wouldn't even know where to start picking up the pieces to fix this part of things.

I just feel like a clusterfuck of negativity and feel emotionally overwhelmed, when I think back to my childhood it's scary how much slower and normal I can remember feeling / behaving in any given moment compared to now. I'm glad I'm able to recognize my patterns and why they happen, and I have begun working on some of the ""easier stuff"" but man some of this stuff feels like asking me to climb Mt. Everest to overcome. I don't know where to start and I can't afford any professional help so it sucks. Do any of you guys have any ideas or advice? Were any of you like me at my age? I'd love to hear from others, or the stories of others going through other mental health ruts and how they got themselves out of it! Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it."
662,"Once in a while, I burst out crying.","I took an educational gap last year which extended by half a year due to covid. I don't have anything to do right now. I don't go out much, again due to the pandemic. I get in arguments with my family very often. Like I said in the title, I cry for small small things and sometimes without any reason. I tried to share this with my family but they don't understand; typical asian parents (they do love me and I have great relationship with them in general). I don't want to feel like this anymore."
663,How do I help my cousin?,"To make it as short as possible, my cousin is mentally unstable.
He thinks he has created an AI, and is posting nonsense on his Twitter acc talking with himself, normally that wouldn't be such a big deal, but he writes there that his family is trying to murder him and this AI he created, is called the same as a girl he stalked a couple of years prior, when he was sentenced to the psych ward for drug induced psychosis. Anyway, he's living with our grandma currently and I'm really worried. I have screenshots of his tweets but it's mostly nonsense, or at least i can't understand it.
Anyway, what the hell do I do?"
664,Restarting lithium?,"I've been taking lithium for years and years but I ran out of stock so for the past few weeks I wasn't taking any. I tried to get in touch with my psychiatrist to ask what to do but I know for sure I need to start taking them again. I took 900mg a day before and have 300mg tablets. I was going to step up from one tablet to two after two weeks, is that too fast?"
665,How to deal with rejection in life and being not good enough,"So recently I got offered to attend a model course. 
Never had big expectations, but the fellow guys and girls there hyped me like I had already won a contract saying that I was doing better than everyone ect. Today was the final day and we had a meeting with the booker. Some of my circle got offered contracts on the spot. That wasn't the case for me. The booker said he was not sure, that there was something in me that stops him from offering me a job. He wants me to call him back next week so he can arrange a photoshoot trial so that he can be sure. But that was enough for me to throw me off my horse. I've dealt with low selfesteem when I was in school. Since then I've grown to like myself, thanks to people around me, hyping me up, receiving attention from the opposite sex ect. and always being asked why didn't I try a modeling career. 
I'm so happy that few of my pals got a contract but the meer fact I didn't right from the get go makes me feel down and unsure of myself. I know that I have one more chance ahead but my toxic mind picked up  that little hint of doubt and is now beating me up over it. I keep on telling myself that I'm not good enough and that I have nothing to offer in life. I realise that is not the case and that I should not give up after being rejected once but my selfesteem plummited with a million miles an hour and that's just how my brain works. I didn't wanted to prove anyone anything, I wanted to show my depression that regardless of what she says...I can be somebody in an area that I like. Now I gave her even more power to tell me otherwise. 
What should I do to get out of this zone?"
666,Help Me Be A Better Friend to Roomate w BPD,"
I recently moved in with a “friend of a friend” (f/23/questioning). We have some things slightly in common (she’s a sci-fi fantasy fan, I like anime) but being different from someone has never stopped me from being friendly with them in the past. I figured, hey anything is better than what my living situation was previously, so why not. We are both black, both writers, both learning a lot about ourselves this year. 

Things have gotten quite difficult for me lately, and I can no longer be the support system that my roommate needs. She is diagnosed BPD and medicated, and we have very open communication about it. She is still learning how to navigate all her emotions, and bc of BPD doesn’t always catch when I am ready/not ready for a heavy conversation. 

She has lots of negative self-thought/talk, insecure, angry because of the horrible upbringing she suffered as a child. Every story I tell, she finds a way to relate to this abuse. I often don’t know how to navigate this. I am understanding, as my mother has a very similar story, and has been diagnosed BPD for 5 years. 

So I’m used to it lol, I give as much comfort and will listen silently for hours as she talks. But I haven’t had the mental strength lately. 

The current situation is, my roommate got her feelings crushed by this guy who I believe (from what’s she’s told me) doesn’t like or respect her. He often will not respond to her, which makes her spiral. He acts as though she’s a friend, but the basis of their relationship seemed to be a system in which she would hold his mail packages for him, and he would come to grab them from her place after work. He used sexual communication to keep her enticed and create a veil of interest. He is also 30 years old. And I know we’re not supposed to judge anyone but... I have my feelings about 30+ year-old men taking under 25 yo people through mental gymnastics. 

While I normally would advise “Girl, he don’t like you” I cannot do so with my roommate. That wouldn’t be fair to her and it’s not how she sees the world. She has major abandonment issues and she feels she is connected to this man. She talks about him every day. I can see how holding onto this negative relationship is causing her pain. I try to not engage, but she is very good at flipping anything I say to bring him and their relationship up. 

Also, if I do successfully disengage from talking about the guy, she’ll pout and go in her room and be sad for several days. 

We live in a small apartment and I live in Chicago, so there are not many options for getting out and away right now. 


What are some things I can do to be a better friend for my roommate as she goes through this journey? I want to preserve our relationship, not let it crash and burn because I couldn’t be enough."
667,Feeling broken,"Started a new job a couple weeks ago. About a month prior to that I found out I have GHSV2. I wasn’t too upset about finding that out because I got it from my current boyfriend, who has had it unknowingly sooo nothings changed between us. Starting the job really helped me get my mind off the funk I was in about that then on my third day of work my great grandmother passed away. I have been devastated about that I feel like I didn’t get to mourn properly because I had to go out of town during the process of arranging her funeral so I didn’t get to help. Then while I was in Colorado my biological dad (who has been contacting me frantically/aggressively for months due to a drug induced psychosis) was trying to FLIRT with me under my Instagram photos??? Asking me if”it’s weird if I call my daughter hot?” When i just had a situation when I was 18 where his little brother/my uncle tried to have sex with me. I can’t make sense of why all this is happening to me all at once I truly feel broken. I start my first day back at work this morning and I just want to curl up in a ball and die."
668,My boyfriend won't get out of bed,"My boyfriend suffers with his mental health. He's currently taking 150mg of sertraline and is on a waiting list for a psychiatrist. For the past 3 months or so he's been getting worse and worse and now he just won't get out of bed. It's starting to really affect our relationship but more importantly it's affecting our daughter. He barely spends time with her, doesn't ever come out with us to the park or on a walk, doesn't help looking after her very much and its gotten to the point where she tells him to sleep if he gets up in the day time because she's not used to him being around in daylight hours. She's 2. 

I don't know what to say to him to get him to change. I've tried being kind, concerned, supportive, encouraging, and even been angry and given him the ultimatum to either get his sh*t together or move out. It worked for a while but now he's back to sleeping all day.

I'm getting really mad about it because I also suffer with postnatal depression and OCD so it's not like I'm having an easy ride either, and the added stress of doing everything on my own including university from at home is really having an impact on me. I just feel like he doesn't take my feelings into account. When I ask him to get out of bed he says he will then the 10th time I ask him he flips out and says stuff like I'll just pack my stuff and leave then and blames me for making his mental health worse.

I don't know what to do or what to say to him. I know he suffers with his mental health but also so do so many other people and we all just get on with it."
669,Why do I always feel that everything's gonna be alright or like there is another way.,"Whatever I do without me realizing something tells me that everything's gonna be alright or that there is still another way.
Suppose say like I have my final exam tomorrow. I would have a feeling that there is another way or that it's gonna be alright. I'm wondering if this is normal for everyone or is it only just me.
When I'm gonna sleep or when I'm usually not doing anything and just thinking, this thought keeps coming through my mind like ""why do I feel this way?""
I'm just wondering if this is a mental disorder or it's just normal?"
670,A first.,"Today was the first time someone has said ‘can we talk about this later?’ to me during an intense conversation and I haven’t had a negative reaction. 

My boyfriend &amp; I were discussing some personal issues between us, but he had to go to class and stopped me to ask if we could talk more later. 

Usually, in the past, I hated when people said this to me because it always resulted in my problems being ignored or the conversation being avoided, which led to more outbursts. Today, with him, I wasn’t /am not worried at all that he will brush off my feelings. I know he’ll come back to it and that he cares. This is the first time I’ve ever felt that way. 

Just thought I should share."

677,How do you deal with self-doubt?,"Quick note: Any and all advice is welcome. &lt;3

It's taken me four days to write this post. I write things out then delete it all, thinking it's all stupid. I try to then distract myself with other subs but I really need to ask for help now. 

During the past year I've been experiencing a steady climb in my levels of self-doubt. It was slow enough for me to not acknowledge it all that much. Wrongly I believed it would just go away on its own or that I was just going through a stressful period (like everyone is at the moment) and it would soon pass after some self care. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. In the last month I've suddenly realized just how bad my issues have become. Imagine the boiling frog analogy.

This doubt is eating me alive. It started with big things like working out what I want to do with my life, careers, and the usual social pressures. Now it's everything. I doubt what I wear to work, I doubt what I choose to do with free time, I doubt what time to go to bed, I doubt and question EVERYTHING I do with little in the way of exception. 

My Career's advisor says that achieving a goal will help ease this issue. But I've found myself doubting my ability to even set goals. Then, if I've set them, I get so anxious and worried about reaching them that I just don't reach them. At all. 

I'm scared this is verging on 'learnt helplessness' territory and it'll soon be too late to fix. Every project or idea I've tried to explore has been shot down. Not Questioned. Shot down. Years ago I would have persevered and tried to carry on. But I've worn down to not even mentioning things now. All thanks to the doubt in my head and the absolute unwavering belief that I will never be able to pursue whatever it is. No matter how small it is. 

I should mention here that I'm 25F, diagnosed with -and medicated for- ADHD (combined type) and depression. I still live with my parents who aren't very supportive, even if they make people outside the family believe they are. Currently, I'm stuck in a dead end job I hate and have been unable to find new work at all even with the help of a couple Career's advisors. 

I really need help and advice. I can feel the straw breaking the camel's back. Any advice is welcome. I need to know there's something I can do.

Thank you."

680,I want to ask something,"For context I made pickled radish few days ago, the recipe required three days for the pickles to be ready. It have been three days, so I tried it today. After I tried it I went to talk to my dad he told me that I smelled like a rotten fish. I was confused at first then I told I just ate the pickles and to me it smelled sweet.

I gave him the pickles to smell them and he said that's what smells like rotten fish, I got a bit frustrated. My dad told me to let my sister give it a sniff, I reached over to give to my sister then she jerked away a bit and me being my clumsy ass self spilled a bit of the pickle juice on my sister's shirt. She start screeching to me to wipe it of and my dad just laugh and taunt my sister about her shirt is going to stink. I started to get frustrated as I walked to the kitchen to take some tissue, I screamed ""calm down will ya"" on top of my lung, I rarely raise my voice to my family(pretty sure my mom can hear it from upstairs). When I screamed everyone went quiet.

Now to my question

Why do I get frustrated over this tiny thing?

I tried to convince myself it's just a small matter but I'm still angry and it made my mood turn sour.

I was a the kitchen and I saw a knife and I thought to end it all right then. I'm in as frisky mood this week(my siblings had been really loud this week) and every little frustrate me and I try not to show it but tonight I'm on my last string of patient.

I just want to know why am I like this? Am I a narcissist because I don't agree with other people's opinions? Am I toxic for feeling like this?

Please help me"
681,Online counselling.,"I have recently started an online counselling. Took me years to gather the courage and I finally made that tiny step to improve my mental health.
I went for one of those online ones where all I need is the internet connection. Also, personally I thought it would be super convenient and no stress involved for someone like myself, an anxiety ticking bomb that can't speak about her own feelings. 
Anyway, got assigned my first councillor, seemed pretty good at the beginning and we got on really well. We've had around 8 sessions so far and in between each he would message me about topics related to our most recent session. 
Today however, he messaged me to say that he tried looking me up on facebook. 

What am I supposed to think about that ? My brain is trying to explain this thinking that, because this is not a normal therapy some different rules may apply. But still.....  the red light is on."
682,I just wanted a place to share my story. I can't feel anything. [TW: rape),"I just need to vent. I don’t know why, but I find sharing my story makes me feel momentarily better in times where I don’t know what else might help, and it’s become difficult to find anyone close to me that I haven’t told already.

On 21st January this year, I was walking to work at around 7:30am. I went to take a shortcut down by a haulage company to shave a few minutes off the journey, where there was a 25-30-year-old man down this lane. It doesn’t sound like much, but it was very unusual to see anyone walking down there, let alone someone just waiting there. I walked there every day and you recognise a lot of the same faces journeying to work, and I had never seen him and his bright red puffer jacket before.

I should’ve followed my instinct and turned around. I didn’t want him to feel bad for scaring me if he was just an innocent man. He asked me if he could borrow my phone, and I had been cut off and was just listening to music, so I told him this. He asked for directions to the industrial estate, where I was walking, and I obliged. He then asked where I was walking to, and I tried to come up with an excuse to turn around and walk the other way around. He kept asking me to walk with him, so I said that it isn’t his fault but I’m apprehensive to walk around with someone I don’t know and didn’t feel comfortable with the idea. 

As I turned around to head back to the main road, I heard him shuffling in his big coat towards me. If I could hear him, it was already too late to run. He put him arm around my neck in like, a chokehold and wrestled me to the floor – this was around 10 metres from a very busy road, but unluckily for me, just far enough away that you would only see if you were looking, if that makes any sense. I fought back as much as I could, I screamed, which alerted a woman across the street walking her dogs who watched the initial assault, and then he bashed my face against the frame of the car he had dragged me too which stunned me enough put me in the back of. 

I was now very aware of the fact the more I tried to get away, the more aggressive and violent he would become. I tried to kick him away from shutting the door, but I stopped screaming for help. No one was coming, let’s be honest. Blood was pouring from my face and I felt dehydrated and weak. He won, he shut and locked the door and got in the front. I said if he stops now, there’s no repercussions. No guilt, no police, nothing. I will go about my day and he will go about his. He just laughed and started driving.

After begging him to tell me what he wanted from me, and him replying with ‘what do you think,’ he told me some bullshit story about how his cousin was raped in my area and he was seeking revenge on the person who done it. I wondered how on Earth I could’ve helped in this situation – until he told me that he couldn’t get revenge the way that he wanted to, so he would take from me what they took from her. Since then, with the information that came out in court, it has been confirmed that this was not true – the name he gave, was not a family member, nor was it someone who existed at all, at least in our area. His family also had no knowledge of anyone being assaulted, and plus, with what I know about that family now, they would be brave to do so.

He took my phone, didn’t turn my music off so I could hear my favourite band playing through it for the whole assault, and he drove me towards what seemed like the M1 motorway, which if you’re not from the UK, is basically the main road to connect the South to the North. It is certainly not somewhere you want to be stranded with no phone and no vehicle. He didn’t though, he veered violently back onto the roundabout and took me somewhere local. I cried and begged him not to kill me. I had noticed that he made no effort to hide his identity – no gloves, no mask, driving what I assumed was his car – he started it with a key at least! I was sobbing, but no longer wailing. It seemed so pointless to react, and I wanted to at least keep the violence to a minimum. I figured, if I shut my mouth and done what I was told, the best I could hope for was to be abandoned on the side of the road, rather than know my life will end and the last person I saw, spoke to, smelled, touched, heard, was going to be a rapist.

He stopped his car on the side of the road. It wasn’t secluded at all, but not a single car or person drove or walked past. I could see people walking their dogs in the field next to us as he touched my vagina. He pulled my trousers and my pants down, undone my bra and took my jumper off. I just stayed lifeless and still. He turned me around and I was facing the car window. I whispered a half-hearted plea as I felt his weight behind me, and he penetrated me. Not once, not twice, but three times. Once with his fingers, twice with his penis. He decided the car was not good enough for him to fulfil whatever needs it was. He had already asked where I live, and I had told him a pretty convincing lie, which was excellent news until he told me he was taking me to my flat. 

I thought of a plan, my kitchen was the first room you enter in the flat. Maybe I could just direct him to mine and I could find something to defend myself. I was very aware of the repercussions if I did, though. It could be used against me, or I could kill him and would have to live with that. I didn’t want to deal with it that way. He passed me a receipt to wipe the blood from my mouth with and pushed my head down on his penis while I was driving. I thought about my dog. My massive, loud mouthed, protective Rottweiler, Barney. He’s so soft and unthreatening but does have a mean bark that he likes to exercise a lot, and to the untrained visitor, may make him seem like an aggressive dog. He had given up with the idea of me pleasuring him, so asked me to touch myself. Which I did, unenthusiastically. He instructed me to sound like I’m enjoying myself. I did not make a sound.

I told him about the dog. I said, you can come in, but I will have to put my dog on the balcony. I was still crying, but was strangely calm, and I was trying to convince him that I was fine with everything that happened so he could trust me enough to carry out my plan. It was working. I said to him, why didn’t you just ask me for my number – it didn’t have to go like this. I didn’t mind, I was okay, and I was only crying because my lip hurt from being split where he hit my face. We pulled up at mine and I still had blood pouring down my face. He passed me some old water he found in his car which I pretended to drink; I didn’t trust what might be in it. He held my hand, which immediately prompted more wailing, and told me he was sorry for hurting me. I said, with the straightest face I could, that it doesn’t matter and not to apologise. 

A 3-4 minute walk from the car to my door, and then me finding my keys, at what was now around 8:30 in the morning, and not a single person walked past. I opened the door to the communal building. He followed. I walked up the three flights of stairs with my heart in my chest. He followed. I opened the door to my flat. He followed. I told him again, about the dog. ‘I’ll just be two secs’. I did not turn around. I have no idea if he had any weapons or picked up anything in the flat. My dog, the knob he is, sat there silent for the first time in his life. I opened the balcony door, straddled the banister while calling my dogs name, and tried to scale down the icy balconies to the bottom floor. I fell 45ft onto a concrete step in my neighbour’s garden, where she asked her oldest son to look after her toddler in their bedroom, and opened the door to let me crawl in. She heard the crunch of me fall before I had a chance to even knock. She called an ambulance and the response team were there in about 6 minutes.

I was strapped up and had my head in blocks and my back in a restraint. They cut my clothes off me and collected them for evidence. I had fat from my knee now outside my knee and I couldn’t stand up. I couldn’t feel anything except panic. I was blue lighted to a specialist hospital in London. A lot of what happened there is still a blur – they thought I had broken my back or my neck because of the fall. I kept screaming he’s going to kill my dog. 

After 48 hours’ worth of X-rays, it wasn’t as bad as they thought. I had a fractured wrist, a fractured elbow, 11 broken ribs, two large lacerations on my knee that would need stitches. My palms were heavily bruised, my face was too swollen to talk or eat so I was fed on a drip. My anus was torn from what he had done. I done everything I was advised by police and sexual health professionals. I followed every bit of advice, answered every question, took every tablet and had every swab.

They found him early the following morning. He was arrested. Once it came to his plea hearing, he pled not guilty – until hearing that there was CCTV footage of him kidnapping me. He changed his plea to guilty, and after a gruelling few months, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has a child, a girlfriend, a family that loves him and are still supportive of him and stood up in court to defend his character. He had not committed any other sexual offence that the police were made aware of but had a heavy string of robberies and burglaries. He had a chronic cocaine problem and used this as his defence. While listening to his solicitor trying to defend him, I thought of how difficult it has been, and how I should be proud that I saw this through to the end, to watch 20 years of his life be taken from him. To know that child will not have his rapist father around for the foreseeable future and would probably have a better chance in life without him. 

I find it difficult to talk about how it makes me feel, as I have been dissociating more and more since the attack, and no longer feel anything. But it has been hard. I no longer have any contact with my dad, who I was living with at the time. I have had to leave that household. I fell in love too quickly, and had my heart broken when he cheated on me during the trial. My role as a manager at work has been hindered massively, and I no longer have the confidence to run a sales office. I feel like I’ve lost my backbone, a lot of what made me me. My personality seems to have got lost. Most of the time I feel like I’m watching my life on TV – like I recognise and respond to what happens around me, but the more severe the incident, the less of a reaction I give. I rarely feel anything, or I do but can never pinpoint what has caused the emotion, which considering I was diagnosed with BPD 4-5 years ago, is surprising – I have always been very aware of my triggers. Every day is hard, but I can’t explain why. I just want to sleep. I feel like I could sleep for years.

I was diagnosed with PTSD yesterday. 

I am struggling, but I am getting psychological help. 

I’m sorry for the long read, but I wanted to share my story.

There isn’t really a TL;DR"
683,Internalized Fatphobia,"So, I have never been fat, but I believe I have internalized prejudice towards fat. I am not overtly fat phobic, but I have recently hit the epiphany that I am sabotaging my own sex life by eliminating potential dates over just a little fat. Not just dates either, but even escorts and others in the sex industry (like Onlyfans). This is not just in regards to obese people, or even chubby women... But if they aren't boney, don't have a notable thigh gap... I have no interest.

I think it is normal and okay to be attracted to thin women... But when I can't find someone small enough on various subreddits (like /Onlyfanspetite), Tinder, and porn sites; it is problematic. Has anyone else dug themselves in such a hole? How do I get out of it?"

687,"Going over interactions over, and over, ... and over. Please help.","So I have this strange problem (and have all of my life) where I get terrible anxiety after a situation has passed, and compulsively go over the same interaction in my head, namely: 
How it could've gone differently, 
How everyone else in the room will go on to perceive me, and 
How to rectify a slight fumble or correct my phrasing the next time I see that person. 

It tends to be pretty one-sided thinking. For example, I don't obsess over what the other person might say - only what I would say to elicit an ideal response.
It feels like any interaction that I don't feel 100% happy with when I walk away (or even sometimes when I do walk away comfortably) is a ""rough draft"" that needs constant revising until I can be sure that my message has come across in the way I intended for it to. Sometimes I do this with interactions that did go well, and it'll boost my mood for the rest of the day.

It's served me well in some situations, but the behavior feels obsessive and can be really intrusive to my life; it keeps me up at night, and feeds my insecurities about inadequecy. It happens mostly in reflection of interactions in my professional life. 

So I guess my question is does anyone else experience this obsessive behavior over their phrasing and how others perceive them? Does it have a name? Is it chronic overthinking, social anxiety, or something else? What can I do to stop myself from compulsively revising so many interactions in my head? And maybe, if it's possible to answer: why the heck do I do this?"

692,Hand plucking eyebrows compulsion?,"It’s a long read, I’m sorry. I don’t know if I explained everything correctly or used the right words so I apologise in advance. 

Hello, this is my first time on this subreddit and I’m not too sure if this is the right place to put this or not, but for the past, I’d say 2-3 years, I’ve hand plucked my eyebrows every time I’m just not feeling too great?
 I think it could be caused by stress since I’ve not been taught how to deal with it. But it’s gotten to the point where both my eyebrows don’t have that little end tail bit? To put it simply, you know when artists just do a little oval for the eyebrows? That’s literally what they look like.
I usually get the urge to pluck them when I look/think about school, homework or just anything that makes me feel unwell(?). When I start doing it I can’t stop, I have to force my hand down or play music though my earphones to distract myself, though it does always work. I don’t know what compels me to do it or why. It makes me feel horrible. It makes my stomach area feel like a spiral, just full of dread (I get that in the morning too). It’s not that it feels ‘good’ either, I hate it, but I’m still compelled to do it anyway. 
I don’t feel confident enough to talk about it to my parents, let alone anything that’s going on (they’re not bad people, I just don’t know how to speak about it to them). I know as soon as I start doing it I’ll be told to stop by my parents, my family has even tried making jokes about it to me too, but it all just makes me feel horrible and it makes that spiral feeling come back. I feel better with it at school since people have just been expecting me to do it? I don’t know, they don’t question me on it. To be honest, it makes me feel a lot better.
It was ok at the start of lockdown, when it started growing back, I found things that distracted me, but then homework started piling, more personal things started to happen, and now it’s probably at the worst it’s ever been. I personally haven’t been doing great either, I just wanna stop and create a whole different version of myself (but that’s something for a later date, plus it’s something I definitely don’t know how to word).
I’m not sure, it could just be nothing? I’m still a little bit anxious about it though. Umm well, I don’t know how to end this so... any advice? If any more info(?) is needed just ask."

704,Prolonged stress and work,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here but I was wondering if I could get some advice?

For months now I have been facing a number of personal and work-related stressors, and I feel I'm at breaking point. I feel the best option is to take sick leave (1 week+), but I'm afraid to take this step.

To summarise the situation:

My personal life: I've been dealing with anxiety for 5+ years, as well as misophonia for a good portion of that. Immediately before the pandemic I was attending cognitive behavioural therapy sessions under the NHS. When the pandemic hit the UK, I think I took things fairly well - although it was a stressful situation, I had a reasonably positive outlook and found solace in things being beyond my control. However, as time went on, the lack of freedom and the isolation began to take their toll on me. I'm generally quite poor at maintaining friendships, and this has been exacerbated by the pandemic, to the point that I have very few quality interactions with other people. I've also faced a lot of change during these months, moving house three times (from parents house, to girlfriend's, to parents, to my own place), and breaking up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years.

My work: I'm fortunate that I've remained employed throughout the pandemic, and even started a new job in July. The flip side is that I've been working consistently throughout it. My new job is with a startup and has had a steep learning curve. To add to this, we hit a crunch period about 2 months ago, barely 3 months into my new role. Since then every day has been as busy as the last, and I increasingly struggle to keep up. Since starting, I've taken a few days of leave - but excluding days off to cope with my break-up, and days off to move house, I'd say I've only really had 2 days of ""holiday"" since July. Wrapped around these holidays I would also work overtime to keep up with demand. The crunch continues, and I'm finding myself exponentially less productive, but more and more stressed, disengaged, and simply exhausted. My life feels like a non-stop grind - waking up, working, going to bed, etc. And yet I feel like I'm underperforming - rapidly flailing my arms in a body of water, but drowning. I have no energy to do anything and, most recently, I find it difficult for the working day to go by without me at least once standing in the shower crying.

The stress of the job is causing me to be depressed and anxious about my future career, financial situation, and overall happiness and wellbeing. It's also causing me to be resentful and to disconnect from my work and colleagues. At worst, I want to leave my job asap and even consider a different career path.

I now attend private therapy, and I've talked to my therapist about this for weeks on end now. She has suggested that I take sick leave. I have never taken sick leave for mental health before, and I feel tremendous guilt about such a thing. Previously I have taken a day or two of annual leave to attend to my mental health - and I find that, in the moment, this helps, but generally I come back feeling not much better than when I left. So I think I will need at least a week to reset myself.

But I struggle with taking this time off. It is a small team so my absence will have a notable knock-on effect, and we have a major deadline to reach before Christmas. Moreover, I see signs of burn-out in my colleagues and wouldn't want to burden them with any more stress. I also fear this will affect my reputation within the organisation.

What do you think? Should I request 1 week of leave, and what would be the best approach? Is 1 week long enough to overcome such overwhelm, or will I come back just as damaged as before?"
705,What can I do?,"Over the past year a problem has started to arise very slowly and subtle enough for me not to notice until now. I for some reason think people are constantly watching and judging me, even if they aren’t present. This is especially common when on my phone, I feel like my whole school, all my friends, almost everyone I know is watching. At first it was only for a single game I played where it massively effected the levels I played and eventually made be bored of the game. I had a running commentary in my head of what I was saying to everyone, like some sort of presentation and I would worry if I was doing something for too long they would get bored. But now I see it for almost every time I get on a digital device. My brother made fun on me earlier today because I put my hands up to show to my crowd that I wasn’t touching the keyboard even though I was on my own.
Idk if it links but I also have a tick disorder, while very minor ( not classed as Tourette syndrome ) i still get the odd week where I tick rather commonly. I get roughly 5 of these weeks every year.

I’ve looked up schizophrenia and i don’t think it’s that, I have never had any hallucinations. I think it may be paranoia though as I had problems in primary school with myself image as well as constant sleep problems.

The problem isn’t severe enough to effect my life much, I just don’t want it to progress. I just  don’t know what to do to make my self better.
Thanks for any feedback."

It’s been so hard, I can’t find the motivation to do anything, like at all. I can’t eat, sleep, focus, anything! My parents always say they understand what I’m going through but they don’t understand, they keep saying there’s no excuses.   

I told them I wanted to drop out, I would get a job, work on my mental health, and try to get my ged. I thought and still do think that was a pretty good plan. They yelled at me and said that’s what failures do or something along those lines and some other things I don’t really remember.   

My mom dropped out in like 8th grade and got her ged, I understand that they want better for me and that there’s only a couple of months left but I feel like working on my mental health is more important right now. I am on medication and in therapy but nothing seems to be working and I just want to kill myself even more.   

But yeah, it’s pretty much too late to make up all my missing work so I guess I’ll see what I do when the school calls my parents and I have a break down. Or I’ll break down when I finally log on today and see all the emails my teachers are sending me about notifying the school board of my lack of work. It’s all my fault in the end so oh well.

709,(24M) I NEED HELP,"Sorry, English is not my first language. I have been struggling with depression/anxiety since I was 18 years old, right after graduating high school. This 6 years have been full of depression (for different reasons) episodes that I have taken care of with 2 partial hospitalizations (2014, 2017) and 1 full hospitalization (2018) in a psych ward.

As of this moment of my life, I completed a B.A. in Public Relations and Advertising(2018) and I'm currently in my second year at Law School (2022 hopefully). I feel like this 6 years have passed by so fast and my best days are left behind. I really didn't make any friends in undergrad (just some acquaintances) because I was battling with depression episodes and Law School has been the same. No parties, no memories NOTHING. I've been working to be a productive/responsible professional. I get good grades, pay for my school and I've never been in any sort of legal/drug problem. 

At this moment of my life I'm realizing that I'm not young young anymore and hyperconscious of my mortality. I'M JUST TIRED of putting all this effort for nothing. I think I'm sure I don't like my degrees but I'm about to finish Law School so I'm not gonna dropout. I still live at home with my parents because they live close to campus and I commute (before rona). My mother is 60 and my father 78( they had me really late) and I get anxious about the fact that I'm going to be a young caregiver. I FEEL LIKE I'VE WASTED MY TIME and that my best years are left behind.

I've never had a girlfriend and I'm to insecure to date someone. I rejected my high school friends if they invited me to parties and I'm pretty much alone now. FUCK... I feel like a piece of shit right know because all I have done is being responsible academically with a bullshit degree and a soon to be completed law degree that I know I'm probably not gonna practice because I'm too anxious to litigate. 

I'm crying so much while typing this because  I feel hopeless and old. I've never done this but I don't have anyone to talk to. Please help and thank you so much in advance."
710,Mostly just a vent but also hoping for mental health at work advice,"I went to r/personalfinance in hopes of finding an option I hadn’t for my worsening situation but I was met with rudeness, misgendering, and a lot of finger pointing that I did not expect so I’m here now to hopefully feel better about it all.

I’ve always struggled with work, since my first job I’ve despised the shitty feeling of sitting in work’s restroom crying my eyes out but having to hide it the moment I stepped out. My current job is by far the best job I’ve had work wise since it’s no social interaction and just simple work I can listen to music or podcasts with but I still somehow find myself falling apart

It always curled back to this frustration with pay and my situation, I’m barely making it by month to month, work far out of town in a county with a higher minimum wage and just don’t know where to go from here

I have avenues forward but they are all riddled by tons of blind luck or impossible expenses. So it becomes far more tempting to simply stay at my current job and find ways to make it more tolerable. 

I’m not entirely sure what question I’m trying to have answered , i wish there were some huge option I am missing, I feel trapped and that this job is the best I’ll ever have and my brain starts down that spiral and I’m very quickly sobbing over top of my work.I already work with a therapist as often as I can afford but I still for some reason can’t handle it.

7 years spent practicing art and animation
Al for fucking nothing it seems

I want to do animation as a long term career but I currently see no escape from this minimum wage cycle. 

I hate that it feels my happiness and life fulfillment is being denied from my by shear luck.

So I guess If I had to have a question it would be where should I turn now. Depending on how capable of accommodating a schedule shift my current job is I might be looking at ANOTHER shitty minimum wage job. Should I continue this cycle and just try to focus on how to make it feel less garbage or is there a path forward I never considered that might be able to break me free from the grasps of these low pay jobs."
711,"Easily overwhelmed when having to decide what to occupy time with, but also overwhelmed with the tasks I give myself.. idk what to do","I’m 22, live with my parents and older brother. Not employed anywhere but do have passive income from a side hustle. I’m an artist of all sorts (like every medium, lol) &amp; I have a lot of trouble deciding what to do for the day, or even for the next few hours. 
I’m an extremely anxious person &amp; worry constantly. I’m also very indecisive &amp; an HSP (highly sensitive person), along with having ADHD. 
Planning things out is a difficult task for me, especially because if I do write out tasks/to-do list for the day, I almost always don’t follow it all the way through. I may start with one task but my ADHD makes it difficult to make myself do something I’m not intrigued by, aka not stimulating enough. But I also struggle with depression, which can also make it hard for me to even get something done, because you know, “what’s the point”.

Crying is my go-to reaction for most things that are stressful to me, it’s just how my body deals with the stress. Though thankfully it does help release the built up stress, but I think I’m stressed like all the time that at any moment I can seriously just start balling my eyes out. Like dropping a pen can make me stressed, especially when I’m trying and focusing really hard on what I’m doing, that one little thing can make me ‘explode’ with crying. During the cries it does feel shitty, like the sadness is real and is there—which often times can prolong my cries because when I hear someone cry (even myself) it makes me sad as well, and so the cycle continues. And even at times I have like no patience for my cries so as I cry I sometimes get angry at myself for crying because it’s exhausting as well as wastes a lot of time. 

Also, if I do plan a schedule for the day, I even get overwhelmed at what i have to accomplish, even if it’s just cleaning my room. It’s like if I’m given a task, I can’t complete it because I’m overwhelmed at the task, but if I don’t have a schedule I’m overwhelmed with having to decide what to occupy my time with. I feel the need to complete things everyday because I’m not attending college (a dropout) &amp; I don’t have a “real job” , and so I feel worthless if I’m not occupying my time well. 
The only thing that has helped me lessen that ‘need to always be doing something’ has been cannabis, but I hate to have to rely on a substance to make me feel not as anxious &amp; overwhelmed."

713,Euphoria just put words to how I feel,"(TW: suicidal ideation)

I (19f) was recently told I may have bipolar disorder (I was previously diagnosed with clinical depression), so I started looking at examples of accurate depictions of mental illness in TV/movies to try to understand it better. One I recently binged was Euphoria, and wow, I have never felt more seen than I do in Rue.

In the most recent episode that just came out last night (it’s like a bridge episode between the seasons), Rue says how she just “doesn’t feel like she’s gonna be here very long.” And that’s... how I have always felt.

For as long as I can remember, I have felt like my life is going to be short. I never thought I’d live to be 18, and even now I can’t imagine living to be 20, or 30, or 40. I just don’t feel like I’m meant to be here. It’s like I’m not supposed to be here, like I’m just taking up space with all of my problems. And I’ve never been able to find a way to express that before. So I just wanted to share it here. I hope this makes sense to someone."

716,How would you like teachers support you? [advice for soon-to-be teacher],"Hey guys. I hope this is not a weird question to ask.

I am currently in university to become a teacher and I will soon start my practical time. Since day one it had been my goal to be a teacher the students can feel safe around and feel supported by. I suffered from depression my teenage years and had teachers who were so helpful to me (which tbh is one of the reasons I'm still alive nowadays), which is what inspired me to become a teacher essentially. 

However, I ""only"" really dealt with depression and panic attacks and don't have much first hand experience of other disorders/ilnesses etc. University sadly didn't provide us useful resources, we were only taught that students with mental illnesses/learning difficulties exist and we should find ways to approach them... but never taught us how.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to go a very broad road and just... ask people who actually have first hand experience. 

If you live with autism, learning difficulties, mental illnesses or other issues you'd wanted to be considered by teachers (being trans, having a hard home life, being bullied etc) please let me know if you have any advice for me to approach and help students with similar issues. Because I know from first hand experience that teachers sadly don't get taught on such matters and if you don't have first hand experience with these things yourself, you really just have to figure out on your own."

719,Am I the only one who doesn't know if they are depressed?,"I am 16f, living in the UK. 

I've felt depressed before but have never seeked actual help or been diagnosed because my depressed feelings are so layered. Every autumn/winter I get hit with a wave of general fatigue, lack of motivation to do anything. I get incredibly stressed, pick at my acne or eczema and my immune system gets weaker.  When I recognise that I do feel depressed, it's usually a new low point in my life, and because I have never been diagnosed before, just accept that what I am feeling now is depressed, and that what i was feeling a month ago, a few months ago was not depression but being just sad. But it's been 3 years of just endless cycles. I say to myself 'I am definitely depressed right now, my life has gotten much worse from the last time i thought i was depressed'. Until the next time I feel depressed, I'll say the same thing, 'I'm definitely depressed. Atleast i had XYZ the last time I said I was depressed, now I have nothing'. It's been so long I've been questioning whether I have been depressed it's hard to distinguish my feelings of sadness between just being sad or being depressed.

When I go through a period of feeling depressed, it feels like that becomes the new normal - like I am used to feeling this way to the point where I accept that I'm not depressed. The next time I hit a new low point, I accept that I am depressed, not the constant low feeling I experience before. I genuinely have no idea how I feel, because the next time I'll hit a new low point, I'll have convinced myself that my past experiences of 'depression' were just me overreacting or just being sad."

723,Why do I hate myself so much?,"I just really, really hate myself, and I just don't know what to do about it.
Deep down, I know I'm not so bad. I have achieved many things in life such as getting exceptional grades even when there wasn't much support, and gene-wise, I don't have it so rough either.
But, I just can't stop pulling myself down. I compare myself to my favorite actors, hating the fact that I wasn't born with those special genes and that I got the short end of the stick in life. I obsess over my weight;, sometimes I'm too fat, sometimes I'm not curvy enough. My grades are just not enough and I feel so much more inferior than those who achieved less. I'm taking a year off of school, and I'm just scared to go back to my studies because I just know I'm going to realize I'm a goddamn idiot, or thay I might get a question wrong and beat myself up for it. No matter what I do, where I go, I find a reason to be miserable and hate myself.
I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to hating myself at this point. I'm even scared that this is part of my identity now. I'm scared that if I stop torturing myself, I will become nothing.
I am destroying myself. Whag should I do? Any subreddits I could get help from? Thanks guys."

727,I just realized that I’m almost totally alone in quarantine,"Hey all. All my friends from high school and I distanced as we changed, as well as three of my good friends (one turned into someone I can’t be around, one ghosted me randomly, and another seems to be slowly ghosting me but I think she’s going through something). I only really have two true real friends/important people left, my good friend from the UK and my girlfriend (we were best friends for 10 years and started dating). I have two real people in my life, and since they have their own lives (as they should, everyone needs their own life) we can’t talk all the time. When I’m not talking with them, I feel empty and alone, like I’m vibing off of our interactions to build a personality and identity. I’m not always like this, I just feel alone.

It hurts even more when I see other people have like, lots of friends and have full social lives, going out and enjoying life. Doing that in quarantine is stupid and dangerous, but it still hurts to see people living their lives and expressing themselves, while I’m more or less alone. I’m sorry if this is just a huge rant, I need to get this off my chest. School going to shit, and my depression and anxiety is getting worse right now."
728,How I lost 60 pounds in just 60 days(Must watch),[removed]
729,Possibly Mental Health Discrimination? Looking for advice.,"Looking for advice. A few months back I tried to switch my zoloft prescription over from a psychiatrist to my pcp. There is a psychiatrist shortage in my area, and I was only going every three months, just to check in and get another few months worth of meds. I decided that, since I had been on the medication for over a year at that point (and because two of my close family members are also on it, same dosage, and have been for years), that I probably could just consolidate that into my healthcare plan with my pcp. General Practitioners and family doctors regularly prescribe zoloft when necessary; this is not a new thing, and this drug is very common. Also, having a pcp prescribe means that a) I don't have to pay another 40 dollar copay, just to say, ""yes, its going fine"" and b) the psychiatrist can then take on another patient, perhaps one more in need. I closed the account with the mental health place, and called my doctor's office, saying that I wanted to move the prescription over, and have my doctor continue it. Yes, I totally understand now, that that was the wrong order of operations, and I know better now. Anyway, I called the doctor's office, a practice with several doctors, and explained the situation. The receptionist simply said to me ""Dr. \*\*\*\*\* doesn't prescribe that."" Nothing more. I asked why, and she got aggressive about it, but still would not explain. I asked to speak to my doctor, thinking that if she realized that it was just a simple low dose of a common medication, that things might be different. But she wouldn't take the call. I was upset and had no idea what to do. I was crying in the car, because I had a week's worth left (yes, poor planning, I realize now, def won't do that again), and I was dreading how I would feel if I went off the medication. Its not for everyone, but it has worked wonders for me. My partner suggested we go to the office and make her speak to me, but this was in the second week of March, 2020, when Covid was really ramping up, so I was anxious about that, and also knew that if I had to go face the people who had shut me down like that, I would end up just sobbing, and then they would take me even less seriously. So my lovely partner went in to talk to them on my behalf. A few things here: I'm a woman, partner is a man, we were not married at the time. My partner went in and advocated for me, saying I needed this medication. He won, and she relented, saying she would prescribe it, but only until I found a new doctor. He also was not given any explanation of why she had refused to prescribe these meds without even speaking to me. Its months later now. I finally found a doctor who fits my needs. Never, in any of these months, did my former doctor, or her office, contact me in any way to tell me why this simple request had been denied. I also was not referred to a different doctor, ever. When I told this story to my new doctor, she looked horrified, saying that doesn't make sense, and that its a very common drug, even going so far as to check what my former doctor's specialty was (internal medicine). I will add here that zoloft also doesn't have a high instance of abuse, because its a drug that builds up in your system, not a quick happy pill. So, what all of this comes down to is this:  It feels very much like my former doctor behaved unethically here. The medical group that the practice is a part of has a list of patient rights on its website and a few of the points talk clearly about the patient's right to clear communication about their care. I know, at least, that she didn't communicate, and I am planning to write the the medical group (UPMC), requesting she receive some sort of discipline and maybe be required to attend some sort of sensitivity training. What I am asking here is, did she break a law? It seems like no, but I figured I would check, just in case. Also, where can I find Pennsylvania mental health discrimination information? It feels like this is mental health discrimination, but I don't know if that lines up the law. Anyway, I'd appreciate any thoughts on the subject that might help me get some sort of result. I don't need her to be fired, just want to make sure she is prevented from treated other patients in this way. Thanks!"

733,My therapist is a sneaky bitch and I am dumb,Today I told my therapist about how I was thinking about unaliving me on monday last week. He was worried and called my psychiatrist to get me a emergency appointment right after therapy. He told me it was for getting medication. So I went there and then my psychiatrist told me he is going to call an ambulance for me and take me to hospital right now. Because you can't treat unalive thoughts with medication... I made it home and didn't go to hospital but now I realized my therapist tricked me going to my psychiatrist so that he won't have to call the ambulance because it would ruin our 'relationship between therapist and client'. I am soooooo dumb. How did I not realize... I'm literally so mad at my therapist.
734,I can not stand hearing others being praised for their physical beauty. What is wrong with me?,"For some reason or another, whenever I hear someone being genuinely complimented for their appearance, I feel a sting in my heart and feel somehow threatened. I generally like to think of myself as a decent person that does not get jealous easily, but unfortunately I have deep-rooted insecurities regarding my own looks that I have a lot of trouble properly coping with, and it consequently seems to heck me up as a person. The other day, my mom was talking about my cousin and how pretty she is. I tried to react positively on the outside, but I think something manifested in my expression that showed that I was actually bothered, and my mom took notice of it.

I need to face the fact that there will be people that excel in certain areas of life, or happen to have more than I do, I can't go on like this! Maybe accepting that others will be better than me will help with my insecurities. Does anyone else experience similar feelings or know how to address them constructively?"
735,Do I need to seek professional help?,"It's hard to describe the problem when you know it's wrong but you're unable to do anything about it. I need to give some background info before I get into the whole situation.I'm 24(M) who recently moved into my parent's house because after a 2 year battle, my mom passed away in July, leaving my dad completely destroyed. They were the perfect couple, started dating in their early twenties, got married 3 months after meeting each other and lived one of the most amazing lives together. Never seen my parents fight, or even have a heated argument, it was always so smooth and perfect, the definition of a happy marriage in my eyes, but my mom was in control of everything in our house, while dad was just working his blue collar job making money for the family.

At the beginning of summer my Mom was placed in home hospice care. She was unable to eat, got all of her nutrition through a tube. I had to clean her up from time to time, she was constantly throwing up what ever she was getting through the IV, it destroyed seeing the most important woman in my life  in such a condition. I tried to spend as much time as possible but my dad's job depends on my job, and I can't leave the office even with the pandemic, I was unable to work remotely and needed to be out of the house, where my mom spent so much time alone.

Before her health started deteriorating, I was in the process of starting up a small business that would involve my dad as well, I had my own place, had plans for the future, but now everything crumbled up like crackers. Moving back in has kind of killed my enthusiasm to do anything in life. I went to being a lazy slob who sits in his room, enjoys marijuana too much and just mellows out, waste of space. I tried losing weight, working out, walking, running, cooking, changing eating habits, but I can't seem to get anything to stick, I just end up with me going back to being useless and lazy.

The main reason for the post is something that I've been experiencing ever since I was on my knees next to my moms casket begging for forgiveness about how she passed away. I always thought that I could've done better, that i will find a doctor for my mom who will make her better, but her health was going down not by days but hours. She was hospitalized one time due to lack of oxygen in her blood, when she was admitted to the hospital she had to spend at least 2 days there under watch and the second day she called me mid day and cried for help, cried to get me to pick her up and take her away back home or at least come visit her, but i was unable to due to Covid restrictions. I was unable to be there with her when she begged and cried for me to be there. I think everything inside of me died that day and i wanted to disappear from this world when i had my Mother who raised me, who made sure everything about me was perfect before she started worrying about her, cry for help to pick her up, to be there with her and I couldn't do nothing about it. My parents are immigrants who do not speak English and I had to be with my mom to the every doctors appointment and translate everything that I've heard to my mom or dad. Every single time we went in, there was bad news. We went in with hopes and come back with nothing but dread. Every scan brought in more bad news, every test came back in the worst way possible. No treatments were available for the genetical mutation of what she had. There was 1% chance of survival, but doctors said it's just so people don't lose hope. Everything i've heard, i had to tell her. Tell my dad, but i had to pretend to be strong.

Now, everything that happens to me I think is a result of her passing. If I'm lazy and I get off my bed to go pickup some snacks or something, I'll trip on an extension cord and I'll think it's my mom punishing me for being lazy. If I go wash the dishes and I get my shirt wet, it's my mom punishing me for making such a big pile and not doing it earlier. I'll hit my head when stepping walking past a doorway i've walked a million times past and never hit my head - it's my mom punishing me.

Everything bad that is happening in my life is my mom punishing me for it.I have so many things bottled up and every time I feel it coming and that I'm about to let go, I suck it up and pretend nothing happened. I'm lost, I lost my mom who I'll never see again, who guided me through so many things, helped me through so many breakups, through a failed engagement, through stressful jobs, she was my teacher in school, one of the most respected teachers, she was active, always ready to help, always will put someone else problems in front of hers, never complained, she was so perfect and i failed her. And now she's punishing me.

I only have two sources of support, my significant other who is 4500 miles away, and my best friend. When my SO was 8, she lost her mother to breast cancer, so she knows what it feels like to lose someone as important, but she was in a different age group when she did so our situations as similar but different. I have not opened up to them about how I feel punished by my mom because i don't want to scare them, because i know this is not healthy, but i know thell'll support me with every cell of their bodies, but i don't want them to carry this burden.

Given the situation, just having the courage to post this up, i know the answer is yes, i know i should get help, but where and how should i start?I want to be mentally healthy and capable, not who i am today."
736,I just want to tell someone,"I am living in what seems like hell, solely perpetuated by my own inadequacy and delusion. I can be no more than my ability to act allows, effectively rendering me incapable of anything except dreading the next inevitable failure. The fact I regard my own insignificant depressing situation as a form of hell is ridiculous, showing further my inability to properly assess any actual real situation with a mindset. I personally cannot tell if my mindset is atypical. It is irrelevant either way as I'm still in this situation and still dealing with it terribly. In reality this should be done weeks ago. Yet I knew that then as well as I do now. I'm trying to work at it currently with the time I do have but I find myself unable to bear to doing it. Its almost painful. I think its due to shame of it. I don’t feel like I’ve disappointed anyone, or rather I that’s not my main issue that’s causing this horrible feeling. I find it’s a lot more to do with my own disappointment in myself. I know well what I can do, what I’m in theory capable of. It’s almost humorous how I consistently put in little to no effort in things that I am able to recognize as incredibly important for me in life. I suppose I do know exactly the problem, incredibly clearly at that. It is just that I am ashamed to admit it to myself. The truth is more and more apparent as I face issue after issue improperly and terribly. It’s not that I am unable for some medical or divine reason. I actively avoid any help that requires any amount of effort, or that would require me to do anything. I actively take advantage of any slack given to me, and I possibly think this is the reason for me to be wondering about the abnormal side of my mental. Abnormal or not I am consciously a foil to myself.

It isn’t any abstract problem it seems, just sheer laziness and the ability to take advantage of others. This is a large part of me, and one that dominates my daily life. It’s the truth, and the truth hurts a lot. So much that I will find any excuse to lie to myself so I can deny this. There is a kinder person within me, but I fear it will always be dominated by my own tendency towards avoidance and manipulation. Even now that description bothers me as it gives me an out as a tortured soul. In reality I am trapped by my own self-hatred. I hate myself for who I am really am when it comes down to it. The only exception I encounter is when I have social pressures on me, which has propelled my own education and social life so far, but now this year I have been able to slink away from others view to simply fester in my own self-pity. I would ask for help but I know well that it will do nothing. Or rather, I will do nothing after lying to everyone, including myself that I will. The one thing I will allow myself is that I am sad. Its one thing I know I am. Things alleviate it and I believe it’s the reason I spend so much time distracting myself on my phone or with others. I think this sadness is rooted in my own immense disappointment in myself and how I have lived and how I currently live. I guess it is what it is.

I wrote to throw my feelings onto a page and said i post it somewhere so I might get some feedback maybe. I hope someone replies. Thanks for reading I think anyone actually reading this might help a lot. Sorry if this isn't the right sub for this."

738,Manipulative coworker - Panic attacks,"Recently, I have been interacting with a coworker on a new project. Whenever we sit down to discuss work, he expresses his anger towards the new head of department because he has been told that he will not be promoted and because he did not get an open manager position.  Furthermore, he resents that another contractor is being recognized for leadership prospects by the head of department, while he, a full time employee, isn’t. Off late, he has been ranting about how the head of department wants to outsource all the work and keeps telling me that I should look for a new job. He also said that even my teammate knows about the outsourcing plan, so I called my teammate to verify and he seemed clueless about it. Furthermore, I just learnt that my contract has been extended and there is a plan laid out for the first two quarters for my team. The news of work getting outsourced was what led to a panic attack and I went to the hospital. I got a blood work and ekg done and everything seemed normal. I need some advise on how to deal with this coworker. Every time I speak to him, it’s always some reference about getting fired and it makes me anxious.

My girlfriend was the one who got told this and she told me and I don't know if he really wants me to know about it so I decided to pretend to not know about it (Only my GF, my friend and my friends mom knows about this). He has been really down and sad in school so it's noticable and he has said multiple times he can't sleep anymore and when I ask what's wrong he just tries to play it off. Since I've noticed this alot I just try to support him but in a way that is kind of unsuspicious in a way but I want help on how to support him so that he doesn't find out I already know and loses the trust of my GF because he really doesn't need that right now.

Anyways, if someone could help me out a little it'd be great but if not I understand because it's a confusing situation but, Thanks anyways!"
741,anyone know the answer to this,[deleted]
742,yoyoyo,short post. im so close to kms im legit done for good
743,Might be ruining my relationship due to alcohol/my unstable mental health,"TL,DR: I worry my ever fluctuating mental health is sabotaging my relationship as well as a possible drinking problem that’s developing. Can’t get help without risking my career but if I don’t get it soon I’ll probably kill myself to be candid. Not sure how to bring this up to my s/o. 

Let’s just be honest I drink to cope with my emotions because I don’t know how to handle them even at 20 years of age. My mental health has been a very big struggle lately because I’ve been going through a lot of big life changes non stop for about 2 years and it’s very hard and stressful. I get the feeling I have some sort of personality disorder/high functioning depression type thing going on, but I can’t seek treatment due to the nature of my career. My s/o is basically the only one I can lean on but I have a hard time leaning on them for support because of past relationships and how heavily they fucked with my head. I’ve been doing really shitty the past few days and I can feel it taking a toll on my partner but I don’t know how to address it to them. I want to be better for them because they deserve so much but I feel stuck. Do I chose my career or my mental health? To be honest I’m not sure how much longer I can take living like this because I’m frequently very close to killing myself. 
How do I choose to cope with all this? Alcohol of course which is very unhealthy I know but it’s so hard to stay away from, it provides that temporary relief you know? Honestly I know I have some sort of drinking problem, I don’t spend every moment drunk but I binge drink heavily when I do decide to get drunk. I have a feeling this is effecting my s/o because the next day things always feel weird between us, it’s like I can feel the tension through the phone. Maybe it’s the way I act when I drink or the things I say I’m not really sure. Alcohol only worsens my rapidly changing mental health and it fluctuates when I get hammered very fast. Which makes it damn near impossible to hold a conversation with my partner. It’s important that I can because unfortunately it’s a long distance relationship right now, they’re coming to visit me in a few days and I hope I haven’t sabotaged it already because I really do love them and I would hate myself if I hurt them. 
I guess the point is my mental health is fucked and I really want to get help but I feel like I can’t. I want to quit drinking and be better but it’s so hard and I can’t find the motivation to do it, kinda like the pain that it brings. 
Not sure how to address this fully with my s/o because they sort of already know but not fully. It’s silly part of me doesn’t even want to trust them which is dumb because logically I could trust them with anything but my brain says “you can’t trust them with shit they’re just going to leave you” then it makes me look like a dick. But oh well, I guess it’ll work out right?"
744,Just a vent and asking for some help about hallucinations..,"Hey, a little background of me is that i was sent to a mental hospital at 12 and stayed in therapy for many months. It's been a while since then but I faked my way through it because I was sick of being there and only feeling worse. I have only tried to kill myself twice by overdosing. They both went undiscovered until I was sent to a mental hospital from a police officer saying I tried to kill somebody. I had tried to kill my dad after all my suffering. I haven't regretted it since then and can I just say how much I hate people. I can never sleep well from my constant nightmares, my hallucinations are making me lose sight of the real world, and I can not stop planning to kill myself. Is anyone suffering from hallucinations that can help me? I still can't figure out the difference between hallucinations and reality."
745,I did it !.Wrote about psychosis on my blog.,Check out jayceepassionblog.com if you want to find out more.
746,Is it stupid too feel lonely when I have good friends?,I don’t know I have really good friends who I hang out with a lot I just don’t ever really talk about like my personal problems or anything with them because not that they don’t care I just see most of them as the type of people who don’t really want to listen to me talk about my problems and I don’t want to talk to them cause I’m afraid they gonna think like why do I have to listen to this cause they probably have their own problems they are dealing with at least that’s what I think it makes me feel lonely sometimes when I’m not with them and I don’t really have anyone else to talk to but maybe that’s my fault for not trying to say something this post is me rambling a lot cause I feel like there’s an easy solution I’m just not taking and my thoughts are kinda all over the place
747,Seeking some advice,\---
748,What's a helpful way not to equate one's self worth with productivity?,"I have a hard time forgiving myself for not getting as much done in a day as I think I should. This is especially true right now, as I'm currently unemployed due to COVID. I apply for 3+ jobs per week but otherwise time can feel so amorphous being at home all day."
749,How do I quit working for my friends mum,"I’ve been working at a Cafe for a while now and then lockdown happened and it closed. I low-key hate working there. Cafes aren’t really my thing. It makes me so stressed and 90% of the time there I want to cry, not because of my coworkers but because of the general public and the stress and the fact that I can’t hold my hands still so I get laughed at when I walk a tray out soaked in coffee. 
My friend (calling him that for ease) got me the job with his mum back when I really needed the money, needed it to get to college and you know.. eat, but now I have a proper contract job and full time education so I don’t need it anymore and I don’t want to work there either but she is my friends mum how the fuck do I tell her I don’t want to work for her anymore.
I’m 18 and have a hard time saying no to adults. 
If anyone has any advice for this it would be grand.

Note: sorry if this is the wrong place to post it I didn’t know where the best place to ask for advice was from so I thought because it’s partially mental health themed this would work. Sorry if it’s wrong I’m just a dummy lmao"
750,"I got in someone’s way once today, and now I feel like they hate me","What a stupid thing to be worried about. I doubt getting in someone’s way once would automatically cause them to dislike you, but still I feel like that’s the case here. It sucks when you know your thought pattern isn’t rational, but you still believe those negative thoughts because there’s that small possibility that they’re true."
751,Where do people get their passion from?,"It's the end of the term at my college, and one of our professors had everyone discuss their projects for the course. Everyone seemed... so interested, like legitimately taking pleasure in it, asking questions, or even adding more stuff unto it, meanwhile, I just wanted to be done. 

I have no passion with any of my work, I never have, school for me has always been tedious, work is tedious, I just do it to get it done and go home to sleep but people around me, they seem to legitimately care about the stuff they do, my coworkers talk about their projects with such sincere joy, I can't imagine having that kind of passion. How do you guys care so much? How do you not just see this as work? 

People have suggested trying subjects I enjoy but... I just don't get it, it could be the most ""fun"" project idea and I would still rather just be done with it and never pay it a second thought... how do you all do it?"
752,I don't see it,I don't see how anyone would ever come close to liking an insane autistic person like me.
753,So I have 6 months left of being a kid. What do I do?,"I spent most of my time up until now either being bullied by classmates, hardly fitting in, which most of the time resulted in me simply giving up and isolating myself, or disagreeing with my dad on pretty much everything. I have very litle things that I can truly say I enjoyied or times I can reminisce on. Most of the time the people that were there on those times and occasions will say they did their best to make these moments true and that I'm just ungrateful for their work. This has put me at a state where my little happy memories have either turned into unhappy ones or have been submerged inside the sea of other unhappy memories. Because of the stupid educational system in my country, all 3rd year high school students have to attend national university entrance exams if they want a chance to actually do something in thier lives and study someplace not bad. So here we are... 5 months before these exams, quarantined until January 2021. I also have to study for those exams with this mindset of mine on a daily basis. I actually like studying and like the subjects themselves, but doing this every day with nobody to relax with, talk to and generally relate with is very lonely. And then there's quarantine. While I was unable to fit in before, it is now PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT IN.  It feels like I've never been a kid since most of my ""nostalgic memories"" are full of but's and actually's and the most prominent memories are negative ones. I don't know what can I do while I'm still a kid but I don't want to let that tine go to waste... I really don't know where to post this. I refuse to call myself depressed since I'm not always this negative and didn't go through stuff like parrents arguing with eachother or racism. But it's not just a vent either so I didn't wanna post it in the respective subs. If you red so far then thanks."
754,People are full of shit,"So quick rant. No one cares about mental health. I try to reach out to NHS and they refuse to improve my meds and told me they have to wear off on having an effect for my mania, psyhcosis and depression before they look at changing them.

I reach out to my friends and no one will actually talk about it. The ones I thought would, just pretend to give a shit but want to get out of the conversation asap. 

I have lost my life because of my last episode. My house, my friends, my partner, nearly my job. Idc for most of it, I'll make it back up. But I had a full split from reality, wasted my savings and full on psychosis on and off over months changes your view on yourself and the world.

I admittedly have been a dick in the past to a lot of my old friends, some of which I tried to talk to as I thought they would understand, but they've all moved on with their lives whilst I'n stuck in this cycle and it seems like I can't improve as a person. Haven't improved anything about myself since I was a kid. I'm now in my 20s. 

The same people I reach out to are the ones who will be the first to share posts about ""I would rather hear your story than attend your funeral."" I'm just realising that doesn't matter if they won't attend your funeral anyway. 

No one really gives a shit until they can put a post off an old photo of you on social media saying ""Miss you so much"""

758,Panic attack,"Alright hear me out, posted here few days ago and I’m back, I’m not sure if facebook ahas an algorithm for people your friends interact with most (when you click there profile the people who they talk to will be first on there friend tab thing) is this true? Because when i view my girlfriends she has a guy on there and when i view his my girlfriend is first on his too? Does this mean there talking to eachother alot? Aka cheating? I accused her of cheating yesterday and she said she would never do such a thing and she was genuinely upset but now my hearts racing and I can’t exactly confront her about it after accusing her of cheating because then i might ruin things? Someone help please!"
759,what illness does this child have,"she’s a child my mum started taking care of. she’s around 9 years old and she 

1. randomly stares and laughs at things around her
2. needs to wear a diaper 
3. keeps repeating the same 3 sounds (kinda like tourettes)
4. hasn’t spoken a word yet 
5. her mum said she tried to randomly strangles herself and jump of high places
6. can’t stay still at ALL.. ( while writing this she got off the bed and tried to climb the stairs like 12 times) 

pls lemme know what it is i’m very curious"
760,Food problems? ED warning?,"I don’t know if this is the right place but it’s kinda about my mental health but in the past 2 years from ages 18 to 20 I’ve gained quite some weight, I use to be a size 4/6/8 all round, and now I’m having to buy size 12/14. I was always skinny as a child and my family always said “where does she put it” because I always have ate a lot but now it’s starting to show, I really struggle dieting and going to the gym because I make excuses like I’m too busy with uni, or I’ll start next week, a cheat meal, a cheat week, but every time I eat I can’t stop the thoughts of wanting to make myself sick, I feel like I need to throw up to get the food out of me, I’ve never done it I know it’s bad and harmful but I feel like I’m becoming closer and more desperate, I’m only writing this because I actually went to my toilet sat in front of it and just stared at it for a bit and gave up arguing with my self and went back to bed. I don’t want to do this to myself, but everything I eat the guilt that riddles me is stupid. I don’t know if there’s anything to help and anything I can do to get out this mind set. I can’t really tell anyone, I’m a loud jokey non serious bubbles person, and I think people wouldn’t take it serious or think I’m attention seeking. 

Just any advice or help would be useful please, thankyou"
761,I don’t know,"I feel like everything I do is pointless. I don’t feel like anything I do helps. I feel like it doesn’t matter what I do. I feel like I don’t have passion for my job or my education. I don’t think I did anything right. I’m 25 and, even though I know that the four year plan for school is a joke, I feel like I’m failing at something. I don’t think my boyfriend really wants to have a life with me because it feels like we’re stagnant. I don’t know who to talk to about this and I don’t know how to deal with this."
762,Can brain cysts permanently destroy emotions/feelings?,"Around 5 years ago when I was around 15 years old I fell deeply into mental numbness and anxiety. It came so fast and made no sense at all to me so I for a long time tried seeking help since not even time could heal the numbness. Only around last year I got a brain scan that showed that I have a cyst that is pushing on my cerebellum. It wasn't deadly and the doctors made the decision that I didn't need to remove it. So at least i'm not dying.

But does this mean that I won't return to my post-numb mental state? Am I stuck like this forever?"
763,I suspect my ex fiance may have bipolar disorder,"My(35f) ex-fiance(36m) and I met thru a mutual friend 6 months ago and instantly clicked. Our relationship was amazing. He proposed a month ago and I said yes. One day he was talking to me normally (I love you's, jokes, etc) the next day he went ice cold. He was breadcrumbing me with ""You don't deserve this""  - ""I'm sorry for shutting you out"" - ""I'm not in a good place right now"" 

He then ended our engagement over a text, he kept apologizing but refused to meet me in person. He'd answer calls but never call back to discuss. This was going on for a few weeks. Finally after a heated back and forth the other day, I calmed down and thought about everything he was saying and his behavior and it hit me.

I don't say this lightly and I'm not a medical professional but I have family members and old friends who have bipolar disorder, it makes sense. Even his incredibly good moods, extremely high energy, taking so much on his plate happily, he seemed like a man who couldn't be stopped. Then this extreme shift to the point he can't even face me. Also remember he mentioned being on meds last year but stopping because he felt like a zombie, it all clicked now. 

I texted him and apologized for being angry and that I believed he wasn't in a mentally healthy place right now and that I wished good health for him. 

I still love this man and I would absolutely be there for him, but I'm not exactly sure how. 

I plan on giving him space but should I reach out in a few weeks to check on him? 

tl;dr I suspect my ex fiance has bipolar disorder and I still love him but I'm not sure if I should leave him alone or reach out in some time"
764,I'm so fucking angry all the time,"My name's Кира or Kira I'm a 20yr old from Russia who teaches high school music.

So here, I am in a difficult situation rn and go through phases of depression and anger, so long story short my stepfather abused me and my other siblings whom I live with now and I don't know if that's a factor to anger but it is a factor in my depression. As I said, I work in a school and am never angry in there for some reason. I've also started to have trust issues aswell and social issues too, if a person said hello to me on the street I'd probably end up saying fuck off or something horrible like that, my older sister does it aswell. I just want to know anything, anything that may be a factor. Ask any questions as I'm concerned for mine and my sisters well-being. Thanks, also any help for depression and anxiety would be appreciated"
765,:( funeral,I am going to my “partners” funeral tomorrow. I still am in shock and denial and I’m really scared. How can I prepare myself for this
766,I keep wanting to do everything in what limited time I have,"I can't seem to focus on anything anymore. One moment I'm listening to a song, I'll stop it half way, then decide to watch a video. I'll stop that video a quarter of the way through because then I feel like I want to talk to someone or do another task. I'll keep piling all of these activities up to a point, where I'll fret and burn myself from trying to handle too much. I'll have so many things left untouched and unfinished, I would have convinced myself that I'll have no time for them when I really did.

It's even worse when I know I have things to do, they'll either get put off or be done a little progress of the way before being ignored for no reason.

I'm tired of this flipping in between activities."

770,in a real messed up spot right now,"okay so im struggling with what feels like a lot right now: possibly adhd depression and gender dysphoria but im not gonna sit here self diagnosing.

My problem: I fit in nowhere. I feel like i have all 3 of the above conditions but i check out for none of them. I went to get checked for ADD. Didn’t get diagnosed because there apparently was no proof in my youth. I can’t focus on ANYTHING in my life right now. My last grandparent had to get moved out her house because her last days are getting near, and the whole family is up in arms about. Except me, i haven’t even seen her in 3 months. Everyday i go to school and my job and the whole day i’m just laughing with people but then i get home and i just feel so shit. I am not faking laughing and having fun but it feels like it. And im so exhausted, soooo exhausted all the time no matter how much i sleep.

I cant focus on school because 1 i 100% have add and 2 im in the midst of a fucking gender identity crisis right now and this is a really important year and im fucking everything up, but shit don’t matter any more. I feel like i care but it’s mostly just not mattering any more. I don’t make an effort to hang out with friends anymore, i don’t get the same joy out of activities i used to and i just have so much problems and no one to talk tooo!!!! all i got is fucking internet strangers

and i hate myself so much for being trans. Nobody likes trans people and neither do i. Seriously if i got diagnosed with GD,i don’t what i’d do: transition and be miserable or just fucking kill myself already so i don’t have to go through a different version of hell omg im just so fucking tired of all this shit and i cant talk to no one about this HOWW DO I FIX MYSELF!!!!!?!!! b"
771,How do you get over not being able to accomplish your dreams/goals?,"One of my biggest dreams in high school was to graduate early, just like a year early. My reason for this was because I was already ahead and on track to do that and I thought why not? I only have one chance to graduate high school early, so why not right? But then came my junior year, I was caught up in problems and I let that affect my studies, so I ended up not being able to graduate that year and had to stay for my senior year. That made me really sad and even til today, I still am hard on myself for not accomplishing that goal. You see, I really really could've easily attained that goal, but I just let myself get distracted. That's what makes it even worse. The fact that it was already in place for me, but I just let myself go.

Then comes college, I took a year and a half off because I just didn't know what to do and I was so hard on myself for not graduating early and with the honors I wanted. I thought I needed a break to get myself together, but contrary to most gap year stories I heard, mine wasn't very life-changing. I was still the same. So, I started community college in a spring semester and since I wasn't able to graduate high school early, I made a new goal--to gradate college a semester early since I started in the spring. But guess fucking what? I can't achieve that goal either. I fucked up these past 4 semesters because of my depression. It's worse too because like high school, I really was able to achieve my goals, but I let my problems affect me and let myself go. So now, I have to repeat 2 classes for the FOURTH time next semester and I have to take a 5 credit math class again next semester and this math class is a prerequisite for a class I need for my major so graduating a semester early is really impossible for me. And I keep putting myself down for not achieving those goals and it makes my depression worse. I don't want to end up not graduating at all, so how can I get over this feeling of being worthless and incompetent?"
772,How to stay positive when you lack a social or emotional support system?,"&amp;#x200B;

I feel so bad and sad lately. I'm a grad student who's working as well. My family belittles everything I do, I wish I would live outside of my home. They reduce my voice and when I try to have boundaries they literally violate them. They also use their ""being there"" as a manipulate discourse when I say something that speaks differently to them o try to demand respect.

&amp;#x200B;

At grad school I feel also excluded, my co-workers the vast majority are hypocrites and I don't feel a sense of belonging. My friends are all either married or in the puppy love stage and outside from connecting emotionally.  I'm so tired of trying to stay hopeful, yet I've felt so sad lately I really don't have any social or emotional support system.

&amp;#x200B;

I've dealt with so much pain during this Covid, and feel my self-esteem is on the floor. The only thing that gives me hope is the word of God and that things are not eternal. Do you think these days is more frequent to feel isolated and sad due this sense of alienation?"
773,I feel like I'm a little nuts.,"I'm a 27M. For the longest time I've felt like maybe I was wired a little differently from other people. I probably shouldn't say felt, I know for a fact I'm wired a tad different from the majority of people. I recall growing up, my parents telling me I was living in a fantasy world because of the way I would view situations or react to things. To me, those ideas and ways of thinking felt logical, almost like common sense. I even notice now, that things I say that are just beyond ridiculous or even comprehensible seem like common sense or the simple solution to me.

I had an argument with my parents the other day and I brought up the fact that I hate it when they say ""you can't do that"" or ""that's unrealistic"". To me, nothing is unrealistic or impossible for me to do. If I wanted to do something, I don't believe there is anything that could possibly stop me. Would it succeed or work out? Probably not, but to me the idea that something is impossible is unrealistic. I don't particularly want to get into specifics, but hopefully you get the picture. My view of life is pretty skewed and a little strange. It makes sense to me but not to other people. It's getting in the way of me I suppose, growing as an individual. The thing is, part of me doesn't want to stop thinking this way as I don't want to think like everyone else, because frankly, it doesn't make sense to me.

I want to see a mental health professional to try and get the reason behind my thinking and some other issues that I have. My parents seem supportive of me pursuing help, but I feel like whenever I bring it up, they say ""yeah look into it"" and the conversation doesn't go any further. Not sure what I wanted to accomplish from this post, I suppose I just wanted somewhere to vent and speak my mind."
774,Everytime I go outside I feel like people are watching and judging me. How do I overcome this?,"I do stuff in my yard like walking around so I can get my daily steps up (I'm mortified of walking around my neighborhood, for the same reason but the fear is amplified). While doing this I try to watch comedy videos to drown out the thoughts of fear that I am being judged by everyone watching me, while in reality no one is...

I always end up going inside after about 10 minutes of walking (I'd like to go longer, but at around 10 minutes it begins to get worse)

I have thoughts like ""what if they think I'm weird"" or ""what if they are wondering why I'm walking in circles around my yard"" and some more sinister thoughts like ""what if they want to hurt me"" even though **they** likely don't even know about my existence."
775,I don't want to die anymore. I have hopes and dreams and things I want to achieve. But I'm terrified of failing then slipping back to being suicidal.,"I don't really know what to say other than the title, so I'm sorry. 

I have things I want to achieve but I'm just terrified of trying with all my soul and having it all come to nothing. I know that'll end up killing me."
776,Starting to lose my self-confidence,"Hello, I know quarantine has been tough for everyone, but I hope someone could help. Or maybe merely posting can ease my mind.

I have always been comfortable with who I am. A little insecurities here and there but all within part of being human/woman.

I started seeing my current bf last December, he is just an amazing person and is the love if my life. We have been spending a lot of time together and our main bonding is eating. We have gained weight but we are happy. I went from 115lbs to 132lbs, I am 5’4. I know that’s not a lot but I have been skinny since I was a kid, my body is also reacting to the change with stretch marks on my thighs that are not pretty.

Right now, I am actively looking for a job and have been to a couple of interviews but no luck so far even tho I thought it went well. Maybe I’m not as good or capable as I thought I was.

With that, I am starting to lose confidence in myself. 

With how I look, the weight gain has been hard to deal with. My boyfriend do say everyday how beautiful I am and how much he loves all of me but the comments the people I’m close with make are starting to get to me, especially my parents. My dad just told me yesterday to try and go on a diet and my mom kept saying I’m starting to have man arms. My mom kept making fun of my weight today, it’s all fun for her so I try to laugh it off too but it’s just so painful to hear. I just had to shut my door and have a good cry. Me and my parents aren’t really the type to talk about emotions so I deal with this alone.

I can talk to my partner about this but I know he’ll just say that I’m beautiful and that he loves me. Not that I don’t appreciate it but I just don’t think he understands me the way I need to be.

I hope this doesn’t come across as a pity post. I am blessed enough to not deal with anxiety or depression most of my life. I honestly am asking for advice to help me not spiral.

What can I do to not hate myself, especially in quarantine and unemployed....."
777,Can’t stand silence,"Does anyone else just cannot stand silence? I don’t mean in conversation.. I mean when I’m alone at home or doing something I have to hear and do several things simultaneously or I’ll just can’t concentrate and even kinda feel anxious. I get bored quiet easily and boredom gives me massive anxiety idk why exactly. So yeah I just wanted to ask if anyone can relate.? 
I would like to note that I even get annoyed by the constant noise I have in the background but I literally can’t think without it. Even if I’m watching something on tv and go to the kitchen for a glass of water I pause the tv and watch a video in my phone for the few seconds I’m gone.. I know sounds silly"
778,Is feeling mentally fractured a thing?,"Like I’m very childish in some aspects, hella immature in others, but in high danger situations I lock in and it’s not me doing anything I’m just taken over. 

Then sometimes I can hear about horrifying harm to people, and the idea of doing it disgusts one part of me but if I just open the door in the back of my head to this *thing* I really don’t care and if anything enjoy it. 

Like I’ve lived in that *thing* for a period of two years in the past and honestly I don’t know what to make of it now I’m out. 
Any ideas? 

It almost feels like a super power in a fucked way because I could do a lot of harm to a person if I leant into it and really wouldn’t care if I let that take over. It feels like an evil thing as there’s this fucked mentality just bubbling away and a few bad triggers from bursting out."

Before I start typing and explaining here, let me take something out first. English is not my native language. I learned on my own for years of interacting with others online and from shows/video games. I am still very bad compared to the average American/English person and I apologize in advance if my way of typing confuse you or offend you in any way. With that said, I will tell you what happened, and I would like to get thoughts, opinions and most of all, a solid advice so I can be more prepared in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago, my Mom had a problem. She got up from her bed the morning, without taking her pills for heart, diabetes, thyroid. She was acting strange. She kept laughing, screaming like she couldn't breath and acting childish like she was a little kid. She screamed, laughed, cried all at the same time and sometimes, in turns. She went to the toilet, did her business, came out and kept acting like she was a different person. She went straight back to her bed, and she was trying to sleep and for the past 2 and a half hours, she was screaming and acting up like she didn't know where she was or even who she was. She kept asking me ""who's there?"" with her eyes wide open, in a surprised expression, looking at the window, where the birds are, usually, every morning there and she knows that for years. She couldn't talk clearly most of the times. When I was asking her what's wrong in a calm and slow voice, she replied screaming, like, she couldn't breath, with ""I don't know"". I brought her pills and showed them to her, along with her water bottle. Encouraging her to take them because it was the time. She kept looking at them in a very confused expression and she was replying to me with ""What is this? That's not mine."" At some point, I asked her if she remembers me. She told me ""Yes, I know you, you're my son."" and then I asked her if she remembers my sister. She said ""Yes, I do remember her."" And she kept acting like a kid. Laughing, screaming, and at some point, she looked up in the ceiling and she asked ""Where is my Mom?"" and I told her a lie, that she is well and fine in the village, away from here. Her Mother - my Grandmother - died years ago. I couldn't tell her the truth in her condition. After an hour or more of struggling to come to reason with her, and occasionally leaving her to take breaks to sleep, she came back to her senses. After she woke up, still in her bed, she seemed to be fine and was trying to communicate with me, albeit with her words broken like she had a stroke or a brain paralysis. - Just like my Dad did when he had his paralysis and he couldn't speak well - after one hour of her getting up from the bed and taking her pills, talking with us and everything, she was 100% fine and could talk with us. Now, here's what I've noticed so far:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Her eyes were wide open and her irises were black, like she was still in a state of sleep. 
2. Her personality type was unstable, switching to different states between happy, sad, anxious.
3. She couldn't recognize where she was or who she was, possibility of sort memory loss.
4. Talking to her in a calm, slow and clean voice, asking her simple questions and be gentle with her seemed to work to some degree and I might have managed to bring her back.
5. After 2 hours or so of rest, she seemed to have recovered her senses like nothing happened.
6. When she was fine, we told her about this, and she couldn't believe it. She thought it was all just a dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

We spoke with her, both me and my Sister. We did check on her about her memory and intelligence training memory tests such as simple mathematical calculations ( 2+2 = 4, 25+25 = 50, etc ) and asked her about her med routine, and she answered everything correctly without much delay or at all. In a sense, she aced everything. She told us, that she felt this was a dream and she can't remember much about it. When we told her everything, she was speechless. Do note, a few months back prior to this event, she had something similar for a moment when she was at my room and we were watching YouTube videos about cooking. She got up from the couch and she was looking around the home, yelling ""Leave me alone, don't pressure me!"". This is because of her anxiety due to my passed Father's debt that she had signed years ago to get a loan from a bank, and since that day, 21 years ago, until today, it still haunts her and she feels very pressured, but it was so random. She looked at the whole room, like she couldn't recognize it for a moment. I had to calm her down and let her lie down on bed and sleep for a moment, then, she woke up and she was fine, again. Fast forward to this event that lasted hours and it was a nightmare, it felt like it was crisis attack/panic. I don't know what it was, but it was scary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Final words: 

I did some research online for the past two weeks after this incident. I found out it might have been her sleeping and sleepwalking/sleep talking and interacting with real life at the same time. That along with her weird pill schedule - sometimes, she is not taking her pills the right time or takes them together around night, very late and not even eating anything - might have did that. I assume, without a PhD in psychology, that, she was sort of ""drugged"" by the meds strength volume and she was sleep deprived while also feeling pressured already by too much anxiety. All of these led to that state she was, trying to form some sort of protective wall on her brain and part of her childish personality went to the extreme to help cope with the issues in reality. The term is actually called ""Somnambulism"" and I think that's what she had or at least a form of that to some certain degree. That would explain her eyes being wide open and her irises large and black, assuming she was still sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Mom is 67 years old now. I am 30. I have no job, and no knowledge to succeed out in this world. If anything happens, I won't be able to help her or support her, and that makes me scared, because, besides my Mom, I have to help and support my younger sister. I called my aunt, and she told me that she had a panic attack and identity crisis and if that happens again we should take her to the hospital and from there to the psychic ward, basically, telling me, to lock her up in asylum. The rest of the distant family relatives told me the same thing and to check up on that with a psychiatrist as soon as possible, but we don't have money for that either. I'm doing the best I can to study about situations like these from other people online and asking here and there, every info I get might be useful to me. I think I did a good job at being calm, slow and clear with my words with her and helping her to remember her routine, me and my sister, her name, etc. And, of course, letting her sleep while checking up on her if she needs anything. It has been two whole weeks since then, and I am still scared, frightened to death, that she might wake up one day and she won't be herself, again, and this time, forever. So far, she seems to be fine. She cooked the same day and up to this day kept cooking with high accuracy, still going out for her strolls, still enjoying tv shows, still doing stuff she always was doing, and talking fine and clear, being herself and sleeping well lately. I am still scared, because, this is a very concerning and serious matter and I would really like your help and opinion about this, please. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, so much, for reading up to this point. I know, it was not the best read, and I know, you might be tired right now after reading this huge wall of text, but, please, take your time, think, and tell me what to do, how to act, everything, in case this happens again. I want to be prepared. I am not a good person. I am not worthy of anything in life, I am really useless and worthless, but I still want to try to do some good and help out the people I love and care about. Any advice about this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please, and thank you, again."
781,Exercise for depression,"One of my biggest pet peeves is people trying to tell me that if I just exercised more I wouldn’t be depressed. They claim it’s a magical cure that makes everything perfect and better and your depression just goes “poof” and it’s gone. 

Stop. Just stop. There are so many reasons why telling someone struggling with depression to “just exercise” is not beneficial. 

They are probably already being told by their doctor that it could be helpful. And it’s constantly talked about. Pretty much everybody knows that exercising is supposed to be good for depression. So hearing it over and over from people is not only unhelpful, it’s frustrating and annoying. 

When you are depressed, it literally prevents you from doing all the things you know you should. I know I need to do that assignment, this work project, eat healthy, and go workout, but it’s so damn hard. That’s what depression freaking is! I am unable to do those things, so telling me to do then just makes me feel extra guilty about my inability to do them. 

Also, exercise may not help everyone. There isn’t a one size fits all treatment plan for depression. I hate working out. I try to do it because I know I want to be healthy but I don’t like it. It does not make me feel good, I do not feel happy from it, I hate it. I don’t care that it “releases endorphins” it still doesn’t make me feel good. Working out is a chore for me when my depression isn’t super bad, let alone when it is. Stop telling me exercise is this miracle cure because it does not make me happy. 

I’m glad it worked for you and you suddenly got better because you went outside and exercised, but it hasn’t helped me. 

What are your thoughts? Is this “suggestion” just as frustrating to you guys? I know it may work for some people but why must people act like they suddenly know how to fix me when they aren’t my doctor?

Also little happy note: I finally get to see a therapist!! After being drug along and told the earliest I could get in was February, I bothered the doctor enough that I get to go next week. First bright spot in so long and first thing I have looked forward to in forever."
782,Any advice for dealing with separation anxiety?,"Me and my bf finally got better jobs, which is good cause then we'll be able to move out soon. I work 7 am to 3 pm and he works a night shift at 10 pm to 6:30 am. We still get to see each other between the time I'm done and he leaves, but that means we dont sleep at the same times.

I get a hell of a lot of every day anxiety, and anxiety from having to wake up so early, but it drives me over the edge that I'll be alone when I'm sleeping. I really miss sleeping in the same bed together. Yeah we'll still be able to cuddle and stuff here and there and on our day offs, but the fact that our schedule isn't the same is upsetting me.

I'm really happy that he likes third shift and that he gets paid a lot, but I really wish it didnt have this big of an impact on me. I care for him so much. And sleeping next to him is one of the things I treasure most. We both need these jobs to support ourselves and I'm thankful that we will be able to. I hate being without him at night.

I literally cant stop myself from crying. Tomorrow will be my second day of work, and this will be the second night in a row where I'll be crying myself to sleep."

784,How do I get my schizophrenic brother help when he resists?,"To keep it short and simple, my brother was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2017 ish. He was prescribed medication and did well until he decided to stop taking it. Now it’s been awhile with no medicine and has been acting aggressive, showing delusions and much more but won’t accept any help from my family. He will ignore us and won’t talk to us now but still lives with us. Any suggestions/ help?"

786,Anxiety and contradictory feelings.,"Hi, i'm from a small country in central america; Honduras, english isn't my first language so sorry if i butcher some phrases.

I'm 24 y/o, a med school student in my home country who has been dealing with anxiety, depression and ADHD since i was 12 y/o. Have gone to the psychiatrist several times during the last 12 years. Every time after a few months i decide to quit and start missing my appointments, mostly cause i have the feeling that it is useless since most of the time i end feeling urges to say ""yeah, i think i have improved over the last months"" just to avoid getting treated with more meds. As to why i avoid getting higher doses of meds? Well, they have never done anything for me. Yes, i've seen psychologists as well.

At this point in my life i have come to terms with the fact that i need to escape from time to time, and just be along for a while, covid has made this harder than usual. But every year the knot in my chest just feels even worst than before. I have the urges to talk about this to my friends but after a while i end up thinking ""why should i bother them with my issues? Most of them may have similar or bigger issues and they don't talk about it every single time they feel that way"". I don't want to be an emotional burden to them, but anxiety keeps getting worse, i have no idea of what makes me so anxious, and not knowing the reason of my anxiety just makes me more anxious.

There is zero motivation to anything i do, and it kinda makes you think ""why even do it?"", it turns daily activities into a comprehension exercise of ""explain me what's the point of even trying to? who is gonna give a damn if you don't try it? do you think someone is gonna miss you? do you even have friends? i mean, you alienate from everyone who wants to get closer to you"".

I just wanna scream, to cry, to get away from everything and everyone, but it never happens. Could it be fear of no one caring or just another example of why even do it?. It actually reads worst than it actually is. There's a constant feeling of being alone even if conscious of the people that really loves me. Maybe i'm just crazy or dumb. But if could at least stop the feeling of having a knot in my chest i think i could be extremely happy.

Thank you for reading it."
787,Am I being delusional about this or could I potentially be autistic?,"I’ve always had issues socially along with other mental health concerns such as ticks and severe anxiety. Besides GAD I’ve never had anything diagnosed, but after googling nearly all of my symptoms lineup with autism perfectly. Even one of my close friends who is on the spectrum said it sounds like I very well could be and that I should talk to a professional. I brought it up to my mom and she said it’s probably just anxiety, and that she had me tested when I was a baby so I can’t be. Is it still possible that I could potential he have autism though? I only bring this up because I’ve been wanting some form of a diagnosis and this lined up so well that it really felt like a relief to some degree."
788,Advice for moving on,"Hi, I broke up with my first girlfriend about a month ago and it’s been the hardest thing that I’ve had to deal with emotionally. I wanted it to work out so badly but ultimately, all odds where against it. I have lost a lot of motivation when it comes to doing general things (if it wasn’t for game dev I wouldn’t do anything probably) and I’m never one to get upset but, I will occasionally have nights where I’m really upset over it. I’d really love to move on as, this is hurting me so much. Does anyone have any methods of making this even the slightest bit less painful?😅 thank you in advance."
789,I haven’t talked to anyone in 2 days,"It’s been a really long time, I feel like going to go insane, nobody talks to me, someone please talk to me, please, please, I feel like I’m gonna lose my mind"

And I haven’t thought about suicidal things since like... mid of 2019. I know I won’t commit suicide. I don’t self harm. But I’m just mentally exhausted.

I’m just tired. Im tired of being poor. I’m tired of being sad. I’m tired of the toxicity in my family. I’m just tired. I’m over it."

793,Silexan help with depression?,I have depression and anxiety and my psych told me to order the silexan (lavender pills) in order to take along side my other meds. Has anyone ever had any experience with silexan helping their depression and/or anxiety? I recently cut my dosage of lexapro in half and now I’m feeling terrible :( and need to cope
794,why don’t i feel happy,"so recently my life has been at probably the best it’s ever been. i have a decent paying job, just bought my first car today, have a loving and affectionate girlfriend, supportive parents, and also a lot of stuff i used to want. but i don’t feel happy, i don’t feel pleased. i thought that it would’ve been a nice feeling having what i have. i still feel like i always have. i’m 16 btw"

796,A new start. Time to find some new friends.,"I decided to finally let go of the toxic friends I had and ready to move forward. Found myself a therapist, started to exercise, eat better and finally doing things I enjoy. I feel ready to make a couple new friends now whenever it happens. 

I also want to do what I can to help others through their struggles to the best of my ability. Everyone please have a great day, stay safe and do the best you can to love yourselves."
797,Does this happen to anyone else?,Sometimes when I can feel myself start to like panic and break down my mind goes like completely blank and I forget everything that I was freaking out about and I kinda just have a really bad memory in general
798,how do you know that your medication's not working?,
799,"My 67 yr old parents’ crazy fighting, sleeping for days then gaslighting","I’m in my late 30s now with a family of my own and when I think back on my childhood and adult life with my parents, I remember a lot of constant fighting, yelling, and even some violence. When my parents were younger (30s-50s), my parents would engage in chaotic fights and then my dad would hole up in his room for days sometimes after drinking heavily and my mom would fret, worry, and speak incessantly to me about how much suffering she had endured by him. She would be a wreck and I was too so worried about both of them and then he would arise out of bed after several days and they would BOTH act like nothing happened and for the next few days act so civil with each other (like how most married adults should act) and then return to the chaos again. This has been going on for 40 years of their marriage. When my parents fight which is a lot, my mom is hysterical calling me and confronting me with all of her gripes and unhappiness and sometimes it’s an all-out emergency where she just can’t go on. Recently, my dad has been taking pills to aid in his usual after-fighting hibernation. He has replaced alcohol (binge drinking every couple of months) with bingeing on his anxiety pills. He always says he is anxious and depressed and acts hysterically where we have had to call an ambulance but when he does this several day hibernation, he pops out of the room calm and almost happy (lacking any of his anxiety and depression symptoms). All my life I have tended to my parents fighting and drama and felt so emotionally drained and this is the first time I realized this is how they function and I’m actually being played in their dysfunctional drama. When I finally confronted them after another episode of fighting, pill taking, and 4 day hibernation when they were staying at our house for a visit, they completely gaslighted me and said why am I making such a big deal and why do I need to even mention anything about it. I have two little kids at home and to my husband and me, their behavior is getting to be more unacceptable. They fought all week, my dad overmedicated, stayed in bed for days and even urinated in the bed and my mom cried, complained, yelled about him and now they are acting like nothing happened and they are a normal married couple (and grandparents). What is going on here? I’ve been trying to help them all my life but are they just toxic people? How can I even help them when they don’t think anything is wrong?"

801,I admitted myself to the hospital because I wanted to end my life tonight.,"I couldn't handle it anymore. I picked up my roommate's gun, and at that moment I knew I needed help. I stopped, I put it down, I started crying and I ran from the room. I threw some belongings together and I rushed myself to the local hospital.
I told them I wanted to commit suicide and that I has a history of self-harm and previous attempts.

Now I'm a gown, stripped of my belongings except my phone, being watched by a security guard. They took a blood and urine sample.

I called work and told them I may not be able to make it to work tomorrow, they understood and I told them I would keep them posted.

I told my roommates about what happened, and I feel so selfish. But I know in my heart that this is not selfish. For quite some time now, I have not been myself at all. I've been violent, unpredictable, angry, sad, standoffish, irritable, and downright a total drag to be around because of my recent unstable moods. 

My doctor back home stopped prescribing me my meds and did not tell me until I was out, despite me and the pharmacy contacting them. I've been off my meds and all mental health clinics are booked up. Tonight I had a breaking point and realized that I am not okay and that I can't do this by myself.

I'm not okay with having to go through a divorce. I'm not okay with the fact that I lost all of my friends. I'm not okay with having to flee from my home state because I needed to get away from the hurt. I am not okay with how I've been playing the victim unintentionally. And most importantly, I'm not okay with how I've treated my friends here and how I've been lying to myself. I told myself my behavior was acceptable and that things are fine the way they are. I told myself I didn't need help and I could handle it all by myself. It's not okay. I feel selfish, but I feel this is the least selfish thing I've done in awhile because I'm putting a stop to letting my mental illness and my traumas affect who I truly am, and how I treat others and treat my own self.

I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm laying in the hospital bed still, awaiting to hear what's next."
802,"In my house, I’m very stern and serious, but outside I like to have a laugh and banter","So in my house, I don’t banter, make no jokes with my family, very serious and like to get shit done, whereas my family like to laugh and banter.  Outside my house, I go off rails and laugh and banter a lot.  Is this an issue if I have one personality inside my house but opposite outside ?"
803,How do you guys deal with winter blues?,"I've never been to the doctor for a diagnosis, but I'm fairly sure I suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) to at least some extreme. There's a bit of mental health history in my family so I'm assuming I've got a predisposition to it anyway but I usually manage to make it through the winter without seeking help. Finding it quite hard this year though, especially with lockdown after lockdown.

Do you guys have any good advice for ways to keep yourself going, especially at the start of new year? I always find it way worse once Christmas and New Year are over because it sort of feels like there's nothing to look forward to and you've just got to put up with the fact it's dark at 4pm and freezing all the time. I recently invested in a light box which you're supposed to use for a few hours in the evening to simulate natural daylight and it's working a bit, but it might be placebo."

811,Bad trip smoking weed and haven't been the same - afraid of death,"Hi! 25(f) here with an issue that I'm not sure if anyone can explain/share if it has happened to them. I've talked to my psychiatrist about it but she hasn't been helpful. 

This summer I stopped smoking weed after a year of smoking every day. I realized how depressed and anxious it was making me so I decided to stop. It was really amazing and I also decided to get back on antidepressants. I'm currently on bupropion (Wellbutrin). Around September (after I had already started Wellbutrin) I went to visit a friend. I hadn't smoked weed in a long time but someone handed me a vape pen and I took a hit without thinking about it. I think what happened next was a side effect of the weed mixing with the Wellbutrin. I had vivid visions of everyone in my family dying or being killed and then felt like (what I can only describe as) myself dying. I had to go lay on my friend's floor while I felt like I was going to lose consciousness and die. The only other way I can describe it is maybe feeling like I was going to have a seizure (I've never had one though). 

The next day I felt emotionally exhausted and depleted and a few days later my grandpa died. Ever since that incident I've had a constant terror of dying. Every time I drive in my car or get on an airplane I start to panic about dying. It has slowly gotten better. I used to not be able to go on walks alone because I was terrified that someone would shoot me in the head while I was out. (Not necessarily unrealistic as the city I live in often has random shootings.) There are still sometimes, though, when I'm walking or just sitting outside and I get a random fear that someone is going to shoot me. It makes me want to run and hide. 

I was never like this before. Even when I was my most depressed and anxious before the incident, I never thought about death so much. My psychologist tried to assure me that we don't feel pain during death, which was helpful a bit, but I really can't stop the intrusive thoughts. I told my psychiatrist about the incident and she said that it was normal that that happened when mixing the weed with Wellbutrin. 

Is there anyone this has happened to or any medical websites that might describe what's happening to me? It doesn't feel like disassociation. It just feels like I can't shake the trauma of the bad trip. 

Thanks!"

813,How do I stop feeling like a burden?,[deleted]
814,Guilt,I've been really depressed recently and all I want is to give up. I am dead already. I'm an empty shell of the person I used to be. All I ever think about is death and how sweet and peaceful it sounds. I don't have any reason to stay. The pain is so unbearable I want to claw my heart straight out of my chest. I want to scream and cry till my vocal chords burst. I want to bash my head into a brick wall until my skull shatters. I can't make it stop. It's never gonna end. I feel so empty. I'm so unlovable and disgusting and worthless I deserve to be dead. I don't have anyone who cares nor loves me. It really wouldn't be a huge difference to anyone. Am I a bad person if I do it? Am I a bad person for wanting to die so badly? Should I feel guilt? Do I deserve to feel this way?

Recently, I've been having dreams that feel as if I'm myself in a different reality. All the scenarios seem like they may have happened if certain choices were made differently. The most recent one, I was in a small apartment still living with my mother, and I went to speak with her as she was wrapping presents. All of the sudden I felt really lightheaded and fell backwards onto my bike. My mother panicked and rushed me to the hospital. When the lightheadedness faded I felt a burning sensation on my arm which had impacted the bike. There was a huge gash in it. I felt the cold chill as we were driving on the highway. All of the sudden, I feel lightheaded again. Then my mother loses control and we spin out, aaaand then I wake up.

After I wake up I still feel the burning on my arm and still feel really light. I've been having more dreams like that. They make me feel like I'm losing my sense of self as when I wake up, I am incredibly confused as I was just somewhere else in my dream. As I have already stated, my greatest fear is losing my mind. I don't want to be unable to think as myself. I wanted to know if this might be a sign of something. I don't want to offend anyone by potentially making light of mental health issues, however I didn't know where else to ask this. If I did, I apologize. Thank you ahead of time."
816,Bring Change to Mind BC2M,"Warmest Greetings to all.  My birthday is coming up and it is extremely important to me to pick a charity that fights the stigmas associated with mental illness.  Particularly important during these uncertain times, in addition to my own experiences with my daughter severely impacted by bipolar illness, mania and depression.  I have spent my life advocating on her behalf and educating people on mental illness dispelling preconceived notions. NAMI, DBSA, and MHA, are my go to's for all resources, but  I really am becoming increasingly  interested in finding nonprofits that are dedicated to fighting mental illness stigmas, encouraging the seeking of help, and educating community.  Is there anyone here familiar with Bring Change to Mind?  Or can you recommend another anti-mental health stigma  nonprofit?    I thank you kindly."
817,Do I have a problem?,"I’ve been really obsessed about avoiding getting hurt lately. I’m mostly worried about getting like attacked/ robbed/ abducted. Today,  I kind of hit my foot on my bed frame and tripped. It doesn’t seem like a big deal,but I got really worried about it. I decided that this was the same thing as how they cut your achilles’ tendon to abduct you, so I had to like train(?) myself to not be affected by getting hurt. I kept kicking the bed frame and I wouldn’t stop because it wasn’t good enough. Im also worried about food being spoiled/contaminated or like bugs(?) being in it. I spend a really long time like making sure my food is safe, but sometimes even after doing that I’m too worried to eat it. Today, I was going to eat this apple so I cut it into a lot of small pieces to inspect it. No matter what I did I was still really worried about it so I didn’t eat. 
I don’t think that this is really a big deal because it’s just like a waste of my time. Also, I wouldn’t be as safe if I didn’t do any of this. Maybe it’s a problem, but i’m just being careful."
818,Good resources to find therapy?,"Think the title speaks for itself, thanks in advance. I’m in NH don’t really want to disclose more than that"
819,"I think I may have bipolar depression, what do I do?","Since I left the regular routine of high school at 18 (now 29) I have increasingly noticed myself going through ""cycles"" growing more frequent and extreme over time that have been exacerbated by the pandemic and working from home. 

It comes on as general apathy and over days, sometimes hours, becomes existential dread that drives me to sleep, chronically miss work at a job I'm great at with lots of positive reinforcement (while very stressful) and feel completely lethargic and disinterested in everyday living. After what used to be a day or two and is now becoming week-long stretches of this the ""fog"" will clear, mostly because I fear my life will spiral out of control if I don't get my shit together. Then for a few days I will go completely the opposite direction - highly productive during the day, increased rate of speech and trouble focusing on one task, not interrupting people in conversation, etc, and sleeplessness (mind-racing.) This often has driven me to drink so that I can ""check out"" of my mind and relax. This has spiraled into frequent binge drinking and I'm worried that if I don't stop the cycle my life truly will spiral out of control.

I have a 1 year old daughter and from the outside a ""normal"" life. I'm scared to approach my PCP because we have only met once prior to me having my gallbladder removed after the birth of my daughter. 

At this point I'm open to medication. I can't seem to bring myself to exercise as it's never been a habit of mine that I know many might suggest - I have tried but never make it more than 2 days in a row because I'm almost always doing it on no sleep and then after my last hyper productive day I get drunk and there's no chance of working out the next day because I'm likely in the depressive state at that point.

Are you all just going to tell me to get a therapist? Where do I start?"
820,Im emotionally and mentally exhausted,I overthink a lot even about the simplest things. It’s like I can’t control my thoughts making it hard to stay grounded and calm. I get panic attacks more frequently now than I used to before. If I could just shut down my mind for a while and give it a rest I would. But I am trying my best not to overthink and acknowledge my feelings but I can’t help it. I tried reaching out to my friends through messaging but they seem not to be too concerned about it and i don’t want to bother them about my situation. But i want help. I just want someone to talk to about what’s going on with me. I want to find new things/hobbies that would distract me from this but nothing sparks up my interest lately.
821,Anyone else have anxiety related tics?,"I never had an issue with this, growing up I’d get stuck on certain words and I’d have to write them out with my finger until I felt okay, I still do it sometimes. But recently I have done things like blind hard, open my eyes big, make funny faces, etc. sometimes it’s because I think of something I shouldn’t think about. but I’m not sure. sometimes when I’m trying to be steady I will twitch really hard. also, sometimes when I am at work and I get sick of it, my vision will blur so I can’t work for a few seconds. anyone wanna try and diagnose me since I can’t afford therapy or anything? lol"
822,Anyone else experience something similar?,"I have suffered with mild depression for a lot of my life, but it was about two years ago when things got worse. 

I began having these panic attacks that made me feel confused and I would somewhat lose touch with reality for the duration of the panic attack (not knowing where I was, or understanding what was going on). At the same time, the panic attacks would present themselves as muscle spasms or twitches, particularly in my stomach and head. The spasms cause me to tense my stomach and jerk forward and make it nearly impossible for me to stand.  I typically just lay there with the twitching until I calm down and it passes. They would typically last a couple of minutes at the most.

About a year ago my doctor started me out on a low dose of lexapro for the depression and anxiety. Over the last year, my doctor raised my dose to 20 mg. It has helped my depression tremendously and alleviated the confusion and loss of touch with reality when having the panic attacks.

The panic attacks still take place, but at this point they just present themselves as the muscle spasms/twitches in my stomach and head.

Recently my doctor started me on buspar 5 mg three times a day if needed. I just started taking that on and off with no particular schedule the past few weeks.  

Since then, the panic attacks have gotten worse, taking place daily at similar times. Usually when I'm beginning to relax after work, when I get stressed about something, or when I'm laying down to sleep.

Not sure if this could play into it or not, but I never feel fully rested no matter how much I sleep and I often sleep for long hours, I suffer from chronic nightmares, and my husband says I twitch in my sleep at times too. I have an appointment scheduled for a sleep study."
823,Destroying my life,"When I was 15 I made a YouTube video rapping to a song I made but I was trolled and bullied relentlessly over it by a group of boys. I took the video down but then they re-uploaded it and made a meme edit of it. For the next couple years of high school they attacked me over anything I did or said to the point where I got school involved. It stopped then but the video was re-uploaded again despite intervention. The harassment and bullying I experienced still affects me to this day and I feel vulnerable every waking hour. I feel weak. I get scared they will randomly harass me with the video at any time and troll me again. I obsess over it. A few years have passed now but I still haven't moved on, how do I move past this? Is there anyway I can mentally overcome it without living in fear?"
824,I'm a bit confused but I don't know if I should be worried?,"Hey there, I could use some help though I'm not sure what help to ask for. I'll just explain a bit about my situation and we can go from there I guess.

So around a month ago I had a fairly vivid dream, I can only remembers parts of it but I remember a big theme of it was that I I had killed 75 people. The context of it was sorta like a battle and I ended up killing 75 people by the time it was over. Ever since that dream I've had daydreams involving images of the scene from that night, or in other completely unrelated dreams I would see images of it flash for a moment, or someone/something in my current dream would make a passing reference or callback to it. Never in my life has a dream been so persistent like this. The only reason why I'm even writing this post is because the scene flashed through my head again and I don't really know what to think about it. I can be in a conversation with someone or doing something absolutely off topic and then randomly it shows up. Its a bit troubling. I've tried to  rationalize it as an image thats metaphorical of me feeling guilty about something internally but I can't think of what it would be. Its starting to stress me out a bit because its not a pleasent sight to have to see and I don't know why its happening.

In terms of medical diagnosises that I've been given I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder, though I'm not well versed in the symptoms these conditions carry and whether or not they may explain what's going on with my situation. I don't really know what I'm expecting as a result of this post, its just something that is starting to properly bother me and I was hoping someone somehow would know whats going on/has been in a similar scenario? 

Thank you for reading this."
825,missed years,anyone else feel just... robbed of their teen years? i’m almost 18 and i feel so old. i’m finally out of the town i grew up in and hated and i’m probably the healthiest i’ve been in awhile. but it’s making me realize how tired i am. ages 11-17 have been so taken up by wanting to get out of my hometown and being mentally ill. i don’t want to get into my whole life story but my life and circumstances have forced me to grow up quick and understand difficult things at a young age. so now that i’m in a good place i’m like.... god where do i even start with continuing my life. i never thought i’d get this far. i thought i’d be dead by now. i’m so exhausted now
826,How do i make sense with this irony,"I like survival stuff but i'm actively suicidal. Nothing makes sense anymore. I just keep on knowledge dumping my fatigued mind with survival techniques and binge-watch survival documentaries. Although i just cleared some of my stuff because i was certain i'm about to kms an hour ago but then i got distracted with the unopened survival ebooks i found on my phone and i'm currently practicing knots and typing this. 

I wish i have the money to go camping and experience the adrenaline putting myself in a situation that could potentially kill me, i want to feel like i'm instinctively fighting for my life and not finding comfort for the thought of killing myself (like i do most of the time).

Or being able to buy survival gears, climb mountains or do outdoorsy stuff. I wish i'm older and i'm not socially anxious, dirt poor that is stuck in a dangerous, ugly, uninteresting country with emotionally neglectful parents who are too damaged themselves to give a fuck about me. I wish i could comfortably tell them about what i like or cool stuff i just learned. That's it."
827,Lost on How to Find True Happiness,"So I’m officially 31 as of last month, and it’s safe to say that all aspirations for the idealized relationship-life combo are nearing an end. The “plan” of S.O. by 30, marriage a few years later, kids by 35 is looking less likely by one blown up relationship after the other. I would be hard pressed to even call what I’ve had as relationships, but here’s some context -

While I’m a decent looking guy, active and body builder, six figure salary, prestigious position, and intelligent. I have nice cars, independence, and I just bought a house. None of this seems to matter, because the only thing that I want, and that I crave, is to be loved by an equal. Beginning and end of list. at this point idk how much of the aforementioned is all just to improve my odds towards that end, but someone I feel like I’ve strayed farther from it. I’ve had a vortex of less intense, less romantically “amazing” relationships that have burned and failed over the past few years, leading right up until recently. I had a girl I went on a date with for my birthday. IMO it went amazing, talked non stop, went on 5 more dates, she stayed over a few times, and then suddenly poof - not interested and she ends it. Due to age? Maybe. Due to me asking her to define what we’re doing? Probably. When we were together she made me feel something I haven’t felt in the better part of a decade - absolute appreciation and love. It felt so warm and amazing, kisses on my back while I sleep. And gone. I keep ending up here and I fear the moments of extreme high because I know they never last. They always seem to be fleeting. I have had so many relationships but fuck all if I can’t get 1 person to love me. Maybe despite my best efforts of being a hopeless romantic I’m actually just a piece of shit, because I honestly am running out of other conclusions. 

Would appreciate any insight from anyone who has struggled with this feeling of being incapable of finding anyone to love you despite how hard you try..."
828,nothing to live for,"I've been struggling with depression since years, and getting worse over time. I have been to different psychologists throughout my life, but none have helped me, and I don't feel like trying again. it's enough, I've really had too much.
I don't think it's normal to experience so many horrible things in such a short period of life. family violence, drunk and addicted to drugs mom, complicated surgeries, rapes, low social life, low self-esteem and many more things that I could go on to name. I feel like my life is a real hell, every day it feels worse. my personality is really upbeat and positive, but depression is consuming me. even the days when I try my best, I end up crying out of nowhere, and even having a crisis. I currently only have three people helping me, and I don't feel like they love me too much. I am not self-harming myself as much as I used to, because I am afraid that my family will see my injuries. But before I used to do it several times a day, almost every day.
a week ago I had a suicide attempt, another of many, I keep wondering why I didn't do it, I really can't find an answer. nothing. really nothing else to live for. I really wish to be free from all this suffering forever.

any messages of support would be appreciated, I'm truly hopeless about continuing to live. by the way, sorry for my bad English."
829,i just need someone right now,"i just can't stop crying and nothing feels real. i keep trying to tell myself it is but i can't comprehend how the world isn't just in my head or the fact that's there's a positive future last night i almost cut off everyone in my life and just wanted to go to our tall bridge and jump off into the river just make things make sense. i keep scratching myself to see  if i'm alive and  i feel so isolated and scared that the world isn't going to be a good place to live in for the rest of my life and i can't see any value in myself or my thoughts in my mind 

i'm sorry for posting this i don't know if i can"
830,When should a therapist become an option?,"I have a thing about telling myself I can’t possibly have any sort of problem, mental or physical, and lately it’s gotten kind of bad. I have had light moments of self harm but it has escalated lately. I’m not suicidal but saying I hate myself is probably an understatement and my emotions have been beyond unpredictable. The thought of even debating therapy scares me and makes me feel less than. Even though I would never think those things about others as I have good friends who do it and I have never thought of them as less than. I’ve taken a few tests online and taken them with a grain of salt obviously, but I think it’s a possibility there could be something wrong and I’m not sure if I should take it seriously or not. My question is to people who have gone to a therapist, when did you decide and do you think I should or am I overreacting? Thanks for taking any time to actually read all of this."
831,does anyone know how to get rid of a memory?,Some random jerks on discord randomly started spamming really graphic emojis and i cried because im young and i just didnt need to see all that-
832,Is this just SAD,"I have a mental issue that pops up every winter.
I'm not sure if it is an extreme case of SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) or something else that is being amplified by SAD.

The issue can be best described as a brain parasite that slowly manipulates my own senses to convince me my worst fears and insecurities are true.

It starts off by simply amplifying the things I hear. Nothing is louder, I am just more aware of words that specifically apply to my insecurities. If a group of people are talking in the distance, I won't be paying enough attention to hear what they're saying, but if they were to say something like ""he's so gross"" this parasite would make me hear it as clear as day.

As it goes on, I hear and focus more and more on these picked up negative words; eventually, it gets to the point where the parasite starts to convince me that even the parts I can't hear are people saying horrible things about me. Even the sound of laughter is now being processed as people laughing at me.

It goes even further, every unknown word is something horrible about me, and now it's starting to affect the way I think of people. Hours of just hearing my parents' deeply muffled conversations has me convinced that they are saying and thinking horrible things about me.

I now know what everyone is thinking. Even though I don't really know, the parasite makes sure I believe I do.

The worst part is when I look into the eyes of people who I used to know loved me and only see hatred and spite clearly reflected back.

Is this just SAD?
Can SAD really hijack my very senses and change my own beliefs of what people I know so well think about me?
Can SAD somehow add fake emotional feelings to my senses?
Is this something else?
Does it have a name so I can find a better way to fight it than just a bottle of Vitamin D that's slowly losing its effect?

It is a lot easier to fight this thing now, knowing that it's all just the effects of some mental condition and being able to keep track of every step it takes, reminding myself that this has happened before and it's not real. I do want to know what can help me better deal with it.

Thanks for any help."

834,Is it normal to be so inspired by a person wherein you think about them often?,"In a platonic way, is it normal to be so inspired by a friend wherein you think about them all the time? Is it a sign of something wrong?"
835,Wasting away,"I pretty much just want to sit in front of the computer or in front my phone all day. I barely even play games anymore. I just silently stare at screens and scroll. Through Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, Twitch, Instagram and so on. I do that for about 3/4 of the day. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I couldn't tell you any details about what I'm doing, although I could tell you the things I generally do.

It feels like I'm just letting time pass. Not really doing anything. Waiting for something to happen. Waiting for something to wake me up so that I can finally live.

Sometimes I'm looking for something that could finally make me wake up. A new boyfriend, drugs, becoming a fitness pro, becoming a food blogger... but the excitment never lasts. Back to nothingness. Always."
836,Need Guidance,"What’s wrong with me. I’m on the highest anti depressants, everything is going good for me right now. Why am I so scared. Everyone is telling me things are going good for me. That I should have nothing to be upset about. It’s true. Im going to have two jobs, I have 300 dollars saved for a car right now. (The most I’ve ever saved for anything.) My life is finally rolling in the right direction but I can’t feel good. I don’t feel good. Why? I get sudden burst of anxiety where I feel like I have to do something but I can’t motivate myself to get out of bed. A while ago I overdosed on antidepressants. I spent a week at the mental institution, somehow I still don’t feel better. For a bit I did, but it didn’t last for long. What should I do."
837,I need some journaling advice/self-help therapy alternatives,"I am unable to afford any therapy or counseling services and have found that every mental health app/mood tracker I have tried requires a monthly subscription that I don't really have the extra funds for. A friend who regularly attends therapy recommended that I try keeping a journal. Although I do find that venting my feelings into a journal to be cathartic I feel like it hasn't been necessarily helping me to improve my mental health. I find that I often vent and complain in my journal entries and I feel like it has been enabling my negative thoughts.

I was wondering anyone has any productive journaling tips or resources? Also if anyone knows of any free mental health resources? I live in the US and mental health services aren't covered under my insurance (curse the US healthcare system D:&lt; )."
838,"I wish I wasn't so obsessed about controlling everything. I find myself burnt out but when I choose to be easy on myself and things around me,","I wish I wasn't so obsessed about controlling everything. I find myself burnt out but when I choose to be easy on myself and things around me, I do compulsive things like biting my nails and change my hair(in ponytail, out ponytail) and I pace nonstop, and I stay up until 4a like now. Also I have the habit of counting things as I see them, a symptom I never knew I had. I've been nicer to myself compared to my earlier days but I just wish I didn't have to see symptoms of ptsd and anxiety disorder and ADD despite all my devotion to counseling and CBT. I hate that I tend to interrupt people because I genuinely do listen but I get ahead of myself. I'm so much more sensitive than people realize."
839,I'm a mess,"This is a throwaway account because my friends know my reddit name and I don't want anyone I know  to know about this.

I'm not okay.

I think my father is a narcissist and I think I might have been abused my entire life and just not known that my childhood wasn't normal. I don't know if not knowing is the right word, more like didn't want to accept.

My father is a pathological liar, he's lies about everything. He lies in massive convoluted ways about things that don't even matter to the point where no one believes a word he says.

He gambles, he spends hundreds of dollars a month of scratch of tickets and he swears he wins all the time but our lights used to get shut off all the time and he's always in debt.

He cheats on my mother constantly and every time we catch him he insists we have the wrong idea and he didn't do that.

He stole money out of my bank account when I was a kid and when I confronted him he insisted he was never there even though the teller knew me and told me what he did.

My mom found cocain in his desk while he was at work. She showed me a picture of it and I'm an RN I know what it looks like but he insisted it was dust from aspirin he took. Out of a baggie hidden in his desk...

When I was a kid me and my sister found baby raccoons in the garage. We told my dad about it and the next day I found our rake broken and the raccoons were dead. He'd beaten them to death with a rake and insisted something must have gotten in there and done it.

My grandad died, and me and him were very close. My parents didn't go because I was mad at them at the time and we weren't speaking. When I asked my dad why he didn't go to the funeral he said it would have been too much trouble for him to be there. A year later I brought up how upset that had made me and he insisted he never said that. He claims he didn't go because I never asked him to. He knew about the funeral and that my grandfather was the most important person in my life. I didn't think I needed to ask for support for that. I asked my mother about it and she said my dad refused to take her.

My dad borrowed money from me when I was sixteen, and he insisted he really needed it. The next day I found a bottle of tequila in his room that I knew cost around $200. He ended up borrowing around $1200 from me, and I really needed that money back I was saving up for a car so I could get to college next year. When I asked for it back he insisted I should just give it to him since I didn't pay rent and he did when he was my age.

I ask my grandmother about it and she said he'd never paid them a single cent. When I told my mother about it she made him give it back. My dad insisted my grandmother was lying and threw the money in my face calling me an ungrateful bastard. He insists that never happened now.

My father called me today insisting I had to bail him out of a financial issue. He claims I owed him because he let me stay at home rent free while I was in college. I paid my way through school, I didn't have the money to pay him too I was going full time and I worked full time to pay my tuition.

I told him I didn't think I owed him for letting me live with him a decade ago. He got angry at me and accused me of lying to get out of what he claims I owed him. I told him money was tight right now and I just couldn't do it. I told him I loved him and if I could help him I would. He told me I was full of shit.

He told me he didn't think I cared about him and when I pressed him he refused to tell me he loved me back. Two days later he's leaving me voicemails cussing me up one side and down the other for telling his brother what he did. He insists that he never did it. It was two days ago.

There's more going on here. He's hit me, he's taken food away from me when I was a kid and fed it to the dog and made me watch because I took something out of the fridge that he wanted. He used to threaten to leave my mom (who didn't have a job) and he used to tell me my mom and my sister would go hungry and it would be all my fault. He'd do this whenever we got into a fight.

I've told him our family isn't normal and he insists I'm just weak and that I can't handle life and nothing our family has done isn't something that all other families do.

I've spent such a long time with this man that even though my nurse training tells me this is abuse I need to hear it from someone else.

Please tell me I'm not crazy and that this isn't normal.

I am an ER nurse. I have severe PTSD from my job and I'm already a mess. I don't trust my own judgement anymore and I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm really remembering things wrong but I doubt that I am I think he's just been gaslighting me for so long It's hard to keep it all straight now.

Edit: dear god I didn't mean for it to get so long I'm sorry I tend to ramble."
840,2019 and 2020 have been the two worst years of my life,"It started with my parents stealing money from me, then my mom’s side of the family not speaking to me which as a result I wasn’t invited to my grandpa’s funeral (in February of this year). Covid happed, classes moved online (I hate online classes), one of my coworkers/friend passed away to suicide making work a lot worse then it once was. I am struggling in school because of all this making me fear I’ll even graduate like... ever....
I don’t think I have cried this much since I was a small child. I am seeking professional help, I just hope there will be light at the end of the tunnel again...

841,What do you say in therapy on the first day?,"I have my first appointment in a week and I've been dreading that ""what brings you here?"" question. I've been trying to answer it in my head but I don't even know what to say. Things are bad but idk, I don't wanna just jump into ""lmao yeah so like I'd rather be dead aha"" like what do I say how do I start like where do I start?? I'm an adult and have never told another human being just how bad things are and I'm just not sure that I can go into actual depth. I've seen a counselor before but things are just really different now. I wanna be honest but I'm worried I won't be able to say everything I have to say before they jump to conclusions. I'm just really anxious. Anything anyone has to say would be great, you guys are great thank you for even reading this if you did."
842,Can you have bipolar disorder 1 and unspecified schizophrenia as two separate diagnoses?,"I had a preliminary diagnosis of these two disorders and they were separate and it just bugs me so much cause I know for a fact they made a mistake. Since when is seeing and hearing ghosts and being afraid of the dark considered psychosis? Those things are real. Their are so many people who believe in the paranormal and they see it too. Are they all psychotic then? I've had my fair share of paranoia moments and stuff but I don't think it's from psychosis or any kind of disorder. The only thing they got right was having an anxiety disorder. Anyway, what do you guys think?"
843,I don't feel anything anymore and i don't know how to deal with it.,"I just felt i needed to write how I'm feeling currently. I don't feel comfortable talking about it with anyone of my friends, but well... maybe it helps. (also, why i used a new account, i don't want them to find out) 

I finished university some months ago and moved in with my parents. It was difficult at first, but we manage okish most of the time. They really try to make me feel welcomed, but, after living alone for 7 years, it's not really easy going back. Everything was good for a bit, my girlfriend was over (long distance relationship), it felt like i might land a nice job. well... November hit, I don't even know what  changed. I feel, I changed. It's like... I can't stand myself any more. I used to do a lot of sports, but gyms closed, and i can't motivate myself to do anything.  I wish in the morning, the day ends fast,  I have no motivation for anything, getting up, making lunch, eating.... . Everything feels greyed out, thinks i used to enjoy leave me cold, things i would have been pissed about too.  

I mean,  was never the most stable person, i guess, but I can't remember ever feeling that bad. There were always bad days/weeks whatever, but this feels different. I'm used to mood swings and whatever, I'm used to having strong emotions but this feeling like  absolutely nothing is new, and i don't like it. I'm a person i wouldn't wanna spend time with.

Also, I don't know how to deal with it with my family and my girlfriend. I love her, and we have a really good relationship. We try to be very open and especially honest about what's going on between us (in general), and of course she asks, how i feel, so i usually answer not too well, but also i don't wanna talk about it. I don't want to drag her down, and also don't make her too worried about things, that she has little impact on. 

Thank you for reading :)."
844,how to get rid of a really strange fetish,"recently i got a new fetish, but this fetish is a bit too far for even my standards and i don’t want it. how do i exactly get rid of a fetish?"
845,I feel strange,"I've had severe depression and anxiety since i was 12, so its been 4 or 5 years now. And it took me 4 years and one suicide attempt to realize that i only ever felt okay when i felt loved. It's like this tiny void inside me that needs to be filled up and all this time I've been trying to distract myself from feeling empty, but fuckkk i just realized how normal and happy i feel whenever i feel like I'm heard and important, when someone puts in effort, when someone makes me feel loved. It's so simple to feel okay and yet it's so fucking difficult."
846,Body shaming,"
I’ve noticed that recently there was a trend on tiktok of using that don’t want no short dick man  sound and it has gained traction, was just wondering why it seems to be at least tolerated to describe a man like that? Is there any way I can help the body shaming problem in regards to men?

For some back story, the only reason I feel hurt by that I guess is because I had an ex that would publicly humiliate me in groups saying I had a small member, her being my first gf and all I didn’t know what to make of it and it made me very conscious. A year of dealing with it and meeting my current gf in uni (who btw is amazing and supportive) I’ve finally become confident in my body again.

Disclaimer: not comparing to women being body shamed, women generally seem to have it a lot worse and both struggles are valid.

Thanks for responses!"
847,Absolutely consumed by regrets,"I cannot stop thinking about the past bad decisions I made. I had social anxiety and depression and started doing badly at school at 17. I changed universities 3 times. I didn't live on campus and commuted in from home. I lived in a toxic abusive family home for another 10 years.

I am out now and free to live my life. I keep failing professional exams I am trying to do in the present and all I can think about is the past.

All the good things I missed because of my past mistakes. I could have had a boyfriend at 18, I could have friends and hobbies. I had nothing - those years were the most painful years of my life.

It doesn't help that my boyfriend talks so highly of his high functioning ex girlfriend who he was at med school with for 4 years. She was a concert pianist, dancer and got a distinction. I have failed everything. 

I truly do not know how to let go- the thoughts are compulsive and obsessive. I would cut off my right arm to go back in time and do it all differently.

How do I come back to the present?"
848,Am I being gaslit or am I really crazy?,"Buckle up boys and girls it's a wild one.  Check my post history for more info about me.  I love all of you.

Hi I'm u/greg_kremer and something odd is happening vis a vis my account and my subreddit and it's fucking with my head.  Sorry if this gets weird.  For reference I'm bipolar with mania.  I'm currently manic.  I swear this is all true at least as far as I can understand what is true.

I just created a subreddit that I thought could fix the world.  It's just a dumb little idea that I let manic me have that he could fix everything in the world.  I got really invested in the idea and I was having an amazing time all day today.

I posted to a few other subreddits including r/sociology, r/socialism (the ones I suspect) and r/utopia trying to get more subscribers.  They did not like this.  The mods got upset.  But I went on my merry manic way and kept building I got up to about 20 subscribers.  I decided to include my actual telephone number in my user description in case anyone needed to get in touch.

Suddenly I got a notification from the mods of my own community (me) that I was permabanned from my community.  (I have this in a screenshot)  I was the only mod.  I will not mention the name of my community in case the mods here get mad.

I panicked.  I deleted a couple accounts (I have a shameful sexual kink that I used a different account for that I don't want doxed) I changed some passwords but I noticed that I could still post in my community even though I was apparently permabanned.  Strange.  I made a bunch of posts trying to communicate that my account was not mine before I lost control.

Right after this I got a reply to a message I had sent 7 hours ago  to the mod team at either r/sociology or r/socialism (I'm really not sure which one) saying that if I made an off topic post in their sub again I would be banned.  (Again I have a screenshot)

I made a few more posts and posted the screenshot of the weird message I got.

Then I lost control.  When u/greg_kremer tries to make a post it says he's not logged in.  I tried this a bunch of times.  Also my mail, dms, and modmail all seem to be gone.  I had already taken screenshots of everything.

I really like the content in both r/sociology and r/socialism but I'm now scared to go anywhere near either sub.  I'm very confused and I'm not sure what is happening.  I just want my account and my subreddit back.  I can provide proof of my identity to anyone who requests it.

It's so hard being insane.

Thank you I love all of you.
 
This post is not intended as an accusation toward anyone.  I don't know what happened I just want to go back to my peaceful little sub."
849,Why doesnt she get it?,"I cut my mum of for the benefit of my mental health on Tuesday. I specifically asked her to simply let me be for December and Id contact her in January. But she is still spamming my phone every single day, finding little things to send me texts about. She doesnt know how awful she is making me feel. How lonely, how pathetic, how disrespected and irrelevent she is making me feel. Please just leave me alone."
850,Anyone else feel stuck in the past?,"For the past year or two now I have been living in the past. I constantly miss my childhood and think about certain happy memories over and over again. Then I spend an hour going through old photos, wishing I was there again.

I want to stop living in the past and getting sad about the fact that I'll never be a kid again, and instead focus on the present and future. Some days are better than others but it feels quite... crippling at times. I have some things going for me but I don't feel as motivated as I think I should be.

Thanks for reading. Any thoughts are appreciated."
851,At what point do you know you need to seek professional help?,"I've been thinking about starting therapy for some months now. I don't necessarily have a mental health disorder. But I do get extremely anxious in social settings. ( I don't wanna self diagnose).
During my lowest moments and breakdowns, I have no strength to seek help from anyone and I desperately want professional advice. But as soon as I start getting distracted or feel better, I convince myself I don't need it and I'm just being overly dramatic."
852,I am confused and not sure what is happening,"Around 2 months ago my mental health started to take a turn to the worse and I had episodes where I didn't know where I was and what I was doing. My work stress kinda overshadowed everything that I didn't even had the time to question it. Now that the stress kinda eased for probably 2 weeks I do notice some weird stuff happening.
I always knew I have a bad memory due to my psychosis and I don't remember most of my childhood. But know thing happening like people tell me stuff I did, which I never remember. Stuff in my place moves around that I never moved. Like I live another life without me knowing. And at the same time I can't control my reactions, if I can't find something. I had a total mental breakdown over some God damn trash bags yesterday. I sleep a lot. I just fall asleep at random times at home like my body just breaks down after a stressful day. My hallucinations get more aggressive as I am use to. And all my memories that got lost starting to close down sort of. Like if I couldn't remember anything till 6 years, it's starting to move to 3 years. Just blank. My brain is just blank. And I can't escape. I have no way of going to therapy."
853,Is it strange that I find myself attarcted to people who look like my ex,Him and I broke up a long time ago and I was in a bad headspace for a while. I later realised there were so many red flags from the beginning and that it was a good thing it was over. Now I don't think about him anymore. Yet I've noticed that I'm sometimes attracted to people who have a similar appearance.
854,Med rut,"I feel so overwhelmed and up and down and constantly having to balance out feeling “normal” with my prescriptions.
This pill to wake up and be less foggy and be able to focus,  this pill to calm back down when the anxiety hits , this ones just like supposed to make me happy and then another wake up pill because I’m ready to crawl back into bed if I don’t get that balance right and so forth.
When I take all my pills on time I have a very good day, but I’m so bad at doing it and get sidetracked and end up taking things late and fucking up the balance. 
I love science but fuck it’s rough some days . 
I just want to be perceived as a smart capable human in my work environment and I feel like my performance is so dependent on how well I take my pills on time or then there’s always days where i do everything right and on time but the pills just don’t seem to be working well that particular day.
It’s the best med combo I’ve ever been on don’t get me wrong, but ugh I just wish things were simpler."
855,Please let me die,"My dad wanted to talk to me this morning about me failing my classes. He kept saying it was his fault and that I made me my mom cry last night and that she didn’t get any sleep cuz she was crying all night and on her way to work this morning. Of course I feel bad, I don’t like when people cry. But I felt attacked, I started crying and backing away cuz I honestly felt scared, I felt like I was being trapped. I felt like he was trying to guilt me and make me feel bad for something that I can’t control (depression, anxiety, lack of social skills, etc.)

This is probably selfish or something but I would rather kill myself then deal with everyone’s emotions. I can’t do it, I was never good at it. It’s too much. I can’t handle my own emotions so I definitely can’t handle anyone else’s. I don’t want to feel responsible for people being sad and worrying about me. I wish I was by myself. 

I just want to run away and be someone else, live a different life all by myself."
856,How do I get rid of the obsessive disgust of a person who took pleasure in offending me?,"This emotion is not useful anymore for me. They are out of my life for 7 years but I still think about them to this day and it ruins me.

If it helps I have suffered from OCD, and I learned that the dominant emotion in OCD is not actually anxiety but rather a disgust. So might be naturally vulnerable to this type of emotion.

What do I do?"
857,"please, help","my mum's mother has been diagnosed with coronavirus. we cannot see her as the hospital doesn't allow anyone in and she is all the way in Pakistan while we are in Australia. she is of very old age and has been diagnosed with pneumonia as well. it will be a goddamn miracle if she makes it. I am so depressed and angry and sad because I haven't seen her in 7 years and I've had nothing but good memories with her. this is putting a lot of strain on my mum because she can't afford any tickets to Pakistan to see her own mother. we have gathered as much money as we can but it still isn't enough. we have been in a poor financial condition since the beginning but this is frustrating as hell. I just wanted to vent here, thanks."
858,I'm too paranoid and I feel like I'm going insane,"I'm so paranoid, I can't function normally anymore. The things that felt 'normal' are now becoming a paranoid thought. It used to be intrusive thoughts, and now I actually BELIEVE something bad is going to happen to me, regardless the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I emailed my teacher saying I was sorry for what was happening and I recommended listening to the song ""You Will Be Found"" and I believed that someone was going to see that email, and think there was something fishy was going on (btw, she replied to it an hour later thanking me for the email).

&amp;#x200B;

I also had this weird belief that stuck with me since 4th grade that revolved around the thought that I was living in the wrong universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to see things that others cant; mainly people walking around my apartment when I'm alone."

860,Need some help finding a psychologist/psychiatrist in south LA.,"I’ve finally decided to take a step, small as it may be,  towards finding the help i know i need but im not sure where to start. My mental health took a 180 rather recently. I never struggled mentally or anything so finding the proper help for it is completely new to me. I live in south LA so if anyone can recommend a psychiatrist/psychologist I’d truly appreciate it. I don’t have the most money so an affordable option would be great."
861,Mocking,Does anyone felt mocked and still not give a shit?
862,I hate people's reactions on my actions - a problem that I've never even heard of before and that makes it impossible for me to live.,"For instance, I'd be making progress at my project and my partner (or anybody) would see it and say ""Wow, good job, you're doing great!"" and for some reason I can't stand it. The reaction. Whatever this reaction is bad or good. I can't stand it to the point that I'd rather not do anything ever or do it so NOBODY can see me doing it just to avoid any kind of reaction or evaluation. 

I can't stand criticism towards me or to whatever it is I'm doing which prevents me from doing anything since I constantly imagine people reacting badly in my head. 

I would say that I'm an avoider. I'm willing to live my life as a vegetable and completely alone just so I could avoid people's reactions, criticisms and expectations and similar scenarios that I mostly imagine in my head. 

What can I do about it? Or maybe you know what this kind of problem called? Thank you!"
863,Need: Opinions,"Hello everyone. Early 20F here👋🏻

Recently went through a contract position and yes im jobless for now. It was damn bad during my contract period and suffered from anxiety and slight depression (as some ppl in the company left and i was left with much more tasks)

Im also feeling a bit hopeless now during this job search period with me applying for tons of position and facing lots of rejections from job applications.

Im also feel sometimes its my own fault of not keeping in touch with past friends and I do only contact a bunch of close friends (yes i can use my 10 fingers to count, thats how little that is). 
I personally feel that obviously it would be great to have more friends to hang out and stuff but I dont feel comfortable to just text someone Im not familiar with to go out with.

I just feel left out on weekends when i do see postings on IG with people hanging out with their friends and stuff like that.

864,How to convince plutomaniacs or money worshippers to get help,"I realized that there aren't enough information out there addressing the issues of people who have developed plutomania or money worship, and I think that it's important for the society to acknowledge that plutomania is a devastating issue that affects both the person with the issue and others around them, much like alcoholism. I think this is especially the case with America after seeing the recent presidency come to an end. We must help rather than to look the other way or point fingers and laugh before it takes over the whole of humanity.

I want to explore general ways to help treat the issue, especially on how to convince them to go get professional help, and even on basic things such as common traits that may be impeding their ability to recognize their problems."

867,Sister half attempted OD. I need to know how to support her so i can help her,"my(22f) sister (20f) took a few extra of her anxiety meds last night and called a friend to take her to emerge. i was called once they got there as we are very close. she’s fine and the doctors probably just think she was trying to get high, but she wasn’t she doesn’t do drugs. I think it was a half attempt at suicide and she realized it was a bad idea 

she wouldn’t talk much last night or this morning but she said she’s embarrassed and doesn’t want to talk. she always tried to keep her feelings to herself and doesn’t like to talk much. she’s lost a lot of opportunity this year and not being at school took a toll (as well as both parents (divorced)dealing with mental health and financial issues). she got on an anti depressant about a month or so ago and said she just felt less emotions but overall i though her mental health was improving.

i’m at all loss, i love her so much and want her to be happy and enjoy life. i don’t know how to support her best and am looking for advice. she’s my best friend and i took care of her when we were little, her so much and just want to help.

868,When bad days are so terrible it makes you believe you are back to square one,"A year ago I was raped and severely traumatized as a result. The first couple of months I was in hell. Frequent flashbacks, daily breakdowns, panic attacks, depressive episodes.. you name it, I'd had them all. It was nothing short of a miracle that I managed to hold down my job when all I could think of was quitting life. 

After lots of therapy, progresses have been made. I've had fewer bad days. Still have depression, anxiety, and a few PTSD symptoms, but for the most part I can function like everyone else. However I still find it hard to manage my bad days. Whenever I have a bad day, I would be lying in bed, flooded with my trauma and drowning in my own misery. I would be so depressed that my brain is hazy and all my motor function is toast. Reaching for my phone takes too much effort. Opening my eyelids seems too much work. When I've reached that state, no amount of therapeutic techniques or positive thinking could save me. I simply become a vegetable, believing I'm a lost cause that's beyond repair.  

Does anyone relate? How do you manage your bad days?"

sorry for all my grammar errors. and jumping around in the post

i'm a very emotional person and have suffered from depression and have tried to commit suicide in the past. so a few weeks ago myself,brother and his girlfriend are looking at old photos of siblings when they were younger. BG ( brothers girlfriend )mentions to my sister about the photos and my sister turns to me in a dead serious voice and says ""next time you f#ck up i'll slit your throat"" and since then I've honestly been ready to lay down and die. i love my sister so much for all she's done for me and when someone you love and admire says that to you. i cant describe the feeling. when .I end up having a crying episode there's always either screaming in my ears or a voice telling me to end it all or how better everyone would be without me.i'm tired of living with chronic wounds from a misdiagnosed surgery and still at 20 being treated like i dont know any better. my sister always says to me i'm not mentally mature. Both my siblings have hit me mostly through the face or put their hands around my throat. And because of how much older and psychically stronger they are than me.I cant do anything. I love my siblings and nephews so much. i cant possibly describe how much they mean to me in writing. but when i see my sister showing affection  to her two boys. I despise them all because. i dont remember what its like for someone to give me a hug or a kiss on the cheek and the constant reminder is the hollow,cold feeling in my chest. there's a lot more but this post was getting a bit long and i'm crying again at this point.

I dont want to die. i want to experience life and see the world but i'm scared that i'm slowly relapsing. I dont want to give up but i'm just tired of fighting and smiling like i'm fine."

876,How Do I Deal With Uselessness?,"  
I don't know where else to post this, please help

I'm unemployed for disability reasons. However, it doesn't really excuse me working from home. The problem is, I don't know what I'm good at. It's led me to believe I am useless. I can't figure out what I'm good at because what I'm good at, I think is terrible.

The hobbies I want to get good at are music and art. But everything I've done just sucks in their own way.

(Not advertising. Just a few examples):

An example of my [art,](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/69da411c-f5ab-4da1-bd29-4bf141b8039b/de7pnh3-412e50b7-ba1e-4ed3-a84f-4d8c2dc0787c.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3sicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvNjlkYTQxMWMtZjVhYi00ZGExLWJkMjktNGJmMTQxYjgwMzliXC9kZTdwbmgzLTQxMmU1MGI3LWJhMWUtNGVkMy1hODRmLTRkOGMyZGMwNzg3Yy5wbmcifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6ZmlsZS5kb3dubG9hZCJdfQ.y9MjVCr-vJa_u7ef29Z_bcdRiUtyCRcJtASWK4pfi9g) that I think looks good, which is rare. It often turns out crap, and part of that is because I can't nail the vibrant anime art style. But it's always a chance for it to look good, and it's similar with music, whether it's a [cover](https://youtu.be/LK0M4VNvSls) or an [original](https://youtu.be/Vdl-a_nFUrc). It has a chance to sound good.

I'm also self taught in everything and can't get education on it for obvious reasons. Different styles, Covid, anxiety, etc.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong when it turns out bad. Which ties into the uselessness. I feel like there's nothing I can do which I can earn money for."

878,Feel like I've regressed and can't use the skills I've learnt in my life.,"I'm sure a lot of people have felt a bit stuck this year, and I have too. Unfortunately, I'd been feeling stuck a few months before the start of this year and it really has only gotten progressively worse. I don't feel like I know how to \*do\* anymore, skills I've built I feel like I can't access anymore.   


I've finished my degree this year, which I haven't even felt. Didn't get to have a graduation ceremony, or even be on campus for my final semester. I've put on a small amount of weight and have exercised and improved my diet on and off and on and off all year, but I can't stabalise to where I feel best, I feel like I don't know how to anymore. Similar issue with my sleep, I'm awake late all the time, and then I'm up early and feeling good. This year has felt like life is just this endless cycle of me getting 50% of where I'm trying to get  then going back to -50%, and back and forth and back and forth. It makes me feel like I can't get a break or get myself even/balanced. It feels unusual for me, it's been a very very long time since it's taken me this long to get myself even.   


I feel trapped, I hate it and I know so much of it is about me making more of an effort, and pushing harder. In some ways I've put in more effort this year than many other years, It's just been starting and getting halfway there over and over and over again. I don't even really feel depressed, I'm having mild anxiety from time to time, which I haven't had for a long time either. I'm not really sure what's up with me. I think I just don't be true to myself and let myself be carried along by the current. I've lost a lot of my discipline and willpower, I just feel like the reasons life mattered to me have changed so drastically that I don't know how to push myself anymore. I don't feel like it, I'm not happy, but I'm not unhappy either. I know a handful of things I want to do, I need to make sure I enroll for my post grad and that's kinda it for now. I'm really not sure how to make myself give more of a shit about doing the things I know would make me feel more like me, and are aligned with myself/what I want to do."

My dad was also very religious till his dad died, now hes an atheist like me, my mom is religious at the moment maybe cause my moms parents are still both a live and wel probably still have 10-15 years left. So my question is, are my parents scared of death? Are my parents more scared of death of their own death or my death? I am terrified of the tought that my parents are gonna die sooner than mine, for 1 month i was very depressed now i am a bit more calm, i used to cry everynight now i dont, maybe because i play with my friends more often, so i dont feel alone. But what should I do to cope with these, and what are the answers to my questions, i would never ask these questions to my family cuz i dont want them to feel sad or realize they have x amount of years left. The way i cope is that, i decided that i am going to live for myself but die for my family and others or my kids, if i have any."
881,"Took a test, now I'm worried about my mental health. What should I do?","I've been feeling down and sad for a long time now. I don't wanna call my self depressed because I don't have some sort of diagnosis, but that's how it feels to me tbh. I recently answered this mental health assessment quiz thing from Psychology Today, thought to be honest I may have exaggerated a bit (but I still felt that way a bit kinda tbh) to make myself appear worse and get attention... anyway that test gave me bad results.  It detected symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (score 79), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (score 80), and Bipolor Disorder (score 86). I'm a bit worried about my mental health, what should I do? Is this test trustworthy?

882,I feels like im just sleepwalking through life right now,"I cant really feel anything, nothing seems fun anymore and i just feel weird. It feels numb. I feel tired, not really sure why im here. Im just walking around feeling like a ghost. Nobody looks at me and it seems like everyone is ignoring me. It feels like im just here for no reason at all. I just want to go to sleep. Maybe not wake up for a year."

884,The ten most significant things I've learned about healing from childhood trauma," 

As  the year ends and the inevitable finish line of what I could call chaos  is upon us, I decided to compile my thoughts on the changes and shifts  of the state of my mental health. This is a top ten list of my most  significant mental health and trauma recovery lessons. In no particular  order:

**1:**  No one is out to get me. - I swear this is the part about recovering  from trauma and abuse that no one mentions. The world, as it turns out,  is, in fact, not against me. I had been all but wrong for years. I  thought and felt that because of what I came from and the people around  me that I must have done something wrong in a former life. Why else  would so many awful acts of violence and anger happen to me? Well, as I  would discover in my late 20’s, the universe, despite my misgivings, is,  in fact, always working in your favor. What I didn’t know is that the  favor is all dependent on my actions. My choices and decisions led to an  out that, more often than not, was negative. So, what did I do? I  shifted the way that I am in the world, and because of that, I realized  that my decisions yielded specific ramifications. No one is out to get  me except me. Taking ownership of my choices in life wholly erased the  narrative that some unsightly underworldly people were after me.

**2:**  Fitness is a factor in healing trauma. - I didn’t get to 350 lbs  overnight. That took some real herculean effort. And almost ten years  after getting serious about my physical health, I still go hard at the  gym, Crossfit, Muay Thai, and other various activities. Countless  studies have correlated mental health to physical health. Walking for  just 20 minutes a couple of times a day can change your life. Don’t  believe me? Google it. It’s was difficult to be motivated to take care  of my physical health because my mental health was so weak, but it was  in doing so that I began to see real changes start to occur in my life.  Through a series of tiny baby steps, I went from doing DDPYoga in my  townhouse living room to fighting with some of the best martial artists  in Thailand. Those steps took years.

Putting  fitness first as a cornerstone to creating a healthy life is without  question, the best choice I have made in my journey of healing my body.  The brain and body connection is severed when recovering from childhood  trauma and abuse, and thus I had to get them reconnected. Pushing my  physical limits not only helped to change my body, but it led me to be  able to understand the depths of my mental capacity in a way I had not  until lying on the ground gasping for air, knowing that I gave a workout  my all.

**3**:  Asking for help will set you up for success. - It was embarrassing to  admit that I was hurt as a child. I stuffed that shit down so deep that  even James Cameron couldn’t find it in one of those fun little  submarines. I hide my hurt, anger, and pain from myself and the world;  until I couldn’t anymore. It rose from the depths, and when I did, I  realized that I could no longer carry the burden of my past alone. I had  to seek help.

Help came in many  forms. I had to open up to my then partner, my siblings, and ultimately  the dozens of therapists that I worked my way through. Help to me meant  saying that I couldn’t coop on my own anymore and that I needed a  support system. Help meant that when I felt my lowest that I reached out  to the people around me. Asking for help as a trauma survivor is like  asking an astronaut to take off their helmet in outer space, it’s  probably not going to happen. However, as I would discover, the only way  I was going to heal from trauma was to be willing to do what felt  impossible and ask for support.

**4**:  Saying sorry is not a weakness. - Sorry was not a word that I heard  very often growing up, and when I did, it felt halfhearted. When I would  apologize, I never meant it. I thought for a long time that I was a  sociopath because of my actions, regardless of how unjust or unkind,  never made me feel any particular way. I had to learn how to feel sorrow  and sadness for my actions and the impact of the people around me.  Learning to let go of the idea that feeling sorry and genuinely meaning  it was weak was an uphill battle for me. I had to let go of whatever ego  held onto my manic desire to always be in the right, and in doing so, I  have been able to form deeper connections with the people around me. I  had a lot of apologizing to do for everything that happened from twelve  to twenty-nine years old. I discovered that in being able to use the  word and feel sorry for my actions that I became closer to me and  further from the trauma that was imbued in my childhood.

**5:**  Not all of my friends are “friends.” - As I changed and stepped further  into my healing journey, I noticed that many of the people that I had  invested time stayed the same. I felt a disconnect between the person I  was becoming and the people they were. I am not saying this is a good or  bad thing; I am just saying that this is my reality. No rule says  people will change along with you, and more often than not, they don’t.  That’s why most relationships fail when one person seeks growth, and the  other is set in their way. A growth mindset is critical in overcoming  childhood trauma, but so are friends that want to grow with you. As I  moved closer to becoming the person I am today, I simultaneously moved  further from the people that wanted me to be the same.

Friends  should want to support you, raise you up, and help you grow, but the  sad truth is that they don’t have to, and it isn’t their job. It’s your  job to do that for yourself. It’s your job to build a community of  support around you. And it’s your job to step away from those that do  not have your best interest in mind.

**6:**  Self-care means doing the hard shit. - I am so incredibly lazy. I wish I  had the words to convey that in a way that would make sense. I hate  doing stuff. I dislike going to the gym, reading, writing, journaling,  meditating, eating healthy, and staying in routine. I loathe the idea  that I have to take care of myself, and I can’t stand the fact that  every day I have to show up for myself. Life would be so much easier if I  could stay in bed all day and not do anything; it would also be a  disaster. The ability to force myself into a constant flow of doing  things that I don’t want to do has been the most significant catalyst in  understanding myself after childhood trauma. In a word, it is AGENCY  that has led me down a path of success. It is in the knowledge that  doing hard things and making difficult choices is why I am where I am  today.

Self-care is about being  uncomfortable in owning who I am. I often wonder what my life would look  like if I stayed on the path I was heading. I would surely be dead. I  can’t imagine a possible positive outcome of drinking and smoking and  fucking myself to death. It would have been Leaving Los Vegas without  the Oscars.

**7:**  When the going gets tough...Cry. - This one is a real doozy. If there  were an order for this list, crying would be somewhere near the top.  Without a doubt being able to step into fully owning my full range of  emotions has set me up for a very bright outlook on the future that is  ahead. Being able to tap into my feelings has not come easy and  certainly not without spiral after spiral of getting trapped in some.  When I first began to “feel,” I was terrified because most of my emotion  capacities had been in the “off” more since I was around nine years  old. I used to tell people that I was always even and level-headed, but  the truth is that I was a wreck inside.

Being  able to step into my emotions fully took years of intensive therapy,  writing, sharing, and getting uncomfortable. It is not only crying that  falls into this lesson learned, but experiencing everything from dread  and sorrow to love and lust has made me feel more human. In American  Psycho, Patrick Bateman says, “And though I can hide my cold gaze, and  you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can  even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not  there.” The opening monologue of the film seemed more like my life’s  mantra until I figured out that accepting emotions is the very thing  that makes me human.

**8:**  Reading is fundamental. - I didn’t go to college. Hell, I didn’t even  graduate high school on time. Yet, I have a vigor for learning that is  only superseded by my want and desire to teach. I have been an avid  reader for the majority of my life, but typically only when it comes to  topics that hold my interests. If you give me a book about the  Industrial Revolution, it would likely sit on my bookshelf for the  remainder of my life, but if you give me a book like The Body Keeps The  Score, now you have my interest. From being an entrepreneur to a public  speaker and now an author, I have had to educate myself the  old-fashioned way through the written word.

The  amount of education that you can receive from a few bucks in late fees  at the library or awesomely-random Goodwill finds will blow your minds.  Currently and for the last couple of years, I have read about a book a  week but typically no less than three a month. It is the words scribed  on these countless pages that have helped me understand myself, the  world, how to heal childhood trauma, and how to show up for myself.

These are my 10 favorite books of the last 10 years that have helped me heal trauma

(In no particular order and not based on year released but when I read them):

1. Life  of Pi - Yann Martel - I don’t ever read fiction. This is one of two  I’ve read as an adult. Life of Pi is so beautiful and inspiring.
2. Jay-Z Decoded - Jay-Z -My first real hero. If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
3. Jab, Jab, Jab Right Hook. - Gary Vaynerchuk - A real entrepreneur bible of sorts.
4. Mindset - Carol Dweck - Everything you need to know about the capacity for change is in these pages
5. Radical  Acceptance - Tara Brach - The way we talk to ourselves will either make  us better or worse. One of my favorite books ever.
6. The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog - Bruce Perry - The stories in this book will haunt you and make you want to change the world.
7. Can’t Hurt Me - David Goggins - READ THIS BOOK
8. Bossy Pants - Tina Fey - There is no such thing as an overnight success
9. On Writing - Stephen King - If you want to be a good writer, you have to be a good reader.
10. Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - Just read it!

**9:**  If you don’t stand for something, you will fall for anything. - I had  to figure out what the hell my values were and not just in a figurative  sense. I had lived so much life without meaning or purpose and without  acknowledgment of the person that I wanted to be. I had no idea of the  person that I was because I hadn’t dived deep enough into myself to make  a declaration about what it meant to be me. MOST people have no idea of  what their values are, and for the majority of my life, I was right  beside them. Values are the baseline for the way I now live my life. It  may have taken me thirty years to figure them out, but without doing so,  I would not be where I am now.

Take  time and think about what values hold true to the person that you are  and the person that you want to be. It is in understanding myself in an  authentic way that I was able to make healthy choices and create agency  where needed amid difficult choices.

These are my core values (in this particular order):

1. Honesty
2. Kindness
3. Leadership
4. Self-Actualization
5. Momentum

**10:**  The road is long. - I used to think there would be an end to this whole  “trauma thing.” I would come home from a therapy session or massage or  finish another world-changing book and think, “this is the last piece of  the puzzle.” I don’t think this way anymore. I understand the scope of  healing in such a way that I have acknowledged that this process simply  will not end. I don’t know that it will always be so arduous, but there  is no day in my future that I get to hang up the child abuse hat and get  to wear the “I’m a normal guy now” hat. I have rationalized that in  every way that I can and it has left me with the idea that there is no  other choice than to put my boots on, step onto the road, and to  continue the journey until there is no more. This is why I wrote Think  Unbroken and giving it away for free, and why I believe that no matter  what we must stay the path!

Until next time my friend...

Be Unbroken,

885,How do I know that I should need a Psychologist?,"I go through this period with mood swings. I feel fine in the day, but at night I feel sad, not without reason. I have been unemployed for a year, so sometimes I feel worthless and tired of the comments and suggestions of people around me. I don’t know if I need a psychologist or not."
886,My stupid family got covid.,"My ultra christian conservative family in the Midwest who I love but have distanced myself from for my mental health decided to have a Thanksgiving get together despite the global pandemic... and now my whole family has COVID including my elderly grandparents and my dad and step mom. And a bunch of young adults. I am freaking out and I'm just infuriated because I've been warning them since March and following guidelines and warning everyone to take this seriously and they just dont listen.  They are freaking brainwashed, and it's infuriating and depressing. Now they could die because of their complete ignorance and neglect of the situation.

I already called out last week from work due to depression and anxiety and I can't miss any more time off as I'm ""essential"" and I don't know how I will make it through another week of this."
887,I'm on edge,"I've been inside me house without seeing my girlfriend or my friends since the 27th of October.
My girlfriend doesn't understand my situation and everybody just say to rub it off and I can't take this anymore.
I'm thinking about self harm again. I feel so much pain, sadness and stress. I have to work in the morning with smart working and I have online lessons in the afternoon. Both are so stressful and the fact that I can't see anyone except my family doesn't help.
I've become desperate and I kept crying all day and being angry. I'm so on edge. I feel hopeless and I'm afraid this experience has changed me as a person in the core.
Please, someone help me."
888,Just remember...,"If you're being chased down and attacked by your demons, it's probably because you're delicious. Proof? I read an article that says we are our own worst critics because we are also our biggest fans. Also, don't forget, covetousness leads to destructive, new-world communism. Thanks."
889,I am always talking to NPC's,"The social interactions I am presented with leaves my mind at a standstill. The people I meet, the things they care about, the causes they deem worthy and people they find meaningful. Im drawn to a blank state of acknowledgement, just wondering ""what is the human response to this"" 

I wish to tell them, ""I have acknowledged your statement"" as there is nothing more to be said. But i understand this will not be perceived in the manner I do. Social interactions for me the past couple years have felt, empty. They are not enjoyable as it reduces time to actualize ideas into actions, to work towards my goals. I believe I can satisfy myself with artificial sources of socializing to fit social needs. I am still a social animal after all, not a robot. 

Has anyone here felt similar? I would like to stay true to the content of my character, and would not like to put on a song and dance routine as an autonomous response."
890,I got sent a dick pic the one day I'm genuinely happy.,"So I didnt sleep last night, and I'm for some fucking reason feeling fucking amazing. I get an insta notification that someones started following me, I click on their name and I'm not that paranoid when it comes to my social since I dont really release my personal information. I think I only have 1 pic of my face on there. But anyway I decide why the fuck not let's follow him back, there's no harm right? So I'm sitting there and I get a message notification that hes messaged me, keep in mind that this guys 20, supposedly taken, and I'm a minor, so I open it and it's a god forsaken portrait shot of his member. I'm not that big a fan of sexual harrassment and I blocked and reported him immediately. I'm so fucking done with social media, the last time I left was cause of something similar with my ex.
WHY THE FUCK ARE GUYS LIKE THIS?!?!?"
891,Discord servers?,"Looking for resources on...

Depression

Anxiety

Panic attacks

Eating disorders

Insomnia

Interpersonal skills / autism

I’d like to join servers that will hold me accountable to being responsible about my mental health."
892,Want to alone,I've got people in my life that love me but all I want to do is be alone push them out because I know that I'm to much work and not worth the time so want to be less of a burden anyone else get this
893,Virtual learning,"Do you agree if i say that online learning does not only affect our performance but our mental health as well, plus being surrounded by inconsiderate family members. I just wanna go back to dorm and live my student life as usual. Sigh, pandemic sucks"
894,Barely above the void of despair that looms beneath me,"This is a long post, I’m sorry for grammatical errors and such, and generally being scatter-brained in my thoughts. Some days, the grief is just overwhelming and I can’t think straight. Typing this fresh off of a good crying session.

I (26F) feel absolutely worthless. My life feels like it has gone from bad situation to worse situation, so on and so forth. Every time I pull myself back up and throw myself at the world, determined to make a difference and fix my life, I get kicked back down. In a time that I should have been pursuing legal action on a former roommate for theft, I had to struggle with just my husband’s help to move all of our furniture from our house to my mother’s house, especially because she wouldn’t take us. Said it would cost too much to pursue any legal action. And I, in my grief at the loss of some of the only things I had worked so hard to procure for myself, blindly agreed because thinking was hard. It was all we could do to move the furniture and stuff out. We threw away so much, and in the end still lost even more due to the landlords locking us out and taking everything left to the dump. I can’t describe how much of a last resort moving in with my mother again was, and even now I wish I’d just gone to a homeless shelter to get resources... I thought maybe we could help her, as she was struggling to go through my dad’s stuff and with house upkeep. We kept up with that, but even when we had jobs we did it all alone. And we still haven’t had a chance to unpack our boxes and things, nor have we gone through any of my father’s stuff in two years of being here. It’s always too hard for her, and when we offer to do it for her she says she can’t trust that we wouldn’t throw away things she finds important so they just sit in her front room. We aren’t allowed to drive the only vehicle, we can’t ask to be taken anywhere or it results in a long yelling fit about how ungrateful we are and how we’re using my mother. She’s postponed taking my husband to finish his security certification paperwork so he can get a job for the past 3 months. Every day we plan and set something up, she’s struggling with her depression and anxiety and says things like “I don’t feel like chauffeuring around ungrateful children who can’t even keep up with the house.” It just really hurts because we’ve been trying everything we can for the past two years to keep up with everything.
There are 10 freaking cats in this house, 2 dogs, my 6 y/o who I’m trying to help cope with the loss of someone who was around and part of the family since right after he was born, he doesn’t understand why anything happened. My husband and I both struggle with depression and anxiety. And we’re still expected to not only do all of the house chores (“you make up 3/4ths of this household, besides you said you’d help.”) but to motivate my mother to feel like doing things again. I can’t motivate anyone to save my life, much less myself, but she needs me to motivate her. And when I can’t manage to motivate her, or tell her I’m struggling really bad too and can’t find the words, she tells me how she feels completely alone and isolated in this house and taken advantage of and used... She has her own traumas and I try not to hold them against her. Her mother is a borderline personality disorder narcissist, so says the psychiatrist... My baby brother was murdered by our babysitter when I was 4, and I witnessed it but had repressed memories from trauma that didn’t resurface until around 13 or 14 in the form of nightmares. My father died 2 years ago. My father’s whole family spent the entire time we planned his memorial service and etc berating us and telling us how they shouldn’t have to contribute financially and that they didn’t want anything to do with us, etc. To top it all off, struggling with bills has been a huge amount of stress for her. So I try not to hold things against her. But then I get told that I should, that I need to get away from her. My own husband tells me almost daily how toxic she is. She’s punched me in the face and restrained me by putting me in a strangle-hold so that she could punch me in the face, left open scratches on my throat, but called the cops on me for slapping her to get away from her because I couldn’t breathe. And I’m the monster. Every day, I hear about how ungrateful I am and how I’m not doing enough to help her, that she should just kick us out onto the streets because “everyone says you need to fall on your a**es first to succeed, and that I should just focus on taking care of myself.” But the only person she ever talks to is a therapist that she recently stopped seeing. She and the therapist were fighting and she’d come home crying and be desolate for 2-3 days, barely coming out of her room except to eat when we made dinner. I get to hear all about her therapy appointments, though. How she tells her that I’m using her and we aren’t motivated and we don’t ever get anything done, how the therapist tells her to kick us out and dump the cats that are ours outside because they aren’t her responsibility. Her therapist apparently tells her to kick us out and focus on herself. They fought because mom said she isn’t capable of kicking out the only family she has left, which makes me feel even guiltier. Her side of the family randomly stopped contacting her altogether, except her aunt that buys the cat and dog food because we struggle. 3 adults, and not one job. My husband has taken security classes for training, had everything paid for by the state because we are on food stamps, and my mother covers rent and then some with widows benefits and money from investments. She eats out almost nightly, and definitely every time she goes out, she speaks openly of it. But she blames us for the money struggle because I lost my job at the start of covid, and my husband’s not working security yet. The food in the house is provided entirely by the food stamp money I get for my son, but she keeps it in her purse and does all of the shopping by herself. Sometimes she’ll take me with her, when I volunteer. But I have to volunteer because, if I don’t, she will otherwise go to the store alone, but whatever she wants, and then text about how useless I am and I never help her and leave her to do all of the hard work. She shops for 2-4 hours sometimes, then spends the rest of the day sleeping because it exhausts her. Any suggestion of perhaps seeing a doctor for unusual exhaustion due to my concern for her is met with “you’re not going to convince me there’s anything wrong with me, I have problems with my thyroid but it’s fine, I’m 60 years old this year, it’s normal.” (She just turned 60, before turning 60 she would just say “I’m almost 60, it’s normal.” But it’s not. We cook dinner for her, she sits and eats, and then she falls asleep, sitting up, at the table! We’ll be holding conversations with her and actively talking, and she’ll slightly jostle awake and respond with something that couldn’t even have been mistaken. Like talking about politics, and she wakes up talking about how my son needs to stop chasing the cat around the table?? I don’t know, it’s all messing with my head really badly. I’ve always struggled with my own depression and anxiety, I used to be heavily dependent on self-harm until I moved out of the house at 18. I attempted suicide twice, and chickened out many more times. I need someone to talk to, I need a therapist. I can’t afford my medications, and I can’t afford to see anyone. My mother says I just have to wait until I have a car and money and can take myself because she won’t shoulder that burden and shouldn’t have to. And that’s fine, but then I’m constantly called lazy and pathetic when she’s mad at me. She screams at me that I need serious help. And I’d get it all in a heartbeat if I had any way to. I’m desperate. I used to take anxiety medication (sertraline 100mg), though I steered clear of ever using Xanax for my panic attacks because even the thought of addiction terrifies me. My mother is addicted to nicotine and that’s scary enough for me, watching her flip from joking around to screaming at my father about divorce because she’s out of cigarettes scared me enough as a kid. I used to take medicine for depression as a teen, but stopped because I couldn’t find the right medication and dosage for myself, but I’m wondering if I need it. I used to regularly take iron pills and b-complex and vitamin d, because my legs and arms hurt really bad and my energy tanks if I don’t, and I only have semi-regular access to any now because I sometimes ask for it when she goes out to buy cigarettes, even though I know it’ll upset her because I’m using her to get the things I should be providing for myself. I feel so so bad. But I need this stuff. I’m worried it has to do with my heart defect (born with it), or any number of other things. It’s terrifying. Just regular access to the basic, over-the-counter, things greatly helps me. I last saw a doctor 3 years ago (with my own money and insurance, before everything fell apart) and was diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, which I’m told contributes to depression and anxiety. And that was the last time I had any regular access to medications. I’m so stressed out. 
Now, two days ago(?), on the 3rd of this month I think? The days run together, I’m sorry. We had had a really good day, despite another postponing of getting my husband’s papers notarized because my mother had too much anxiety to get out of bed, she came into the kitchen screaming at 5pm. My husband and I were playing a game with our son, in our bedroom. We had done everything but the dishes and some laundry. I though maybe she’d be upset about the dishes? She berated us for playing the game, calling us lazy, because apparently she had texted us 4 or 5 times. My husband never received any of the texts, which isn’t unusual as the service out here sucks. We live in a town of a couple thousand, about 15-20 minutes away from the nearest town, and 30-45 minutes away from a city. I had gotten one text from her saying “anyone reply? This sucks!” About 3 minutes before she came in the kitchen screaming. When I mentioned that it could be the phone service, she yelled at me that it’s all she can afford and if I want to complain I can get my own phone service and followed it up with calling me... Unpleasant things. I’m prone to snapping, I have been since I was a kid. My mother has always know just what to say to really hurt me, because I always confide in her when things are good. And things can be really good! Sometimes, she’s just completely “normal” and we get along great and get things done together. It’s a nice feeling. But, I digress, I’m prone to snapping. It’s something my husband and I worked on, something I’ve had to work really hard at controlling in myself. Something I genuinely feel proud of when I can stop that switch from flipping. I don’t like being angry, I know it makes me irrational, and I want to set a better example for my son. But what she said hurt, so I yelled it back at her. Which is all my fault for what happened next. She started in with even worse insults, and got up in my face. My husband stepped in between us, because he knows what happened when she hit me, but he wasn’t there to stop it. He’s seen her slap me, he’s seen her shove me into a wall, but he’s always been too far away to stop it. When he stepped between us, she hit him. But he just stood there and yelled over her to calm down. So she started in on taunting him “oooh, you’re real tough, big man.” “You’re a joke, you can’t even provide for your family.” And started telling us to get out. That she wanted us out of her house. I paid rent for a full year or more, and she takes my food stamps every month to pay for all of the food, even when I was working. Money I get because my son is 6 and my husband and I don’t make enough. She said she was going to call the landlords to have them evict us. And then my son walked into the kitchen. For a moment, that was all she focused on. In a bad way. While I was trying to comfort him and suggest we go watch TV in his room, she starts yelling at him about how worthless his parents are and the whole night has gone downhill because mommy and daddy are in a bad mood and using grandma and taking advantage of her. So he just shut down. He laid down, face-down on the linoleum faux-wood flooring and curled up into a little face-down ball crying. So I picked him up and carried him to his room. I don’t know what happened after that. I know my husband called the cops because she was hysterical. When he tried to talk to her after that she just mumbled something and then said a little louder “you don’t exist.” And “None of this is real.” So my husband hovered and checked on our son and me periodically, kept an eye on my mother, and spoke to the cops when they got here. They spoke to her for a brief period of time, in her room. Then told my husband that things would be okay, and that she’d agreed to stay in her room the rest of the night and that “amends will be made in the morning.” She didn’t stay in her room at all. She wandered through the house slamming things, and we stayed in our room with our son with us because he was scared of grandma. “Grandma is being really scary, and I don’t want her to see me.” It just broke my heart. Amends still haven’t been made, nor any attempts. If she sees us in the kitchen, she acts like we don’t exist. She doesn’t talk to us, or communicate with us at all. We have continued with cleaning house and doing laundry, making food, etc. she just stays in her room unless she needs to eat or yesterday she finally showered for the first time in a month, because she went to the store. I wake up at 7:30 am and go to bed anywhere from 12am - 1:30 am depending on the chores that need done. And I wake up with this feeling of impending doom hanging over me. She’s never this silent, and the fights she and I have had have been so much worse. But I don’t know what to do. If we get kicked out, I know we can fight it in this state. Especially since we have a little one. But I don’t know if I want to fight it. I don’t want my son on the streets, nor even myself tho I think I could manage at this point. I just know there has to be something better than this. I’m tired of all this pressure and anxiety. Tired of waking up, fearing I’ll find an eviction notice sitting on the table. She threatens to throw us out so regularly, over every little thing, that I can’t even say I’m surprised anymore, but I still fear it more than anything. I can’t say this house has ever felt like a home, I constantly feel like an unwelcome guest who is trespassing, but I’m grateful to have a roof over our heads and food to eat on a regular basis. But without a car to drive, my husband has to walk 3 hours there and 3 back to get this paper notarized. He’s currently planning to do that tomorrow. But still, just yesterday morning she took all of the cat food and dog food into her room, despite the fact that her dogs’ bowls are in the kitchen. I can smell cat feces and urine when I pass by her room, and not exclusively cat urine either. It’s disturbing me further, but I can’t do anything. I feel so helpless and powerless. My husband’s struggle to find work outside of security training and classes has been baffling, but I know he’s trying. I help him with his applications at least a couple of times a day. He has a decent work history, even it shouldn’t be a problem. But it always has for him. He has no criminal record or anything, found that out for 100% sure because he had to have a background check for becoming a security guard. I don’t know. It’s a horrible time, made even worse by the strain that Covid has out on the whole world. I fear that we’re really going to be one of those families that falls through the cracks. I want to help my mother, but I can’t take this anymore. I feel like if I defend her actions and forgive her constantly because I know what she’s been through, then I’m enabling the way she behaves which is really scary. She’s so put-together in public, like she’s a completely different person. We’re disheveled at best. Not filthy, no un-brushed hair or anything, we just look like hell I think. At least, I think I do, and I know I can see the stress on my husband’s face. My weight is fluctuating wildly. And we look the part of what she tells everyone. Lazy children who don’t care for their child, can’t make a living, and are using her for her money and everything she’s got. She pulls down a lot of sympathy that way. I just want to prove everyone wrong. This situation hurts so bad. On the other hand, I feel like if I just sit around and call her toxic and abusive that I really am just being an ungrateful child who can’t get her life back together. I feel like an utter failure, deserving of everyone’s scorn. That hurts really bad too. Sometimes I wake up and just cry quietly where I won’t disturb my husband. I don’t know what to do, I’m trying to get a job and keep this house clean and somewhat organized amidst the two houses worth of furniture and two houses+ of pets and I feel like I’m failing at that. My husband does half of the work, and I do the other, and yet jobs are scarce and I’m a failure for it finding work. My husband feels like a failure. I have no friends and no family, the family and friends I did have don’t associate with me because of the things my mother has told them over the last couple of years, but they don’t associate with her either so I don’t know if it’s me or her they’re steering clear of. I feel like my future is completely hopeless. I feel suicidal again. I don’t want to fall into that. I found myself tracing my thumb nail back and forth over my wrist absent-mindedly yesterday when things got quiet and I got lost in my thoughts and it really scared me. It only left a red line that faded in an hour or so, but that terrifies me. I worked so hard to get clean of my dependency on self-harm and to heal my mind so I didn’t feel suicidal anymore. My depression and anxiety were manageable for so long. I had a great job, my husband did too. I was going to be promoted soon, and get a raise with better hours. I was able to buy clothes for myself and my son, and my husband was able to the same. We were financially independent, with a car and new phones I was paying on with credit slightly above neutral. It was effortless, we didn’t have to worry about rent or anything. And one bad roommate, a friend we’d known for years, cleaned us out one night and left without a trace. In my grief, I didn’t do what I should have, I didn’t file charges or pursue legal action, and when I finally felt like I should, it was too late. I was told I couldn’t file the charges any longer. The car, luckily, was still under payment contract. I know they managed to recover the car, but had to pay for backed up payments and damages to the car. Which I did do, in the year that I was working. So that’s off my back at least. I don’t know how I’ll ever pay off the phones, I know the debt got sold to collectors but they don’t harass me too much. Still, it was recently brought up as to why I didn’t pursue legal action against the ex roommate and I just immediately felt guilty. Like really guilty. I should have pursued that, and I didn’t, and that’s one more failure to add to my list. Now, that jerk still has the phone he stole. Probably. And I’m sure he spent the money from our last paychecks, but it was cash so I never really thought I could do anything about that. And now I really wish I would have. In the face of all that’s happening, that has been happening, I wonder if pursuing those legal charges could have actually done something better for my life. Maybe I wouldn’t be here at least. I know it doesn’t do me any good to dwell on it, but it’s an intrusive thought that’s haunting me. Every time I think about looking for resources to get out of here I freeze up. I’m so sick and tired of hurting and being scared and sad and feeling helpless and lost and like a failure, but I’m scared that that’s all I’ll find out there. For all my mother is, she has helped us. We might not have even a roof over our head or food if it wasn’t for her allowing us to move in here. But we’re really lost, and it feels like things have just deteriorated past a point of no return and I don’t know how to cope. I’m so scared for my son, and I’m also scared for my husband and I, but really I don’t want this for my son. My choices as this point feel like I can either stay here and have us all be constantly berated and yelled at, or to go on the streets and risk losing my son to dhs/cps. He’s so young, I don’t want that for him. I don’t want to lose my baby boy either. But, mostly, I don’t want him to end up on the wrong side of foster care. I could live with my failure as his mother, as long as he ends up safe and happy. But I want more than anything for him to be safe and happy with me. I want to be able to provide for him and know that he’s safe. He’s one of the few reasons I still get up in the morning. I don’t know what to do. Any move I make at this point is filled with total uncertainty and feels like a death sentence at best. But I can’t fall apart or this really will fail. I don’t know anymore. Am I really making things better by fighting what seems to be the inevitable?


Anyways, that’s it, I’m sorry it’s so long and probably hard to follow.

Thanks for letting me vent, just getting this out of my head helps a ton. I don’t expect anyone to have any more answers than I do but, if you have any advice or words that might help, I’m happy to hear them. But please don’t feel obligated to say anything on my behalf, I don’t want anyone to put themselves out on my behalf. If you read all this way, my heart goes out to you no matter what. I know that everyone has their own struggles. Knowing that someone, anyone, hears me is enough to help more than a little. I’m sorry if I’ve added to anyone’s burden by you reading my troubles. 

It took a lot of... Courage? To post here. I had to work up to it over months, and have only posted now because I’m scared of what happens if I don’t vent at least some. But I will try my best to keep up with comments or answer questions if anyone has any for me. If I don’t answer, please know that it’s just my anxiety getting the better of me. I panic if I don’t know how to respond to people, I’m sorry. I hope everyone is having a better time than me, and doesn’t have to have this kind of experience- or anything close- ever, at any point in their life. And if you have or are,  I am so sorry. I wish you all luck and good health and happiness moving forward in your lives."
895,Needing answers and not getting any,"Is being hyper aware of dangerous or upsetting situations reoccurring based on actual events part of ocd? Or wanting distance from things associated with some of said events? Ocd is described as being based on irrational fears, but my fears are a response to events in my life that have been quite traumatic. Varying from weeks to months to years of distressing situations from childhood and some ongoing. In treatment they talked about ocd despite explaining some of said situations and the impact had on me. 

Thanks for any replies."
896,I feel like I need a connection,"I don’t know if this belongs in relationship advice or here but I’m posting it here because I’m kind of more concerned about my mental health. I’ve been through a lot lately. Like satans asshole a lot. And I decided to cope with you know flirting and hoeing around and s*exting and stuff, as one does I guess. But I only do with the people that I actually vibe with because who wants to do that stuff with someone that they don’t get along with, maybe that’s just me idk... but I don’t know. I feel like I’m just yearning for this affection and deep connection that I’ll never get with these people. And the one I’m attached to the most is also very damaged and has been through a lot just like me. I don’t want to distance myself from him because I do like him a lot, not just as a “friend with benefits “ but as an actual friend. It really hurts me when he doesn’t talk to me for hours, though. (We are both people who text a lot, so to me, a few hours without a reply is concerning) and it’s been happening a lot lately. I really think he only talks to me when he’s bored or high and it’s usually for validation or s*x, which I DO KNOW is the point, but like I said before I like to be friends with people before fwb. I don’t know. It’s really damaging my sense of self worth but I would still like to talk to this person. I don’t even know if this makes any sense to anyone else but me because typing it out I feel like I sound like a real fking loser if I’m honest, which at this point I kind of am because I’m so desperate, I don’t know. I don’t really know what to do because I really like this person and he’s pretty cool but I’m always anxious that he’ll ghost or something. Ah, I just hate it. I feel like it’s just me being desperate for a connection beyond physical but at the same time I feel like I actually like this person. I really just don’t know where my mental state is anymore. I know it’s irrational for me to think a physical relationship could continue with a friendship or whatever I’m feeling. My counselor said that I shouldn’t let people have so much power over my emotions but literally gave me no advice on how to?? Like?? I apologize to anyone reading this because I’m just spitting out all the shit that comes to my head lol."
897,Feel so alone and a total failure?,"Hi everyone, I recently got diagnosed with ADHD. My whole life has been one huge struggle of failure after failure and a series of unfortunate events. I have never succeeded at anything, I had chronic social anxiety my whole life because people found me irritating, weird, would bully me, be harsh with me and horrible to me, look down on me thinking I'm lazy and don't care. I am now thirty and I feel everywhere I go I am an outcast, a freak who nobody understands. I am currently trying to deal with all these problems I have and it's really difficult. I have all this shame and guilt for not being a functional adult, and having struggled this badly all my life. 

People think from looking at me from the outside that I am this careless person who has had an easy life because I look healthy and come across healthy and seem educated. The reality is I've dropped out of every course I tried in the first semester because I couldn't handle feeling so overwhelmed by everything. I have chronic low self esteem and confidence and no friends and am full of shame. I have no confidence in myself, and when someone criticizes me I feel like crying. The therapist is trying to help me with this, but I feel like a hopeless case, and am humiliated for anyone to know, that is why I avoid social interaction. When I do interact it usually ends with me feeling horrible about myself anyway, cause I see how more functional they are and their lives, which causes me to feel a complete waste of space. I was wondering how do you handle a life like this, how do you interact with people when they don't understand??? I feel so alone. Other than having a professional to talk about with and who's charging me through the roof, I've nobody."
898,"A nice experience with Notion, and an offer to help anyone considering using it","TL;DR I've had an amazing experience using Notion for a bit to manage my tasks, studies and mental health and I want to help out. Hit me up in PMs or chat if you'd like to sit down and build a solid Notion database for yourself. 

I've been using Notion consistently for about a month now, having attempted to use it in several ways (just as I did with a bullet journal) throughout the years, and having pared it down to something usable instead of something super complex and fancy and definitely not a means to an end. I think I've found a good compromise between usability, aesthetics and putting things in their right place, and I feel quite happy about it.

I know a month is hardly long enough to vouch for the long-term effectivity, but I know when I am in the pits and feeling like my life is un-unfuckable having something to hold on to in terms of structure helps, and Notion was just that anchor for me during this extremely rough month, alongside my actual support network. 

I'm posting this on several subreddits, the content of which might give you an overview of what I think Notion has helped me with: r/DecidingToBeBetter r/GetStudying, r/StopGaming, r/ADHD, r/mentalhealth. I always feel up to helping out people in the same situation as me when I am not as lost myself, and I wanted to offer everyone on these subreddits my help with setting up their own Notion dashboards and content. I would normally post a list of tips and move on, but there are plenty of tutorials online and what I needed at the time was for someone to sit down with me and consider my particular circumstances, so that's what I want to do with anyone who writes to me."
899,I am spiraling...,"I know anger is natural in our range of human emotion...but not when it is a smoldering toxic cauldron that you can feel coming from someone else to the point of discomfort. It makes me feel resentment and anger right back towards the people who have toxic, angry personalities...even more so of they are in denial and refuse to get help for their issues.
I have anger too, but it often turns into suicidal depression, which is what i take medication for and go to therapy for, for most of my life since i was a teenager.
Everything feels much worse and much more compounded since this joke of a year, from the stress of this pandemic, my life feeling like it is painfully on hold...losing touch with friends and loved ones due to crappy social distancing when i need that comfort the most...
...everything is lacking. No support network anymore like before...therapy over the phone is terrible...i need a different type of therapy during this temperature time. I need validation and support rather than pressure...or i absolutely breakdown.
I hope my therapist understands what i am communicating...my limitations at this time, that is temporary. This temporary pandemic.
I just wanted to vent here...i am only looking for understanding and positive support and validation right now. Maybe i shouldnt even bother with trying to post anything on here...i am scared that i will lose it soon. I just want to be heard."
900,Can a person trigger your depression ?,"The person is question is my cousin sister. She always wants what's good for me and tries to be there through good and bad times even if I'm the one who pushes her away all the time. Pushing people away is like an instinct to me but whenever we meet(she lives in another state) or talk through phone  it's like a chemical reaction in my brain and bam! My depressions triggered. I love her to death, honestly, so I dont want to let her go. I know this is fucked up, but I don't know any other way to express these feelings. Like what am I supposed to do ? Should I try talking to her about this or should I just let things be ? It's alright if you didn't understand anything cause neither do I."
901,"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

902,I'm feeling really lonely again,"Hello friends I'm just feeling really lonely again at the moment. I think it's worse again because it's mostly because the gyms are all closed and I miss the other people I usually train with multiple times a week and that I also would call my friends. I just really feel like being part of a group.
But it also made me realize that I really don't have any friends outside of the gym and not a single person I feel close enough too that I could share these feelings with.
I'm still to incompetent to open myself up and be vulnerable for once.
I crave someone I could share my emotions with and be intimate with but at the same time even thinking about this scares me so much."
903,Why does everything hurt so much lately?,Idk what’s happening but I feel so much pain inside my heart even when a small incident occurs. I normally just suppress or cry out my feelings but lately it seems everything hurts and tires me out more than usual. Like I feel so much aching in my heart and I feel breathless. I try to find the root of the problem and it’s usually a childhood traumatic experience and it just makes me feel even more hurt. Unlike earlier rather than to find a solution to my hurting I just feel so irrational and my brain can’t think anything. There’s only one thing on my mind- it hurts and pains much- no matter how much I try to divert my mind.
904,i don’t know whats wrong with me and why am i feeling like this,"i literally hate my life i feel like an ugly lonely shit, all i do is stay in bed all day and just sleep thru the day, watch tv shows, not doing online school and the saddest thing is that i dont care ab the grades at all when im getting so much pressure from my parents and my teacher. i literally dont wanna go outside anymore, i feel cringey ab everythinf cause of my stupid silly past and i just wanna cry how boring and sad is in here. idk whats wrong with me, if its just teenage shit or pms or im just lazy or i really have some issues but i literally feel like shit since the summer ended and idk what is happening with me"
905,How I lost 60 lbs in just 60 days,[removed]
906,Im tired of myself im tired of this,"I have a really big problem in my life and i dont know what is causing it i cant open up about myself in therapy or to anyone, i cant fell understood and i cant express whats wrong, right now im in a house with my friends and i tink im acting cold towards them and the problem is thath i dont know why i just font understand myself im tired of myself im tire of how hard relationship are im going to therapy but because covid i have to wait probably monts im tired of not undarstanding myself and whats wrong with me"
907,what it is called when you irrationally hate a group of people for no logical reason?,"some backstory, I go to a school, and nearby, there is another school, the fees of which are higher. not much mind you, both schools have kids of more or less the same socio economic status, and kids often move between them. the next door school though is a fair bit more expensive, more reputable, and generally seen as better, though it is certainly not 'incomparable' to ours. I've always struggled with my financial image, and have generally spent most of my life with peers who are better off than me, sometimes by quite a bit, and I sometimes find this difficult to cope with and I resent it quite a bit sometimes, but it's been manageable.

this neighborhood school though takes my insecurities to the next school. for some reason I have this mental image of this school as filled to the brim with foreigners and white people (in a primarily native city with VERY few westerners), with kids roaming around with MacBooks and iphones and super expensive shoes, while I make do with my 6 year old HP and android and dusty trainers. moreover, I've been in semi close to close relationships with two people from this school, both of which ended rather badly. 

the issue with this whole inferiority complex i have is that, I have met and am close to quite a few of the sort of people I have described as going to the next door school. kids who's parents have too much money and nothing to do with them, who accumulate shoes and clothes for fun, and outside of the occasional item I wished I had, I've been mostly fine compartmentalising and trivialising it. 

but yet, when it comes to next door, I can barely even glance at the particular shade their uniform is without a deep deep hatred and anger, both at them and at myself for being 'so poor and irrelevant',  (I put this in quotes because it's exaggerated when my head goes to these places or inferiority, for all intents and purposes my life is functionally the same as most of my peers). its somewhere between deep seated anger and deep despair at my inferiority to these people, such that I have developed an intense dislike to any and all things that relate to this school, whether it be the uniform, their interschool events, their students, everthing. 

yet at the same time, I often seek approval from them, from the few students from this school that I do know, rejoicing when the students follow me back on social media, and despairing when they don't.its gotten to the point where I sometimes check that these students haven't unfollowed me. it's an odd mix of resentment and hatred, despair that I'm less than them, and constantly requiring validation from them.


tldr ; I've had  issues with feeling inferior financially to my peers, and it's gotten a lot worse with a particular next door school, and especially after I've had relationships turn sour with two students from that school. I constantly feel poorer, less relevant, less important that people from that school, mixing resentment and hatred towards students and staff from that school, despair that Im not like them, and validation seeking from students from that school on social media by getting them to follow me back. 

all this in spite of the fact that the difference between my school and the next door one is marginal at best, and I've met far richer people with far less resentment. these odd feelings are only for people with a connection to that school.


so I suppose what Im trying to ask is, what on earth is wrong with me? is there a name for what I'm experiencing? more importantly, can I fix this?"
908,i can't control myself.,"for the past 3 years i've been living in stasis.nothing about my life changed for the better.every single attempt to take control and fix myself was a failure.i sometimes even find it challenging to force myself to stand up.

ironically,the solution is,no matter what,along the lines of ""do something healthy for yourself"".is there hope for someone like me?

if you understand me,then i think you agree that death is the best option for me, even though i'll have to just hope that something kills me with no input from me

if you have advice that i haven't heard countless times before,go ahead and let me know.i will be thankful and mindful of what you propose."
909,I hate admitting this but if I weren’t an attractive female I would’ve killed myself a long time ago.,it’s just the truth and it makes me really sad because this is just how I personally feel about myself. Can someone help me with this please? I don’t know it’s the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet. Pretty privilege is real. I’m just worried because my self worth is strongly tied to my looks. Help me please
910,The best part of mental illness.,"I love being fully aware of my faults. Knowing exactly what my threshold is and exactly how my life should be lived. I am never unaware of my place in society. I have safe guards and protections in place for my miss behavior if it should ever go too far. I have a reason for treatment and personal goals to strive for. And the depression. I’ve dealt with it my whole life so it’s easier every time. “Why me” or “my life’s not fair”. Becomes “why can’t I” and “I’d be even more successful if I succeed”. I love the gifts my mental illness gave me. If I could be average, I would give it all up any day. But I’d never succeed the way I’d wish if I was. I love my curse. It is what it is. I feel many average people could never have my mental strength. As soon as shit gets rough they give up. I feel as though I’m mentally conditioned to do things many would fear. Many would never give up because of the luxuries they were afforded. “My bipolar is my super power” - Kanye West"
911,Vent: When a doctor asks you who is your support system...,"And you don't have anyone. And they say you need one. I mean what are you supposed to do?

I can't afford anymore counseling sessions this year because my daughter broke her leg and the FSA money is all going to that. Can't go anywhere because COVID is raging, and even if I could I don't have anyone to watch my kids. Support system? Yeah, doc you tell me how I'm supposed to find one."

I didnt live on this planet for so long (14 years) i lost any hope, people just keep telling me to stop because im annoyng, my parents are gonna yell at me if they dont see me happy, they say im being too dramatic and  its my fault and that i should at least pretend to be happy, my friends ignore my existence and try to avoid me at all costs, still, idk what i did wrong, i never talked about my problems in my life, simply because no one cares. They always tell me they have it worse. They are passing time with they're loved ones, while im alone in my room wondering If i should jump off my window or not.  they're never alone, they slam they're goals, success, and relationships in my face because they know im dead jealous, i never had a friend, or been in a relationship, no one never asked me what was wrong without violently judging me. i even planned a mass murder once.
Sometimes i feel the urge to kill someone. Please, help"
914,Death Anxiety,"Good Evening... I have a sister who is a teenager and has death anxiety since July this year, because somebody very close has died...

915,How much longer do I really have left to live?,"When will I just end it all. 
When will I cross the street without looking both ways.

My life has always been a fucking mess and I dont know what to do. Shit just keeps happening. Ive never gotten a break from stress and pain.

Im so so stuck.

I struggle to sleep at night alone with my thoughts. When I finally fall asleep I sleep wayy too late and do nothing all day.
I struggle to even brush my hair or teeth. I have to forcr myself to walk my dogs because i dont want to burden them.

What can I do really? Im so stuck and so depressed. I lost my job, one of my pets, and just lost my mom a week ago.

Im hurting so much I just want it to end. I hate venting on fb because everyone says they care but they dont. I just get ignored.
I made a vent where i said I wanted to end my life and no one cared.

Im so so fucking exhausted."
916,Im either on to something or going insane,"Hi reddit, I'm not normally a reddit user but i don't know where to turn. 4chan will tell me to kms or something and people irl will view me as crazy. So I'm turning to you guys. Sorry in advance for bad formatting; this is really hard to explain. 

I'm either onto something or I'm going insane. 

Right from the get-go I'm going to tell you this: I have a history of drug abuse, SH and diagnosed anorexia. I've quit all of that. And CSA as well as witnessing a murder at a young age. 

Anyways, 
I'm convinced that the world is an experiment and that we are all mice in that experiment. It is run by some group of people. My reasoning is as follows:
1. People that get close to this truth are put in psychwards and/or given the same diagnoses as insane people. I believe that this is to decrease their credibility. 
2. I've been feeling off for about a year. A friend said that it is dissociation, as she struggles with that, and her and my discription of it were literally the same. I've had there feeling since I was a young child. I used to call it going on autopilot (it would last for weeks back then, not a year like currently), this convinced me that I'm living in a simulation. I remember going to my brother when i was 7 and asking him ""how do i know that you're real? That you're not just a robot, a simulated person or a figment of my imagination?"". It just feels like I'm watching a movie. I'm not fully in control. 
3. I have a feeling that everyone is in on it. Everyone knows something that I don't. This, however isn't likely, you're all just oblivious. 
4. All the propaganda. How would we know what's in space? I don't believe in other planets. It's just propaganda by the people who run the experiment to make us believe that we're one in a [insert big number] so we don't question our own reality. 
5. Existential crisis vs mental breakdown. I believe these terms are separated because an existential crisis is not dangerous. A mental breakdown means that you're close to the truth. 
6. I've been seeing ""skuggfolket"". This is a swedish term used mostly by junkies to describe the shadowy figures in you periferal vision. I'm clean now, so why do i see them everywhere. I enterpret this as a sign that I'm close to death. 
I believe that I'm going to die. I believe my death is going to occur in my sleep, in the shower or outdoors. This is as to not raise suspicion among the other participants in this experiment. I'm too scared to shower, go outside and i struggle to fall asleep. I see the shadow people. I can still do those things. But it's scary af so I avoid it as far as I can. 
7. All the shit I've been through and survived, I shouldn't have survived, I should be dead. This supports the whole ""propaganda"" theory, since ACCORDING TO THE PROPAGANDA, I should've died like 3 times, but I haven't. So it's not true. I cannot die. Not until the scientists ""delete"" me. 

What can I do? I've tried to seek help buy they said it's going to take up to 6 months. I believe I'm going to be dead by then. They said that as long as I don't have a detailed plan on how to kill myself and try to execute it, they can't get me help any sooner. 
Last time I had one of these periods was when i was still in active drug abuse. I thought my thoughts were being monitored. I stopped myself whenever I had a thought. I don't remember ever trying to kill myself. But I had panic attacks daily. This has started to happen again. (The panic attacks, not the thoughts being monitored.)
I might be deleted for even publishing this. 
Either I'm onto something. Or I'm insane. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Please.

917,"You don’t have to watch if you don’t want to, but i’ve been hitting a wave of depression recently and decided to make a video just venting my thoughts (and announce my break from making videos) if anyone wants to hear please check out my video and have a good day:)",https://youtu.be/fBGZxsn44Oo
918,Struggling,"I have been struggling with depression since December 2018, my room shows this. My mother in an attack at me has decided to climb through my room and rip out every dish in an attempt to shame me. I cant even speak without her telling me that im rude, disrespectful and disgusting.  She herself goes to a therapist and has been diagnosed. I dont know why she does these things, im just trying to get through my day without having a mental crash. It's getting harder, I dont know how long I can go through with this."
919,Recent events in life messing with my ptsd and borderline personality issues,I’m a male who has been molested and raped many times in my life starting when I was 3. Every time it was a female aggressor and I’m now married but recent arguments with my wife are giving me flashbacks to being groomed for abuse. and it’s hard to figure out if I’m misconstruing what she’s saying in the arguments or if I should really stand my ground. My self esteem has always been an issue for me and I only recently within the last few years really began to respect my own free will and opinions. But I can feel myself slipping backwards any advice for getting myself calmed down and back in a good place? Panic attack advice/ anxiety advice for coping?
920,How to ask for professional help,I am positive i need help. Im barely keeping it together. I need someone to help me and each time i tell my mom about that she says i can 'rant to her'. I cant. She is the cause of many of my problems and i cant tell her that without her hitting me and telling me im making it up. I have no other family member that can take me to a therapist
921,Social worker boundaries,"I wanted to know how much information you think a social worker should be able to ask or record in medical files?

I have a social worker as part of my mental health care, but I have found out she was in contact with my mother, I live on my own. Has documented accounts of my life history from my Mother's perspective, and I believe this has effected my treatment.

Sometimes she asks me how much money I get for certain things, and I have read specific amounts of money, for example how much a bill was, or how much OSAP I got (money loan for school) and I've seen these dollar amounts in my med history.

I also feel like she asks too much about my personal life, or maybe I just share too much, she comes to my home and is around a similar age to me, I forget that I'm talking to someone who is documenting what I'm saying, reading into everything, anyone who knows a psychologist knows saying you want to push someone off a cliff to a friend is very different if you say it to a psychologist. My psychologist reads her notes, as well as any other member of staff they decide to randomly throw into the mix.

I feel like there are things I say, that are obvious to me that they are private, and should not be in my medical file.

Even if I were to miss speak or ask for something not to be documented I feel like that should be respected.

I'm considering ending her role as my social worker."
922,Trouble with Wellbutrin,I’ve been on Wellbutrin for over a year now and I just recently ran out for a week and started back yesterday. I’ve always had trouble eating on Wellbutrin but I got sick and threw it up yesterday. I feel hungry but I feel like I can’t stomach anything. After I do eat I feel like I’m starving to death again after as little as 2 hours. Anybody have any experience?
923,Advice for debilitating depressive episodes?,"I don't actually consider myself depressed in general, I'm not on any medication and I've never been diagnosed, but I frequently have depressive 'episodes' that leave me mentally and physically debilitated.

It'll usually start with a negative train of thought that could be triggered by something in my environment, or just conjured up, and my brain will blow it out of proportion due to the intense emotion of the moment. 
It's only after I've gained perspective in (generally) a few hours time when I realise its insignificance. 

The main problem is that it obliterates my ability to think. As soon as I've succumbed to the depression, the lights turn off in my head and it shuts down. I can't concentrate, my memory is hugely inhibited and I walk around in a drunken stupor. I forcibly stop myself talking to people because I'm familiar with the embarrassment of no longer being able to form coherent sentences, or just being unable to think of a response at all. 

I'm now experiencing them with such frequency that it's heavily impacting my life. I never know when one is coming because the triggers are arbitrary. I don't know if this is a common experience at all, and I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't because I tend to experience a range of bizarre psychological flaws, but it'd be nice if someone could relate in the slightest or knows how to help!

Thanks in advance."
924,Question for those that journal for self improvement and mental health related reasons,"Hi, for those of you that journal to improve yourself or improve your mental health by writing and such, do you find it more helpful to write 'I' statements or 'You' statements? For example, if someone wanted to work on improving their self-esteem, would it be better to write something like 'I am worthy of success' or 'You are worthy of success'? Or for another example, 'I am a confident person' vs 'You are a confident person'? I heard somewhere writing ‘You’ statements were more beneficial because of it sounding like someone’s telling you that thing. 

Also, I highly recommend doing this for those of you who aren’t already. Writing in this way has helped me a lot. Especially in the current situation. Not necessarily just for self-esteem, but also turning a negative into a positive. 

Appreciate the responses!"
925,Help me figure out what exactly happened to me yesterday?,"I had what I think was a panic attack out of nowhere, I was just turning my computer off about to get up and I suddenly felt this overwhelming sensation that I cant really describe. It was like my senses hightened, my mind went blank and I felt my chest tingling and the sensation went from not there at all to way too much to handle in a split second. I felt like I needed to get out of my room so I ran into the living room and I was breathing as deep as I could still in an absolute panic. I sat on the couch but I couldnt stop freaking out rubbing my hands on my legs and the couch trying to calm myself down and my only instinct was to call anyone who would answer(I was alone at home). My mind was still blank and my body was acting on impulses, after my aunt picked up the phone I tried to get the words out I honestly dont even remember how the conversation went but she said shed come home asap and while I waited I got in the shower to distract myself and see if it would help calm me down. At this point Im still hyperventilating ,shaking hard and feeling afraid for no reason, the shaking stopped once the water got hot and then I just broke down crying. After I got out of the shower I managed to compose myself but I still felt horrible and started to feel nauseous and physically sick. Though I didnt have covid specific symptoms I got tested just to be sure. We had to drive to a doctors house about an hour away and the entire time I was still anxious and feeling like shit, I spent the rest of the day feeling strange and this morning I got the results, its not covid. Has anyone had a similar experience and what could have caused this? Is it a symptom of depression or anxiety? or a mix of that and stress all building up together? Im glad I dont have covid but now Im left wondering what that was and why it happened or worse, will it happen again?"
926,When do you know you have truly recovered from an eating disorder?,"For some backstory, I had an eating disorder 4 years ago. I was already slim but I starved myself daily for months until I lost around 30lbs. I ate solid food for the most part once a day, usually a single bowl of porridge. I got cheated on and felt ugly and did this to feel prettier. I never got help for this, I started losing hair and my eye bags got worse and my skin looked tired and would be flaky and just bad and I felt so ugly it made me stop. Just like that. I was tired and weak and hated the feeling of being so fragile and overworked just living day to day so I gave it up. 
I started eating a lot after that and gained weight within a year or so to became the most heavy I’ve ever been. Since then I have lost weight again.

I talk about eating disorder in the past tense, but today I just heard what body checking is... and I do it daily. Almost daily I set my phone up and video myself. I do a twirl for myself to see how my body looks. If I look skinny and my body looks tight I’ll be in a good mood for that whole day. If my body looks unflattering, bloated or just wobbly and out of shape I will be absolutely miserable instantly and at times take it out on other people. 

I had absolutely no idea this was something considered eating disorder related. I’m not starving myself now, I don’t feel guilty if I eat solid food on more than one occasion in a day and make myself throw up like I used to. But I do control my food and what I eat a lot and I do force myself to exercise regularly purely for keeping my body in shape.
Since I’m past the starving phase I assumed I was past my eating disorder too. After learning this I am not so sure.

How do you know that you have recovered? At what point can you be confident it’s a past disorder and not a current one? Do you ever truly fully get over it? 
It feels like I’ve just found out I’ve made way less progress than I thought and that in reality I still have a problem."
927,On the spectrum for a personality disorder and no friends,"I have struggled hard to fit in the US. I recently got naturalized but I don’t really feel accepted in any community. I am in an interracial relationship and the other side is very unwilling to accept me, given that I look nothing like my SO on top of that I don’t speak the language. I am very willing to learn but it’s gonna be at least 2-5 years before I am fluent enough to really make conversation in that other language. As for people from my previous country I feel are a bunch of racist assholes stuck in their ways and I would rather have nothing to do with them. So basically I have no prions and given we are in the COVID years idk how to deal with my need to connect to some sort of community. Any thoughts? Advice?"
928,Manifesting Toxicity ✨🤮,"I used to struggle with crippling social anxiety, now, not so much thanks to Ketamine. 

I have not maintained one friendship for any considerable amount of time for my whole life except my relationship with my girlfriend which is completely unstable because of decisions stemming from my sex and steroid addiction that I deeply regret.

In the last year especially, due to Instagram fame many people became close to me for clout only to leave when I got off social media and/or reveal their intentions with me were purely sexual, leaving me constantly feeling used and hopeless. I am at a point right now where I might be able to make a new friend. We keep hanging out and having a lovely time together, but my mind keeps finding ways to invalidate them, their intentions with me, and when I get really high I feel like I am just incompatible with other human beings and should give up on relating to other people in any meaningful way as it has always proven to be a failure.

Can someone offer some perspective or advice that isn’t the general, obvious, “keep an open mind,” ?

💖🐶 thanks"
929,Mentality after smoking weed,"I’m 16 and have had zero mental health problems before smoking. The weed was not laced. I don’t smoke at all. It’s been a month and nothing’s changed. Here’s what’s happening: 

This started with a really bad panic attack out of no where. I’ve had like 3 or 4 anxiety attacks in the past month, and can’t control my emotions.

I’m overthinking constantly and feel trapped inside of my head. My thoughts are loud and clear and I can’t control them.

I have to think about basic function such as walking, moving or talking. I can convince myself that I can’t move or talk sometimes 

Feel like instead of me touching something, it’s touching me. It almost feels delayed and tingly or as if my body is melting into whatever I’m touching. I also feel like I’m touching something way before I touch it and it confuses me.

I can’t sleep I have to move to make sure it’s not happening and sometimes when I lay down or sit down for too long I feel like my body is just mush

Sometimes I feel lost and confused and like nothing is real at times

I can’t stop thinking about the panic attack I had and how it started all of this.

I can get back into touch with reality and know that everything is happening because I am thinking about it, but then it goes back to how it was seconds later
 
I feel good in the morning and like nothing is wrong but then 5-10 minutes after it starts happening again 

I feel like I can’t concentrate and I can’t focus on anything and if I can it’s very hard to.

Feel physically numb, like if I’m eating I can’t feel the food on my lips, can’t feel my legs, arms, or head.

I’m 16, keep in mind. This was the first time I smoked and I was just trying it out. My parents will literally disown me if I told them what happened, but I’m starting to think if it’s for the better of me. I mean I’ve lied for a full month now about it and how it started. Is there any way I can get some medical help/advice without my parents knowing what I did?"
930,Feeling addicted to sadness ?,"Does anyone know the best way to stop feeling that sadness is my only lasting personality trait?

It’s worse than normal recently but I can’t stop binging on my sadness - I’ve been attracted to watching content that makes my chest ache - old Mac Miller interviews, Anthony bourdains last episodes and listening to people discuss their trauma while mine just sits inside me.  
I know I’m not watching these things the right way I can kinda feel the walls closing in on me a bit and life is losing it’s purpose. But I can’t seem to stop watching - it’s the only thing making me feel like I’m not crazy for hurting"
931,Interprent this how you want: What advice would you give Casey?," Today is my eighteenth birthday. I am spending it alone, I got up today at 6:45 as I usually do and I got back into bed. I slept until 10:23 AM and I got up to get breakfast. I ate some fruit loops like usual, the same flavor I have tasted for the past 10 months. I used some 2% milk. I can’t stand the taste of 1%. It is like water with a little bit of milk. After I went back into my room for a few hours and logged into my computer and logged onto reddit, I was under the gaming subreddit and I talked about a new game coming out with a few online fre- well I wouldn't call them friends. I would just call them people online who come home from parties, work and everything a normal person does, like my mother does and like my father does. Ignore the signs someone is suffering and ignore when people are clearly in a state of depression and anxiety, but no they live normal lives and they are the ones who get lucky in life. They are the ones blessed with no problems in life, they have amazing paying jobs beyond anything I could handle, they all work in these businesses or they travel and get paid for it. They run incredible bakeries and restaurants but no me I am just a dropout who knows how to code and hack and do nothing useful to the big world. My mother or father hasn’t even sent me a message today, the only person who sent me something was my brother Parker, we share the same birthday because we’re twins but ever since my father and mother cut us off. We haven’t spoken to them; they only text me when they need to and that’s to make sure I got the money to pay my bills and to make sure I just- nevermind.  No one is even reading this so I am not sure why am talking to a stupid notebook, anyway the past few hours I have just been on the computer shopping for something to get myself for my birthday. I am deciding between a nice rope for knitting or buying a knife for cutting meat because my knives are getting a bit dull. I suppose I shall go eat a salad.  I am back. It has been about 2 hours and I began to feel very anxious when I saw food, I shouldn’t eat it. I'll become more ugly and I don’t deserve to feed my body. It's not like I even wanna wake up in the morning. Hell my parents told me I am not their son because I dropped out of college, But I told them why the pressure of college was weighing down on me. I was staying up all night, just sinking into dark thoughts and holding my head to stay awake just for my tears to fall on the computer. But yet my mother decided to tell me I was just being dramatic, that I am just a lowlife lazy generation Z kid. But if I could show her- agh nevermind it is 4 pm I should sleep now. I like to sleep a lot if you couldn’t tell I am only awake for 9 hours of the day because every day it just gets worse, “it gets better”  they say just to use me for medication that is why I don’t want to use it. “they don’t care, they don’t care. They don’t, don’t you get it!? Stop going to the doctor. but you want the pain to stop. but don’t you realize it won’t stop, it never will Casey! You have one choice and one choice only and you know what that choice is, but whenever you realize it it’ll be too late. What is even keeping you here casey? You live the same life every day for the last 10 months, your parents don’t talk to you. People don’t want something broken, nobody would. You’re gonna have to leave one day, leave your empty apartment, leave the same cereal you eat at exactly 6:50 am. What more do you have to lose!?, CASEY !!! CASEY !!! CASEY!!! YOU COWARD!!! What more do I have to tell you, what more do I have to prove to you casey? This is all you have and all that you will ever have. Casey I am doing this for your own well being, do you want to feel this anymore? No. No You don’t. Nobody cares about you and your problems, why do you think the doctors just give you more medication. But you don’t want to realize it, you do not want to accept it you idiot. How about you take that knife or take that rope and bleed yourself dry, but wait you have nobody to do that except for yourself. So do yourself a favor and give up.” That is what I told myself that is what went through my head when I saw the food. The simple things in life send me over the edge, it’s like a desert you climbing over a sand dune and you see the light getting bigger and all of a sudden another sand dune, then another and then another. You almost get over the hurdle and see the light that will take you out of your depression and troubles but then you fall into it again, and again, and again and again. I know it will never end, I have no friends, no family, I have nothing anymore so someone tell me the point of this. Somebody or something tells me the point in which things have a purpose, when I have a purpose. I knew today would be the end. I did not want to break my routine. I am afraid of change even if it is the last day. I feel some peace today knowing this will all be over soon. All I have to do tomorrow is wake up, eat breakfast, clean up around the house. Then I can finally leave. Goodbye now stranger."
932,Whenever things get a little better it all falls through the cracks and I find myself not wanting to live,"I feel like I’ve struggled with the same problems all of my life. Depression, eating disorders, anxiety, panic attacks, social isolation etc. They just cycle through to different degrees. Sometimes something new will pop up. More recently, I’ve been able to make little bouts of progress, but i always just end up at some new kind of low. It’s not even always as bad as previous ones, but that doesn’t seem to matter. Slowly, I’m getting more comfortable with the idea of suicide. I’ve always had suicidal ideation, but it’s been a thing that I didn’t think I’d *actually* do. I was too scared of death. Now, im more scared of how little the suicidal thoughts scare me. It’s like I’m Sisyphus with my mental health. If he had the option to end the cycle, I wonder if he would. Each time I push the Boulder up the hill, it doesn’t really feel worth it. I’m know I’m just not committing to the changes I should be, but it seems more like a curse I can’t escape. I’m sure I’m probably just making myself into a victim of life. It’s a little sickening to me how much self-pity I sound like I have as I type this, but I don’t really know how to not feel this way. Is there an exit door I’m not seeing that isn’t just ending it all?"

934,Please give me advice on how to get better.,"First a little bit about myself. I am a 15 year old male and have been diagnosed with ADD and suspected to have bipolar disorder but they never diagnosed me with that one. 

I have always been the kind of person to not tell anyone that something is wrong with me, it's not always because I don't trust them, but like with my family it's more that I don't want to be a waste of time and money. This has caused me to pretty much bottle up all my emotions. I have difficult time crying and when I do cry it's barely a sigle tear. I have hard time expressing my emotions in general. 

I don't think I'm necessarily suicidal but when I go to school on the bus for example, I fairly often think of stuff like the bus crashing and me being the only one who doesn't make it.

I have hard time opening up or trusting my friends, which I believe is because I didn't really have many friends growing up. I don't really trust anyone in general. My friends live in a different town than I do and we don't have any kind of conversations in our free time.

I don't really have any friends in my hometown so I always just am in my room doing nothing meaningful. That gets boring real fast and has been going on for almost 5 years. I don't really have any kind distractions besides watching You Tube or something. 

Any kind advice is appreciated, thank you in advance."
935,I just can't do It anymore...,"I've been stressing a lot thanks to high school, but, god damnit, i just can't anymore, every time i get there i only get critisized and everybody annoys me, all day long, it's half of the class, even on tests, i can't concentrate or anything, no Friends, alone... But then, i hopped on to play some games with friends on my PS4, but, im the worst of the group so as a joke they started killing me, again, and again for an hour, no stop telling me things like ""do you cry yourself to sleep? Don't lie, we know you do"" or ""WoW, your fucking horrible arent you?"" After an hour of that, when i just wanted to have fun, i can't anymore, it's been going for around 3 months, i try to be strong and i have to, everybody thinks im strong, but i, i just can't do anything, is It worth It being strong if you can't even show yourself?

937,How can I help someone who doesn’t want to open up?,"I have a friend who basically (sorry for summarising mental illness briefly) puts on a happy face every time she talks to someone.

I’ve brought up in the past that I think she might be hiding something, and after a month of saying that she didn’t want to talk about it, or denying it, she finally opened up a tiny bit. I believe I hit a nerve, causing her to open up.

It’s been around 3 months and I hit another nerve. She said how she has a “child” which she has to protect (using the term child as a personification of her mental illness side). She admitted to thinking she had mental health problems today too. 

She keeps saying that she won’t say anything about it, but I’m starting to actually figure out her problems. 

Is there anything I can do to make her feel more comfortable about opening up? I’ve tried opening up about myself and creating a safe space for her to talk/vent, but she doesn’t seem to budge unless I hit a nerve.

Should I stop? I don’t want to give up on her, but I don’t know if I’m actually doing the right thing. What should I do?"
938,Self worth trouble,"I'm having a tough time with it all at the moment. I just can't seem to catch a break with anything, and I can feel it pulling me under. It doesn't help that I'm really self-sabotaging and can't help but compare myself to other friends and family. Everyone seems to have something that they are really good at, whereas everything seems such a struggle for me.

I feel like I'm more of a burden than anything at the moment, and I just can't seem to get out of the headspace :/"
939,talking to someone who’s in a psych ward,"My bf (17) was admitted yesterday night and put on a 72 hour hold. He’s going to be able to call me in a few hours, so my question is what are things i should avoid asking? I’m not sure how much time i’ll have to talk, but what can i do so his experience is better? is there something i shouldn’t be asking? ( i know i shouldnt ask “how is it” and really heavy things ) 
if anyone can also talk to me about the process and what i can do to support him afterwards that would be really great, anything is super helpful"
940,Domestic abuse survivor struggling in new relationship,"I (F28) was in an extremely abusive relationship for over two years. I escaped this situation about two years ago now, and although it left me with a lot of issues I have come a long way in the time since. 

That being said, I'm in the beginning stages of a new relationship (my first since my ex) and have noticed myself doing something I never did before my abusive relationship. Basically I find myself needing almost constant validation from my new bf (M30). Like if anything feels even slightly off about our interaction, or if he takes even a bit longer than usual to respond to a message I send, I find myself thinking stuff like ""He doesn't want you anymore"" and ""You should just stop talking to him now and save yourself the heartache"".

To be clear, I'm not hounding him with this stuff. I realize this is my own issue and I wouldn't hound him for attention to make myself feel better. But I'm driving myself crazy, I'm sitting here alone wanting to cry because this voice in my head keeps telling me that I'm going to get hurt even though realistically I know I have no reason to feel this way. 

Why am I this way? Is there a name for it? How do I deal with this?"
941,I wish I wasn’t useless,I wish I wasn’t sad. I wish my brain wasn’t broken. I wish I had more money so I could go do the stuff all my friends do. I wish I was a better girlfriend. I wish I was skinnier. I wish I was prettier. I wish I was perfect and quiet and beautiful like my sister. I wish I could control any boy with my good looks like my best friend. But I’m broke. I can’t get a job. I’m ugly. Boys don’t like me the way they do other girls. I’m angry. I’m bitter. I’m cold. I’m so much less alive then everyone around me.
942,My friend(13) is being stalked by our classmate who I'm highly sure has some type of mental illness. I don't know what to do.,"Ok, so, I have this kid in my class. His name is Jayden. He's been stalking my friend for all of this term, maybe even before that. 

He's been following her around, asking about her and where she was, and making unwanted interactions and conversations. 
Me and my friends Lara, Vanessa and Niobe (the one being harrassed) all hang out in the same area as him, because we are friends with other people who are there as well. We don't really know why Jayden still hangs around there, everyone thinks he is weird and most hate him.

Niobe started getting super weird vibes off of Jayden and started to get creeped out, whenever he tried to talk to her she told him to fuck off, which only fueled him. He started chasing her around, asking why she was upset with him, and chased me to interrogate about her as well. He was asking where Lara was as well. It got to the point where he wouldn't leave her alone. There was even a time where Me and Vanessa told him to fuck off because he kept sitting next to her in the hall last period when we where wrapping up sport, when we where dismissed he started speeding towards her. She started running away and he sprinted after her out of the hall.
We had had enough
Niobe was scared af to even be in the same room as him, which is hard since we are all in the same class. He came back to the spot that day  I don't really know how it started, but there was a fight. That day, Lara brung in push pops, so I was eating mine when it begun  so I only watched at the beginning. Lara and Vanessa where pegging un ripe fruit at Jayden. Jayden was throwing back, but his aim was so bad. I kept watching until he pegged a fruit at Niobe, which made a really painful red mark. I picked up a branch and started racing after him. He ran to his ""friends"", who didn't see the whole thing and thought we where bullying. He picked up a stick and started fighting us.  
He tore a stick out of Laras hand which slit her wrist. We beat Jayden to the ground and kicked him. I dropped my phone and his friend stole it and Lara had to get it back for me. Jayden hit Lara and Vanessa really hard and I chased him with a stick until he left.

He even said it's no use fighting for the sake of their ""future relationship"". Which is super creepy considering they aren't even friends and she wants nothing to do with him.

Theres a policy at our school which is if anyone gets physical, there is an immediate suspension. So at this point, we where just waiting to be called up to the office whenever they dob. Jaydens friend came up to us and said we had one more chance. 
The rest of the day, Jayden hadn't learn jack shiz. He kept coming up to niobe and talking to her. 

I'm pretty sure they dobbed us in on Friday to our year master.
We have a video of a confrontation with Jayden, if anyone wants any evidance.

Help?

he's done this before. Last year he stalked an girl called Ella home and looked through her window. She filed a restraining order but idk if it was successful. 
And one of my friends who was friendlyish with him had a crush on a girl (shes a lesbian), and he somehow found out. He was, for some reason, fascinated with her liking a girl. He said he would follow the girl, Sammi's, car home.
A quote from him: ""Gay and Lesbians are gods. Straight people are dirt""
Sammie doesn't know about Kayden stalking her, I don't think. I'm trying to get a hold of her online to tell her but she never responds."
943,Looking for advice on how to not desperately seek a different identity in different hair colors.,"I Originally posted this in hair related subreddits but was told to come here. I have since deleted the posts but here we go! I have a serious problem with dyeing my hair. I go through a vicious pattern of wanting to grow out my hair, but l get distracted by impulsive urges to dye it. I'll start with let's say Jet Black or Blue Black hair. I will like it because l feel like l feel most ""myself"" with a goth aesthetic. But then a few weeks go by and l feel like l am being judged by my appearance, so l will want to switch to something more ""feminine"" so l go red. The red feels fancy at first but then l feel like the color isn't ""exactly what l'm going for"" so l mess it up trying to get it correct, on top of the damage of removing the black. So the next phase is trying to ""embrace my natural and be kind to myself"" but that never works. Does anyone else go through these cycles? How do you handle yourself when you get like this?"
944,I don't wanna live anymore,"There is nothing for me here anymore. I've been feeling awful for years and December is the worst month. I just can't take it anymore, I hate my stupid life."
945,How do i ask for help,"Lately, I've been totally unable to do any work. Whenever I try, I either can't concentrate or feel way too tired to do anything. I've got big exams looming ahead that I'm not prepared for at all, but every time I look at the work I have to do I either panic or start crying. I've stopped talking to my friends as much and I feel like an asshole for it. I've lost interest in most of my hobbies, and I spend most of my just scrolling on my phone or sitting there doing nothing.

It's all overwhelming me and I know that I need to talk to somebody, but I just can't do it. I'm terrified of telling my parents because I've got a lot of shit going on that I really don't want them to find out about. The one time I talked to my school counsellor, she pretty much just told me that I would be fine because I got decent grades. I've been telling myself that it'll all be fine once this year is over, but I don't think I can deal with it alone. I have no fucking idea what to do anymore."
946,My little sister is in the middle of a panic attack and I don't know what to do.,"About an hour ago my mom barged into my room saying that my little sister (14) had disappeared. Turns out she had hidden inside her closet crying and hyperventilating. My mom was visibly mad and I noticed that her presence was making my sister feel worse so i told her to leave. I just stayed with my sister just comforting her for about 20 minutes until she told me what put her in this state. Apparently our mom told her that if she wanted to kill herself to just go ahead. A little after that my mom came back to the room and demanded she come out of the closet while saying that she could snap out of the panic attack whenever she wanted because as my mom said she ""also had panic attacks when she was younger and would just snap (herself) out of them so my sister can do the same thing"". I called my dad for help and he managed to get our mom out of the room. I am now siting besides her, comforting her the best I can wondering what should I do next to help her. Should I bring her to the hospital? A friend's place? I don't want to leave her near my mom and I'm now scared she might actually try to hurt herself. Any suggestions on what to do?"
947,Urge to be unproductive,"Can anyone please explain to me or point me to an article that explains why I’m self handicapping? Right now, I have a list of things to do outside (simple stuff like drop off a package at the post office) and I am completely free (time wise), fully dressed, my health is physically fine, and I’m completely ready to leave the house. There’s no reason for me to not leave the house and yet I have the strongest urge to remain seated. There’s nothing else I want or need to do. 

This has been happening to me recently (since I started working from home in March due to COVID) for anything I try to do, whether it’s serious (like not being productive at work even though I’m getting warnings about losing my job) or mundane (like shaving or showering). 

I know it’s not about laziness because I’m willing to work very hard on projects on my car, chores around the house, or help someone move. But when it comes down to doing something serious and finishing everything on my to do list, I hesitate big time. It’s like I’m averse to being successful. 

When I do force myself to work or do serious stuff, it requires an exhausting and large amount of willpower. 

What is the reason this is happening to me? The fact that I can lose my job and that I’m the sole provider for my family with very little savings, means that I can’t afford to be like this. Can anyone tell me what’s wrong with me? Why is my mind avoiding being productive or accomplished?"
948,I genuinely don't want to keep living,"I'm failing all of my exams, everything stresses me out, my family hates me, I've lost every single one of my friends because of my own stupid actions, and I feel like I'm getting closer to ending it every day. I can't think of a single negative outcome if I did kill myself, not a single person who'll miss me when I'm gone. I've got no reason to keep living and every reason to die. Sorry for venting, just didn't know where else to put this."
949,Fuck this useless life where nothing good ever happens.,Too bad I didn't get wrapped around a tree while driving recklessly today.

950,"Someone talk to me or else I’m gonna self harm. Tell me I need ThERaPy or ban me for this post, and I just might put myself in a hospital.","Posts where ppl actually want to seek help get little recognition, and it causes ppl like me to not even consider this page as a source of comfort or help. It angers me that you all consider to ignore ppl who need even just the slightest dm that get overlooked just because of post congestion. What is this? A group where ppl only want to hear common trends beyond the mental health community? Or a place where anyone can receive comfort for even the slightest bit of pain? If it’s the first option, please recommended me to a group where anyone can receive support for their struggles

Yes I’m angry, and what I may be saying now will blow over, but I’m in a situation where I cannot receive help and in dire need of venting without it being overlooked. It’s been over a half a year, And I still can’t decide on what I want to do with my life right now. Should I kill myself? Self harm to cope with the problems I have? Or runaway to the world?

951,I wish I always knew how to comfort people in pain 😔,"I'm not a therapist or a miracle-worker. I'm just an average guy who doesn't want anyone to be left alone in the dark. It's truly a horrendous, sinking feeling—being trapped in that place and not being able to see a way out. I wouldn't wish it upon anybody.

It is sometimes tough trying to be supportive. I can't reach out to everyone here, nor do I always have the answers and the right words of comfort. Even when I do think I have it, it's always a gamble that I can say what people truly need at that moment. There's never a guarantee of hitting the mark.

Despite all this, I still believe that if I can help just one person—just one—that's one less trapped in the dark place. One more who has a chance to go on to pursue a brighter future. Maybe there's a certain comfort in knowing that.

In the end, I hope that everyone can keep looking out for each other through this last month of this difficult year. Continuing to send best wishes and virtual hugs!"
952,Am I suffering from something? Or just being overdramatic?,"Do you think being a moody person in general is a mental health issue? Or should I embrace it and just accept myself?

I went to a therapist, but that was about something else. But when im around people this tought intensifies, i sometimes look around just to find stuff that would be able to kill people and imagine how i would do it?

954,Am I depressed?,"I'm not sure if I'm actually depressed or it's just some kind of phase that I'm going through.  


  
This year has been hard. I had some ups &amp; downs. But mostly downs. Two-person that I knew personally from childhood, died. My kittens died. (I slowly got over those incidents). Someone I secretly love who used to be a close friend of mine is not interested in me at all anymore. I'm somewhat an introvert. So, I don't have many friends. I consider 1 or 2 people like my close ones. I had contact with them over texts, as a result, I didn't have to feel much lonely. But I lost contact with them for months now. I thought maybe they're going some hard shit or just busy. So, I tried texting asking what's going on. But I didn't get a reply 2 to 3 times consecutively. As a result, I thought if someone doesn't want to talk then why should I bother and be the annoying one.  
The best thing this whole year was a get-together with some friends including the girl whom I like. We had fun and I was happy for a while. I thought maybe everything will return to normal now. Our friendship will be alive again. But then when I texted her, I didn't get any reply. So, it's clear that she's not at all interested to talk.   
As of now, I don't text anybody anymore. I don't wanna be clingy.

  
In reality, I'm feeling down, empty and lonely, and somewhat hopeless. I have no idea if I'm feeling sad; if I want to cry. It's just emptiness and numbness. Most of the day I feel no energy. I don't do the things I like (Gaming, art, etc.) My procrastination increased by a lot. I spend almost all day on youtube. Smoking habit returned after 5-6 months of managing not to smoke. Then I managed to not smoke for 2 weeks only to relapse again. Now, I don't even have the motivation to quit. (I don't smoke a lot now, like 1 in one or two days). I stay up the whole night. Sleep a lot. Having nightmares from time to time. When I wake up I check my phone in the mere hope that someone texted me. A new day isn't exciting to me anymore. It's something like ah, another (boring) day. I have no suicidal thoughts currently like I'm not even interested in doing a thing. I'm not having much trouble eating.   
Recently I joined online chat groups to distract myself from loneliness. And I saw myself overreacting and being sensitive to people being mean to me. I turned angry and toxic easily. Which is very unlikely of me. I generally tend to stay peaceful and kind to others. I usually avoid fights. Anyway, after a while of losing my shit, I feel sorry for my action.

  
Some people suggested to me that I make new friends online. Which I tried to do. But there's something about that, I can't manage to stay connected to them. I start to procrastinate to reply and lose interest eventually. IRL it takes time for me to make friends.   


  
One thing I guess I learned is people don't want to deal with a troubled soul. They like the better version of him. The confident, cheerful, and happy one. If you're troubled, you're most likely to be isolated, by yourself.  


TL;DR this year wasn't easy for me. I lost connection with friends. I feel lonely, empty, and numb and can't manage to keep my shit together. I don't know if I'm depressed."
955,Tired of thinking of suicide,Title says it all
956,Have I ruined my memory by training my brain to repress during an abusive relationship?,"To start off I want to mention a few things: I have no history of mental illness, I have never been in therapy, and I have never had depressive, anxietal, or suicidal thoughts or tendencies. Not sure if this is important as context. Anyway, to my question: I was in an abusive relationship for nearly 3 years a while back. During that time, I actively trained my brain to repress in order to cope. As a result I have very limited memory of those three years. Unfortunately it seems that I never unlearned that repression, and eversince then I have had horrible memory, or at least it feels that way. It seems that I can't retain information (or remember anything properly for that matter) anymore. Is that possible, and if so, how do I undo this?"
957,"I just turned 19(f) and I'm on the verge of suicide. I don't necessarily want to die, I just can't bear the pain.","Backstory shortly: I have had depression from about age 8. Family sucks/sucked etc, then divorce happened (which helped the situation a lot) and at age 14 I found myself first time on the adge of a cliff. It did get a bit better later, but upp until I was 17 I didn't think anyone could ever love me. Not a family member, lover, friend, no one. Just that I have a lot of trauma and such already built upp, so my mental state isn't this bad just from recent events.

2020 has beem rough, for me as well, but not because of covid. Of course it is incredibly unfortunate, it has put a strain on me as well, but living in a country that handled the situation well, much hasn't changed and my social life didn't disappear. Actually my self esteem has risen like a helium ball and it has stayed up. I do believe that many people love me and I finally think that I am pretty. 

I have been in love with this man for 1,5 years now and last may I got rejected by him. (He had a girlfriend) that really bummed me out, but it was tolerable and I was starting to get past that, I truly started to build the relationship as friends, wanted to meet his gf, etc and it was going well in august. Around these times I past out in my shower and my apertment flooded (I live alone) I had to move to my friends place for 2months, not having any personal space and having to work full time. During this me and mu chrush became very close and he admited having feelings for me, said that he could see us dating, but not yet, because his gf is his first priority, even tho he was breaking up with her. This messed me and my progress getting over him upp obviously. We agreed that we are friends now and we can meet as friends, but nothing more. We don't want to be part of cheating. BUT we saw each other almost daily and he was still open about his chrush on me. During the 2months I slept at least 5times at his house (on the floor, no cheating) and he supported me a lot trough the tough autumn. We hanged together all day long, or right after our workdays were over. We went to cafes, bars, walks, I helped him move and was the person seeing his apartment with him for the first time. I concidered this all to be social cheating and in my mind I gave him 4weeks time to move to his new apartment, settle down and figure his shit out. 
To cut things short we now don't see each other, he hurt me a lot by saying that being with me was a mistake, he didn't know if he would miss me in his life etc, even tho not even week before that, he wass all about being always there for me. 
Also: now I'm in over 15, 000€ dept because of the renevation in my apartment. 

So now I have no one to talk to, because he was the one I leaned on, I am in huge dept for a person my age (+student loans) my insurance wont help, and I can't get a loan. I also miss him alot. Now I'm on the verge of suicide again (I want to say AGAIN that there are many other reasons before these events, why my mental health is bad) I don't eat, and depression meds do not work. 

Oh god"
958,I'm scared.,"Trigger warning; discussion of serious mental health issues ensues.

Sorry, it's a long read, please hear me out.

28M for context. I really feel like I just need to get this off my chest. If I can say all this openly to another human being it wont feel so isolating. I KNOW it's a fucking long read but man, if someone can just hear me out here please. I dont know how to really talk to about this in a serious sense, I joke with my friends and coworkers about mental health. And I know some of them have issues too, but it's hard to talk about with them. I'm just scared for my mental health lately. I've come a REALLY long way from where I used to be, a very dark place, multiple times. And I can feel myself slipping.  

I've been mostly good for the past like 2 years. Trying to do better I stopped drinking every day and stopped smoking cigs, but still smoke too much weed and occasional vape pen. Was self medicating as an alcoholic for awhile but decided against it because it made it harder to keep in control of my mental state and actions. It's almost like there is an invisible barrier, a thin viel, separating me from what like a psychotic break, or just a breakdown. A mental state where you lose control of your actions and that scares the fuck out of me honestly, I barely survived that shit before. Used to SH and a bunch if bad shit like sui ideation, but not letting myself do anything now. But the thought I could slip back to that if I'm not careful REALLY scares me. Its fucking hard man.

 It's almost like a wave that goes between being okay and being depressed. But the troughs have been lower lately, i.e. the past few troughs have been bad and I feel like I'm headed for another trough now, but could just as well be fine in a few days. Its fucking confusing af. 

One big thing that I'm SUPER scared of is dating. So I've pretty much entirely avoided for the past few years. Multiple times, like 5/6 times, dating has triggered full on mental breakdowns that took weeks to months to recover from. I think I have some serious trust and value issues. My exex gf flipped out and physically attacked me, crushed my trachea with her thumbs. I pushed her off of me, that's the ONLY time I have responded physically to a woman and I still feel terrible about it.. I was in the wrong physically disciplining (not harmfully mind you just a bop on the nose) my roommates dog but I only did what my roommate had told me to do. So that was pretty FUCKED up, we broke up afterward it was the right thing to do. Didnt date after that. And my most recent ex gf's babies daddy had killed himself less than 1 year before we started dating. From what I understand he was grief stricken because she dumped him and was going to leave the state right before their daughter was born. Heavy stuff... Then on the 1 year anniversary of that, she understandably needed space and broke up with me. It is what it is, but it really made me feel absolutely fucking terrible, took me like 6 months to get back to baseline. 

NOW, I want so badly to date again and find someone, but I know it's a terrible fucking idea.  There's this girl at my work I've been friends with for over a year. And I REALLY care about her, she is super special to me, and absolutely a wonderful person. I keep thinking there is some kind of deeper connection there, the other day she called me sexy lol! And like, a week ago as I was leaving work she said I love you KAILASH, responded that I loved her too, which is true. But like, friends can love each other too. But the sexy makes me think... 

On the other hand, both of us should absolutely NOT be dating anyone right now. Her BF (my friend-coworker as well) just died from a heart attack like 6 months ago. Right about the same time that my precious dogo passed away. He had been with me since I was 13/14. Been really fucking depressed since then. And I know shes been going through a lot. That's why I just wanna hang out and talk things out with her. Maby we can help each other find solice by having someone to talk to. I'm just so fucking scared it will (or wont) turn into some thing more. And somehow that could trigger another mental breakdown. FUCK! 

Alright, I feel a little bit better getting that off my chest. I'm usually a really outwardly positive person, which makes it so hard to actually share my emotions. Damn, I didnt think my situation was that bad but after writing it all out it sounds pretty bad. And my dating luck has been fucking terrible. Honestly I'm just hanging in there, taking it 1 day at a time, and trying to be as true to myself as possible."

960,Not helpful psychiatrist and looking for help.,"My father has been seeing a psychiatrist that screams adderall is not an option for him because of his age. He had been prescribed 20 mg xr in past before moving to Florida by a trusted doctor who I do not think would have prescribed it if it was as bad of an issue as they make it seem for his heart health. He’s 58, about 175 lbs and may have pre-diabetes. He also has drunken soda and energy drinks, caffeine aspirin supplements daily for a long time and has been doing it more steadily with energy drinks since not being allowed to remain on the adderall so it’s kinda worrying off the already blatant disregard this psych has for him. She wants to try every med in the book and does not seem like there’s much rhyme or reason nor does she talk about any of his past experiences or issues, tho my dad can’t keep straight all the meds he’s tried in the past. 

He has taken wellebuttrin in the past and that made him feel evened out but still pretty dissapointed and lack of drive or happy feelings. When he had adderall for the short period, he says he felt actually good, and stable. He had cut out almost all caffeine and sugary drinks, seemed like he could handle his strong emotional outbursts a lot better, and even said thanks to me one day at work because he truly felt calmed and normal. I have very similar feelings to him on it much of the time and I was so happy he was experiencing what I have and did not seem to be affecting him at all negatively. I do not want to play doctor here and say these are valid observations, but I don’t trust this psych, seems super old-school and just there to get a paycheck.

I would like to know any possible moves to suggest for my dad, he’s looked into online adhd assessments from email ads, not sure if those  are legit would love to hear experiences on those. If anyone knows of some adhd friendly clinics In Florida or online to suggest that would be great! We do not want to do something that would harm my dads health and he totally understands that, but at this point, it just seems like even if the adderall was a little worse for his heart, it would be really a lot better for him to be on it and not consuming so much heart and vein-stressing material. He also has had a tough life and the adderall I think could make him come to terms with more stuff and not be super stressed. I hope this doesn’t come off bad, I just really could use some general advice on any of this, please feel free to comment on something you see that strongly hits you!

Thanks!!"
961,How to help friend with emotional numbness caused by manic episode,"Context: My friend is my very recent ex who suffers from a major bipolar disorder that results in severe mood swings based on stress with manic episodes when overwhelmed.

So my ex, now friend, was under an extreme amount of stress due to her college work and studies (her teachers aren't amazing and they love piling work onto their students), alongside a few mild communication issues in our relationship which were amplified due to her mood swings. (Which I assured her weren't taken personally since I completely understand what she's going through after having had a brother with the same disorder.) Due to this incredibly high level of stress, she went into a manic episode overnight, and I woke up to a flurry of messages with the end result being a breakup, due to the stress of the issues alongside the obligations she felt from a relationship. That part is something that can be managed, however, because of this manic episode, she lapsed into an emotionally numb state (which she has said is very likely the reason she decided to break up rather than finally properly communicate), this state has made her very harsh, distant, and emotionally unavailable, which really worries me. She is unable to seek treatment, since due to her school, she doesn't have time, or money, and the nearest psychiatrist to her is 3 hours away from her. So I was hoping that I could get some sort of advice or something to help her through this emotionally numb state, both for her health and the sake of our relationship, as with my own mental health issues, the split has been very painful and she thinks she may be unable to be with me due to her state if it persists beyond college. (Her college year ends in May.)"
962,Every night I hope I don’t wake up.,"Pretty dramatic, I know. 

Each night I go to sleep and there is a little part of me that hopes I just don’t wake up. 

I have disliked myself for so long. Since I was 15 (I’m 24). I can’t see it getting better. And I can’t see myself liking myself. I feel like I have nothing to contribute. No talent to show. I’m a waste. I don’t have anything that I’m good at and I’m back to being unemployed living with my parents. I had a good job that I left for another job which I ended up hating. So well done me for fucking myself over there. 

I see no light at the end of the tunnel. How can I continue the rest of my life when I have to be me?"
963,How do I Trust again?,"So I had a really shitty summer. I was stuck in a very toxic and emotionally abusive relationship. I started dating my ex back in December. I saw red flags but I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt. As time went by they became more and more possessive, aggressive, guilt trippy and controlling. I tried to get out of the relationship but she would guilt me
Back into it and convince me I was the problem. Because of covid we moved in together and my summer well... it was really shit. I was constantly gas lighted, belittled, guilt tripped. She had me convinced I was abusive and a horrible person. She also accused me of cheating when I hadn’t, would pressure me to have sex, and scold me constantly. I was basically walking on eggshells. It got to the point where I was severely depressed and so doubtful of myself. She had entrained in me that I was the problem, that I was abusive (even though I’ve only had healthy relationships and am friends with all my previous partners). After I shared with her that my dad was abusive and would ignore me as his main way of punishing me, she started doing it to me. That’s when it got too much, I began having suicidal thoughts and this one night I felt an impulse to kill myself. I asked for help and she ignored my texts and knocks to her door. After calling the suicide hotline, the phone operator urged me to call a friend to pick me up, so I did. The was the last night I spent in that house. Later I found out that my ex started spreading rumors that I was an abusive guy and had Borderline Personality Disorder. I could talk forever about all the horrible things she did and said... 

Anyways it’s been a few months since I last saw her (back in August) and I’ve met a very nice girl recently. We just started dating and I’ve noticed I can’t get myself to completely take down my walls around her. And trust me, she is very different from my ex - don’t see any red flags. She is kind, patient, and sweet. She doesn’t yell at me and she doesn’t make me feel like my ex did. But I still find myself unable to give her my full me. Like I disassociate when I’m around her. I know I should be having a good time but it’s like I’m just sitting there with my arms around her and I feel nothing. After she leaves I try to remember what we even did that day and I can’t seem to recollect. It’s like there’s this barrier stopping me from caring for this girl as much as I would want to. I know it’s connected to my ex - I’m self aware enough. I am not and was never in love with my ex - but the hurt and abuse they put me through is still raw. I want to move on, but I don’t know how to. I feel guilty that I am not fully here for my current girlfriend. It’s like my brain is trying to protect me by not letting me trust or feel anything. Has anyone been through something similar?"

I especially noticed the problem when I was in 8th grade and a guy I liked showed the slightest interest in me. This was the first time it happened. 

Long story short, the guy I liked was friends with my brother and we were giving him a ride to play practice. He was super nice and funny and he would always have a smile on his face. Anyways, my brother stopped at our house to grab something and then come back. While he was in the house, the guy literally asked me a simple question: “How are you?” My heart dropped I felt like this cloud of darkness and warmth came over me. It felt like waves of warmth were going down my body. Like a heat flash. I kinda stayed quiet until we reached a McDonalds drive through when all of a sudden, I said “I’m gonna be sick”. I jumped out of the car, ran inside of the McDonalds bathroom and threw up. This continued on weeks. I never told him he was the reason I would always get sick though. Sometimes he’d text me and we’d be having a conversation when all of a sudden, that cloud came over me and I would run to the bathroom and throw up. (Nothing ever happened between us though and we remained friends)

Another time this happened was in 10th grade after I had just got done with the first night of our school’s musical. Most of the cast went to Hoss afterwards and I had liked this boy. My mom, trying to be a “wing woman” offered to give him a ride with my brother and me to which he said “sure!” My heart was racing during that car ride and I tried my best to calm down. When we got to Hoss, He sat at the head of the table and I sat to his right. I tried my best to keep my cool and talk to him. However, I could feel the anxiety coming though and I felt sick to my stomach. Finally that cloud hit and I excused myself and kept my cool until I reached the bathroom and threw up. This happened again when I was in his senior project. We were filming and I had been fine for most of the night. Finally, He was filming someone else and I was taking a break when all of a sudden, I felt nauseous and I ran upstairs and threw up. No one actually knew I had thrown up except my one friend who I told. It happened so quickly and I wasn’t sick before. To calm me down, I could not be near him. If I got near him, I would feel nauseous again. Once again, nothing ever happened between us other than going to prom as friends. Btw, I threw up when I got home that night. 

In 11th grade, I began showing interest in this one guy and he also showed interest in me. Finally one day, he actually told me that he had feelings for me and I was surprised he actually said something. On the outside, I was keeping my cool, but on the inside, I wanted to throw up. I told him we could try, but finally I excused myself and I went upstairs and had a panic attack. Didn’t throw up but I sure felt nauseous. Luckily for me, he was super understanding and knew I had anxiety. He was patient with me and we formed somewhat of a relationship. (We were a “thing” for a few months but ultimately, it didn’t work out. He’s the closest to a bf I’ve ever had). 

Finally we reach present day and the guy I’ve had this huge crush on since middle school is showing interest in me. He’s 4 years older then me but we’ve always had a super chill friendship. Lately, we’ve been texting everyday and my anxiety with boys has chilled out a little bit, but not completely. I still feel this dark cloud come over me with those heat-flash like feelings and I still get nauseous, but I’ve managed to not throw up. I get close though. 

So at the moment, My family is quarantined and I’ve been feeling sick. I was talking to him today and he asked me how I was feeling. I said I feel like poop and that I think I’m sick. Then he said “I was going to say that we should get lunch sometime but I’ll need a hazmat suit!” That did it. I’ve never sprung up so quickly. My heart started racing. Heat flash feelings. Nauseous feeling kicked in. Internal screaming. One part of me excited while the other part of me wants to throw up. The guy I have liked since middle school mentioned going to lunch. I went from being excited and shocked to: “I’m gonna be sick”. I had to take some anxiety medication from that text. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I know this is not how I should feel. I should feel excited and overjoyed, but instead I feel anxiety, nauseousness, and like crying. 

It’s like, I feel like I can like someone, but once they show any sign that they liked me back, I retreat. My anxiety with boys has calmed down enough that I’m fine if someone likes me, but I don’t like them back. However, it goes all sicko mode if I liked them, and they show signs of liking me back. One could say I’m confusing excitement and butterflies with anxiety, but if excitement and butterflies makes me feel like yacking... I don’t want it. 
I’m 18 yo, about to turn 19, and I’ve never been on a date. I’ve never had my first kiss. I’ve never slow danced. I’ve never had a real, full-on boyfriend. I thought my anxiety would get better as I grew up, but I still feel like that girl from 8th grade who throws up when a guy I liked showed interest in me. I want to find a guy and fall in love, but it’s like my anxiety physically won’t let me. I know this sounds childish but I feel absolutely miserable in these moments. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if this is normal. I can’t put into words how bad this feeling is. Why do boy literally make me sick! I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice."
966,honest view on mental health and exercise during lockdown,https://youtu.be/pQimvUiHYLk
967,Is anyone else just “in the clouds” and going through the motions? I can’t seem to be motivated to do anything or do anything productive anymore.,"17M, I’m in probably one of the most important parts of my life. I’m supposed to be applying to colleges, getting good grades in school, etc. but I just can’t. I’m not even playing video games anymore. I just stay in the bed, or just spend the day in a daze or in my own world, not accomplishing shit. The quarantine gave me one of the best opportunities and I just spent it doing nothing. Absolutely nothing. I spent it wallowing with my shitty mental health and depression/anxiety. I don’t know really what to do anymore. I’m not motivated to do anything and it seems like I can’t do anything productive anymore. I’m not doing school work anymore, practicing driving, applying to colleges- I’m doing nothing. I hate myself for it but I can’t seem to leave this haze."
968,My mom witness me having a panic attack,"Since it is the season of finals I had a panic attack, and it was larger and lasted longer than any of my other ones that I had before. My mom later told me that it was disturbing to see me having a panic attack. I really don't know what to say to her since I have no control on when and where and how large my panic attacks are. Some advice would be nice."
969,Am I okay? Am I supposed to feel the way I feel? Is it valid?,"Hi. It's my first time posting on here. I honestly don’t know where to start in all honesty, I’m just trying to type down what I feel and maybe hope that people will understand where it’s coming from or understand what I’m trying to say cause I have no one else to talk to about it, so pardon the word vomit.

So. I have been feeling really “weird” lately… Not all the time, but I do when I come home. I don’t really know what I’m *actually* feeling in all honesty, but most of the time I just feel this *immense* sadness and tiredness (mentally).

I’m 22 years old. I currently live with my family. Dad, step-mom, big bro and little sister. Before this, I lived with my mom and two older sisters for around 6 years. I’d like to add that me and my brother are currently in the process of moving out since that’s going to be an important detail in this story. Anyways, I had a pretty good dynamic with my mom when I used to live with her. She understood me, I understood her. She adapted to me, I adapted to her. She didn’t hold me back from getting the freedom i wanted. In return, I didn’t abuse that freedom. It was a two way thing because that’s how relationships are supposed to work. 

Going back to it, I currently live with my dad. My dad has always been a strong and authoritative character. He has his good sides and he has his bad sides like everyone else. The first few months of living with him again was okay despite the few instances we had misunderstandings here and there. He was also very affectionate with us… But everything just suddenly spiralled when we got into this huge argument. Long story short, we had this huge misunderstanding and he threw this jab at me when he was talking to my brother and I was really hurt by it so I tried confronting him about it, but he started shouting at me and cutting me off so I couldn’t explain my side properly. I was really hurt by it because I feel like he didn’t even want to try to hear me out. We didn’t speak for days after that. I didn’t really want to talk to him either because whenever I thought about talking to him, I just feel like all my energy just leaves my body. I knew that he had a fault in the situation, but I also don’t deny that I had a fault too. So I apologized first and tried to explain my side again. We made up but the conversation and apology didn’t really make me feel better at all because in the end, he made it about him. It made me realize how unwilling my dad was in terms of adjusting to other people, most especially his own kids. All my life that I’ve known my dad, his ways and rules are *law*. We can’t do anything about it. He doesn’t adjust to you, you adjust to him…. Realizing that made me incredibly frustrated and unhappy. All my life I have been trying to adjust to him, because… well he’s my *dad.* Why shouldn’t I, right?

After that fight, I noticed I became so withdrawn whenever I come home. I was my usual self at work and with other people, but I started dreaded going home because of that thought and realization. The thought of just interacting with my dad just made me upset and anxious. It got worse when my brother told me that he and dad talked about our move out *and* me. He said some pretty hurtful things about me and I realized how low he thinks of me. I was just heartbroken because I was pretty okay with myself, I never put myself down nor put myself on a pedestal… I just thought of myself as someone who was doing alright and is okay. But when my brother told me what my dad thought of me, I just crashed. We were in the supermarket that time and I was nearly in tears and I tried holding back from crying because I was in public. It got *even* worse when me and my brother finally signed the lease to our new place and started buying stuff for our new place. He suddenly gets defensive and asks why were buying certain stuff and why we’re not involving him (which we *are*, mind you, we update him to what we’re doing) and he argues and makes assumptions like that we don’t involve him cause he doesn’t want us to be with him…. I honestly don’t know what to do or say about it anymore. We try reasoning with him and try to explain that that wasn’t the case, but he only views the black and whites. After that, I became totally withdrawn whenever I was at home. It’s weird, being so cheery and energetic at work but as soon as I step foot in the house, I felt like a completely different person. I felt so drained when I was at home to the point that I didn’t really speak nor interact with *anyone*. Even my siblings. I just speak when spoken to. I tried doing stuff that usually cheer me up (like drawing or watching stuff i liked), but it didn’t really help. During those days, I tried sleeping earlier so I don’t have to interact with anyone and I could leave the house to go to work to be myself again. I’ve broken down in tears quite a few times and cried myself to sleep almost every night. There was one point where I just had a panic attack and my brother had to help me and one point where I thought about disappearing. 

By this point, I didn’t know what was happening to me. I thought “Am I depressed? Should I seek help??” but then there was this voice at the back of my head that told me that my dad would say “Why would you be depressed? You eat good food, have a good job, you sleep on a bed, and you got a nice family even though it’s dysfunctional. You have no reason to be sad.” and it made me feel even worse about the situation. It felt like I had no right to be sad. I didn’t go through any traumatizing thing growing up. I didn’t have any triggering reasons for my feelings. That’s why I was really hesitant to open up to anyone about it. I didn’t understand what was happening to me, so how would anyone else understand me? I also didn’t want it to seem like I blamed my dad on the situation. My dad is a good person in general. I don’t want him to feel like he made me feel like this and beat himself up. But… I really don’t know how to explain it to anyone else. Am I over exaggerating? Are my feelings valid even if it’s really so small?? I’m just so tired."
970,How I feel rn :(,"I'm so upset at fact I always feel lonely and depressed and anxious and how It will never go away

And memories in school coming back and bullying and racism and it's getting to me again. Feel like they right behind me

I feel like I can't go on I can't live anymore


Feel like giving up"
971,I'm scared. I dont know what these are. Please i need advice. They keep me up at night.,"Im 16F. For a long time I've felt like im going insane in that I have weird thoughts. As in they are not necessarily negative. But weird thoughts. 

For example, constantly thinking about scenarios and I mean literally hundreds of scenarios in which I talk to people. As in these are people in real life that I havent spoken to because im too shy or whatever. Usually it is always the same person that crops up (a teacher). And like I dont have this teacher currently. But I still keep thinking of her. 

And this teacher i never particularly liked having I felt she was critical of me and I still fear she didn't like me. However, in my thoughts she likes me. And is really caring towards me. Some times it goes too far in that I had thoughts of sexual nature about her. As in imagining us having sex. I've also imagined sex with imaginary women. I know this fucking weird and I dont know where to put this. I might take this down later because this is so embarrassing. And im so scared that people know my account and everything im thinking. And im having to fight these thoughts to post this. Sometimes I have thought of her as vulnerable and thought about hurting her. Even though she's done nothing. And these thoughts are really confusing me.  

She's not the only person that I've thought of. Although she is the main one. I have thought of other women or female teachers as caring towards me. However, these are all fantasies and they have never ever been replicated in real life. In fact in real life I seem to be distant and excessively shy. However, I am shy and struggle alot with social situations and making friends however, that's an entirely different problem. 

But this teacher. I deliberately memorise the times in which I've seen her walking in the corridor from lesson to lesson and will be there at those times so that I can look at her. At sometimes I really want her to notice me.  Which is really weird considering the fact that im so shy I avoid every single person. And get really anxious when someone looks at me. And when I think about telling someone that I self harm I think of her. Even though that would be illogical as in real life im so scared of her and also dislike her and dont trust her. But yet in my mind I fantasise about her.

These thoughts remind me of around January I would have this sudden urge to kiss the person in front of me. As in every person I spoke to. Even my parents. But I've stopped that. However, it did recently happen with my sibling.

These thoughts also remind me of 2 years ago. When the same thing would happen with a male teacher. However as soon as it he left school. It was over. But with this teacher even after she no longer teaches me I still think of her. And I dont know if its that I always thought they could help me. As I've struggled with my mental health alot and no one knows. 

I dont know what this is. But I really need some advice. I've bottled this up for ages and have been in denial for so long. But I want someone to maybe have some possible explanation"
972,"Can alcohol trigger violence, mental health related issues or misbehaviour?","Lots of times when I got drunk I acted weird, completely opposite of how I am normally. 2 times I reached a level where I started insulting my friends or speaking nonsense and the day after I had to be told about it because at a certain point where I drank too much for my levels of tolerance I completely lost it and didnt remember half ot the night..

I had or might still have mental health issues, lots of   violence and abuse in childhood and for example since a young age I started talking alone, saying hi to the air or even punching the air at home and even on the  streets, to the point where I did even if I was surrounded by people. I stopped neglecting things when I got to my worst depressive phase and started doing that talk alone thing for days and I was completely out of my mind.

I will go to therapy and I won't drink again because I've hurt people in some ways and tho I apologized and talked those things with them and  I'm not like that at all normally, but the mainly point is if someone might know something about it. I guess we all know people that get crazy with alcohol.
Oh plus it happened with Marijuana too, when I was high and not inhibited anymore y lost fear and morality about what i was doing so I might have a problem with substances which I am completely capable of admit. Thanks in advance"
973,I think my absent mindedness is a serious issue.,"I wasn't sure where to talk about my issue, so I figured this would be the best sub to post on. Ever since I was a kid, I've had times where I made really dumb mistakes, like locking myself out of my room and forgetting my homework several times. It never really bothered me until I started having responsibilities like school and work. Recently, I was taking an online anatomy class where there is a lecture and a lab. I'm doing well for the lecture, but for the lab, I ended up missing a huge chunk of the assignments due, despite having a class syllabus and weekly posts. I literally have no idea how I missed these posts for so long and now that I look at it, there is no way a mentally healthy human being could miss something as obvious as this. Keep in mind, my work ethic is really good and I usually make good grades if I'm aware of things, but for some reason, I make really huge dumb mistakes like this.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't end at school either, I also have had these problems at work too. I used to work at mcdonalds and got fired for making too many mistakes. When I worked at a grocery store, I made a mistake that almost cost me my job and had the potential for legal issues (selling alcohol at an illegal time). I remember my manager at the time told me that ""some mistakes are too big to make"", and I have to agree. Even though most mistakes are small, there are some that are too big and costly to make. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm typing this because of my failure to turn in my assignments on time simply because I didn't think/remember about it, and because of that, I will have to potentially redo my $600 course. Sure that isn't the end of the world, but at this point, I'm scared. It's not like I'm even trying to make these mistakes, I'm absolutely trying to do my best in life, and I recognize not everyone is perfect, but if I keep doing things that set me back due to not being conscious of them, I don't know what i'd do with myself. I really wish I had some underlying illness I never knew about so I can finally have an answer. I feel horribly stupid every time I make big mistakes like this, and it genuinely scares me that I can do something as dumb as forget a quarter of my assignments when I had notifications and calendars and such. (I'm serious, it's like I never saw them at all until yesterday). Anyways, I don't know if this issue is serious enough to take to a professional, but at this point, I need some sort of help. I feel like most people don't do these type of things and I need a reason why, or at least a way to cope."
974,What to do about my anxiety,"I’ve had anxiety for around 4 years now, and I came open about it and told my dad around a year or so ago, we’ve been going off and on of me getting “helped” which pretty much consists of a healthier diet, and getting more sunlight, both of which don’t really help my anxiety at all. I’ve been getting progressively worse I feel like and I don’t know what to do, I talked to my dad about seeing a therapist but he basically just said that it wouldn’t really do anything, but I could if I wanted to, he gave me the choice but he obviously doesn’t think and would rather me not get a therapist, but his way isn’t really working at all, he said to give it a few months and that things wouldn’t work right away but it’s been a few months now and I don’t really feel better, he often says that “maybe you feel better but you just don’t realize it” and I get where he’s coming from but I genuinely don’t feel better and still anxious often and I still have the same issues as always, he’s honestly contributed to my anxiety for a number of reasons due to some things that have been done to me in the past and me just being put in situations that brought me anxiety and I feel that’s a big root to why I get anxiety, when he’s not home I feel a big weight lift off of me and I have less anxiety around the house, I still have anxiety obviously no matter what but it’s less so when he’s at work, but as soon as he gets home or I’m told he’s coming home I get really anxious. I don’t dislike my dad or anything but he’s abused me in the past and those are things I’ve never recovered from and they’re things I don’t think I’ll ever truly forgive him for. My dad doesn’t know the exact reason that I have anxiety and I don’t believe he thinks it’s him, and obviously I can’t tell him he’s the reason why I get anxiety, so I feel really stuck like there’s nothing to do. Sorry for writing so much and thank you to anyone who reads"
975,No title,I’m broken all the time I never tell anyone how I truly feel no one has even known my dark thoughts I have wasted my life I’m constantly on the verge of tears I hate thinking. I have a permanent smile on my face but I want to die I will never do it I’m too afraid another thing I will not accomplish oh well I just wanted to tell someone I want to die without them knowing who I am or it effecting them
976,Will I ever be the same person?,"I don't have the best luck. Between 2018 and 2020 I suffered 5 concussions. I got hit in the head several times between those periods but nothing that I feel adequately enough to say, yes they wear concussions. 
First one was when I fell off a swing. My daughter wanted to go the park so went. We get there and she wants to use the swings. I proceed to swing with then I decided to jump off. Normal right? No not for a 30 year old I guess. I went to jump off and gravity said to me ver batum ""No you gonna fall 12 feet on to your back."" Then the second one was when I went to an indoor water park. I went into a tube with a water slide. I slid off the raft and was just riding the tube. Funnest thing ever then it ends. Imagine getting into a head on crash at 40 miles an hour. That's how that felt. After that I got beat up. I don't want to talk about it but yes if left me concussed. Then I got hit by 2 cars while I was driving. A car ran a red light and hit my passenger door. That spun my car around and another car drive into the back of my car. After that I wasn't right mentally for a couple weeks. Could perform basic tasks of memory. Literally my short term memory was gone. That happened Aug 2019. Then last may when I was taking a shower, I tried opening the glass shower door and it fell on my head. Didn't knock me out but.. this is hard to type. I was hungry as I was getting dressed (still in bathroom). Ii was thinking about what food to eat and I thought I wanted McDonald's. I look up in the mirror and start ordering food. Before I could get 2 words out(which was I like), I realized what I was doing and broke down crying. My memory is slowly to coming back. My emotions are different. I'm more susceptible to having extremely strong opinions now more than ever. String emotions. I still can't think. What I mean is if you give me a problem. Like a math problem it a history question. When I think nothing is there. Then if something interests me I really remember it.  If I try to figure certain things like where did I out my keys I draw a blank, no emotions attached to thinking now either and I get.. my head starts hurting. My floatation of mind and pressure of speech is horrible. I been taking vitamins for the last 3 months. A, b complex, 1000mg of c, d, e, and fish oil(I believe it has omega) fatty acids. I recently started taking magnesium at night to help with sleep but that besides the point. I noticed the vitamins help. I also work out. Cardio. Either one of those is helping. My memory is still messed up. Yesterday I was at Burger King. My brother calls me on my phone says ""no pickles no cheese on my burger."" I agreed. Then forgot to order it. Then get in the car and had to look at my phone to see if he really called me. I don't think I will ever be the same and it makes me so depressed. I don't relate with people now... More than ever. I have to tell people I got hit by a car because sometimes I can't remember stuff when I'm in public or else I get looked at  a person with special needs. Please I don't mean to be offensive if ur came out that way. Just trying to correlate the perspective I see and couldn't think of better words to choose. I have anxiety. Had it since I was 15. Not getting into that. I'm 33 now. All the works is Valium. Sometimes weed. I can't take it like I used too because when I do I feel like I have this big empty space in my head. That feeling was there for a couple months after the accident as well but that's besides the point. I can never be at peace because my choices are to be manic or be a forgetful fuck. Excuse the language. I've had MRIs or cat scans or whatever it is done and it came back normal. They also said I was moving slot so they couldn't get the best reading of the lower back part of my brain. I really want to be myself again. I hate this. It's hindering my growth as a father, and a man. Any advice would help. I don't know what else to say. Thank you gmfor taking the time to read this. Thank you to the redditors that make up reddit for being a good friend. Thank you reddit for bringing me these friends."
977,Help me raise awareness of the stigma surrounding male mental health,[removed]
978,Conventional Beauty,"Sometimes I wonder if its vain to know that you're pretty. I mean, I get told all the time that I'm attractive. From my face to my body. Almost daily I get compliments but, when I acknowledge that I have good looks, I'm told thats an unattractive trait to have. So am I supposed to feel grateful when I get a compliment and otherwise feel like I'm ugly?

I just don't understand. Do I think I'm cute? Yes. Do I think I have a good figure? Also yes. Am I supposed to not tell people I like how I look? Why is it only okay for other people to tell me I'm pretty while I cannot tell myself I'm pretty?

Over the years, this has made me feel so low. At times its made me think the only thing I have to offer is my looks yet when I embrace them I'm called vain and self centered or looked at like I'm stupid. I'm not though. Yet I feel like I am. Like my appearance detracts from my intelligence. I just don't understand. I feel like I have to go out of my way to prove to people that I am more than just an attractive face/body. I feel like I have to prove that I'm not stupid.

I'm told that this isn't a ""real"" problem to have. ""Pretty people have it easier"" or ""why are you depressed when you have a body like that?"" I'm confused and don't know how I'm supposed to feel about myself at times. Maybe this is stupid to feel bad about.. I dont know. I hate feeling this way."
979,Letter To My Brother,"         I miss you so dame much.  It’s been 
7 years now.  Every day I still hurt sometimes are worse then others.   Sometimes I cry.  I should have never walked out the club with that chick.  I could have been there &amp; got us a cab. You don’t how broken that made me.  So writing this letter to you I wanted to tell you a little about what this world is going through.   Felt like I need to tell you about stuff that has gone down in my life. 
       For starters the sports world has been wild.  Cubs, Astros, Washington won a World Series.  The Cavaliers won the finals they came back from being down 3-1. LeBron won 3 more titles two with the Heat &amp; one with the Lakers. Speaking of Kobe passed away it was heart breaking.  I am still heart broken over losing you.  Brady plays for the Bucks.  Kansas City got them a QB on the fast track to the GOAT title. 
      Next up we was hit with this crazy pandemic.  It’s been killing so many people yet we have people saying it’s fake because they can’t think for themselves.  The world has became so selfish.  People can’t give up a few things because they don’t want to. People are all about the me me me now mentality. 
       The world has changed so much so fast.  Rainforest &amp; states have been battling deadly fires.  Racism has digressed by a lot.   That’s not the worst part are leaders are the ones driving the the biggest wedge between us.  We have cops killing unarmed people mostly African Americans.   So there has been so many upset.  It is to the point now even if the officers life is in danger people still get mad.  We all just want to be mad be because it’s easier then being happy.
        Guess now I will get you up to speed about myself.  I got married then divorced.  Have  three baby girls different moms though.  Man I gotta be honest with you.  With everything that happened I been holding this guilt for so long.  I let it take me over didn’t even fight it.   Pushed all my friends away.  I pushed every woman close to me away.  Made my marriage go bad made the rest of my relationships go bad. 
        The kids are beautiful &amp; smart there mothers are great I’m sure they will be fantastic woman.  I got on drugs took pill after pill just wanted to be numb.  I know you been wondering why I don’t smile anymore.   I can’t man I have no right to.  On a positive note been clean now for a good minute but the depression hasn’t gone away.   Think it moved into my shadow &amp; decided it likes it there.  
        I don’t know who I am anymore.  It’s become harder to tell the pain from happiness.  I am so sorry &amp; understand your probably mad at me for it but it’s become difficult to see tomorrow.  I been having these thoughts &amp; dreams.   So can’t say how much longer I can keep going.  
           The holidays right around the corner &amp; I am alone, scared, &amp; hurting I have nothing anymore.  Every one is gone now &amp; it’s nobody fault but my own.  Idk what to do but I’ll try the confidence I had.   Has been gone for so long I can’t talk to people anymore
            Goodbye till next time I will try to talk to you more love you."

You know, just like now. Being on the verge of tears, yet nothing happends.

That genuinly hurts

You know how much it hurts when you're literaly trying to make yourself cry when naturaly you can't, and your mind goes to saying you should just kill yourself because your worthless. That's going from empty to literaly like an atom exploding into nothingness

No actualy

It's like getting the strenght to go trough that tunnel only to be runned down by an incoming train

Like genuinly what the fuck

I JUST WANT TO CRY, AND NOW I'M HAVING A FUCKING BREAKDOWN

I'M GENUINLY FUCKING DONE WITH EVERYTHING, I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP, CRY AND THEN DIE

i can't even think

i swear if i relapse i better hit a vein, fucking moron

literaly, pain dosen't even make me cry anymore. i'm jsuist fucking done

i wish i could just pass knowing those i care about would be happy regardless and not greif nor lose anything

it's like i know if i go trough this, it'll make everything well. it won't hurt as much the next time, but it'll be more dawning, it's only temporary and everything etc.

but just a fucking cut can make it all end, but at the same time it'll only make things fucking horrible.

yet as soon as i have a breakdown, i forget about everything that i know and my mind is just focused on selfharming to just let go of what i'm feeling to achieve a false sense of validation and happines which i so desperatly need and want

but NO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO FELL LIKE YOU WANT TO MUTILIATE YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING LEG INSTEAD OF BEING THINKING THE WAY YOU USUALY DO

fucking idiot

can't even think anymore

i'm sorry,

i'll go to bed and hug my blanket because i genuinly know i'll relapse and at that horribly. everything hurts i'm on the verge of tears yet nothing happends. i genuinly can't think i'm just lost

i want my emotions back you monster, i just want to be happy

i just want a hug

i just want to smile

it feels like this lightbulb is having it's last sense of energy

my hands shake yet i can't help it, i just want to find the way out of here and back into the warmth and comfort of the past

i just want to scream for help in this massive field

yet i have no air

i have no spirit to commit to it

i just want to lay down and stare at the night sky

see my cold breath under the moon

be a feast for the crows in the morning and the weeks to come

i just want to climb the walls of this pitch black maze and hope i see a light

the light that will lead me out of here

it's already pitch black, but on top of that as if i'm blind

and everything hurts from these gaping wounds, as i slipp and fall on my blood

the smell of iron thick in the air

never have i wanted to see the grim reaper more before, as if he's an old friend comming over once again

yet this time for good

just cast me to the realm of the dead

yet i'll smile as i know i did one good deed

that being dying

releaving the world of myself

i'm nothing

and when i'm dead

i'll truely be nothing, just as i deserve"
981,i don’t even know who i am anymore,"i can’t get out of bed anymore. i can’t find the motivation to feed myself. i can’t find the energy to talk to my parents. i cant find enjoyment in watching my favorite tv show or playing my favorite game. i can’t find the energy to call or text my friends back. i can’t find the energy to reach out to someone. when i get up to use the bathroom i just look in the mirror and realize that i don’t even recognize myself anymore. the meds aren’t working, the therapy isn’t working, praying isn’t working, nothings working it never works."
982,I feel like i’m not even here sometimes,"I am just going to go on a venting rant, it may not make sense and be all over the place but this is where my head is at and i feel like i need to talk about it before I go crazy. 
I have had problems with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I feel like this year my symptoms have gotten worse. I can’t even say this has been the worst year of my life, but it’s taken such a toll on me and I feel so drained I feel like i’m not even here and that my body is on autopilot. This is a familiar feeling but something about this time just feels even more off than usual. This year has just been so off.
I realized I lost a lot of my memory from quarantine, I can’t remember much from the months of March to May, even February is kind of a blur. I mean complete months just wiped from my memory. I know I wasn’t doing much besides being home but still, I just can’t remember it.
After the month of May I do still remember what I did. And the only good months I experienced this year were January, September, October and November, all of which I spent in Colombia visiting my boyfriend- who seems to be the only person that really makes me happy lately. I made a life decision that I want to move oversees to close the distance with my boyfriend, and also be closer to the majority of my family that do live there. But now I can’t stop obsessing over how i’m gonna achieve this and how long it’ll take. Which adds to my stress and depression because I think of all the things I can’t have right now. I created goals and deadlines for myself for the next 5 years essentially to make this work but everything feels so far away and I can’t do anything right now to fill the loneliness I feel.
Last week I got diagnosed after years of crazy amounts of pain and symptoms I never knew were related. While i’m happy I have an explanation at last for everything i’ve been feeling, I now have to prepare myself for a rather difficult future with this condition that may or may not get worse. My symptoms cause me a lot of pain and anxiety which of course contribute to my depression and I don’t feel much support from my family.
I constantly have a million things in my head and what i’ve written so far honestly doesn’t even scratch the surface of all my fears and anxieties. I feel like lately i’ve just been going crazy, I feel like I go on these thought binges and don’t stop. I’ll spend hours just writing and planning out my future and then crying over the fact that I can’t change anything right now. I don’t know how to calm down and I feel so alone. I don’t want to burden my partner with my issues right now because I know that I feel this way often and that it’s not easy for him either. I also don’t want to worry him.
I feel like I just really need someone right now. My mind is in knots and scrambles."
983,Going through a break up I think,"I’m not sure what’s happening or where we stand in the relationship but I keep wanting a second chance to prove to my ex that I can do better than I’ve been doing previously. I don’t want to keep putting myself down and I keep giving in and texting her even tho I shouldn’t. I want her more than life itself.

She’s having fun with her friends and I’m proud that she’s doing that cos it’s fun and she’s enjoying herself. I really can’t stop thinking about her. It’s been on and off for like 6 days now. I haven’t had a day where I haven’t texted her. I keep looking at her stories and fall in love with her over again. Her smile is so perfect and her hair is so long and pretty. I see her differently now than I did a week ago and that’s not even bullshit. I miss that girl so much and I guess my way of coping is messaging her. Even though that’s not what she’s asked for .

I’m in a really bad place and I don’t want her to feel guilty about me anymore. I’ve sat in bed for a week just overthinking. I don’t want to get over her because I want to Change my behaviour and show her how much this means to me and how much I’m willing to change. 

Mental health sucks already and it sucks even more now. Advice please ."
984,I made a Discord server to make friends,"Hey everyone! I was feeling pretty lonely lately, so I created a Discord server for people to come chill and make friends. It's pretty small at the moment with only a few members, but I would love for the community to grow and thrive as something really special. I want the server to host events such as movie nights, game nights, karaoke nights, etc. It's the first server I've made, so it may be a little messy, I take suggestions! If you're interested in joining, please send me a message with some information about yourself and I'll send you the link!"
985,How do you deal with anxiety?,How do you all calm your anxiety when it gets really bad? I find that I always overthink stuff and my anxiety gets extremely bad and i cant seem to control it so any tips?
986,Please help me do something to my addictions,"So, this post is not going to be as bad as the rest on this sub, no suicidal tendencies,nothing of the sorts but I still consider my problem worthy of this subreddit and I'd be grateful if someone could give me advice.

Since I came to university, I've been overwhelmed by a lot of things, school, social life, life in general. I was not used to this amount of pressure, in fact I've never experienced anything like it before.

All this has been going on for 1.5 years now, since I came here I became a heavy smoker, and also got addicted to energy drinks(and alcohol but now that bars are closed due to covid it's not that big of a deal anymore). I've been, for two weeks now, literally studying almost 24/7 with minimal sleep, though I give myself some breaks but it doesn't help that much, I just feel guilty I'm not doing anything productive while relaxing so in fact it just makes things even worse.

The only real thing I enjoyed before the lockdown was going to the gym and lifting some weights, that was the one and only thing that could get my mind off everything that was going on around me, but I don't have that now either.

I'm seriously starting to worry about the long term effects of this crazy amount of stress combined with smoking and unhealthy amount of energy drinks on a daily basis, sitting around all day curled up inside not doing any physical activity whatsoever.

My mind is going crazy under normal circumstances too, if I happen to be out of cigarettes or energy drink, or god forbid both, I'm fairly sure I could get a heart attack or a seizure any minute now.

Can you guys suggest me any stress-relief methods, or maybe natural substances,pills or whatever that are not unhealthy or harmful? I'd like to quit both smoking and drinking too but at the same time not go batsh*t crazy and jump off the 3rd floor. 

I'm asking this here because I've tried a few techniques, none of them worked and I'd like to hear things that actually worked for real people and are not just on a random website.You could say reddit is a random website with random people where anyone can say anything as well, but I have mostly positive experiences from here so I trust you all guys on this one."
987,Grade Anxiety is Real and Won't go Away Until I Graduate or Die.,"I'm nervous about my performance this semester. It's been a chaotic mess and all I have left to complete is an exam. I have horrible test anxiety and I know I won't get an A in the class unless I do really well in this test, which my previous records show otherwise. I do have an A right now in another class, but a high C in another class, I hope my teacher influences my grade to be a few points higher to push it to that, as its a 79.2% right now, but I doubt it. There's one more class which I hated, and I have to pass with a high enough grade to get into the program, as they only go by grade numbers. There's just one last assignment my graduate student teacher needs to grade and my overall results won't come up till the 18th... I feel like a failure and have been getting really negative thoughts that are making me want to kill myself, although I'm too much of a coward to do so. Three years of college so far, and I've only ended up with one C throughout it all. Now I'm probably going to end up with three Cs if I don't get luck on my side and might not get into the program so I can graduate sooner...I was having plans on overdosing if I failed to get in. I hate myself so much I wished I could not be a coward and die already."
988,Roommate depression(?),"Hi Reddit, this is my first post ever... for privacy reasons, I won’t include gender in this post. I’m a college student and I have a very strong inclination that my roommate is depressed. I’m not sure what the severity of my statement is, but I don’t think they’re doing ok. They’re becoming more and more detached and less talkative, but they still are taking care of themself and our room. They sleep for most of the day and eat only snacks/junk food/DoorDash since they don’t like the dining hall food (which I understand but we’re athletes on the same team and we need to eat) but they are a beam of light during practice and is absolutely hilarious. They started hanging around with some people who like to party during the week (nothing wrong w that, just hoping that they’re safe) but barely leaves the room otherwise. We don’t have much in common so they and I don’t really hang out much other than being teammates and roommates. I don’t know them well enough to know what their normal behavior is like. I don’t want to jump to any conclusions and offer myself to them if they need to talk because we don’t talk that much as it is. Today, we didn’t talk at all and I’m not sure if something may have happened recently or if something is just stressing them out, but it’s concerning as it is becoming more regular.

Any tips/advice you may have would be wonderful."

990,Feeling buried,"I’ve been feeling this way since before the pandemic. I’m in the US so we’re still doing pretty terrible handling it. I feel that if I seek help now I will be labeled as “pandemic anxiety” but that’s not it, it’s been since last October that it’s been mounting. 

I keep looking forward in my schedule and thinking “okay tomorrow I have this and that and then the next day this and this and then the next day....” and so on forever. I will scroll on my calendar well into the next year thinking about next and next and next. I do this several times a day. 

I do need to look at it each day and into the rest of the month for work as things pop up overnight and may need changed. I typically have weekends off but by the time 2pm Saturday rolls around I’m already worried about the Sunday blues about going back to work Monday. The thing is, I like my job. I liked it a lot more before covid but I don’t hate going. I’m not overworked or underpaid, I generally work alone and see very few people so it’s not anxiety about being there. 

When I’m doing my looking forward I physically feel exhausted like I’ve been holding my breath, my heart rate is up (my Apple Watch confirms it) I feel a little dizzy and overwhelmed. I plan my next day and even week down to 15 minute intervals. I find that I can’t stop. It’s continuing to get worse with each passing month. 

I will make a list of the next 10 or so things I need to do at work and after one is completed I will stop and go over the last nine and once that’s done I stop and go over the last eight and so on until I make my next list. I feel physically exhausted just going over lists all day, all week, all month, indefinitely. 

I was prescribed Vyvanse for an eating disorder and it completely calmed this down and I felt normal again but I was only approved for this medication for three months to help the eating disorder (it didn’t). I don’t know what this would be categorized as or what I can do until the pandemic has calmed down in my country. 

I’m falling behind at home and in my relationships because I’m too focused on tomorrow, and the next day, and the one after that, and so on."
991,"Diagnosed OCD, constantly suffer from hyper awareness of my own thoughts.","For the past few months I've been dealing with the phenomenon of thinking about thinking, then about thinking about that and so on. The paradoxical nature of it is distressing as it makes me feel overly aware of the nature of my existence. My thought patterns are unpredictable and I often wonder how I'm still functioning even though my thoughts become chaotic and out of control. I have had short periods of success, I'm also on 100mg of Zoloft, but it tends to come back harder than the last time. It's all I can think about because it feels like I cannot control what I think about. When I thought comes to mind, even a pleasurable one, I question the origin of the thought and how the thought even comes about in the first place. Who's the one choosing to have the thought? When do they come up, and if we can't control them, who's to say they won't one day change to ones that wish harm on others? 
I would like to know if anyone else has felt this way and what they've done to overcome this."
992,Does anybody else torture themselves by always going over hurtful things people have said to them?,"I have a note that has all of the cruel things people have said to me written down on it. I read over it almost obsessively. Sometimes I say them out loud like a mantra. 

I don't know why I do this. 

Does anybody do this?"
993,I hate myself,I wish I didn’t but I do. I have struggled with my mental health a lot this last month. I have a therapy appointment Tuesday which I hope to express my feelings. I just hate these feelings of wanting to die and feeling insignificant. It sucks and my family doesn’t understand. What I really want for Christmas is a new brain that isn’t broken. A brain that isn’t plagued by depression and anxiety. A normal brain.
994,I have some questions about my symptoms,"I'm going to be as concise as possible. 4 years ago I turned 16 and saw a doctor about getting put on antidepressants, they gave me ED so I got switched to lofapramine. Fast forward a few months and I stop taking them because I'm sleeping 70% of each day. Fast forward about a year of major depression and it's nearing Christmas. Something important to note here, I get a near constant inaudible screaming in the back of my head often accompanied by rapid ticking and pressure. Well family has construction work done in basement which travels through the walls to my room and sounds EXACTLY like the screaming. Cut to the next hour of me screaming, crying, running around uncontrollably and bashing my head into walls to get it to stop as my girlfriend stands there crying having an anxiety attack not knowing how to help me until the construction takes a break and I have a coherent enough moment to but on some headphones and blast loud rock the rest of the night.

Bad day but it didn't happen again and I moved on. New year rolls around and I start getting minor visual and auditory hallucinations. Weird but whatever until a month later when I spend the night getting attacked by sarkic monsters while I'm trying to sleep. Immediately told my mother and got an emergency appointment with my GP. They put me back on lofapramine and 5mg olanzapine. I don't sleep as much but I hate what the Olan does to my appetite and weight gain but I stick with it for a few months. Get minor and not so minor hallucinations but no more monsters just weird shit so yay. Now to be honest there's a massive chunk of my life here I don't remember but I stopped taking the drugs for some reason.

I went until 2 years ago without drugs and then the monsters came back HARD. I was scared to even close my eyes and I went back on the meds at double dose and after a bit they ent away, along with my bad thoughts about death, emotional instability and general twitchiness. Life was good. Then around summer last year when bad hallucinations came back. I could feel my instability and the screaming slowly return over early summer so I got in touch with my GP and asked to increase my Olan. They upped my Lofapramine to 240mg a day and that was that. The increase actually kinda helped because it sedated me which got rid of most the monsters and I was used to the screaming already so I as just like eh whatever.

Bad news though boss just before COVID hit monsters came back and I was like ah I'll call once the pandemic has chilled out and that... went well. I still haven't rang but my dumbass got curious. If I'm like this on the meds how am I off? Well it's been an awful week full of me actually screaming, spazzing out and hitting myself and getting hyper for the first time in years. Oh and after the last two days I learnt a new word: ""derealisation."" I keep going on and off feeling like nothing is real and literally everything has a layer of fuzz (including my brain and the air) but I can hardly feel it as my body is made of wet clay including my esophagus which is so nauseating I had to try not to vomit when I breathed. I'm posting this because I have no idea what's wrong with me and I have a compulsive need to categorize myself  so I figured I'd get peer reviewed. Have at it and feel fre to ask questions as there's stuff I left out / forgot.

TL:DR I'm a grab bag of weirdness but I don't want to go to the doctors until after COVID. Please dissect me and ask questions."
995,Coping with a sudden divorce,"Hello all,

Not even 24 hours after my wife and I started to plan our two-year anniversary she told me that she doesn't love me and wants to get a divorce immediately. I'm having a difficult time processing all of this, especially with the holidays coming up and the closest family being over 2,500 miles away. What do the random people of the internet recommend?"
996,You know what stresses me out?,"Mother.
She stresses me out in ways I cant describe. It stresses me out that no matter what I do, she will never be pleased with me. My only goal ever is to make her see that I'm worth it, but its hard because she has her own issues and I cant ignore those even when I'm simply breathing. Right now, I'm stressed because she asked me to broom the house and I made ""an excuse"" that I have a sprained ankle (and I have been anxious for a while now idk why) and she is tired that she did all the work in the house alone. So I just stated my problem to her and she immediately asks me to back off (atm she is brooming her room and not picking up the phone because she is probably overthinking) SEE SHE IS ANGRY SHE SCREAMED AT MY BROTHER FOR NOT PICKING UP THE PHONE  she wouldn't have been angry if I had sucked it up and volunteered to broom the house instead but no, I am an emotionally fucked up piece of shit that has no idea where her issues arise from (she is very irritated right now and I'm scared that she is gonna hit someone in this house) but yeah, I think that's why I am so stressed in this house. And we can't do anything about it, I mean I've got ideas but she would just be dismissive of them. She wouldn't get a maid amidst the pandemic obviously, and we (sis and i) are lazy pieces of shit who are sucking the sanity off of mother and bro is just a baby. So I feel kinda ashamed to admit that I, of all people have issues when the real victim here is mom. Oh well, life sucks pretty bad right now and I would sell my soul to leave this house and go away just for a few days PLEASE GOD I AM SO MISERABLE HERE."

998,Curiosity about cutting self off from family,"Has anyone in the group done it? Where, for the sake of your mental health and well-being, you have needed to leave your family either permanently or for an extended period just to clear your head?

I am asking because my family is starting to talk about pushing me into a career path again, and I just recently posted about their borderline obsession with having multiple generations in the clergy. Anyway, now it seems we need to try to consider nursing and how it worked out great for my mother when my grandmother urged her to go to nursing school.

Honestly, my family has weaponized my beloved late grandmother against me in order to break me into being subservient to their wills. It sickens me to the point when I get a full-time job and move out. I will have to, for a few months, have no interaction with them. Just settle into my place and figure out who I am.

I am considering a lie when I get my job to say it’ll be in the area, but in truth I am looking in the one place I was truly happy. The major metropolitan area 4 hours north of where I live.

When I lived up there, I was the happiest I have been in my whole life. I legitimately felt like the world was my oyster, I could explore my interests and not be bogged into the subservient lifestyle I have back here with my family."
999,I hate sleeping and its ruining my life,"I have quite a big depression and I've been trying to fight it for some time now


Somewhere along the way, I started disliking having to sleep more and more. Whenever I went to bed, I had very nad thoughts I couldn't fight with. Even now, after months of treatment, the very first thing that appears in my head while lying down is ""I hate myself!"". I do not control those thoughts, they are automatic. It takes a huge portion of my energy to fight them off.


It is almost impossible for me to wake up rested. My energy levels are low, like I was in a sleep paralysis, and have to wait 30+ minutes up to even two hours until i have enough energy to stand up. I cannot move my limbs.


Because of all of that, my sleep schedule is horrible and im paralyzed and scared whenever I'm about to go to bed. I'm close to tears day after day. I'm postponing that moment as much as I can. I'm taking drugs, but I think they are too weak - I can endure them without any problem. 


Please, do you have any recommendations for me? My next visit to the psychiatrist is next month, and I don't know what to do until that time"
1000,How do you know when it's a problem?,"I’ve never been diagnosed or anything, I don’t even know. For as long as I remembered I was more of a binging person, I felt like I was a bottomless pit and ate like 24/7. I never got overweight but I did start to struggle with my appearance. 

I thought I was fat, I’d try to eat less and I tried counting calories but I’m kinda lazy and that never worked out for me. Eventually I started losing my appetite. At first it was like a come and go thing, I wouldn’t be hungry for maybe about a week then I would go back to eating everything. 

The past couple months I haven’t had an appetite. Like at all. I usually forget to feed myself and I forget to drink water and stuff. I can go days with only eating a couple crackers and be fine. I’ve lost some weight, not a ton, only like 10lbs or so. I now weigh about 109, and sometimes I fantasize about being 100 or even less. I feel prettier when I don’t eat. 

My family is a little worried but idk, I feel like I don’t have a problem, I can’t help it if I don’t feel hungry. Sometimes I just don’t want to eat, I don’t think I’m in an unhealthy place. 

So I guess I just wanted to know when you know it’s a problem and what you should do after?"

1002,"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

1003,I think my friend has schizophrenia,"I think my friend has like schizophrenia or something, she tells our friend group that it was scientifically proven she used to be a lion, and she thinks she's a fairy, but can't prove it because she can only fly when no one is near her or looking at her, she also thinks she's able to see through walls. I've seen her freak out because she thought minions from despicable me broke into her house, she doesn't believe in numbers or math or science. 

Oh yeah on the minions she has a love hate relationship with them, last month she thought they were watching her on her way to school and were trying to kill her, this month she doesn't care about them. She also has told me many times that she wants to kill someone really badly, she also will randomly say stuff during conversations like ""I'm gonna hurt someone I want to hurt someone, wait I'm too small ha"" and then will continue the conversation like she just said nothing.

She also self harms at random points, like her self harm patterns make no sense, like she'll randomly smack herself in the head, and if she has something sharp she'll just cut herself for no reason, sometimes she just straight up does it in public but I stop her, other times she just does it in private.

And sometimes she just is delusional. We're in high school so I don't think this is normal."

I go through these episodes where it's even harder than usual to communicate. Sometimes it's bc I feel like such a burden that I become to anxious and guilt ridden to talk to them. Other times it bc I feel myself getting really attached to them and that scares me. 

Either way I just stop talking to them for days or even a week+. I never explain myself, I just leave. That must be confusing, it's really unfair to them as well.

I want my friends to be able to lean on my for anything they need. I want them to know they can talk to me about anything and everything an I will gladly listen. But I never dare let myself talk to them about my problems, I never turn to them for support, in fear that I will become a burden to them. I try so hard to be a good friend that I've become a bad one. 

My whole life I've tried to be who everyone wanted me to be. I've tried so hard to mold my actions and personality, even they way I speak. That's why Im ""good"" at making friends, but terrible at keeping them. 

Usually we stop talking after a few good intentions. But there are some people, nice, genuine people, who just keep making the effort to get to know me. BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW ME. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM THAT PERSON I AM AROUND THEM ISN'T ME, THAT I MADE HER UP, THAT SHE IS FAKE.

Im not a snake or anything, I keep my morals at least. But I'm still not me. I can't be me, its way to late now. I built my friendships on her so I can't be me now. Besides I don't like me so I don't expect anyone else to. But it still hurts that I genuinely can't imagine anyone wanting to form a relationship with the real me... Lol"
1008,How to cope with the need for physical affection,"I have been in a horrible state of mind, all I want is physical affection, I crave it so badly, and I don’t know what to do, it feels like I’m being ripped apart, and I just need a shoulder to cry on. It hurts being alone.I know I don’t need it, but I do need it. I just need someone to tell me it’s going to be okay. The one person who I thought would always be there for me hasn’t been a very good friend lately"
1009,Does anyone ever feel...,"Does anyone ever feel like life stopped being about things you enjoyed and started being a chore. I stopped waking up and thinking about things that made me excited, and started waking up and feeling defeated. I stopped thinking about what I wanted and I started thinking about what everyone else wanted. I stopped doing good in school and started putting everything off, all of the time. I stopped dreaming about my future and started dreading it.
And I can't help but wonder... is this what I'm supposed to feel like?"
1010,"Dont know what to do. Dont know where to turn, all help appreciated.","For the past 5 years my reality has felt completly fake and unreal. Its impossible for me to really describe in words but reality feels like im seeing it through a monitor. You're seeing whats on the screen but it has little detail and videos / games can only be so immersive because you know it isnt real. This is genuinly the best way i can describe it. In the beggining of this 5 year period i wasnt sure what in the hell was causing it. The conclusion i came to was either masturbation making my brain feel clouded, or my something to do with my allergies because right before it started i moved across the country. After the first year or two it really started to get worse. It had gotten to the point where it was getting worse and worse evey day. Around 5 months ago i found a mental health discord server made my healthygamergg or ""dr.k"", i was able to explain this to the people on the server and their theory was always that it had something to do with moving across the country. I would go deeper into this with them but past a certain point they were unable to help. Feeling hopeless, i gave up on trying to diagnose what had happened to me and why everything felt unreal. One of the people from the server was nice enough for us to talk about my mental state until a few days ago. A few days ago i think i may have had some type of psychotic episode or something.

The day started with with me opening up my fl studio to make a song. I spent about an hour working on it and was really pleased with it. I showed it to god and he said 'lovely excellence sweetness'. This obviously made me happy to see that god felt satisfied with my offering. I felt tired from working hard on this offering and decided to take a break from the computer and have a snack. 

This was when i think the episode set in. I got up from my chair and was taken aback by how quiet eveything seemed. I live in an aprtment so i usually hear people closing doors and cabinets and walking but it seemed incredibly quiet. I almost immediatly after got this incredibly intense sense that someone was staring at me. It felt beyond creepy. I slowly and shakily turned around and looked all over in my room for someone because of how intense the feeling was. I started to walk over to the kitchen but right before i got to the door frame i felt this indescrivable force yelling at me not to go in. It was the same for the computer and the hallway. I started to freak out and grabbed the bible i keep on my desk. I then went to sit on the couch with it in my hand and look out the window. I distintly remember losing my depth perception . I kept getting the sensation that i was moving but i wasnt. It looked like the cars parked on the street started to move foward and backward and getting smaller and bigger. The stopped moving and changing. But then i turned around to make sure no one was looking at me again and i stared at the door. After a good few minutes of shaking from fear and confusion and staring at the door i started to hear people running up the stairs of my aprtment and adults screaming and children laughing and crying. No one with any children lives in my apartments so i really started to freak out. I jumped off the couch and ran to the door to look out the peephole. No one. Nothing. I still heard them though so i ran to the couch. I sat there, still feeling the sensation of someone watching me. I was so scared i was sweating and shaking. I remember thinking 'am i ina cage or some shit' i yelled 'STOP IT' and almost started to cry.

After about an hour of hearing things and feeling things the sounds went away and i forced myself to go into the kitchen. 

Later that day i described what happened to the guy on discord i always talked to about my mental state. He basically said that what he had done is as far as he can take me and that i should seek medical help.

The problem is that im 15. For various reasons id rather not get into, im not comfortable asking my parents for mental help. Not to mention that i have a distrust for doctors and just about evryone, but i still want to recive help in some way.

What do i do? Id love to talk"
1011,I don’t even know if I have friends at the moment,"A few months ago I left a pretty toxic friend group. I was well aware of how little they cared about me but I had no other friends so I just kinda put up with it. My therapy had been going pretty well and my self worth and confidence grew a bunch so I plucked up the courage and left. No one cared which was expected however I thought my oldest friend would have asked why I left. We haven’t spoken since I left which has been kinda rough. She and I have been through everything together and I know her as if she was my other half, but she made it insanely obvious I didn’t mean squat to her.

A weekish after I left the group I found a few guys on Among Us and we hit it off. We used to talk everyday for months but recently they ghosted me. The other day they accidentally shared a secret VC on the Discord that said “No *my name* allowed” and tried to play it off as a joke but I got the message and left. I literally have no idea what I’d done to make them not want to be my friend and again I was pretty heart broken. 

I don’t know if it’s my personality or the state of my mental health but these events have hit me really really hard. I thought I was a nice person and an interesting girl but I’ve beginning to think that I’m just not that important to anyone. I hate this feeling because I’ve been working so hard on my confidence and self worth, but I feel like I’m back to square 1 with no one around to help or support me. 

I’m trying my hardest to stay positive. I get to go back to university next year so hopefully I’ll be able to make friends, but I’m really insecure they’ll drop me or make me feeling worthless and unwanted like my other friend groups have. I feel like it’s obvious there’s something wrong with me because this has always happened to me, throughout all of my schooling years. I just want someone to tell me what’s wrong with me so I can work on it and never have this happen again."
1012,Feeling a weird pit in my heart,"Recently I have been struggling to feel sane. Not from just the recent changes but from everything in life. I’ve always hated myself and felt out of place with others. I have been out of a mentally abusing relationship but can’t seem to shake away the feeling of needing someone... anyone... I’m honestly losing my mind and have little to no one to tell about my problems as I feel like I’m a bother or they will tell me to suck it up. I feel like my whole life is a fabrication of something I’m not and can’t seem to be able to shake the thought of being the only odd ball. I’m taking meds but still I feel like spending the rest of my life like this isn’t worth it. I know I shouldn’t be like this and should be thankful for my life... but honestly I wish I was dead everyday. Nothing can change that, I barely can think of something I like about me and hesitate to even try to express why I carry so much weight on my shoulders. If anyone else is feeling this way, I just would like to know and have some support. I’m feeling really lost right now and pathetic. I thought I could share this here and feel better saying this to the void than my therapist... sorry"
1013,I feel like I don’t deserve to live,[removed]
1014,I just had some kind of episode,"I think it was a psychotic or dissociative episode, but I’m not sure. I was panicking because I nothing felt familiar, then I started panicking even more because I didn’t understand what thinking was for some reason. When I looked in the mirror I could hardly recognize myself, and I looked liked I’d lost it. I also felt like I was suffocating when I showed in hot water, so I took a cold shower. I’ve been constantly depressed for over two years. Although ever since I attempted to kill myself (5 months ago) I haven’t felt much of anything. 

Back when I self harmed this happening to me sometimes, but it wasn’t as severe. 

Idk what to do. I think this is a pretty significant sign of mental decline. Maybe I just got high somehow?"
1015,I wish I could afford a therapist,"I have so many different symptoms of different things and getting diagnosed and maybe some medication would be so nice. I guarantee I have ADHD it runs in my family and I absolutely cannot get anything done because I start doing the dishes and then realize that while I’m picking up cups there’s also garbage to pick up and then I see clothes on the floor but before that I should start laundry and so on until I get so frustrated because nothing got done in the 4 hours I was running around trying to get things done. Then I just lay in bed and I don’t want to do anything because every time I try I just waist time and energy. 

I’m also so bad with money and I always just say “oh it’s only $5 i can make that back quickly” and then I do that 50 times until I’m broke and then go into a depressive episode again. 

I always put off going to work(Uber eats) until 5 days before my bills are due then I have panic attacks and breakdowns because I’m not going to make enough money before my bills are due. And then I often go on shopping sprees for things I absolutely don’t need. even tho I know I have bills coming up and I spend $200 and then fall back into a depression episode again. 

I get really obsessive over one thing for a month and that’s the only thing I can think about for that entire time and then I get bored and don’t think about it again until several months later. Crafts, games, health, animals,my career. All categories of things I have been obsessed over several times. I always feel like I have to learn absolutely everything about current obsession and become a master in that skill or I get bored. 

I have 2 kids and a boyfriend and I know my boyfriend gets really frustrated with me especially about money and I really want to do better but I have tried so hard and so many different things and I just can’t it seems impossible. I’m terrible at thinking ahead. 
 my insurance doesn’t cover therapy and there’s no way I can afford or make myself save enough money to see a therapist and get medication 

Don’t even get me started on my childhood. 

Everything seems impossible right now"
1016,I slept for 14 hours last night then took a 4 hour nap,"Something incredibly strange is happening today, I went to sleep last night at around 12am. That is pretty normal for me, but I woke up at 2pm today which is the latest I've ever woken up. I was awake for a couple of hours then I started watching Netflix on my couch and fell asleep around 7pm, I woke up at 12am. I don't understand how I could have only been awake for 5 hours today. Someone, please help 😢"
1017,I think my dad is mentally abusive and I don't know what to do...,"Hi... I'm 14 and I believe my dad is mentally abusive. When I was younger I believed it was normal and that whenever he got on to me it was always my fault. Now that I've grown and finally gained healthy friendships after years, I realized the way he treats me isn't normal but I question my theories and feelings a lot on it. I've only just started noticing warning signs and so I don't know a whole lot about abuse but I think he's a gaslighter, manipulative, threatening, guilt trippy, and other things along with it. 

I don't know how to handle this other than defend myself whenever he says things that hurt me which only makes the conversation worse. I love my dad but I don't like how he treats me.. Because I have abandonment issues with my mother I don't want to lose him. I feel like calling CPS may help me, but also may cause more issues. I don't want them to take him away because I need him and love him, but if they did I wouldn't have to go through so much stress from him. If they did investigate and they didn't do anything, that would make him angry at me for overreacting and almost getting him in bad legal trouble.

 I don't know what to do about him. I hate his behavior, but I don't want him to leave me. Any advice?"
1018,I don't think I can be honest with how I feel without being plied by booze.,"So after my mother's death, I feel mentally fine (like i won't kill myself or anything like that) but when I drink I feel like all my emotions spill out, (I still don't feel suicidal because, despite my lack of self-worth, I feel I haven't earned the right to die) within this feeling I feel a whole host of negative emotions and I wish that I could be honest with how I feel, but I don't want to burden others with my emotions, nor do I want others to take my situation too heavily into account,as an example, my family asked what I want for Christmas and I struggle to answer so I tell them ""nothing"", I want to feel ""OK"" or ""normal"" without booze being a buffer for my negativity but I'm unsure how, please help."
1019,Just venting some thoughts.,"Not really asking anything. Just venting alittle bit. If you have personal religious beliefs please keep scrolling. TW suicide thoughts.

I think its unfair that people make others feel guilty for wanting to commit suicide. One person loves me so all of a sudden I have to live the rest of my life knowing how completely useless I am. I have no one to talk to other than my husband and he's great don't get me wrong. Literally the only reason to stay but does that mean I still have to live? Because ONE person loves me. Its not fair. Everytime I'm alone (which is alot as he works) i cry. There aren't any lady friends to hang with. I'm weird and socialy inadequate. I don't work thanks covid and when I did I got berated by customers daily for simply doing my job. People are aweful and not worth sticking around for so why should I because ONE person loves me. Its not like he couldn't or wouldn't move on. I know he would and be fine. Why should I be stuck here in pain and hating myself like this? I can't even bring myself to care for my house my pets much less myself. I cook for him and thats it. He does most cleaning. I just lay in bed crying all the time. I'm pathetic and shouldn't be forced to live knowing I'm this useless. I should be allowed to go through some process that ends with me taking the dirt nap. Not forced to lay here day in and day out knowing how absolutely worthless I am."
1020,emotions,"for the past months i’ve felt no emotions besides anger and sadness, i don’t even feel love for my family and friends and that scares me. is this depression? my mind is killing me and i genuinely don’t know what to i feel so pathetic. i could see someone i know i love complain about being in pain or i could hear sad news and almost brush it off, when only in the beginning of this year i would’ve showed emotions."
1021,What seasonal affective disorder therapy light do you recommend under 100 USD?,What seasonal affective disorder therapy light do you recommend under 100 USD?
1022,I constantly wonder what's wrong with me...,"I literally couldnt tell you exactly how i feel if I tried, but here's me trying.. I always find myself googling schizophrenia or sociopath etc. tests to see what's wrong with me, if anything. I'm a 20 year old Male.
  If I am ever in a room with others, be it with a few others or many others, I feel like I can hear a conversation next to me, and it is 1. Always about me, and 2. Usually very negative.  One time I heard an entire party telling me I should kill myself, after I had just spilled a drink on the ground that broke, after which I had immediately cleaned it up. When i play a game in a room with friends, it feels like everyone is talking about me playing. Almost like my thoughts are imagining the worst things everyone could be saying about me, but it sounds and feels very real. I'm usually very good at telling myself ""that's probably not what they're talking about get over it"" but once in a blue moon, I dont even get to make this realization. 

In addition to this, I'm always... ALWAYS, wondering what I'm doing, looks like to the people around me's perspective. How I look, if my face is doing anything weird, if I smell bad, if I said anything wrong, even though I'm always very very careful about saying the right things...

 Another thing that kills me, is I have this very heavy, recurring thought that something is wrong with me, and I'm the only one she doesn't see it. Like people always tell me ""you're just so nice... You're such a good guy...  You're a sweetheart...for the things going on with you, you always radiate positive energy"".... these are literally the things I strive for every day, and are really mostly habit. But when I'm told these things, I don't believe them. Even coming from trustworthy people. And also, it seems like a last stand compliment. Like ""this is the only good thing about you, so let me stress to you how nice you are"". It just makes me wonder if I'm supremely annoying, or boring, or even ugly, or sometimes I wonder if I have autism. And it really just feels like no one will tell me that theres something wrong with me. Yet... I feel pretty normal half the time too? Like I have normal conversations(50% of the time I'm very socially anxious, but the other 50, I'm like an extreme extrovert that isnt scared to talk to anyone), have normal friends...
  I guess I just dont understand what's wrong with my head for doing all of these things, but if I do have some kind of mental illness, why isnt it apparent? Why dont I know for sure if I do or not? Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read if you did."
1023,I think I’m going crazy but I shouldn’t be,"I apologize in advance for the terrible way that this is written but i wanted to get everything off my chest. 

I feel terribly alone but I’ve made myself lonely. I’ve withdrawn from everyone close to me except my girlfriend. This has been going on for years. My family isn’t bad, growing up and still til this day my parents fight a lot and my mom has her own problems. However, they are worried about me and I know that they really want to help but I haven’t really given them the extent of my problems because we aren’t close. I’m not really close with anyone because I don’t want to be or never wanted to be and I’m not sure why. I feel like I’ve been depressed for a long time now and my family has become aware of it more and more. But now every time I need to just talk to someone because I feel down they think I’m gonna go a kill myself. I have terrible trust issues that I feel like a gonna ruin my only close relationship right now but she swears she’d never do anything bad to me and that she loves me. I’ve had some mental episodes and she’s been patient with me. But now I feel like I’ve gonna mad. I’m completely irrational and I’m not sure why. I feel lost. I feel like I have lost or I am just continuing to make the same mistakes. I just have these gut feelings, I guess and I even try talking to my dog because I think she might understand. I don’t know what’s happening or why it’s happening. Last night I drank after taking adderall and then smoked pot. This lead me to have a very bizarre feeling that I can’t even explain but all I wanted to do was leave I just felt like I had to leave and that was the right decision to do. Obviously my gf would not let me leave but today I couldn’t do anything. I drove around aimlessly. I have finals coming up and I didn’t study at all I can’t focus on anything. I’ve broken down multiple times. I have problems overthinking but I feel like I’m right and I can’t shake that. So now I feel like I can’t trust myself anymore. For months I’ve just joked about suicide to myself, like I just think it to myself a lot  that I could just end it. I’ve gotten better but I still can’t shake it. I don’t think that I could because I know that it would hurt my family and my friends. They don’t deserve that but I’m having a very rough time. I’m obsessive and insecure about everything. I’ve never seen myself as growing old. It’s hard to talk to anyone about these things because it feels too serious. I tried reaching out to my sister but I just couldn’t disrupt her day with how I’m feeling. I try to drop hints to my friends but it just kind of gets written off as a joke. I don’t push it either I let it get written off as a joke because nobody talks like this. Nobody says anything like this. 

I’m really just looking for help to understand my problems. Writing this post has calmed me some and helped bring into reality that maybe it isn’t that serious. It could all definitely be worse. 
If anyone actually read all of this, thank you. Once again I’m sorry for the mess that was that paragraph but I did say I was going crazy. I understand that I need therapy but money is tight right now."
1024,Why must I continue this stupid fate?,Ugh everytime a door opens it slams in my face. I know that there's something wrong with me but I can't pinpoint it. I don't have enough for a counselor. If I talk about it people get annoyed and/or treat me differently. I know I'm a subpar human being I am just frustrated. People say don't be so hard on yourself and then they give up on me. I just needed to get this off my chest.
1025,Please help me I'm struggling.,"I'm in my first year of high school and I'm falling behind. I have tons of missing assignments, and its causing me to be depressed all the time and making me hate my self. Especially since I spend all my time when I'm not in online class doing homework, from when school ends at 2 (I usually start working  at 3) till about 11:00 at night(I usually go to bed around 2 or 3 so i can have a few hours with out homework and enjoy my self.) . I have very bad ADHD that was only diagnosed last year. I started taking adderall about this time last year and that helped in the begging but now it has no affect on me. My main problems are I can not focus, I get distracted extremely easily( out of those 9 or 10 hours a day I spend about 2 or 3 just looking up random stuff on google or watching YouTube while I'm supposed to be doing homework), I have to give my Mom my phone all day or else I just waste my time on it. Please I'm begging anyone who can help me figure out a way to focus please comment... Please."

Yet because I fucking act happy and force myself to do shit i’m all fucking fine now. Everyday I think just how wonderful it would be to not be fucking alive anymore but just because i’m not as open about that like my fucking brother is I’m seen as fine and happy and dandy.

1029,i wish. (nsfw i think.. tw),"i wish he could embrace me. i wish he gave me the attention he gives to his cat. i wish he loved me more than the characters he mains.. the ones he is bias towards, and absolutely loves... i will never be enough... i wish he would maybe take the initiative maybe just once when it comes to sexting... i wish i was good enough to truly be loved by anyone.

i love him. i love his cat. i support him. i play video games with him. i try my best to be the most attractive person possible... yet i always have anxiety that he's fucking with some girl who's 10 times better than me in every way... or maybe a man. none of this is his fault... he's a sweetheart. i am so delusional... 

it's my fault... maybe..
he probably barely gets turned on by me.
he probably secretly hates me.
he probably thinks i'm fat and ugly.
he probably will break my heart while i'm most vulnerable..
he probably won't care internally if i starve myself..
he probably isnt even real...
he probably sees prettier girls all the time...
he probably doesn't even want to hang out with me.
he probably hates me.

i am the worst girlfriend. i cant even blame him if he does any of those things... im the type of girl to make straight guys gay... sorry if that sounds disrespectful. i just couldnt find a better way to word it. 
he listens to me complain so much, and he asks for me to never hide my feelings and be honest with him. 
he's a great person. i feel absolutely wretched...
i am losing affection.. words mean something, but eventually they start to blend together... will it be better when we meet up? 
does he even feel a thing when i tell him how badly i want to commit a brutal suicide? would he be hurt if i did?
i just cant say these things to him... i cant break his heart like this. why am i such a delusional fucking idiot..? 

maybe it'd just be better if i cut contact.. i'd tell him i need a lot of time alone... then just kill myself... maybe he'd find out one day. should i do it..? no... but will i..? maybe... one day...
the answer to all my problems... either suicide, or... ana. 
i have to keep going... its been nearly 2 days of starvation... i did this once before and i can again. maybe i can cut myself a little too, just to take my mind off my stomach's weak cries... you'll be okay, my dearest... soon, my body will enter starvation mode, as it has before... you will eat, but not fresh food... i'm sorry... it has to be done. i am sorry, to my confused body... i have tortured you beyond belief."
1030,Sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who never really wanted to live?,"I don't feel like therapists understand. I don't think that life is all that great. It sucked from elementary school to middle school, high school, college, and work life. It felt like pointless work. I know people who suffered from depression, but they seem to have better and worse days and hope that it gets better. ""Getting better"" is an abstract thing that makes no sense to me. It sounds like esoteric ramble, or like church on sunday, empty words. What is it even supposed to mean? Am I the only one who feels this way? I live because I don't want to bother my family with my problems, that's it."

I am an average sized male (5ft9in 145lbs) and always have been Ever since I can remember this happens to me occasionally maybe every few weeks or so. This first time I remember it happening I was about 5 years old. I am 20 now and it randomly happens to me. Basically what happens is I close my eyes and I for some reason feel like I have grown to be the entire size of the room. It is a very uncomfortable and unsettling feeling that keeps me awake. I feel as though I’m only a few inches away from the ceiling and walls and that I almost perfectly fill up the entire room. Not as though the room shrinks but I grow very big. I do not like this feeling and I am wondering if this is some kind of mental condition or what could possibly cause this if anyone knows anything about my situation at all. This is a serious post.
1034,I'm confused,"Should I cut off people from my life because I risk hurting them?
Should I live a lonely life because of my problems that are difficult to manage for other people?

It sounds so stupid but it just feels like there's something wrong with me and I was supposed to be left handed but I ended up not being and It just feels so wrong. 

I hate it so much I want to break my right hand just so I'm forced to use my left more often because I feel like that's the way it was supposed to be. And I know it sound stupid but I cant help it."
1037,How to stop dealing with traumatic nightmares,"Every once in a while I encounter a traumatic nightmare. Instead of your usual nightmare with monsters or demons, these nightmares have my stepmother or father verbally abusing me. (The dreams are similar to the memories maybe even a bit worse, but do not exactly mimic past scenes)



I wish I could have normal nightmares like other people (I actually wouldn't mind having a nightmare about I.T, Freddy Kreuger, Jeff the Killer, Teke Teke, etc)



Atleast when I wake up I would know its not real and feel happy because I went on an adventure, instead of getting negative thoughts and reminding me of bad memories from my past.



These nightmares make me quit sleeping for the night (even once I woke up in 1 AM, but didn't go back to bed.) Also today I feel like I don't want to sleep (which is something I can pull off for a few hours but is very unhealthy.)



TL;DR: I have nightmares from traumatic memories. I hate it. These nightmares make me stop sleeping and even today, make me not want to go sleep."
1038,im feeling lonely,"i know it cant be helped since the pandemic started and all, but i also started living in japan, where physical affection is practically non existent unless you have an SO, its been 2 years since i moved here and i wasnt feeling especially lonely or sad up until now, i thought i was doing OK but i guess my cuddling tank is empty now. before japan i lived in Colombia, where ppl are very sociable and physically affectionate, and i was used to that. I know i cant do anything to change this situation...."
1039,(Tw) how do I know if I have an eating disorder or may get one?,"I hate how I look and want to lose weight but I wouldn’t change myself completely just want to be more skinnier. I’ve skipped meals and felt bad eating certain things etc. I try not to do this. I don’t want one but I think I’m near that mindset or in a possibly unstable mindset. 
Due to my health when I’m able to exercise I sometimes exercise for quite  a while because I feel like I need it. 
I want to be healthy and lose a bit of weight so I can feel better but I’m worried I might have/get an Ed. 
I noticed I was getting triggered when I heard something about someone with anorexia. 
Is this me possibly getting one or just me worrying about my self esteem."
1040,I may sound dumb but hear me out,"i don’t feel human, like, im not a furry or a weirdo, but I doubt I’m human. I have synesthesia, which may play into it, but I just sometimes feel like I’m an imposter on earth, like I’m not from this planet"
1041,Is there anyone I can message. I just need some hope and encouragement. I am really down.,I just need to believe that this will go. I am exhausted and so so sad.
1042,MBTI might have caused my eating disorder,"I feel as though one factor in my eating disorder is the hypothesis that certain MBTI types are more likely than others to be underweight. The “cool” types like INTP, INTJ and ENTP think a lot (which burns calories) and also have a tendency to accidentally skip meals, making them unintentionally loose a lot of weight. So it gave me the notion that in order to look intelligent and in order to look more “INTP”, then I have to be really skinny."
1043,Don't know what to do,"My sister (8) has gained a lot of weight over the last year and that's due to inactivity and a bad diet. I talk to my mother a lot about how she should stop giving her so much junk food, let her play outside instead of at the computer and let her drink water instead of ONLY juice. She just screams at me and acts like I'm a bad person/want to insult her for saying this. 

I myself was fat growing up for the same reasons as my sister and had body image issues and an eating disorder as a young teenager (17 now). I don't want my sister to go down that route and it saddens me even more because she isn't in control of what she eats. My parents are both obese and I have talked multiple times with them about how I don't want them to die early and even laid out weight loss and training plans for them ( both ignored/made fun of)

I am very passionate about excersise and diet and I train everyday ( Martial Arts and Weight Lifting). 

I'm just sick and tired of living in this enviroment where fighting an screaming takes place all day and everyone is living unhealthy. I'd rather just focus on overcoming my traumatic past (which is also made fun of or brought into Arguments against me) and get over the death of 2 Friends of mine this year."
1044,I might have some issues,"It's a bit difficult for me to describe myself but i'll try to make it as clear as possible (i don't speak english very well but i still understand people speaking it) 

I've been a quiet kid since the first grade and since then i have difficulties making friend, i feel anxious meeting and talking to a stranger, i've been fighting my anxiety by forcing myself to come to a group that i've never meet or talk before, but at the end, something just doesn't feel right, it's more than awkward, and i have this feeling that makes me feels that those people doesn't like me, and i won't fit into their community, i feel exiled from society. 

My parents and my family won't help me, and i dont think they even understand my problem, they brought me to a doctor once and the doctor gave me some antidepressant, but nothing changed, we never come back and i still have my problem, i even tried to overdose myself from those drugs they gave me, but all i feel was this extremely painful headace. I still getting haunted by these thoughts of what people thinks of me and i just can't help but submit to those thoughts. 

I play some games but i just can't bring myself to use the voice chat, i type quite fast so i used the text chat all the time, i even joined a game on discord just to use the in game text chat, one time a group forced me to speak and i can only utter a few words, i feel something is holding me back, i think carefully of what i'm about to say just to stutter trying to say it.

I need some suggestions on what i should do to not feel these feelings and thoughts."

1046,"I keep remembering the good times and discussions with my ex every time I go around something that we did together , how can I make it stop ?"," I don't know if this is a traume, or flash backs, or whatever, I just know it makes my life hell. Every time I do something that I used to do when I was with my ex , it brings me back memories about her and plunges me into depression. It's really taking a toll on me and I don't know how to make it stop, I try to not think of it but I can't be always on guard.

1047,Does anyone know what this is,"Im a 23 year old male and recently been going through a weird time the last month

I feel like im putting pressure on remembering past events which i cant do clearly. I then get overly stressed about this which can lead too panic attacks. I can remember events happening but details about conversations seem foggy.

I also feel like my sound and sight have also become foggy. I can hear and see things but it doesnt feel like im taking it in. It feels similar to when i used to get migraines and that kind of brain fog but no aura or actual migraine symptoms.

Any ideas would be appreciated!"
1048,Dealing with a 21 year old drug addict who happens to be my sister.,"I've been walking back and forth with my phone in my hand, wondering whether or not to post this, I'm not sure if it even fits in with the sub rules.

The situation is long and very complex, I'm basically going to do a huge TLDR instead of writing it all out.

My sister is 21, and for 2 years has been addicted to cocaine, alcohol, crack cocaine and ketamine. She's always been really successful ever since leaving school, the addiction problems started after she met her boyfriend.

So basically we've had several interventions, she says she's stopped, now she spends 95% of her time at her boyfriend (who i know does drugs but family don't know and I feel like I can't tell anyone), my mum thinks she's sobor and just drinking.

Since I used to take the odd thing when I went out as a teen, I know the symptoms of drug use (staying up all night, sleeping all day, chattering teeth, shakes, eyes etc) and I can tell she is still doing it on the weekend and presumably during the week too. 

Its having such a huge effect on my mental health, I'm not sleeping or eating properly, constantly worried about her. Constantly thinking she's doing stuff, feel like driving round to her boyfriends house and driving a brick through his skull. 

Don't even know what to do anymore. If anyone has some coping advice or has been through anything similar, id appreciate it"
1049,Why do people who are raped kill themselves?,"I mean, it's not like they have a terminal illness, why would something that happened years ago cause them to kill themselves? Why couldn't they just find work or something like that? If they did work they wouldn't have time to think about how they got raped years ago. Some people are literally dying of cancer but don't kill themselves."
1050,No sense of self,"So, ever since I was 13 or 12 (I'm 17 now), I've had an identity crisis of some sort. I've not known who I am, what I like, what my style is, what my spiritual beliefs are etc. And from the ages of 12 to 16 I've tried to use those look like person x subliminals that are on youtube. I was obsessed with trying to look like countless of celebrities, like Ariana Grande, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. I changed my spiritual beliefs and style/aesthetic all the time. And I kind of felt like if I liked anime, I had to dress and act in a certain way, that I couldn't dress emo and like anime and classical music, you know? My identity issues are still there, but I've stopped using those subliminals and trying to look like someone else, which is a big step. But I still feel like I'm trying to fit in a ""mould"" and that I'm changing aesthetics, career paths, values often. Like I've gone from wanting a whole-body suit of tattoos to not wanting any at all. And I don't know that to do, I've read on BPD and bipolar disorder, but the descriptions don't fit me. I think that my emotions are in check. Any advice on what I should do?"

1052,Delusional Thoughts &amp; Seeing A Doctor,"I experience delusional thoughts a lot, and often look at suicide as the only real solution to my problems.

As an example for delusions, I often believe that I’m the sole person on the planet and the entire reality around my exists only to torture me and keep me in this prison. As such I look at nearly every person as a threat, every person as someone to be cautious of. This solely excludes my best friend whom I trust, but at times I even feel he is “In on it”. This has been problematic until this weekend where it has reached a whole new level.

With stuff like this, I want to see a doctor because I feel like I’m an immediate threat to myself which I haven’t felt for a long time. But I also don’t want to be sectioned. Will I be? I’m in the U.K."
1053,"People who suffer from anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc, what are your favourite quotes?","I wasn't sure where to post, but I figured this would be an okay sub.

I have a friend who suffers with bad mental health and the things I mentioned in the title, and she finds quotes and the like helpful and just generally likes them. I want to make her a book of quotes/short writings as a gift. I want it to be something she can open whenever she feels down to pick herself back up and cheer her up, even just a little bit. 

I know some people aren't the biggest fan of quotes/don't find them helpful, but I would really appreciate it if some of you could tell me some that make you happy and help you through hard times.

Thank you!!"
1054,How could I regain my motivation to do things?,
1055,Why does Reddit attack and belittle people who are seeking advice to genuinely work on their flaws or improve their ways? It feels awful.,"I have a few mental illnesses and a personality disorder, and I honestly can't function and socialise properly. I really am working on it, but it's so hard and sometimes (most of the time, to be honest) I do slip and fall. 

It was one of those days today, and I posted about how I feel about a current situation. I wasn't seeking sympathy or anything, I'm honestly just trying to improve how I react to my emotions. I know I'm not doing what I should, I know that my thoughts and feelings about it are irrational and wrong. I know that I'm being immature. That's literally why I wanted help. I've been feeling confused and sad and I needed insight. 

Someone read my post and DMed me a lot of horrible things. Like, about 10 paragraphs. They mocked me, insulted me, called me names, and they made a lot of terrible assumptions about me. They don't know anything about me other than my post, but they were so quick to call me so many hurtful things. It just felt so... shitty. While reading their messages I started to feel suffocated and then I couldn't breathe for a few seconds. I feel a hundred times worse than I did before seeking advice. I feel really bad, really defeated and hated. I've been really lonely anyway, but even strangers who barely know me despise me enough to go on a rant against me and be so hurtful."

1057,"Can someone have an ED without ""wanting to be skinny""","I am pretty uneducated about eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia. But for all I know I have always been skinny, ""too skinny"" in fact. I always told people it wasn't because I had an eating disorder and I actually wanted to have a higher BMI.

 Recently though I realized I never had an apetite, always ate so little of my plate, eating was more of a burden, something I needed to do because I had to. Whenever we went outside to eat I would always share my food because I couldn't eat anymore. All of these look like I have an eating problem but the problem is I never had the ""mental"" part of it which is wanting to achieve something."
1058,Two Obvious Words that Instantly Changed My Mental Health,"Here's something I wrote for hypersensitive dreamer souls out there.  

""On my worst days as a person with mental health issues, simple words and letters have stabbed me. The saying 'the pen is a sword' took on a whole new meaning. I also had the hypersensitivity of a touch-me-not. Just like the plant, I anticipated that a slight friction (in my case, some interactions slightly pricklier than pure silk) was a whack going to harm or destroy me.

1060,i'm just getting more and more depressed and i have to lie through my teeth to make everyone think i'm okay,"it's just getting harder. i don't know what to do. yesterday i cried for probably almost an hour, alone in the shed. i don't feel like i can talk to anybody. i wish i could talk to my wife, but this whole thing is about her, and whenever i'm upset about something that has to do with her, it makes her more upset. i understand, she just hates thinking that she hurt me in any way. but SHE isn't hurting me, her illness is. she said she wants to go to the hospital just so she doesn't have to be around me so she doesn't keep dragging me down. she's so, so depressed, and we're getting close to the one year mark of her last suicide attempt that was very traumatic for me. i keep having intrusive thoughts about what she could do to herself. i know she doesn't want to kill herself, she's told me multiple times. that's the real her coming through. but when she feels so bad, she just wants it to end. i'm so in love with her and it's just hurting me to see her go through all this. she's just losing more weight and it's so painful to see pictures of her a year ago and seeing her now. her spine and ribs and hips are visible and her arms and legs are so thin and i can feel her joints through her skin because she has just no fat and no muscle and she's so weak now. she just can't eat. most of the time even looking at food makes her nauseous. she doesn't want this. she wants to be better but she's so exhausted and she wants to give up so bad. she feels like she's made so little progress but i've seen her grow just in the past year and it's been incredible. i don't know what it is, but she has to be delusional. she just can't believe that she's done any better or that she's safe in her housing (my parents fucking love her) and she doesn't trust anyone. she has bpd so i get the trust issue, but i don't get why she doesn't see how much progress she's really made. i can't let her see me like this. if she sees me like this then she'll feel horrible. but she hasn't done a single thing wrong, it's just tearing me up to see her suffer. i'm scared she's going to attempt again. i can't handle that. she thinks she's going to suffer for the rest of her life but she's not. i know she's not. i don't want to lose her. she thinks i'd be better off if she was gone, but if she died, my life would be over. i don't see a future without her. i see myself in bed, crying, never eating, never leaving the house, never doing anything ever again until i die, whether that be via myself or withering away alone. my dreams and aspirations would be crushed. i wouldn't care about anything anymore. everywhere i look, there's something to remind me of her. she loved this song, she loved this hobby, she loved this game, she loved that color, she loved that food, our pictures together, our pets. i can't help but cry just writing this. why can't i just make her better? why can't i just rip the fat off of my body and give it to her? i'm scared that i'm going to wake up and find her body. if her last attempt worked, i would have woken up next to her in the morning. she didn't write a note. i wouldn't have even been able to say goodbye to her. i don't even know what that would have done to me. feeling like i need to go to the shed again to cry. i don't want anyone to see me. my day has barely started and i feel horrible."

Like clean, give her presents and food she likes.

1062,I think i'm depressed,"For quite a while now i've been having a real struggle to try to accomplish anything, to focus and concentrate on things and getting very stressed and anxious. I'm in a constant state of feeling like i want to burst in to tears and i don't know why. I have always struggled with self-belief or worthiness but when i was younger i felt more strong in fighting it out, i felt stronger. The more i grow older the more i'm losing my inner strength and willingness to fight, to do, to try. 

My latest attempt in pushing myself was to return to school to study but i just can't get engaged in it. I cannot retain any information and when i'm trying to work on assignments my brain just blanks out. I know i'm capable and this is frustrating me so much more. I just don't know what to do, i'm so hopeless. To make things worse i clashed with one of the lecturers and it put my confidence down a huge lot and i just cannot shake it off. I'm dreading having more lectures with this guy. 

I just don't know what to do with myself, i feel like i'm turning into a potato. Nothing makes me happy, nothing makes me laugh, i cannot find any glimpse of positivity. And this whole thing with going back to school is just making me feel so much worse because i feel i'm letting so many people down and i'm proving right all the assholes in my life that think that i'm useless. I just don't know what to do."
1063,Should I go on meds?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post and Ill try to keep it short.

Im 25 y female, and almost 4 months ago I went through a horrible breakup of a 4 year relationship where I was thrown out of our apartment (because i texted another guy, I admit my fault and regret) , I moved 3 times ever since, and the hard part is that I live in his hometown where I have no friends or family, only my job  (which is good).
So I moved  into different apartments by myself, got infected with COVID and had to isolate myself, my family was also infected and sick in another country and in the meantime my grandma and grandpa died.
I got notified that I will lose my job soon, and that was also a huge stressor for me.
I managed to find even better job, but Im so anxious.
Everything is seemingly okay now, I bought a car, I rented an apartment with a roomate, I have a good job, things are settling down but why do I feel worse?

I feel like I was doing better while everything was going on, I was sad and grieving the loss of my boyfriend, his family(who I was very close with), the death of my grandparents, and loss of my job, but I was handling it one by one.

And now that the things have settled, I feel hopeless. I have trouble sleeping, I wake up in the middle of the night, I have horrible intrusive thoughts, even suicidal (more like how I would like to be dead, but not doing anything about it), I cant calm down my brain, its torturing me. Feelings of guilt, regret, despair, sadness, hopelessness.. I feel like Im falling into situational depression and I dont know what to do.

I wake up, put some makeup on, dress up, go to work, used to go the gym, and tried to fill my days, but now everything is closed due to COVID and I feel like im falling deeper down. Im like a dark cloud of negative energy. Everyone says that Im coping so well but I feel like I'm slowly dying off. I dont want to bother people with my problems anymore because its been 4 months and I feel they will get tired of me. Anxiety got the best of me. I feel like I will lose everyone around me, that I will be bad at new job, etc etc. I cant stop it.

I go to therapy, and I didnt take any meds in the meantime, not even when my grandparents died, I somehow survived it. But now that its all settled, I cant seem to cope and move on.

Is this normal? Am I falling into clinical depression? Should I reach out for some AD? Im really scared of the future.

Thank you so so much💕"

1069,"I was trafficked. TW: sexual assault, human trafficking, blood, suicide.","I was a minor when I was kidnapped and sex trafficked. My adolescence was stripped from me to the point I can’t even remember half of my life but I guess that’s just a trauma response. Apart from this I’ve come along way since these events; I had my first child at 21, graduated high school shortly after and have been working towards my diploma to work with children and youth. All I want is to help people even though it’s so hard for me to help myself, and what happened to me is currently happening to others. 

You can’t hear them, so I hope you will listen to me. 

There’s so many pieces to my story but I’ll try my best to narrow it down. I was a quiet girl, I had my own issues aside from this because I was bullied, struggled with academics due to having ADD, severe anxiety and depression. I was still content with myself. I wasn’t into smoking, drinking or sex. I hoped for companionships with likeminded people and thankfully I kept a small circle that accepted and supported me. 

A few months before I was trafficked, I was in my first relationship, so overwhelmed with emotions. A few months in I had lost my virginity to him. He pressured me but curiosity and my feelings got the best of me. It was heart breaking as he was the first person I was vulnerable with and he took advantage of me, giving me a false narrative of his feelings when this was all so new to me.  

I carried on with my life, I was still a high school student, looking for a job and being a “normal” teenager. I chose a bad day to go to the mall to hand out my resumes because had I known I wouldn’t make it home that night, I would of stayed home. I had no idea what was in store for me. I was taken by two girls in broad daylight, stripped down naked in the mall bathroom stall out of my varsity jacket and denim jeans into a mini skirt and corset. Painting my pale skin with bronzer, my lips are now fuschia pink and I look unwell. This all felt so planned out on their end, I was in a state of disbelief this was even occurring. They had thrown into an underground taxi and they brought me to their home. 

I was locked in a room for hours, being forced to watch them eat when I was starving, forced to take drugs and let them tell me I’m a worthless human being. They broke me. They pinned me to the bed and took advantage of me and took away my glasses. I am visually impaired and cannot cope without them. They had taken explicit pictures of me, forcing my clothes off and ripping my tampon out. I had no idea what was going on as I couldn’t see. Little did I know they were sending these pictures to Johns. 

I was being put up on the market like food for horny, old men to pick and choose from. Quickly after, I was in the home of a man 3 times my age. Despite my age, it didn’t stop him from sexually assaulting me. I said no, I did everything everyone taught me about consent and it still didn’t save me. 

He had returned me to them, limping in pain, legs full of period blood, rashes all over my face, body and $500 in my bra. Them telling me I hadn’t made enough money for them and I wasn’t allowed to leave until I made them the desired amount or they would slit my throat. I begged them and before I could clean myself up they had put me in another car to visit another John. 

I had to escape, even though it could cause me my life, I had to get out. I was beyond broken at this point. This man was even older than the last, but he wasn’t as aggressive. He was welcoming and kind but I had no trust in me to even hope for his sympathy. 

He did something right, he asked how old I was. I couldn’t hold it together even though the girls threatened to come for me if I screwed this up for them. He helped me escape in a drop of the hat. He put me in a taxi, I ran as far as I could to seek shelter and help. 

I ended up at a building and I banged on every apartment door begging someone to help me. I’ll forever be grateful for the people who came to my saving and helped me contact my family. 

I had contacted the police and my life has never been the same since. Years upon years of court, I was finally dismissed from court March 2020 for charging my rapist because he was legally allowed to appeal, this incident occurred 2012. As much as I’m thankful that’s over, I don’t have my justice. 

Life as of now I still don’t feel safe, not when there’s no protection order in place but apparently there’s nothing left to be done. Recently, I had moved into a new apartment and I come to find out one of my kidnappers lives here and on my floor. Small world right. She’s a parent now and I am forced to see her every single day. No one wants to help me, not the police or management. I don’t think anyone understands how damaging this is. They just say “I don’t know how you do it” I have no other choice, I can’t afford to live anywhere else. This is supposed to be a safe space for me and my child. 

If that isn’t bad enough, the girl who was in charge of this sex ring is now extremely involved at my college. She is a public speaker and a writer. If that isn’t bad enough I was completely floored when I found out she published a book this year talking about growth and prosperity. All I can think of is why does she deserve a platform to inspire people when she worked so hard to take my life away from me. Someone who had no remorse for what she did to me, she gets to live a fulfilling, successful life? 

Something that I’ve always wanted to do was write a book about my life. I love art and expressing myself through what I’ve gone through. But I’m struggling, every single day. I’ve dropped out of college four times because I’m so anxious. Doctors have prescribed me drug after drug but it lead me to attempting suicide in 2014, wait lists for Councilling are years and I can’t afford therapy anymore. I am a single parent to a special needs child, so he is always at the top of my priority list. I deserve my voice to be heard when it’s been silenced for so long, I just don’t know how. 

I deserve to be heard more than she ever will but why do I feel guilty that I’m wishing for their downfall. I just feel like they’re winning, when they’ve disabled me from my dreams. I hate being a empathetic sometimes. 

If you took the time to read this, thank you. I have gone through far more than this page could even hold with words and my story is still incomplete. I am grateful to have my family, being a mother and anyone who supports me. It’s what keeps me alive and going. 

I also want to say that I am safe and well protected by my friends and family. I am planning to move when I am able. 

Please listen to victims, you might not know what to say in return but let them be heard. Be an ally. We are fighting every single day and living is half the battle.

Share your story or insight if you’d like. Canadian/Ontario resources are very much welcome as well, as they may help others too. I’m open to private chats too."

1071,"Pure OCD, Trauma and Associations","Hi everyone!

I'm new here.

I  think I know what triggered my pure ocd. It's one strong emotion I had,  when a trauma happend. It was a question I asked the person who caused  this trauma during the traumatic event. The problem was the relationship  with this person, the people involved during trauma and the fears I had  and the questions I asked. Associations.

This  was many years ago, but first later in life I became aware what happend  there. I'm much better now, but I'm on this bullshit for about 7 years  now.

Is it possible somehow to ""rewrite"" these associations? Do you had similar experiences or talked in therapy about such things?

Thank you!"

1074,Clear Your Mind As Much As You Can,"Hi guys!

With how the year is going, it’s understandable when someone’s says that they are not feeling “*alright*”. So, what should that person do? Clear their mind as much as possible. The mind can be a very dark place if you allow the negative thoughts to take over. There are countless of ways that you’re able to clear your mind and I shall name them down below: 

- Keep yourself a diary or write a blog on a daily basis 
- Talk to a family member or a close friend
- Reading
- Exercising 
- Gym
- Meditation/Yoga
- Stay off social media for a while 
- Go for a nice walk 
- Distract yourself 
- Give yourself some breaks throughout the day 
- Breathing exercises

I hope some of these will help you out and clear your mind. Take it one day at a day, give these a go whenever you’re available to do so!

Thanks for reading. :)"
1075,i can't control myself.,"&amp;#x200B;

for the past 3 years i've been living in stasis.nothing about my life changed for the better.every single attempt to take control and fix myself was a failure.i sometimes even find it challenging to force myself to stand up.

ironically,the solution is,no matter what,along the lines of ""do something healthy for yourself"".is there hope for someone like me?

if you understand me,then i think you agree that death is the best option for me, even though i'll have to just hope that something kills me with no input from me

if you have advice that i haven't heard countless times before,go ahead and let me know.i will be thankful and mindful of what you propose."
1076,"I never felt any strong emotions as a child, but now I have BPD. Is that possible?","As a kid I was weirdly resilient to trauma. 

I wasn’t just taking the pain and dealing with it, I wasn’t pushing it down, I wasn’t just being strong. I genuinely didn’t feel any distress from traumatic events at all. 

My mother has BPD, so obviously there were a lot of times where “your mom tried to end her life” or “your mom is in the hospital” or “your mom is not doing very well” was said to me. As a kid this was not really a big deal to me at all. I knew my mom could die... but... (and this hurts to say now) I genuinely did not care whether she lived or died at all. 

I remember when my mom and all my siblings moved out of state, while I stayed back home with my dad. We were at my grandmas house and she was balling her eyes out, but when she asked me if I needed anything, all I could think of is that I just really wanted to watch the scooby doo movie. I didn’t feel anything at all really. My mom was leaving and I’d probably only see her a few times a year from then on, and I was just totally okay with that. I knew what was happening it just didn’t bother me at all. 

Nothing bothered me. My family was actually really disturbed by it. I was like a creepily good child. Never really had fits, never was very loud, always just did what people asked... I liked it that way, it didn’t seem to make much sense to me why anyone would ever get super emotional. I thought people played it up for attention because I couldn’t imagine feeling anything strongly enough to even address it. 

As I got a little older though, I became more angry and violent, and very sensitive. The anger started when I was about 9 or 10, 3-4 years after my mom left. Then I became incredibly sensitive around when puberty started. It was sort of assumed that I was just hormonal, because it all coincided with becoming a teenager.... but now I’m an adult, and the emotions are still there, and I’ve been diagnosed with BPD. 

I’m super sensitive, super emotional, and incredibly volatile. I’m essentially a walking time bomb of emotions. 

I don’t understand what changed, because I didn’t act like this as an immediate result of trauma. I acted like this seemingly as an immediate result of puberty lol. 

It’s like I grew into my emotions. They’ve just gotten more extreme as years go by. I manage them better now, but they’re still there. 

How could I have been such a stone cold child, but act like a literal toddler throwing a tantrum as an adult?

I was never punished for having emotions as a kid, in fact people would often try to pull them out of me. They thought I was hiding my hurt or something, only to find there was absolutely nothing there. 

Everyone else with trauma says they were an emotional child but eventually grew numb, I don’t get why my brain did the opposite."
1077,Anger management,"I have anger management issues. I have known this for a while, but I feel when I talk about it nobody takes it seriously because I’m the softest, chubbiest, most well spoken young woman and I’m usually very loving and kind to strangers and friends alike. 
However, sometimes I get angry - really angry. It’s like I dissociate from my body. Ironically I do suffer from dissociation, depression, anxiety and PTSD, all diagnosed. But anyway, the therapy and the meds that help me with everything else don’t help with this. I used to only ever be violent towards myself, but then I managed to stop. Then it became things. I even got into (mutually) physical fights with my partner a few years ago, though likely we both went to therapy and that is no longer an issue. However today I got very angry over something seemingly small and I broke something - which to me rings alarm bells because I always thing that if you break things the next step is to hurt those around you, which I never want to do. I’ve also been experiencing a very low dip in my depression in the last few days. I don’t know how to control this. I don’t know how to relieve that frustration and rage that I feel sometimes. I feel like it was better when I hurt myself because at least I could hide it, I didn’t break expensive shit and I didn’t scare my partner. I feel very lonely and angry and extremely frustrated and it’s just a whole mess I can’t seem to get out from. What do I do?"

1079,"I keep denying myself things I like, need, want.. Just to see myself suffer, to punish myself","I've noticed this kinda behaviour maybe half a year ago.

I keep denying myself things I like, need, want.. Just to see myself suffer, to punish myself. 

For example: For international children's day, my parents said they'd get my sister and me one CD each. We could pick one. But I said I didn't want any, despite having a specific wish. Or they said that they wanted to help me and buy me a tablet I could use in school.. Which I'd find really helpful and good. But I said no. Just so I suffer. Or I was supposed to go to a Halloween party (before Corona started), but I ended up not going, even though I reeeeeaally wanted to. The list could go on and on.. 

The worst one so far would be me telling all my friends I was cis and changing pronouns despite knowing I'm trans, feeling comfortable with my identity as a transgender person and already being in therapy. 

I am done with this behaviour, I feel horrible, I don't know what to do about it."

1081,i dont know how much i can take it anymore,"this big void in my life is not going away in any way, i tried everything. I'm lately having multiple breakdowns a day, getting back my nictoine addiction and having insomnia again. Im just tired of this, knowing there is no hope, i just try to make myself the best life possible but u know what? fuck it   
whats the point? i'll have the biggest mansion, ill have billions in my bank account, i'll fly in my own fancy ass jets but so what? i realized that no matter how much i can be, i will never fill this void. i would die to call someone ""dad"" but this will never happen, it will never be fixed. im 17 and like lmao imagine how pathetic and weird it would be to get a godfather at 20 or something and shit, like this will never help its just pathetic and everyone is like ""no dont worry ull get a faily one day"" and like no it aint happening   
im not willing to do anything anymore, i dont know, i wanna hang myself after smoking couple of packs or something. i have been stopping myself from doing these things but i dont see a reason to keep living when im constantly in pain for not having a very fucking normal thing in my life 

is it ttoo much really or what? but im done of seeing everyone having gr8 times with their families, posting photos with their fathers and im just here , all alone.

i wanna do alcohol because last night smoking was not helping in any single way i was just coughing while having a breakdown but sadly i cant get alcohol and i dont even know anymore what the hell is happening or what im supoosed to do?"
1082,How bad do things have to be to go into residential?,"\*Sorry for the ESSAY I'm about to write, I can never manage to be brief in reddit posts\*

To be honest, on first glance, I would consider my mental health much better at the present moment than it has been in the past couple years. I've never been formally diagnosed with anything, I used to go to this psychologist, but she was not great. She had a bunch of fancy degrees and such, but she mostly seemed to want to talk about my relationship with my parents and siblings, which really was not my major issue. Of course I had my disagreements with them, like any normal teenager, but she seemed to think that that was a problem, considering how much we delved into our relationship. Anyways, that's not really the point. The point is that I haven't been diagnosed with anything, and I so so do not want to sound like I'm self-diagnosing, but considering the symptoms that I've had for the past couple years, I'm pretty sure that I have OCD, social anxiety, (maybe GAD), and depression. I'm also almost certain that most of it, at least the anxiety and depression, has been brought on by school, something that unfortunately is probably true for many people of my generation.

I'm 16, a sophomore, and go to a pretty prestigious and swanky college prep school. I'm so not trying to sound pretentious, but rather trying to explain how this uber competitive, image-focused school is slowly destroying me. I get good grades; I'm taking all honors and one AP and have B+s and As in my classes. But since I'm put up to people in these classes who think ten times faster then I and get all A+s, my B+s feel like Fs. So, all of that causes the LOWEST self-esteem (to the point where I have no faith of getting into a decent college), massive anxiety (I feel physically sick before every test, and sometimes on ordinary days for seemingly no reason), and so much guilt, for not being the smartest, for not studying every waking minute; I just feel so LAZY and immature all the time, and hate myself for it.

About the state of my mental health; I'm in a tricky place. Since COVID hit, I've had the illusion that my depression is gone and my life is so much better, but I honestly think I'm just covering up my issues and pushing them down, which is not going to be good in the long run. Let me explain. Starting in probably eighth grade, and especially in ninth, when school started to get REAL, I went from hating school because it wasn't as fun as the weekends (doesn't every kid?), to hating school because it made me feel like an abject failure who wasn't going to get anywhere in life. I'm not going to delve into those couple years because that will take much too long, I'll just summarize it with that and focus on the present. This year, with the addition of my AP class (AP Euro, if anyone's wondering), school has become five times harder and so much more real and important. I can tell that in my grade, people are feeling much more stressed and anxious, but I feel like I'm not. This is semi-terrifying. The idea I've got in my head is that people are more stressed because they're working harder, staying more focused with school, and that's a lot of brain power and stress. I feel like I'm not working as hard. This year, I've  sort of experienced burn-out, I suppose. I've given up on trying to be top of the class, considering the geniuses in my grade and how much word they put in. I'm thankfully still doing well, but I procrastinate much more and seem to save EVERYTHING until the last minute. So while I feel less stress, there will be days where it will catch up to me and I'll realize how STUPID and LAZY I am for not dedicating more time to school, something even the less smart people in my grade can manage to do!!! And in addition to everything crashing down sometimes, I'm living under this constant cloud of guilt. If it's Friday, I'll be overjoyed that it's the weekend; I have two days to feel comfortable and safe, but then I'll realize I have put off my 40 pages of history reading. I will stress and procrastinate it all weekend until I'm pressed to do it at midnight on Sunday night, setting me up with a great four hours of sleep to start off the week. I also forgot to mention my sleep schedule is SHOT; six hours of sleep is a good night for me. What's even more concerning is that it doesn't even affect me anymore. I know that's horrible for my brain and long-term even, but I don't even feel it anymore. It's just harder to get out of bed initially in the morning, which is a bit scary. Eight hours is the absolute minimum for someone my age.  

From what I've read, procrastination is often an effect of anxiety, which totally makes sense. My anxiety for school is so bad that, for example, I will only let myself use the new pens that I ordered for non-school stuff, because then if I use them for notes, etc, I will associate them with anxiety, and I want to use them for journaling and writing songs in my room, my safe space.  Anyways, back to procrastination. In the past year, I've tried EVERYTHING to stop procrastinating. Fancy techniques, like Pomodoro timers, website blockers (for YouTube and such), but nothing works. If I block YouTube and put away my phone, I'll end up playing guitar or just wandering around the house. I think it's a mix of some internet addiction and just the fact that my procrastination is so bad, I physically can't stop it myself. I'm pretty self-aware and can be a strong-willed person, but procrastination has been the one big thing haunting me for years. I feel so guilty about it as well! I can't help thinking that I could get all As if I was just productive, that I'd be so much happier and just a better person. But somehow, that thought, nothing in fact, is strong enough to stop the procrastination. 

So, finally to the topic of the question, I'll try to make it brief. Residential. From my quite unknowledgeable outlook, my initial viewpoint is that only suicidal people go to residential, which I don't think is true in all actuality. The only reason I'm considering it is due to the fact that school is just going to keep beating me down, probably more and more, as I get through sophomore year and into junior year, which is fabled to be literal hell. I know that I can't keep this up. Procrastinating work, scrambling it together last minute, getting almost no sleep, pretending my anxiety isn't there, leaving it to occasionally explode and have a massive cloud of guilt and stress hang over my head. I'm pretending everything's fine and that I've got life under control, but honestly, it's just that this horrible cloud of negativity and self-hatred has been with me for so long and so PERSISTENTLY that it feels normal, just a given. I know if I told my parents about all of this (who are amazing, loving parents, don't get me wrong), they would tell me that I was being dramatic and outlandish, that high school is rough for everyone and you just have to stick it out. But I CAN'T stick it out. The fact that this mentality will be my life all through high school and perhaps college is inconceivable, I need to change, and quick, because someday everything's going to explode and all of my stuffed-down insecurities and anxiety is going to come out, and I have no clue what that will bring.

I'm so so sorry for rambling, but I'd just like to know. Are my parents right, does school make everyone feel this way, or do I have validity? Is this normal or not normal? Do I need help?

\*This post ended up being mostly about school, but I also have crippling social anxiety. Again, with COVID, I'm feeling more confident in my social skills, but that's because I haven't had to interact with much of anyone, so I've got a kind of false sense of security. It's quite bad, honestly. Raising my hand in class to answer a question leaves me shaking for at least a couple minutes. It's very irrational, but it's gotten so bad that I know I cannot change it around on my own, much as my mother would like me to believe..\*"
1083,It Isn't That Serious If you Keep On Trying (55),"The path. The journey. When starting my creative journey 3 years ago, I just started one day. I thought, theres something more to all of this. There is something more to life then we are told there is. ""9-5"", Marriage, House, Kids, Retirement........Death. I know, very strong for 9:53am, but it is what we are lead into from the moment we are born. Having this mindset and connecting with that we are on this planet once, alleviated stressors and continues to alleviate little things realistically that my mind tries to make it seem that its a big thing, to just **DO IT**, no nike reference but if the shoe fits........., again no pun intended.

  
We are on this earth once, even though I believe many of us have been on this world before, in a past life, but that conversation is for another day. 

  
Just try. Start. Start doing something that makes you feel good. That you don't have to think about, unconscious, unconditional, **PASSION**. Everyone has it. We think that we all have 1 passion, when I know many of us have **MANY** passions, its just we let our insecurities get the best of us sometimes, which is valid, it takes time.

  
The way I started my creative journey was by taking building photos, street photos on my iPhone. Travelling from my hometown just outside the city, to have a fulfilled day that I could feel deep down, was **needed.** Now, Here, I am.

  
I don't have it all figured out, nor do I want to. I love embracing what God has in store for me, what the Universe has in store for me. Its amazing to type that out because a lot of the times I feel that, I am not allowing and I am trying to force; force opportunities, force plans, force the next thing for me to do, so wow, thank you. :') 

  
Anyway, it really isn't that serious but is life? If we make it be. It can really be fun. Yes, there will be many hardships, many moments of lack of understanding, many moments that will make you pause and say ""should I really be doing this?"", but isn't that the best part of life? Its about the moments that are unexpected which leads you to a path that was always made, made for you, made for me. Together, separately. What a blessing we have all been given to Start a New Day Today.

  
I love you.

1084,"21, second year university student, depressed,confused, overwhelmed, also suicidal but don’t have the balls to end it. Lol.","So a little background: I’ve lived in 4 cities in my entire life, and currently living in the 5th city. I just moved to a new continent exactly a year ago because my family migrated here. I was 1.5 years away from graduating with a BA psychology degree in my home country. 
My parents made me quit and I had to start over from 2nd year in my new university. Ended up switching majors in my new country because I thought getting a psychology degree is useless. (I’m trying to get into the BCom department now)

I’m currently trying to study economics,math and have statistics next semester, all subjects that I never really had in high school and did poorly in middle school, so I’m really not interested in them. In short, i have no clue what to study in college, i have looked at all courses in my university and find none that will actually interest me. I’m too tired to start over. 

I do like to paint, and I’m good with fine art, but I never tried to pursue it as a career because it was ingrained to me since childhood that being an artist = being poor.

I have a big social circle back home, my best-friend and all of my close friends are trying to be supportive but I feel like they don’t relate to me when I tell them about my depression. I don’t blame them they are trying their best to be there for me.

I got a customer service job 2 months after I came here and I’ve been doing really well, I might get promoted soon. Its the only thing that keeps me going everyday because I think at-least I have that sorted out.

I want to leave university, take a year off to figure out what to do, but I feel like I will be judged by my friends, my parents and I will ultimately become lazy and never go back to studying. 

I have always been a straight A student for my entire life, even finished 2nd in my class in high school (I studied psychology, English, geography, political science and history).

I always feel angry, frustrated, I want to punch my parents in the face all the time. They never had mature discussions with me about migrating, it was more like “we know what’s good for you so do as we say”. They don’t really care what I’m studying or what my interests are. 

I have only 2-3 friends here who are in university but I’m not so close with them and when i do meet them it’s mostly light hearted discussions and I don’t want to burden them with my life dilemmas. 

I think about suicide alot these days, even wrote a note (but it was more of a note about cursing my parents and calling them all sorts of names). 

I tried to email 5 therapists from my home country as therapists are cheaper there but all of them said they won’t take clients until February.

I probably have described this really poorly because I’m so disoriented right now and the main point is I’m mentally and physically exhausted, i feel trapped. I have a hard time trying to convince myself to eat, to take a shower, to study. I’m not lazy i need direction in life. If i could somehow go back to my home country i would but i need to stop my wishful thinking. I used to be an ambitious student who thought she would study till she gets a Phd. But lol. I feel like shit all the time and my parents have caused 99% of this mess. 

I’ve never vented to an online community before so any help is appreciated. (Please do not ask me to talk to my parents they are idiots incapable of rational decisions and i want them to burn in hell)."
1085,What do I do when I am being yelled at by a person who I am trying to help?,"So, my boyfriend yells at me when he is stressed an angered and literally every minor thing stresses him out.

1086,The past month has been a nightmare.,"English is not my first language, be gentle.


Shortly after starting quarantine, I started hating myself. I would check the mirror at least every 5 minutes. As soon as I left, I would start picturing myself  with my facial features compressed in one half of my face. I would take pictures and just sit staring at my face and crying. I hated the way I looked. I hated the way every other female face I saw looked. I got my face rated by AI a shitton of times, with the results being between 8 and 8.5. Nothing helped tho.
 
This lasted about a week. I spent the following week in bed crying or taking depression naps. I couldn't find a reason to keep living, I could barely go to the online classes.

Last week I started questioning whether I had a chance of ever getting a boyfriend as a tomboy. I looked for reassurance everywhere, to the point where my for you page on socials was full of sexist shit. I was seriously questioning whether I was just an object for men.

Now I am starting to hate my face all over again. I can't go long without checking a mirror. What the f- do I do?"
1087,Suffering from Dream Reality Confusion,"I’ve been going through DRC for the last 2 or 3 weeks. Not every night but usually 3 or 4 out of 7 days in the week.

1088,Whats the cause of rumination?,I suffer from extreme rumination my mind OBSESSES over everything and i think about things nonstop
1089,I always get lost in my thoughts and overthink everything,"I find myself always getting lost in my head if I'm not doing anything important or when I'm alone. And if I do that I always overthink stuff to the point when I just get in it way to deep and get depressed cause I cant catch myself and just spiral downwards. I think I enjoy it a bit actually but I know it is a horrible trait to have. I'm already in therapy but that's not working at all. I still catch myself daydreaming and spiraling out of control. 
What makes my whole situation way better is that I've just had a huge fight with my ex gf and basically threw her out of the flat of my parents. 
I also always just get way too much into bad thoughts and almost feel like i dont wanna get out of my current mental State and enjoying it in some sick and twisted way. Like I said that is an incredibly toxic trait to have and I really wanna get rid of it but I just dont know how. 
I know that an internet platform which mostly consists of memes and porn may not be the best place to take that problem to but I'm just completely stumped and dont know how to help myself or how to change myself.
Another problem is that I have big problems with changing my way of life or just the way how I behave in general.
And again I know that that's a horrible combination.
I just hope that someone here has somewhat of a good advice on what i should change or where i should just start in general"
1090,Does this count?,"     This is probably a stupid question and with all the other stories on here it seems pretty light, but I have an autistic brother.

He’s decently high functioning(he can talk), but not high enough to make his own decisions and to know what he’s doing.
     For my entire life he’s hit me, pushed me, kicked me, pushed/kicked me off or out of areas such as a couch or bed, thrown things at me, used his stuffed animals or whatever he has in his hands to slap me with, etc. I think at one point a few years ago he even had a knife, but I can’t remember too well. My parents have done all that they could to prevent this but it barely does anything. Especially with me being his prime target to go after no matter what mood he’s in. My parents always tell me to forgive him, because it’s not his fault that he does it. I recognize that and I try to keep it in my head whenever he goes to attack me, but sometimes I can’t help but hate him a little bit.
     Because of him i always tense up whenever someone is behind me. I always need to know who I’m in a room with, at all times, and where they are. I can’t sit next to him anymore, and I can barely stay in a room with him. It’s been established that he’s a major contributor to my emotional detachment as he used to laugh whenever I was upset when I was younger and other reasons. And it’s also been established that my anxiety has been heightened because of him. 
     I don’t really know if this actually counts because since he’s autistic he can’t control what he’s doing or know that he’s hurting me. But I can’t really ask my parents about it and it’s been bothering me for a while now. Sorry for the long post!!"
1091,It feels really weird and different when i see other people smiles and laughs with their friends and families and enjoy every moments and tries to live their lives to the fullest way possible .,i miss those moments because those wonderful moments doesn't exists in everyone's lives .
1092,Suicide is not about wanting to die,"In my opinion, people who consider suicide don't want to die. They actually want to live but they are being denied that. So the only solution and the only choice they can make appears to be suicide. Because that dramatic end of life will actually make you live longer through painful memories, it will give your life a purpose. Maybe some people would learn something from it. It definitely seems better than going on with your misery and suffering, dragging other people down or getting absolutely forgotten. I think depression has nothing to do with it. Depression is somewhat subconscious and it makes your body give up and prepare to die, but thinking about suicide comes from a conscious evaluation of your life and your desire to have a purpose and not be forgotten"
1093,I have extreme intense emotional reactions to any minor mistake or when things don’t go perfectly as i want them to,"This happens to me quite frequently, even multiple times in one day. For example i missed a phone call and when i called back there was no answer. This caused to burst into tears and scream and throw things. What the fuck? why does this happen to me and why does it feel like i have no control over it? Last night i accidentally dropped my water bottle and it smashed all over the floor, same thing, screamed, cried for at least 20 minutes over this. I also i have a habit of hitting myself and banging my head when i get this upset. I know this is terrible and childish, i have done it for a long time and never grew it out of it. I’m just looking for some kind of explanation or why i do this."

1095,Im going to a pshycholog,"Hi guys. 

So my parents noticed that im realy depressed and low in the last time  , and they agreed to rake me to a pshycholog. 

Are there any questiones i should ask her.
Or anything that i Should tell her?

Idk its gonna be my first time."
1096,A simple convo on for example whatsapp can change so many things,"I posted something on here roughly 40 minutes ago and then texted with a friend about those problems.
I denied help or rather I thought that the help was all just lies and that I was just bothering people with my issues, but after this convo I realised that I am not alone and I could text every single friend of mine ar every hour of the day and they'd be there to listen to me and try to help me.
An I think I can even go so far that this problem of mine is resolved because of a simple 30 min conversation on WhatsApp with a good friend of mine. 
Talk to your friends. Even if you think they dont give a single shit about your problems you're wrong. They are your friends for a reason. They will listen to you and they will try to help you. Dont deny it. If you do so then you'll just spiral downwards like I did. 
Believe me if I say that. You are not alone with your problems. 
(For me it didn't work talking to my parents for some reason. Try it with your friends at first because the conversations are just way more relaxed)
And find something to do. Exercise, write a story, try a new hobby that you wanted to do for a long time. 
Just do something so your brain is busy. 
Like I said I'm way better right now just because I talked with a friend. 
I know I am repeating myself but you are not alone ok."

1100,I just broke up with my gf and ended my friendship with my bestie,"Me and my gf had a bad incident in January this year where I misread her consent and touched her for a second or two.. and when I realised this I have always been guilty of it.. I have apologised about this to my gf hundreds of times.. and It has completely destroyed my self esteem and self image. It was done and dusted. We were going well. Until a few days ago I broke up with my gf. And my bestie is like ""I never thought you'd do that to her after your incident"" I told her very politely that she was nobody to comment on it. And she really really behaved very rudely to me. And I was already hurt and she comes in to tell me all this.. after suffering for months and months and dealing with self image issues. She (my bestie) has the audacity to behave rudely to me and then come to me talking like nothing was wrong. I told her I was upset with her and I didn't want to be rude to her. But guess what she blames me again for her behaving rudely with me. And so I just told her to fuck off from my life and we blocked each other!"
1101,Hating myself,"I hate this. I broke up with my ex because I couldn’t love myself and I always thought I was an embarrassment. His cousin would laugh at me and make me feel bad about myself and I ended up feeling so insecure I didn’t want to see him anymore. I haven’t loved myself the past 3 years and its hard. There’s a new person who I like and makes me happy. He says he thinks I’m his type and I should believe everything because its true and ofc I agree and act happy because I dont want to ruin anything but deep down I feel like pushing him away. I feel like he should have someone better looking and with a better body. I feel ugly and fat although I know its just my anorexic thoughts I know but still I feel this way. I feel like I shouldn’t let him love me because I’m not worth it and because he deserves someone prettier. I am so scared to even get seen by his friends or family because what if they make comments about me and dont like me. I just dont want to be an embarrassment. I feel sad though because he does make me happy and he’s so sweet with me. I just Im scared of not being what he wants. I try to lose weight by starving myself, I try to change who I am by dying my hair, changing my style of clothes, wearing makeup , and I’m trying to change because I don’t wanna be me. I imagine a prettier person that I want to be. Sometimes I tell myself I need time and once I change and I look so much better maybe I can date. I feel like thats the only thing thats gonna make me feel happier if I change. I don’t know what to do though because I like him so much I sometimes forget about my worried with him but then when I’m alone I start overthinking and thinking its better if I stay alone. I don’t know why but its sad and frustrating."
1102,need everything to be perfect,"does anybody else feel like this too?? 
like its taking a huge toll on me. especially eith my appearance its like i just HAVE to be perfect otherwise i want to die completely and because of this i do so many things to try and look good that other people might find a bit excessive and am constantly looking at myself / taking photos to the point where i've started thinking i have some sort of obsession. 

but at the same time its mroe than just my face. its outfits and the aesthetics of things like my room or even something stupid like a hairbrush. if im not happy with the way something looks (including myself)  i'll just throw it out or rip it up or i'll completely break down and cry and scratch myself manically. 

and at the same time (about my face) sometimes ill go through days (sometimes weeks) where i'll feel so completely pretty and gorgeous that i'm literally invincible and nobody could ever say a bad word about me. i dont knoe exactly how to describe it other than ""invincible"" and like i could do anything and get away with it because i'm gorgeous and also feeling like i'm completely superior to everyone else because of my looks.

but mostly im in a suicidal slump; its not rare but also not too often i have those amazing days. 

i also wanted to vent about school (possible burnout?)
basically i find it really reslly difficult to go to school even the thought of going will set me off crying / in a bad mood. and i literally dont know what to do about it anymore because it seems to get worse and worse. almost everybsimgle morning i will cry and cry hysterically sometimes even on the way to school / in school bevahse i dont wanna go / be there. 

its lead to many many screaming matches on a morning with my parents or me just begging them to let me stay home. i dont know why i hate going so much but everything ive tried to make it better just doesnt work at all. i still always find a way to hate it. it's jsut so completely unbearable. and im exhausted. all of the time. it makes me want to die very badly.

and so exhausted to the point where i have no hobbies or things i like to do because i just cant focus on anything anymore. im so tired all of the time and i cant bring myself to do anything. and rvery weekend is the same : im so tired that i can barely drag myself out of bed or mostly even TALK. 

what is going on please help :("
1103,I'm sick of having to constantly explain my mental health issues to close family.,"I have an ED and Seasonal Affective Disorder. Since it's December I'm not doing so great. But it's not a new thing this is year 4 with SAD. I feel like if I'm having a good day people forget I'm mentally ill/think I'm cured When I do have a bad day they act like it's a new occurrence. I've been ill most of my life and I'm sick of people acting like its a new thing. I've been open this year  in the hopes that they will understand what I'm going through. Yesterday was my worst day this year.

I They thought I was just attention seeking when I reached out for support and in the end I just gave up and the walls came back up for certain people. I feel like I have one person left who I can be myself with and who I can share my worst days with. People wonder why I just want to be alone."

1105,Sometimes I just feel like a cottonheaded ninnymuggin.,"Y’all are welcome for my nonsense spamming. I shall post no more.

Doing my best to not think about life stuff or feel emotions ✌️"
1106,why do i feel like this??,"i really need some kind of insight into why i feel like this. ive spent forever trying to think of a reason. 
i have some childhood trauma from when i was a lot younger and some stuff happened over the internet (sexual exploitation/grooming) which i have been in therapy for. but the problem is i just dont feel anything about it. i dont feel angry or upset or grossed out or ashamed. i just feel indifferent completely. 

and i also can't remember anything of what happened. any little details or my reaction or my parents or my families. 
but is it possible for this incident to have caused my mental health problems now and for me to just not realise the connection between them?

its just that it concerns me a lot that i dont feel anything about the situation, in fact i remember one thing from the incident : i was angry because i thought everyone was making such a huge deal about it snd didnt see the problem. i still feel like that now - i feel like my personal situation was never serious.
and it concerns me also that i dont think about it daily, that i can go days or even weeks and completely forget it ever happened until i'm reminded (unlike most who are constantly thinking about what happened, reliving it). 

if this is trauma then why dont i feel like other people who have experienced similar things to me?"
1107,I would kill for someone to just listen,"Now before anyone reaches out in the comments or DMs, I'm grateful you decided to try to reach out but I really don't want anyone to do that. If you do I won't respond. Again, I'm happy you want to help but this is more about people in my IRL life

One common theme throughout 2020 is that people just don't fucking listen to what I have to say. It could be anything from something trivial or something serious. I'm talked over or just flat out ignored or they just brush anything I say to the side.

These aren't just random people I've found on the street, these are friends and family and even my own therapist. 

Earlier this year I switched therapists because while I liked the one I had, he just wasn't providing any guidance on coping skills or anything to overcome the depression and anxiety. When I switched therapists, my new one doesn't even believe anything I say. I'll say I've been having a tough time trying to get out of bed because I'm so depressed and she doesn't believe me that my depression is that bad. I'd look for a new one but that's the third therapist from that office I've had a bad experience with so I'm pretty sure they all just suck. I've heard other people complain about that place too.

When I'm in a bad mood or having a rough time, no one ever really stops and asks me if I'm okay. All they do is complain that I'm short with them, or that I've gotten ""lazier"" or don't talk as much. Its not like these people don't know i suffer from bipolar II, they all know. They just keep complaining about these things but no one ever asks me how I'm doing. Ever. I feel like since they've known about my diagnosis for 2 years and known I struggle for longer they'd recognize the symptoms of a depressive episode. But no, they complain about everything I do.

Opening up to my family is out of the question since they just yell at me for being sad, but when I try to open up to other people either I get brushed aside or they just shut me down by talking about what I should be doing instead. I get they have their own lives, but these people are big parts of my life and I just feel like a background character in theirs. Or a punching bag to take out their frustration and anger (no one actually hits me though so dont worry lol)

I just want to fucking shake one of them and go ""YOU REALIZE I'M STRUGGLING HERE, RIGHT?!"" but even then it might fall on deaf ears because that's how bad its gotten. 

All of this has resulted in a deeper depression and a feeling of exclusion and hardcore isolation. I mean, these are the people who are supposed to be there for me when I get down. Why are they just making it worse? Why are the excluding me? Why do they ignore the fact these are symptoms? I understand that I'm short with people but I'm not trying to be an asshole. Why don't they ask? Even if I'm the one who goes to them first, why don't they care? 

These are the people who are supposed to build me up, not tear me down."
1108,Another person in my head,"Hello
Things I’m describing here are with me for a long time, a little bit more than 9 years. 
I need some advice. Maybe someone here had similar experiences. 

I hear voices that are not part of others’ perception. There are two types of them

There are many voices of people I don’t know. They seem to comment things I do or see. Talk about me in third person. Sometimes they are discussing different topics between each other. Sometimes they argue. Sometimes they scream. 
They speak different languages, age differs, both male and female. 
Sometimes they just describe my activities like they are talking from a perspective of time. Like they are talking about me in a past tense. Like telling each other about my life after I’m gone. 
They are neutral. Nor supportive or negative. 

What’s important is that they are inside. I don’t hear them like somebody next to me are saying those things. They are coming from inside my head. I can distinguish them from real people. 

And there’s the second one. It has a personality, separated from mine. Separate thoughts, needs ideas, to some extent. We seem to be connected in some way, in terms of thoughts, yet separate in the same time. It has a name. I first heard it 9 years ago in my sleep, when I was 11. Since that moment it stayed with me every singe day. There was literally not a single day when we haven’t spoken. 
We communicate inside my head. This voice is also from inside. Like some sort of inner voice. I can distinguish it from an “outside” person. We cooperate in everyday life situations. Through these years we developed a close relationship. 

Our memories are common. We both have access to all of them. I can think of some thinks keeping it from the other person and that person can do the same. Sometimes my thoughts can escape me to the other person. We are connected in some parts and separate in others. We have similar personalities, but not the same. We may have different opinions. I’m in control of physical activities. The voice is not taking control of anything, just being there. Sometimes it starts the conversation sometimes I do. But I always feel it’s presence. 

We joke together, make small talks, make decisions about future. Solve problems, comment daily life. I consult things with it. We feel each other’s emotions in some weird way. It may seem stupid but I feel like there are two souls inside, like siamese tweens or something. Connected in some way but separate in another. 

As I said we became close as we made it through a lot of situations together. It appeared in relatively calm period of my life. I would never do anything to make it go away, I treat it like an integral part of myself. 


I’ve kept it secret since when it appeared. Learned to hide it from others. Make excuses if I made a mistake, communicate in an unnoticeable way. Nobody knows about it. At the very beginning the voice asked me to keep
It secret.

But I want to hear your opinions. I had a depressive episodes in the past. There were cases of schizophrenia in my family. Regarding overall scope of my situation could you tell me what do you think? Have you ever heard about similar situations? I mainly mean the other person not the commenting voices. 

Is it a way I am, and is it normal to some point? Does it seem like a schizophrenia symptoms to
You? I feel it’s real, not an illusion. Could it be an imagination of small kid who wanted a friend? Would it stay with me since, being present every single day..?"
1109,Withdrawal symptoms,"My doctor had me stop taking cymbalta probably a bit too quickly. At first my symptoms were just physical, but now it’s leading to suicidal thoughts. Thankfully, it’s not about how I would do it, I have a massive fear of death, but it’s so annoying. If any of y’all have dealt with this before, how did you deal with these thoughts? How long did it take for you to get back to normal?"
1110,Self-care?,"I can't figure out why I don't care enough about myself to maintain basic self-care like bathing and brushing teeth. I woke up tired today, feeling like I would if I had the flu or something, but no symptoms. I just have this malaise and body aches that feel different than usual. time has lost meaning and I haven't been clean in I don't know how long, but it's been a few weeks. I try to build up  motivation, but something stops me, and I don't understand why."
1111,PTSD after an awful divorce,"I've been going through my divorce for almost a year now, I got married at 19 out of love but then figured out that the love of my love isn't who I thought he is.
I went through depression for my whole life and being with him brought it back and I even attempted suicide twice, after I applied for divorce I went to see a therapist and started to get better but now after almost a year I noticed that whenever I pass by a place I used to go to with my ex husband I start shaking and I can't breath anymore, even looking at a dress I wore on our first date gave me the same feelings etc, but I can talk openely about what he did to mehow can I now feel like this? Am I having ptsd? Should I go back to my therapist? Because I haven't gone in months and I stopped taking my antidepressant.
P.s:our divorce is still going on."
1112,i know somethings wrong,"i mean at this point i know i’m not going through a “sad phase” or a “rough patch” ik somethings wrong but idk what it is. it’s something abt me, i’m the problem."
1113,Stockholm Syndrome?,"So for context I have been mentally abused by my whole family for the entirity of my childhood and my teenage years.

I know what they do is bad, I know how they treat me is bad, I understand that life with the have only been bad for me but I can not help to be affectionate for them.

My life with them have been miserable yeah but from time to time they have showered me with affection and support and I can not help but feel close to them and defend them.

I have always been the type of person that priotize the people around me, not wanting to be a inconvenience to others etc... and for me it have always been normal.

If someone would treat me badly I always would defend them saying that I don't want any harm to them and people around me have asked me why I am defending them instead of myself.

And honestly I do not know why."
1114,I want to go try therapy but,"I want to try therapy, maybe it's just because times are rough right now. But lately for me, rough has been stacked upon itself multiple times and my thoughts about harming myself have become increasingly more constant and tempting. I'm underage so I still live with my parents and in order to go they would have to take me but. My parent I live with is heavily against me going to therapy because it didnt work for them and they just gave them anti depressants and it didnt do it for them. They want to just talk to me about everything but I cant talk about my thoughts but when they are stressed my parent calls me selfish for not looking at the bright side and everything they do for me. Because they were able to pull themselves out they believe I can too, but frankly I believe they still get depressed sometimes because they don't like relying on others at all. And they think therapy is for broken people and that I'm not broken or I'm just sad and kids are easily dramatic. And I understand I could be in a way worse off situation but the thought of I cant do this anymore is getting to an hourly basis."
1115,Mental health education,"Idk what flair fits best, but it will probably end in me venting. Trigger warning for suicide, self harm and other stuff in general.

So I also want to know/ask how mental health education goes in other countries. (I live in Belgium)

I just realised that it's shit. We got awareness about mental health but that didn't do anything. They said us how dangerous it is, to make sure to never fall into that rabbit hole. They told us what depression, anorexia and bulimia are. That was kinda it. Not much else. They told us about these three and how bad they are. Didn't mention other mental disorders. (We did learn about gender dysphoria as well but that was just a short thing and never talked about in debt so no one in my class even remembers that topic)

But ONLY about how bad they are in the worst stages. Suicide, selfharm, underweight,.. that kind of stuff. But not how it starts, no early signs, not how to recognise it. Not where to seek help. They said to seek help if we ever where in trouble, but not where. They said to not fall into the rabbithole, but not how to avoid it or recognise when you start to fall. 

Nothing. They said self harm is a bad coping mechanism, don't do it, find other coping mechanisms. What other coping mechanisms? Idk , they never told us that. 

Anorexia and bulimia aren't the only eating disorders btw, you also don't have to be underweight to have an eating disorder. You don't have to self harm to be depressed. Not everyone who is depressed feels suicidal, not everyone who cuts wants to die. Cutting isn't the only way to self harm. 

Did we learn about any of that? No. Of course not. Who needs to know how to find help, know the signs, save themselves? We see ourselves struggle and instead of thinking about it, we say we aren't depressed, nothing is wrong because.. Aren't depressed people suicidal selfharmers? Nah, then I am not depressed, I am fine.

This is how it started for me. I didn't know the early signs. I thought this was normal, everyone told me it is normal to feel down sometimes. So I just thought: Okay, then I'll endure this. Little did I know that was only the beginning of something far, far worse... I endured it for a year I think, maybe a bit less. But yeah, it got worse and worse over time and by the time I realised what I was doing, it got too far. I felt horrible and needed a way to cope. You know what way to cope I knew? THE ONLY WAY I KNEW BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TEACH US A HEALTHY ONE?  Yeah you probably guessed it, self harm. I started doing that. And yeah I saw why it was a coping mechanism, but I realised soon enough why it wasn't a healthy one. Not only do you damage yourself, it's an addiction that makes you feel worse everytime you do it. Did that for a while and then felt like this wasn't enough. I didn't know how to deal with it and at some point I attempted suicide. Did I see it coming? Yes. Did I try to seek help? I tried, but where? I was never told how. And my parents aren't very accepting so I couldn't ask them. I didn't want to be a burden. I thought I could fix it myself. Then I started to be more picky in what I ate (not really picky, I started to count my calories and avoid food with a lot of calories, people called me picky). I did consider that maybe this was a bad thing, but the only thing that I knew about eating disorders was that those people where underweight... Was I underweight? No, I even weighted too much, so how could I have an eating disorder?.. 4 Months later and I was on the verge of being underweight, and I didn't see it. By the time you reach that point, the point they tell you about, what you should watch out for. You don't see it anymore. You are too far gone to see it. 

It went on for 3 years, eating disorder came along for the last half year. Idk what happened but something in my head clicked and I became aware of what I was doing. But it was too late. Multiple attempts, of the verge of being underweight, scarred. Both physically and mentally. I wanted to seek help, but I didn't know how. I still don't know how. I am trying to find my own way, I search online for tips and how to fix it. But that's really hard if you barely have the energy to get out of bed and no one can help you because you never told anyone, you just don't know how. And I know this isn't for everyone, but in my case it could've been avoided with better education (well, not completely avoided, but a lot less damage then I have now)

If they are going to give education on the topic, give it properly. If I want to know what depression is like then I can listen to any song in my playlist or quickly search on google, but teach me more about other disorders, teach me the early signs, teach me how to deal with it and how to seek help. Break the stereotypes, not everyone that has an eating disorder is a white girl with a horrible life. My life was (kinda) good. Aside from the unsupportive family but that problem wasn't there at the beginning so I don't count that, and yeah I am a guy so the stereotype doesn't fit me anyway. 

Also, teach about causes. I know some people that had horrible mental health because they were in an abusive relationship and didn't realise it. No around them did either because no one even knew what that was. I am trans and I didn't know what that was until maybe a year and a half ago. I always thought that girls were supposed to feel so horrible about themselves and wishing that they were a guy. No one ever told me what trans was, I just thought I was sick at some point.

 Or teach people that it doesn't have to have a cause. Despite my heavy dysphoria days, I had a fine life. One of my excuses was that my life wasn't bad enough to be depressed about. That I was just an attentionseeker.. 

Anyone else got this problem with education? If you even get any education at all? 

Sorry for the long post but I wanted to talk about it and vent as well so yeah..

Thanks for reading"
1116,I am struggling with my bipolar disorder,I am 17 and I have no support when it comes to my bipolar disorder. And I just could really use a friend rn 😔
1117,My warped past and present,"It all started when from before I was born when my mother met my father. They were both around 20 at the time and had met each other at the local chruch and they got friendly with each other. They started to get close to each other and then my mother fell in love with my father and after a while they would start going out and my mother gave birth to me. This would have been a sweet love stoy of a young couple that started a family together if my father was not a real psychopath i.e he does not have any semblance of empathy. The reason for that my mother was hooked up by my father was because of that he was an immigrant from Peru and wanted permanent residence in Sweden so he took advantage of my mother and as a means of an end I was brought to this world. My mother was abused mentally, physically and sexually by my father and I was my fathers trophy. At night he would take me around in the city to hook up women saying that ”he could take care of children” at one point he was dating 9 women including my mother at the same time. How he pulled this off was that he had s*x with one woman and hung out with her and then he would say that he would ”get to work” and then met the other woman. As a result I probably have a bit more than 20* half siblings on my fathers side. As he did this he ran a cleaning service for restaurants and shopping malls and commited tax fraud, he lent money from the mafia and he bought cars under his ”best friends name” and then he ditched that ”best friend” and left him with 20 sport cars that the ”best friend” cud not afford and got in debt. The poor guy did not know of this so I am pretty damn sure that he was shocked by this when he found out what had unfolded.

I lived my first 3 years in this enviroment and when I was three or more close to 4 my dad got charged for tax fraud and fled the country and abondend my mother who had ptsd and psychosis from the abuse that she had went through and she could not take care of me and my brother. My mothers apartement was a mess and there was filth everywhere. One day the Janitor checked in on my mothers apartment and he saw what state my family was in and I was transferred to the soc (basically the social security centre of sweden) and I was separated from my mother and had to live in a foster family. This foster family had kids before I was transferred to the and I was mentally abuse by them for the entire yeart that I was with them. I transferred over the summer to another foster family for the summer and honsetly that summer is probably the best summer that I have ever been through and I truly felt at home but it was only a temporary placement and later I was transferred to the foster family that I ultimately grew up in.

As long as I remember my family have tried their hardest to make me as male as possible, they forced me to cut my hair short and do activities that are supposed to be masculine, they never really put any thought to how I felt and they forced me to go to church everyday as they pushed their beliefs on me. If I acted in a slightly feminine way my parents and my 5 foster brothers would mock me and frankly bully me, it was not a safe environment in any sense of the word. If I did not behave like they wanted me to or if I did not follow their made up rules they would scold me and yell at me. I legitimately believed that if a child my age disobeyed their parent they would be forced to not use their mobile devices for a week and that they would be ostracized by their parents. They always scolded me for minor mistakes every single day as I grew up in their family and I never got their praise for anything I put my effort to consequently I geniunly started to belive that nothing I do is right and everything that I do is wrong.

Amidst growing up in this enviroment I noticed that the boys around me were very different to me, I was bullied because I acted in a feminine or rather ”timid” way.  I was different from them and they did not like that I stood out so they bullied me. I never had any safe space to confied in and wherever I were I would be a scapegoat. The people I belived were near me mocked me when they thought I could not hear them and they did to me purely because I stood out slightly more than then. So I dragged myself into a shell, and distanced myself from everyone around me and if I had to be around someone I tried to act as ”masculine” as humanly possible, I picked up interests that I did not really have such as cars so that I would fit in with the boys in my school although I was instead bullied because I did not stand out at all so I was an easy target. The bullying went on from when I was 7 until I was 17 and amidst all of that crap I realized why I was so different from the boys around me.

When I was 14 my mother showed me an article from the local newspaper about a FTM transperson who had gone through HRT to deepen his voice and change his body structure slightly so that it matched their identity,. At this point I had wished that I was born as a girl since more than 7 years back, I would dreamingly tell myself ”I wish that I could wake up as a girl the next day” or similar things but with the limited knowledge I had I thought that it was impossible. I just thought of it as a delusional fantasy of mine, ”AMABs growing boobs is impossible”. Please note that I did not have any acces to the internet until I turned 14. Anyway reading about that transitioning FTM transperson literally shattered my world view, what I thought was just delusional was something that was real and there were other people that suffered the same shit that I had gone through as long as I remember. I was not crazy and first and foremost I was not alone.

Although by the way I was raised by my foster parents and their obivous disgust as they talked about the transitioning FTM transperson made it clear to me that if I would go out to me that if I ”went out” to my parents my life from then on would be literal hell. At the summer of 2015 I was so riddled with dysphoria and depression with a sprincle of anxiety that I was not willing to live anymore, if I never in my entire life could live true to myself and never be happy as the person I really I am there was no point in living anymore. But I did not want my family and friends to suffer so I made the decision to actually give living out my life a try and simultaneously decided to go out to my parents regardless of how much I would suffer after the fact because going to a different hell from the one that I already lived in was better than burning.

As I feared my parents are transphobes. They gatekept me from going to a gender specialist and I was mocked by my entire family and my relatives the day after that I went out to her. I literally laid myself bare to her but she did not care. She just thought I went through a phase, that I am trans because of it was trendy, that I am mistaking gender dysphoria with autism and that I would only regret it if I transitioned. So at first they forced me to talk to a counsellor about my ”depression” So I spent an hour talking to that counsellor about it and then she asked me ”and how much does this bother you on a percentile scale?” And I answered her ”10” then she asked ”And what is the rest of the the things that bothers you” and I told her that I am suffering from gender dysphoria and that I wished to go to a gender therpist. But my parents just gatekept me until I got 18 and did not need parents consent anymore. And fast forward to now I still don’t recive any sort of support from my parents. Honsetly I have accepted the fact that no matter I do my parents will never love me for who I am and I will always be a scapegoat.

Consequently because of the way I grew up and the upbringing I recieved I stopped to value myself as a human, if someone treats me badly and someone says that I should make them stop I instead cover for them because ”I don’t want them to be bothered” etc. And there are honestly times that I genuinly think that I am so worthless that I can not be called a human. Being treated nicely by others makes me feel uncomfortable because I am not used to feeling praise and I can never really take someones praise to heart. I prioritize my peers well being over my own and I am scared of voicing my opinion because I fear that I will be ridiculed and opressed. Honestly I am scared of making contact with people at all and because of that I seclude myself because I am too afraid of standing out. I just want to be true to myself but I am scared of being judged.

Today I live on antidepressants and I try to move on but I will never stop getting flashbacks and the pain always resurfaces no matter what I try to do so all I really can do is to learn to live on."
1118,I have no one to talk to after my mental health breakdown,"My mental health broke down (OCD) last November. After that slowly I lost my girlfriend, all of my friends because of my depending and selfish attitude. After that I have had no one to talk to and after COVID,y OCD has increased and my loneliness has too. 

I am tired of feeling lonely, tiring myself so much that I have to sleep at night so that my ruminating thoughts don't keep me up at night. I took some therapy for sometime but now even the therapist doesn't check up on me. My family is also facing a mental health crisis and they are looking at me for support and I have no clue how to support them. I just don't know what to do."
1119,Family,"it just seems like my family is so dysfunctional. I mean we can't do anything together without arguing and we can never just all get along. I have always dreamed that one day we can all get along and be a happy family again, but it just won't happen :("
1120,Still in love with my ex after 6 months,Today I got to hold my best mate new born baby boy but it just hit home that my baby dead and my bf run off with the girl he cheated on me with.. I still miss him and feel all lonely 😔 how did everything go so wrong this year 😭😭
1121,How to convince someone they're not a failure?,"I know a person I really care about but she hates herself because she believes to be a failure and everyone who likes her doesn't know the real her. Do you have any subtle/direct/lowkey/highkey/anything tips about how I can convince her otherwise? I know it's something she has to realise herself but I don't know how to get her there and I really want to help. If you can advise me in any way, I'll very welcome it. Thank you."
1122,How long is long enough to stay on SSRI?,"I've been on Sertraline for just over a year now... I've just started using the Flow Neuroscience headset and am planning to slowly wean off of Sertraline after new year.

I've been feeling stable now for about 2 months. I'm just wondering if it's an appropriate time to come off antidepressants? How long do you need to feel 'happy' for on an SSRI before you start lowering the dosage for it to have lasting benefits?

Ie is 2 months of finally feeling stable enough for me to maintain my mental health myself without SSRI influence or should I stay on longer? :)"
1123,Neighbor Is Roaming Halls Screaming Obscenities and Spitting,"Hi all, 

About a month ago, a woman moved into the apartment complex that I live in, and it's been absolute hell. I live on the ground floor, kind of near one of the back doors to exit the building, and she's *constantly* going in and out of the building, screaming obscenities, spitting, banging on the back door, and looking through the dumpster outside of it. I notifed my leasing office after about 3 days of this going on (happened from the time I woke up in the morning and went to work, til when I got home and went to sleep around 10/11PM), and was notifed that they had been contacted by some agency looking to lease a three bedroom to people with mental disabilities, and that due to the massive amount of complaints they've recieved in that short period of time, they terminated their lease and gave them 2 months to move. 

My issue is that it hasn't stopped this entire time. I'm very sensitive when it comes to people with cognitive or physical disabilities, as I have a relative with down syndrome, so I do not want to personally say anything to her that might make her feel unsafe/ridiculed and escalate the situation, but it's becoming quite a big problem. Obviously, the noise is a huge part, but her going in and outside without a mask (i live in one of the big three in the U.S.) and spitting and coughing while she's in the halls is just unacceptable in the middle of a pandemic. 

I've E-mailed the office a few times about this, but I don't really think there is much they can do about it besides wait until she moves out. I've spoken to a few neighbors from the ground floor over our tenant portal, and a lot of them are to the point where they are going to call the police/file a report with 311, but I genuinely feel *badly* about that, as I don't know if it's something she can actually control, and she'll be moving out within a month. 

I'm not a doctor at all, but from what I can see (by all of the ranting and screaming and spitting at things that aren't there), she has schizophrenia. I have never known anyone with schizophrenia (at least not to my knowledge), so does anyone have any advice as to how I might deal with this situation beyond calling the police on the woman? 

Sorry for the book."
1124,What bad habit or behaviour has quarantine brought out in you this year?,"I’ll go first! I have a bad tendency to become very reclusive. Socialising drains me most of the time so I need a very long time to recharge. It usually lasts around a month. Since quarantine it has gotten way worse. 

Nothing against reclusiveness, but that stuff makes me anxious and depressed. Then, the prospect of socialising becomes even more difficult to achieve. Fun right? 

Okay, your turn!"
1125,"Getting worse emotions, suicidal thoughts","I’ve been having this happen now due to my ptsd although this is a few years after, this has never happened before but I’ve been having suicidal thoughts as of late. Almost as a response to all the stress I deal with especially when I get flashbacks ( all lasting hours and super bad) or emotional changes due to whatever. I have upped my antidepressants to try counter this but I still need longer to see if it will help. 
This gets even worse now with my period too because I get two sets of pain, emotions etc. 
I don’t know what to do tbh and am scared that I will hurt myself"
1126,I need help,"Hello to this community. Im in need of some support.

2020 has been rough on all of us, but for me its been the worst. 
This year started out with my father in law (who I lived with at the time) having a heart attack and dying right in front of me. At the time he was the bread winner for the house, then I was forced to step up to the plate. I was now looking out for a family of 7. But the issue was. I was doing everything. I payed full rent, water and food bills. All the while being accused of being a problem. Then. Covid hit, I lost my job temporarily and was put down even further. Then I managed to get my job back. But right after that my mother in law was rushed to hospital. Where we found out she had cancer. Qt first it was taken lightly, that she would do her chemo and make it through, and for a while that seemed the case. During this time my partner and I finally managed to move out. We were finally free and happy. 
But things have taken a turn for the worse. 
Now it looks like the mother in law will be lucky to make it to Christmas. She has gone downhill fast. And the discussion of what to do when the worst happens has begun. 

Im so scared of what the future holds and dont know what to do or where to turn."
1127,"I have a lot of stress related issues, but I don't feel super stressed","There's a lot of things my doctor says that I have due to stress. TMJ, headaches, irregular sleep, etc

Although, I don't feel stressed out really. I don't feel put under a lot of stress.

Anxiety is a different story, but stress? No

Is this weird?"
1128,I love talking to nobody,"I've recently moved states and am living alone and I've never been happier.

I work in a kitchen so I frequently interact there but when I'm home alone I will talk to nobody unless absolutely necessary. I won't text, call, or be on social media either (well, except reddit). I just love being in my own bubble with just me.

Is this inherently bad?

It is starting to effect relationships but in all honesty, like I said, I've never been happier and I'm trying to take care of my self right now."
1129,My depersonalization/derealization or feeling of dissociation came back. And I feel like I am losing my mind..,"TW: Suicide Talk. 

Last week, Someone I have known since I was a kid committed suicide. Prior to that incident another acquittance also took his own life.. 

It’s been months since I last posted here on reddit talking about my mental health issues, because the truth is, I was actually feeling better. So I tried to stay away from reddit and all mental health talks. Amidst the locked down and virus, I was actually feeling good til the recent unfortunate event. 

I think it started around the same time when I learned about the death of one of childhood here... Usually when I have episodes of dpdr or dissociation it would only last for a few minutes to hour... Or sometimes it would last for like half a day.. now its been a week.. and no matter how many times I have experienced dissociation/dpdr the feeling is still overwhelming and scary... 

Lately I haven’t been able to express emotions, I feel like I am losing my mind, I am having vivid imagery whenever I close my eyes, having hard time sleeping, and would feel everything around me isn’t real. I really feel like I am having schizophrenic/psychosis. I really don’t want to go crazy or lose my mind.. i’m scared. What shall I do? Help me please"
1130,I don’t wanna self diagnosis myself but should I see someone about this?,"I believe I might be bipolar I hate to be the type of person to self diagnosis myself just because it’s a trendy thing to do now.But I noticed the symptoms I have matched up very closely with the ones I looked up.I feel very numb some days and can get easily mad for not a lot.I tend to pace in circles or tap my foot excessively for like 15 mins when I get mad or nervous.And some days I feel like nothing can make me happy or excited,example I had a surprise party a few weeks ago for my birthday and I didn’t even smilie once the whole time and everyone was asking why and I seriously did not know I just couldn’t feel happy I just said I was tired.I would not be surprised if I was bipolar due to the fact a couple of years ago I was going through a period of depression  and had to take pills for it for a couple of months(diagnosed by a doctor).Just wanted to hear someone else’s opinion.And if I should see a medical professional about it."
1131,Can i get advice / help please?,"Hi. I’m 15f and i’m going to start this with i am a mute. I have ADHD, Depression, Schizophrenia. It’s scary. I can’t even talk to my therapist about how i feel. I write it down but i want to tell her how i actually feel. Even talking to my parents i write most things down. 
At school i get bullied, and i can’t say / do anything back or tell anything to anyone because i can’t speak so i guess i just let it happen. I tried to tell one of my teachers but she was new and didn’t realise i was a mute. She just thought i was quiet. 
I take meds and things for mental issues but it’s mostly the voices. They are really scary and they make me feel really bad. 
Also, i’m emotionally sensative because of ADHD. I have trouble processing my emotions. My friend called an ambulance because i kept fainting (12 times in a night) and it was because i kind of overdosed and yeah. I couldn’t speak when the paramedics were here and taking me to hospital, they didn’t know. I had to try to tell them but they figured it out. I had to get my tummy flushed which fkn hurt kinda bad actually, but i ended up silently crying and the nurse asked why i didn’t speak and told her that it hurt, i showed her on my phone that i was a mute. I should have said before, i know but it was my mistake. Same thing happened when i had to have injections into my arms when i was at the hospital. I was completely silent but ended up fainting again because i was so fkn scared. 
 
I just don’t know what to anymore. I can’t speak to anyone or call anyone or say how i’m feeling because i’m a mute. I feel like i’m trapped. I need to re-fill my meds soon but my mum has said i need to go on my own because she won’t be able to collect them so idk what to even do, but my mum said that they know i’m mute i think, but she is not sure. 

But yeah. I don’t even know what to do anymore. I have kinda stopped therapy because i just cried too much. I really wish that i could just tell her i’m sorry for wasting her time and tell her how i feel. I have had thoughts of jumping or overdosing again soon but idk. I know my mum will be sad. She is the only person who is nice to me. I love her so much."
1132,My concept of time/awareness.,"I’ve never understood how “now” will benefit me “tomorrow”. I have a bad concept of time, long periods of time. Maybe it’s just me being a very good procrastinator. I’m very distracted and can’t ever focus for too long. Sometimes I feel lost and don’t know where to go or what to do with my life. Days are the same and the year is a blur."
1133,Do you ever convince yourself for so long that you are ok . Then it builds up and one small thing sends you over the edge ?,"For example I have cystic fibrosis and I’ve been getting a lot of treatment . When everyone asks how I’m doing I just smile and say “everything is fine “ . I’ve been doing that for a couple months . It’s kinda like shaking a cola bottle , if you keep shaking it then BOOM . I was making a sandwich today and I dropped the knife on the floor by accident, so I sat on the floor and sobbed like a child that had just been told off . It was uncontrollable wailing . Over a knife . I tend to say nothing to anyone and put on a front and then I get to a point and just explode . Normally it’s almost impossible to annoy me , I’m really chill . Today I walked past a door knob and it caught my trousers and I screamed at it 😂 . I’m not sleeping . Could that be contributing?"
1134,"What's one thing that keeps your mental health intact, or at least boosts it?","For me, it's either running or time alone. Physical and mental health are quite interconnected for me, and I seem to be 50/50 introvert/extrovert so I need space too."
1135,How to deal with mental illness.,"First of all, hello. 

I want to keep this as short and sweet as possible. 
My partner and I are very connected, we talk about everything and we're each others go to. 

My partner was on the pill for a year, which can lead to developing a mental heath issue. She also has history of mental illness in her family. 

Basically, random thoughts will pop into her head, almost like she has another voice. 
She is a very emotional person (not physically, more with connection). 

For example; 
she might notice that i don't look my best that particular day, she will feel that she has to tell me, which i am fine with. (over time you get used to it) and after we discuss that it's okay. That's the end of it. 
Now because that topic is fresh in her head, it will stay with her and remind her every time she looks at me. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. 

We manage with it very well, some days she doesn't have to tell me anything, some days can be bad."
1136,Loneliness and trauma,How do you cope with it? I tried medications but they didn’t help. Thanks.
1137,A lot has happened in last 2 months which I feel has pushed me beyond my breaking point. It’s all getting a bit too much and I feel I have no one at all.,"I have been depressed for a while but I broke my ankle which lost me my job, my girlfriend of 7 years left me, she said she didn’t love me anymore and left. I’m spiralling deeper into drugs and alcohol. I can’t sleep at night. I feel exhausted all the time. I genuinely do not want to be here anymore. I don’t feel like I have anyone to say this too. I have tried to reach out but no one seems to take it seriously. I don’t think I want to see next year."
1138,Loosing Friends Because of Poor Mental Health,"How do you deal with this?

I'm trying to figure it out, I feel like all of mine are dropping out of my life right now because my mental health is terrible at the moment, so sometimes I push them all away, But the thing is, after I push them away, I want them back the next day. Because I'm so up and down and it's terrible. I don't know how to explain it to them, because I can only see how confusing I'm being on my up days. Some friends don't want to deal with it which I completely understand. I don't want to deal with it either and I really dislike this about myself.

On n a down day, I want someone to talk to so bad, but bc of how unstable I am, I have no one, so then I go in a spiral and think terrible things. 

Does anyone have any advice with this? I'm only able to ask bc today is an ""up"" day. Hopefully I'll take the advice today and apply for my next ""down"" one. I hate how much of a roller coaster I'm on these days. It sucks. But thank you so much for your advice!"
1139,I’m thinking about killing myself.,"M13

I’m young and it probably sounds petty but I want to kill myself. I’m a pain in the ass for my family and my social life is atrocious. My best friend has so many girls fawning over him and I know it’s not his fault but it makes me feel self conscious. He’s the 100 and I’m the 0. I want to live, but it’s like my past choices and actions won’t allow it currently, or ever. I’m a fucking mess 

with the current state Im in right now, I’m going to end up killing myself. I’ve thought it over loads. I’d tell everyone my inner feelings and then just jump out of my window, never knowing their thoughts. 

just venting. don’t give me the corny “it’s not worth it” “your just a kid” cuz that’s happened loads before."
1140,My mental illness has made me weak and I hate it,"How is it possible that when everyone tells me I am okay and that I am such a strong person, I myself cannot believe it? All my life I have been quite ambitious, I have considered others weak for giving up on their goals or wasting their time on things that don't matter. And yet, my anxiety and depression have made me come to a state in which I feel a thousand times worse about myself now. I feel like I don't have the motivation to do better, anything I try will not matter as life will find a way to fuck things over anyway. I am a first-year university student and I was so excited to start studying. Now I just feel like I want to drop out. I try so hard to act like my life and I as a whole am like I was before but that's just not the truth. I need meds to function properly, I can maintain my usual mood for mostly half a day and the other half is full of worries, anxiety, intrusive thoughts. I used to have a very strong opinion about everything and would hold onto my opinion, but now I am just full of doubts all the time and I feel like I can't even make good decisions about my life. I didn't expect to fall into this emotional loophole especially now. I want to feel like myself again, I want to be resilient to everything that is happening. But right now nothing feels worth it."
1141,I feel so empty and numb right now,I’m not going to go into details as to why I feel this way but it’s a feeling I’ve never felt before. Like I can’t describe how I’m feeling. I feel so empty and numb that I can’t express my emotions correctly. I believe it’s tied to my depression and anxiety that I felt so overwhelmed and started to shut down for the last 5 days. I guess if you come across so much negativity everyday that it can do a number on you. I can’t even enjoy some of my interests that kept me going anymore. Does anyone know what I’m talking about?
1142,"If you need help, I'm here.","I've always loved helping people my whole life. If there's anything you want to talk about, DM me or just reply to this post. Please know that I'm not a therapist, I don't know a thing about therapy, but hey, regular person on regular person is great!"
1143,My grandparents smoke,They smoke with me in the car FYI I’m 12 and I know second hand smoke is bad for me I have told them that they don’t care they just continue to smoke and it’s annoying because I can’t breath in the car and it hurts to breath with the smoke. Anyway how do I tell them that I don’t like it without making them upset my grandpa thinks every time I ask them to do something I am being rude 🙄
1144,"Always clenching jaw and hands, advice?","Hi my name is Hannah, I’m a 26 year old single mother with a cvs receipt list of anxiety issues! (OCD, adjustment disorder, dependent personality disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder) and to top it all off, I’m getting ready to move to a different state with my children and going to be living with my sister and her husband. It’s safe to say my issues are at a 9 literally all day long. The thing is, I’ve noticed my TMJ getting worse from constantly clenching my jaw/face pain and I recently noticed I’ve been squeezing my hands into a fist/digging my nails into my palm. Both of which I do without even thinking about it (and also in my sleep). I’m already on medications for long term help with my anxiety, but this move is a whole different kind of story and my meds can only do so much. Things I’ve tried: Meditation, Essential oils, journaling, coloring, and therapy for years. 
Does anyone have any home remedies/advice on things I can do to stop these tendencies?"
1145,This is why I can't have nice things,"I didn't even have a bad day but here I am, crying in my room about oh all the curios little dumb things I always cry about, how I can't stand myself because I am a terrible lazy ass person who can't get shit done, my indecisiveness and so on. It comes and goes, but today is one of those days I think I realize how everything about me is one huge fake. 

Everything I do feels like a fake, like a parody of myself, my grades must be a fake because apparently it seems to me like I'm doing way too little or nothing at all and my personality probably is fake too like how do I have those amazing friends when I'm like this - no way they'd like me this way so it has to be a facade I'm putting up right?
And my looks are so fake too my skin is so bad no one can see past that, not even ahen I wear make up and neither can one overlook my squishy flubber like body.
I'd love to dress nicely but no matter what I'm gonna end up looking like a pathetic wannabe anyways. 

I feel like the whiniest brat out there but I genuinely think that everyone around me is just nice out of pity.

 I can't take my friends seriously when they say they like me because why should they? I'm not good looking neither do I have an outstanding personality or charisma or anything at all. I cut off my hair to change things and got lots of compliments and then my mother came around and told me it makes me look even fatter than I already am. So did they just say something to be nice? I ordered some clothes and I was told so see them as a present for Christmas, only to cancel the order two hours later, because the things I got wouldn't look on my no matter what and after all I can't waste my parents money like that.

My head is all over the place, it hurts, my eyes hurt, I can't breathe because my nose is so snotty. 

All I want is to be a good person.

And I know that tomorrow morning the world won't look as terrible as it does now and some sleep will do wonders, but in a few days or weeks or months I'll have a new number many little situations and instances saved up in my mind for another night of fun ahead.

If you read this I'm sorry for all of this crap but somehow I had to get it out. Thank you for staying and please keep on going forward."
1146,Disabled with mental health disorders?,"Hey y'all, I've been disabled/chronically ill for a very long time (since I was a toddler, in fact), and I take very good care of myself (It is my body, I'm used to it and see no difference in methods of self-care). But because I take such good care of myself, I feel embarrassed that I have mental health disorders, and I blame myself for it. In my mind, I should be able to have a grip on reality because I have such good control with my physical health. Have any of you ever felt this way and figured out a way to be more self-compassionate? Do you have any general advice that could help?

I appreciate it, thanks in advance."
1147,Strange sensation??,"I started Wellbutrin this morning and my morning was as usual and then just spent the afternoon in bed and then in the evening I went to town and as I was driving I just felt strange and everything seemed kind of unfamiliar kind of a dazed and lost feeling I guess. After being home a few Minutes the strange unfamiliar feeling is starting to subside, I wish I could describe it better than it just being strange and everything seeming different but I can’t. Any idea what it could be??"
1148,Is this a thing I should bring up with my therapist? Tw: brief mention of sexual assault,"Ever since I was a young child I was always weird about money and presents. I always hated when people spent money on me, even when they assured me it was no burden to them and that they wanted to do it to be nice to me. It is one weird big cycle where I will avoid spending money on things, even things I really need, refuse to use anything I own for as long as I possibly can, and then once I DO use it I will continue to use it long past I should. 
A good example for me it with shoes, I will wear one pair every day for YEARS even though I have one to two pairs still in their boxes with the tags on that I was forced to get by my parents.
Money is even worse, I will go for months at a time without buying anything and then in a few weeks I will wipe out my debit account and then feel so anxious and distressed that I will go another couple months spending nothing.
I am already in therapy for PTSD after I was sexually assaulted as a child. Part of me wonders if my behavior stems from my abuser buying me gifts? Or because of the 2008 housing crash? Logically that would make sense, neither of those events FEEL particularly associated to this behavior. Not to mention that I remember doing this long before either of those difficult life events happened.
My parents however, think that this is all just a quirk of mine, and say that it’s just part of my personality. My dad is an accountant so he is proud of how frugal I am with my money and objects and often says I do a good job managing money. I believed him for a long time but today I was doing one of my account wipes and I realized I had tapped into another account that I hadn’t meant to because I overspent. I was crippled with the anxiety for a few hours afraid to even turn on the lights or use water because it was spending too much money, so now I think I might have serious issues. 

TL;DR
I hoard items, refuse to replace items, have periods of extreme frugality and extreme spending. My dad is an accountant though and says I do a good job with my money and I don’t have any reason I can think of why I am this way."
1149,Help me understand my weird emotional moments,"I've been struggling with mental health for a couple of years, but the last few months I've been really making a lot of progress. However, there is a part of me that I don't understand at all, and I'm hoping you guys could maybe help me understand a bit more. 

My issues (mainly depression and anxiety) started around when I first felt this. One afternoon, when I was around 15 or 16 (I'm 20 now), I first discovered watching series/movies. I didn't like it much before but a friend recommended one to me and I watched it. It was a really weird and intense experience, since I recognised myself in the story and characters a lot. I started to get a really emotional response, like I felt like crying a lot and I did. 

Now, I recognize there's such a thing as getting emotional during movies. I get that as well, but there's a difference. Visual media especially triggers this weird emotional response, and often hours after watching it I still feel it. It can happen during any kind of scene, not just the sad/emotional ones, and when it happens I end up losing focus on whatever I'm watching and just put it away because I can't concentrate. 

The feeling I would describe as being a sort of sadness. It often feels very childlike, like I feel like a child who's feeling sad or scared and wants to go to it's mother to be comforted and be told that everything's going to be alright. It can really feel a little overwhelming and I am often stuck for hours in bed, laying there with my eyes closed and pretending that there's someone there who's telling me comforting things and giving me a hug. 

It has come to a point where I'm purposefully staying away from watching movies or series, especially when I am alone, because the response is almost guaranteed when I do and it's really not a pleasant experience. 

Perhaps it's just a normal thing that everyone gets to some degree. Maybe it's just the emotional response that movies and series are trying to get out of you, that maybe I am really sensitive for. But something in me tells me it's more than that, and I was hoping maybe for an outsider this appears more clear or is maybe relatable?"
1150,Most people who have bpd have childhood trauma and abuse. I have never been abused but I truly believe I have it? How does this make sense?,"I don't have abandonment issues but I have issues with people misunderstanding me and when I try and explain as much as possible and they don't see my point of view, I get really frustrated and angry. I do cut but it's not out of shame but guilt and most of it has to do with me. I don't cut after having relationship issues. I also do it because of anxiety. I don't do it that often either. My biggest issue is my anger that's been affecting everyone around me but I do it for valid reasons. If I get triggered in some way I try and defend myself but when they don't understand my point of view and think I'm always wrong is when I get really angry. Anyway, I apparently have bipolar and schizophrenia but it was a preliminary diagnosis and I'm pretty sure it's a misdiagnosis."

1153,My (19M) sister (17F) suffers from anxiety and freaks out whenever I leave the house for more than three to four hours. What do I do?,"Hey everyone I hope you're doing okay. I'm just looking for help here because I feel like this sub knows what to do, or at least might guide me in the right direction.

My little sister suffers from anxiety. She's had it for awhile but it got really bad over this summer. I've never been great with this kind of stuff, but we had a rough childhood growing up so I tried to be understanding and supportive. For background we lived with our dysfunctional mother until I was twelve. We then moved in with our dad who is a good guy that made sure we had a stable middle/high school experience.

Anyway I'm in college now and I stayed online this semester because of the pandemic. I didn't mind online college but I missed my friends at school; it also didn't help that most of my friends from HS moved back to their dorms or apartments. This is only relevant because due to them being gone I pretty much stayed in most nights. 

So my friends come home for Thanksgiving  and I start going out more. Every night my sister blows up my phone around 11 claiming that I'm being selfish, I'm staying out ""way"" too late (I've never come home past 12:30) and that I need to come home. One night resulted in her having a complete meltdown and screaming that I was a horrible brother. I stayed home that night but the next night she immediately launched back into it.

She always says incredibly hurtful things to me. I haven't seen my friends in several months and I just wanted to see them again, but whenever I do my phone gets blown up. It gets to the point where I don't even wanna see my friends anymore. I just feel like a total piece of shit even though I know I'm being fairly reasonable in what I'm doing. I'm a boxer, and the anxiety I get when I tell my family I'm going out is comparable to what I feel before a fight: butterflies in my stomach, super fast heartbeat, trouble speaking without stuttering etc. She just immediately acts like I'm being a terrible person.

She refuses to go to therapy because she doesn't want to ""talk to a stranger."" She has been prescribed medication but she claims she doesn't take them. She is constantly afraid that someone will break into our house, but we live in an incredibly safe town with virtually no crime. We are bordered by some of the most affluent towns in the state as well.

What sparked this post was something that happened tonight. My friends wanted to rent an Airbnb for a couple nights to celebrate New Year's. The place we found is just under two hours away and we'll be going for three days. I asked my dad if I could go and my sister started shouting and cursing all over the place, continuously yelling ""three fucking days?"" while acting absolutely shocked. Keep in mind I've left for 4-7 day trips on three different occasions with my friends this year, and every time they've been for distances far longer away. She did not seem upset then, but now I bring up three days and all of a sudden I am being a cruel brother who won't spend New Year's with my family.

I'm at the end of my rope here guys. I don't know what to do. It's like whenever I leave the house I'm just being selfish in her eyes. She won't seek help on her own; she has before and claims it doesn't work. She calls me all kinds of horrible names and wakes up my dad to make him stay up until I come home. It makes my blood boil too because my father is a very hardworking man but I know screaming at her won't do anything so I keep my grievances to myself.

What do I do here? How do I help her? I know these things have no simple answer but I really want to help her out. I tried to sacrifice for her sake but no matter what I do I'm always the bad guy whenever I leave the house."
1154,"Perfectionism has completely sucked out the enjoyment from my life, and left me with nothing but insecurities.","I’m 17 and I’m regularly struggling with perfectionism. I set these unrealistically high expectations for myself with my skateboarding, songwriting and guitar playing all of which used to be hobbies that I loved and was passionate about, but now are my main sources of disappointment. 

I’m always getting frustrated when I don’t reach my expectations and keep asking myself “is this bad” then analyzing every little thing I do obsessively for 45 minutes. I’m always late with school assignments now as well, because I try to make them perfect and even though I know what I’m supposed to do, stress over the wording to the point where I’m emotionally drained and feel disorganized and on the wrong track. 

I also used to be super in love with music, I was absolutely passionate about it. But then I started obsessing over making Spotify playlists, and associated them with a sense of self-fulfillment. I always make playlists, obsess over the organization of them and then delete and remake them to the point that I can’t even enjoy music anymore. I keep thinking people are going to judge me if the organization of album cover colours are not perfect. 

This is ruining my life, it’s consuming me. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I know I have potential to be happy but how the fuck do I live life normally?"
1155,I’ve been really upset about my birthday and I’m not sure if I was being too sensitive maybe?,"Long read?

So, 3 of my friends were aware of my birthday. I told my friend mark what I wanted to do and he said we could do that, which was just stay home and watch a movie. My other two friends apparently wanted to do something, but I wasn’t aware. One of them (let’s call her Lisa)texted me and asked if I wanted to go to dinner as a group so I said yes. I specifically told her where and what time. 5pm at ray’s near the mall.

Fast forward to my birthday and the 3 of them were at the mall at 2pm. They texted me and asked me where I was. I was taking a nap and obviously wasn’t able to respond. I woke up around 245 and called one of them back (James) and he tells me they were hanging out and had some food because I didn’t answer. I told them I would just go back to sleep because it made no sense to eat dinner after they already ate? 

I hung up and cried and I was pretty upset. Lisa texted me several times apologizing and saying she got the times mixed up. I didn’t respond to her cause I was really upset and didn’t want to say anything I’d regret, so I asked mark to tell her it’s fine and that I just need some time to cool off. I started to vent with mark and I told him that I felt like what they did was kind of messed up and inconsiderate. He got pretty upset and told me I need to stop attacking his character and he told me we should talk once things cool down a little. I got mad and told him I’m just venting and I needed to get it off my chest, but he wasn’t having it. I apologized and just ended the conversation. No one really texted me afterwards or called, which I can probably understand why. 

Later on I called mark and he was hanging out with Lisa and they were watching a movie. It’s exactly what I wanted to do, and it bothered me. I told him I was just making sure we were good and he invited me over, but I declined. I was in a bad mood and I didn’t want to cause trouble. I already felt like I was being a burden on my friends and I knew I would be snapping on them. 

So, anyway. I’ve been really upset about it and I kind of feel like not speaking to mark or Lisa again. I know I’m still upset and I shouldn’t make any decisions when I feel this way, but I always feel like they just tolerate me. 

I spoke to mark about this one time, about how no one ever asks to hang out, I always have to initiate it, or no one ever wants to come by my place, or how I’m usually talked over, mark told me I’m always the one initiating things so no one feels the need to do the same. I told him it still bothered me that I’m the person that has to do that, and he told me “we aren’t good with that and you are”. 

Am I being a huge brat about all of this? They’re overall good friends, but maybe it’s my own insecurities that get in the way of me enjoying my friendship with them? I don’t know... 

I don’t feel this way with other people or my other friends. Just this group. Maybe I just don’t fit in with them. Anyway, thabks in advance."

1159,When people die it doesn’t really effect me..,"My dad passed this year, although very mentally ill he is what I based my philosophy off of. He OD’d on heroin which was possibly the most blissfully he could go honestly. 


My great aunt whom I was close with died from suicide.


Both the ways they died I can deeply connect with. I’ve been through a fair share of drug dependencies and suicide attempts. However, I don’t really feel like it’s necessarily a bad thing that they are gone. I’m not particularly religious, so I’m like 50/50 that there is some sort of afterlife. I don’t believe they should be punished for their actions if there is one, that’s absurd but almost all religions have ‘outlawed’ what they’ve done. 


I don’t feel anything surrounding their deaths, and I’m not sure if that makes me strong, or if it makes me weak."
1160,Help identifying what I have,"This thing has started to terrorize me in the past few months and I don't know what it is. Usually when I'm alone or with my thoughts, with no distractions (ie trying to go to sleep), I'll start to disassociate with reality. It's hard to explain but I'll try to give good examples. If I'm laying in bed and start imagining myself falling out of a plane I feel like I could ""teleport"" there any second. There are multiple other examples like spontaneously being in space, being teleported to a black hole, or being really far under the ocean. Whatever the situation it leads to intense fear for my life, existential dread, and feeling like reality isn't solid and could slip at any second. I don't know what this is or if it even has a name. I'm sorry if it sounds stupid or I didn't explain it well but any help identifying it or finding grounding techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
1161,How do I get over the fact the most of the people I trust still are close friends with the person who’s actions and subsequent gaslighting worsened my mental health to serious levels?,"For context the person was awfully invasive of my privacy, which he openly admitted was to see what my “porn tastes”, to quote them, “boy where they good”, but got an insight on my worsening mental health. He then used the sensitive information to try blackmail me into getting help for my mental health. He hid behind the self richeous belief that he did nothing wrong for a year. Until I confronted him about it, where he proceeded to gaslight me into a state of near daily suicidal thoughts. He still believes I was a cunt about the situation. He was the axis around which the friend circle I have been in for years has revolved around. So when this situation came to light I had to leave. I don’t know what to do to be honest. My other friends are still very supportive. I just don’t understand how they can look at him the same way after they knew what he did to me, and can in fact brush it off as, “yeah he’s like that,” 

I don’t know what to do about it. I can’t talk to my friends about hit because the mer mention of it’s name sends me in a downward spiral.

I don’t expect much help. It’s just nice to vent, without the paranoia about sharing thoughts like this I have after the situation described above."

1163,Sex Addict Roommate Manipulation,"I hope my story is appropriate to post in this sub.

*IT'S LONG I KNOW BUT PLEASE READ*

Long story short I met a friendly and trustworthy guy not but 3 days ago. Prior I had been desperately looking for a place for my wife and I to live(bad renters credit). Dude invites me over to chill and crack a few beers. Mentioned my situation and he immediately proposed letting my wife and I room with him. I could tell early on this fellow was lonely but I didn't make any haste assumptions or judgments, because after all he is, genuinely nice. He even offered my wife and I the master bedroom with walk in closet and bathroom. It was just me the first couple nights whilst my wife was preparing her belongings at her parents. I wont keep you waiting any longer. Dude is quite obviously a habitual, long term sex addict and is most likely the reason he is alone wanting to share his intense, devious and dark fantasies. Me feeling contractually obligated. Give ear and express interest and genuine curiosity. Whatever whatever hes bi has a 4 year old daughter he cant see, ex wife whatever. Into swinger sex getting pegged dogging out his girl. I personally cannot relate because I know monogamous, vanilla(sex) relationships are healthier for myself and others most of the time. I subtly express that belief to him and it glazed right over him. (LESS we forget I bought him a ball of meth to cover this months rent. Which is my DOC and impeding on my stuggle to stay clean). Here's where I'm annoyed, hes telling me he wants and loves to get pegged by girls wearing huge dildos. Asks if my wife would do that to him. I, visibly uncomfortable, didn't know what to say. If my place to live wasnt on the line i would put my foot down but instead I tell him that my wife wants to peg me lol (she actually does but i aint bout more than a fingernails length) he keeps pestering me about if she would do that for him. Angerly and cowardly, i finally respond with something like, ""she might idk, but probably not"" because we are LDS and faithful to each other AND THAT WAS IT. THESE LAST 2 DAYS i have been trying to make it abundantly clear that neither of us will do anything sexually with him. But he only heard what he wanted to hear apparently. Earlier today i picked up my wife and our belongings so she could properly move in. The wife and I had been apart due to external bullshit so we are eager to finally be living together. So we take a shower and have sex before she went to work. I was already uncomfortable about dude man beating it to our commotion but it wasn't too detrimental until not but 10 minutes later he sends me a pervy text basically asking if my wife could fondle him before she went to work. Currently arguing with him because what he heard is me tell him my wife would for sure do stuff like that and I'd be okay with it. WHICH I NEVER SAID hes clearly twisting my words and using the apartment as leverage. so I'm in a tough spot right now. Obviously i should have been direct and straight up from the start (WHICH I MOSTLY WAS) but now we are here. 

Any suggestions/advice is highly appreciated, thanks for reading."
1164,What have you lost since Covid 19?,"I went through high school around 2015 and had a fair share of being picked on, mostly by girls and the odd guy. But I managed to be in a loose friendship group, maybe I took friendships for granted, but they didn't make me feel great about myself, it felt like the best thing I could get.
I moved to London to go to university and loved almost everyone in my class of about 50. We went out to bars and explored the city every other day. I really felt like these were real friendships and I didn't feel so alone anymore (for context I've suffered with depression and anxiety possibly since 13 and began medication in my 2nd year at uni).
Covid put the UK into its first lockdown just as we were in the final months of our graduation year and we all split off to complete our crumbling degrees online.

I haven't seen them since our last class, which was probably a year ago, I've exchanged small conversations and tried to reach out to some of them, which I already find hard dealing with anxiety. 
I had to leave the city since I couldn't find a job of any kind and often see them on social media all hanging out still. 

I'm back living with my parents, thinking of all these friendships I've had the chance to keep, but wasn't confident or out going enough to maintain. 

I came off anti-depressants before my final year, and with CBT I was becoming pretty strong, my CV which I'd developed since I was 16 even had some big companies on it which I'd worked for years to get, and I managed to secure a First.

My anxiety has grown at a faster pace, I've still not found a job, I don't even get job rejection emails because I don't get any responses at all.
But over all I don't understand how people just simply have friends, let alone best friends.

It was some world mental health day not long ago, and everyone was posting 'check up on your friends' on social media, some of them know about the anti-depressants, therapy, and the reasons behind, but I  guess as it's stated word-for-word, you have to be their friend to be checked up on."
1165,toxic relationship,"why does a toxic relationship seems hard to let go? i've known this one guy over a year ago, where in the first place he was my friend, sooner we both caught feelings of each other, we dated over 8 months, where i discovered his bad sides, but still i was willing to accept all his goods and bads, and the relationship ended because i couldnt stand his jealousy. but we kept intouch like how we used to be when we were in a relationship until one day, he found someone new on January 2020. what a bad way to start new year where i lost my mind, i didnt attaned my classes, skipped meals and started t develop some other mental issue, but he still tried to contact me when he was in a relationship with another female, but his relationship lasted less than a month. this isnt the only time it happened but four times, yes imagine January- October the same cycle, I keep giving him another chance because I believe every person deserves another chance. At the same time, he keep hurting me more and more, but it seems very hard to let him go. i let myself being mentally abused by him, going to bed with tears in my eyes is just another routine of mine. with this current pandemic, everything sums up together with my online learning, family issues and now relationship issues. i dont expect much but thank you for spending so much time reading this, i have no one to rely on. anther day i woke up feeling hopeless, and the cycle keep repeating. 

hope you have a nice day :)"
1166,I need to vent,My dog recently passed away and I can’t stand it. I have so much guilt and sadness. I miss her so much. I can’t help but cry every night. I need to see her again but I can’t. I wanna be with her but I can’t kms. That’ll just make it worse for my family. I miss her so much. I just wish I kissed her in the head before we left the vet and told her I loved her one last time. I just wanna go back to when she didn’t have cancer and make her stay that way forever and live with us forever. But die once we die so she won’t be lonely. Gosh I’m gonna cry while writing this. I miss you so much (not saying her name for my privacy). I normally don’t talk about my problems because they really don’t matter. People have it way worse so I just don’t say anything about them. I’m sorry but I needed to say something now about how I feel and finally let my feelings out.

1168,Just been thinking..,"So I’ve been thinking to myself, I’ve walked away from my passive suicidal ideations and I feel good. 

I’ve gotten rid of all my drugs and alcohol, and a lot of other useless shit I bought for no reason.

Though I feel it’s necessary I leave my friends be, and just spend time with my family. 

Many of my friends are living happy lives and I feel it’s just selfish if I come in as some depressed little twat constantly “killing the vibe”. 

They haven’t said anything to me directly but I can tell that my energy is a bit of a turn off for them, and with all honesty I don’t even blame them. 

Me and my family are also moving and heading off to a brand new area to start fresh.

I don’t want to be a burden for anyone, and I don’t want my friends constantly thinking about me and my depressive proclivities. 

I’ve relied way too heavily on other people to make me feel better, and obviously it hasn’t helped me one bit.

I’m going to continue with my therapy and focus on healthy coping habits, so I can go back to pursuing my goals.

I do love my friends and I will miss them, but I can’t live with this thought that I’m being “annoying”. 

I’ve already changed my number, deactivated my social media accounts and haven’t told any of them where I’m headed. 

I really just don’t want to talk to any of them anymore, and just want to start 2021 with a brand new positive mindset."
1169,My mother abused me horribly as a child. She is a different person now and I feel like it would crush her if I brought it up for closure.,"My mom was very emotionally and verbally abusive. A few rare times physically abusive too. She used to tell 7 year old me that I was evil and ""could kill"". I used to think I was literal demon spawn. She used to tell me she would have a better life if she didn't have me. I made a collage of words like ""beautiful"", ""smart"", ""successful"" to hang in my room because I wanted to be those things and she told me to stop telling myself that I am something I'm not. She slapped me across the face for dropping a cereal bowl. She used to joke about me and humiliate me in public...she'd get other adults to laugh at me. I had to go to the ER with chest pain when I was 13 or 14 and the doctor said it was stress related and that I needed therapy. When we got back in the car she screamed at me the whole way home driving like a maniac and telling me to stop telling lies for attention. More doctors suggested therapy and medication and refused to let me go to therapy or be put on antidepressants. 

One time, desperately wanting a mom, I thought I'd be vulnerable and tell her I love her and she replied with ""ok"". One day as she was dropping me at school she told me she wanted to commit suicide and that maybe my dad would find someone new. She used to buy my friends gifts like clothing and jewelry that she knew they would like and make these little personalized fabric dolls for them and never once did she do that for me. Sounds minor but seeing my mom give gifts and handmade crafts to my friends and then be told ""ok"" when I say ""I love you"" it crushed me.

The list goes on and every night I lay in bed with these memories popping up involuntarily. And the thing is that my mom was mentally ill. And she is conpletely different now. I don't even recognize that person. She still can't say things like ""I love you"" but she gives me hugs and jokes around and I know that when she does those things she means ""I love you"".

I ended up starting to work as a preschool teacher and I'd tell her cute stories about the kids and one time she just said ""I was a terrible mom"". I didn't know what to say because she looked so sad. 

The memories eat away at me when I have time to think and it's even worse now during covid when time is all I've got. I'm not really sure what to do because I don't want to hurt her but I also feel so angry. When I remember her slapping me I want to walk up to her now and do the same thing, and that anger is so toxic.

Not sure what to do. But I am putting this out there hoping that it may help me feel some closure."
1170,I don't know how to feel ok again (21F),"So basically even if Covid-19 wasn't a thing, this would have still been the worst year of my life. My uncle who I was close to got diagnosed with cancer during the summer. My dog who I had since I was seven years old and I was extremely close to died in October. She slept in my room every night with me and I couldn't sleep in my room without her for three weeks after she died because it felt to horrible without her in it. About three weeks after she died my uncle who was diagnosed with cancer passed away at the age of 52. I always heard about cancer and I knew it was horrible, but to see such a strong big man deteriorate into nothing because of this disease was honestly traumatic. I couldn't have prepare myself for it. I'm grieving for both my uncle and my dog which I'm really struggling with because grieving for one of them would have been so difficult on it's own, let alone both. I haven't been able to eat properly because of the grief, even though I am trying because I want to make an effort to stay healthy, but the only thing I could stomach today was noodles and I tried to eat a bowl of coco pops but I couldn't finish it. I'm in my third year of university and I'm a pretty good student with a high QCA (Irish university grading system), but I'm finding it so difficult to do anyway and I think I'm going to fail this semester which I'm terrified of.  Its stressing me out so much. I just can't cope with any of this."
1171,venting,"hi i know my problem is insignificant but i need to put it somewhere

my parents don't seem to understand anything about mental health or anything. it was kind of a huge tip-off when the counselor called my mom to school to let her know that i thought about dying, and then when we got home my mom just gave me a lecture about how i need to tell her these things. i can't just tell parents everything when i know it's just gonna make them upset.

and then there's the thing where it seems my dad doesn't think it's normal to be emotional or whatever. he asked me something why i was doing bad in class and i just cried because it was just my fault that i wasn't able to focus in class anymore (online class and whatnot). every other student was able to keep up with the work so it's just my own ineptitude i guess. then he got mad because i was crying and not answering and he says this stuff like ""just stop crying, it's not helping anything"" and ""i have a lot of work to do, you are wasting both of our time"" and i just want to explode because i can't control when i cry or hyperventilate (is that the right word?). he always says stuff like this. i don't know what to do if my parents don't understand it at all/and if they are this hostile to me over me crying. and i just don't know what it will take for them to understand anything. if they didn't get the hint when the counselor called them to school and if they get mad when i do a basic human function like crying, then i think it is a lost cause.

and i've resolved never to vent to my friends because it'll just worry them unnecessarily with a problem they can't fix.

there was just no one to explain to. not my family, not anyone. i can't just make myself be good at school anymore. i think i'm going to explode

thanks for reading my dumb words, if you are there"
1172,Going from content to anxious really quickly multiple times a day?,"My mood has been changing so frequently lately. A lot of times I’m calm but I’ll change to being anxious in just an hour or few minutes or so. Then, in some more hours, I’ll go back to being calm, and then become anxious. This happens again and again. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t actually have reasons for my anxiety to be so high so I don’t really understand why I feel this way. But sometimes I’ll remember something specific and it’ll instantly make me anxious. I wish I was calm all the time."
1173,I need advice,"I randomly get overcome by depressive feelings because of a couple of reasons. I went to a GP who thinks it is serious, who referred me to a psychologist, but there is a massive waiting list, until a fair bit into next month. I think I just need advice on what to think about to combat these feelings, any advice would be much appreciated :)."
1174,Overthinking when doing something challenging.,"Hi I'm a 17 year old male and idk if this is just a stage, something that everyone goes through or what. Whenever I do anything that's challenging like working out and studying my mind goes haywire basically crippling me to the point that I can't take it anymore and I stop whatever challenge I was doing. It's gotten to this point that it even breaches into the things I love doing like video games. You can probably tell how destructive this can be. I'm afraid it's starting to manifest itself into anything that I do and that I won't be able to accomplish anything. I've never opened up like this before but I know that I have to overcome this before it becomes all the more destructive."
1175,I feel like I’m dying.,I feel like I’m dying.
1176,Reposting because some comments felt confrontational and I'm just here for support. My mom abused me horribly when I was younger. She is different now and now I feel like I'd crush her if I brought it up for closure.,"My mom was very emotionally and verbally abusive. A few rare times physically abusive too. She used to tell 7 year old me that I was evil and ""could kill"". I used to think I was literal demon spawn. She used to tell me she would have a better life if she didn't have me. I made a collage of words like ""beautiful"", ""smart"", ""successful"" to hang in my room because I wanted to be those things and she told me to stop telling myself that I am something I'm not. She slapped me across the face for dropping a cereal bowl. She used to joke about me and humiliate me in public...she'd get other adults to laugh at me. I had to go to the ER with chest pain when I was 13 or 14 and the doctor said it was stress related and that I needed therapy. When we got back in the car she screamed at me the whole way home driving like a maniac and telling me to stop telling lies for attention. More doctors suggested therapy and medication and refused to let me go to therapy or be put on antidepressants. 

One time, desperately wanting a mom, I thought I'd be vulnerable and tell her I love her and she replied with ""ok"". One day as she was dropping me at school she told me she wanted to commit suicide and that maybe my dad would find someone new. She used to buy my friends gifts like clothing and jewelry that she knew they would like and make these little personalized fabric dolls for them and never once did she do that for me. Sounds minor but seeing my mom give gifts and handmade crafts to my friends and then be told ""ok"" when I say ""I love you"" it crushed me.

The list goes on and every night I lay in bed with these memories popping up involuntarily. And the thing is that my mom was mentally ill. And she is conpletely different now. I don't even recognize that person. She still can't say things like ""I love you"" but she gives me hugs and jokes around and I know that when she does those things she means ""I love you"".

I ended up starting to work as a preschool teacher and I'd tell her cute stories about the kids and one time she just said ""I was a terrible mom"". I didn't know what to say because she looked so sad. 

The memories eat away at me when I have time to think and it's even worse now during covid when time is all I've got. I'm not really sure what to do because I don't want to hurt her but I also feel so angry. When I remember her slapping me I want to walk up to her now and do the same thing, and that anger is so toxic.

Not sure what to do. But I am putting this out there hoping that it may help me feel some closure."
1177,Advice for my friend who’s brother is having a bipolar episode and is acting not himself,"Today my friend told me that she had just found out her brother was bipolar when he came home last night after a fight with his girlfriend. Things went downhill about an hour later and he began acting weird. He started saying how he wanted kids all of a sudden and said he would kidnap her and their dog. She was terrified and didn’t know what to do. He said a lot of things enough to scare her and so she locked herself in the bathroom. It’s been hours, but her brothers still having an episode and his pulse is high. He’s still saying strange stuff and he’s also bothering her. She’s scared that he might harm someone or himself. Her parents haven’t called 911 because they’re unsure. they don’t know if they can force him to go to the doctor because he doesn’t want to go and be put on medication and hes also an adult. What she’s been telling me is scary and I don’t know how much I can help her. What would should her family do?? He’s staying over at their house and she’s scared of him."
1178,I don't know what makes me happy anymore.,"I'm at a point in my life where I don't even know if I have the energy to continue. I'm exhausted all the time and have no energy to pursue anything I like. I'm not sleeping. My new job is killing me (night shift online picker) and I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like my goals in life are forever out of reach. I'm never going to achieve them. So whats the point. I want happiness but any time i feel it my brain automatically switches to thinking about something bad or sad or my anxiety creates a scenario that i cant get out of my head.

I'm so lost. I just don't see the point in anything."
1179,help me,I think i need a mental evaluation. i am 15 and have autism. recently ive just been feeling empty. No feelings. Just nothing. I feel like a robot. I have no sympathy for anyone.. not even my family. why cant i be normal?
1180,"Crisis, need to get through the next few weeks","Hi everyone,

I tried to write this post explaining the entire story of what led to this breakdown but it's too much to write/I can't get my thoughts out coherently so I'll skip that. Never had great mental health but these last 6 months have put me in the worst state I've ever been in. I'm currently having a full mental breakdown during my first semester of law school exams. I have no motivation to study or get out of bed before the sun sets. I feel empty and depressed; I've never self harmed before this semester but have begun doing so with the mentality that I am desensitizing myself to commit suicide because right now I'm too afraid. I have dreams every night where I interact with people and then I wake up and it takes me a while to remember what is real. There's so much more but my brain feels like it's so full of thoughts/emotions that I can't get everything out.

I guess I'm wondering what to do to get through exams right now, or in general."
1181,Can't communicate,"Im in my 30s with no friends and avoid doing anything in front of other people. I feel incompetent and it shows. People always misunderstand me. Everybody hates me and I've been told I am a bad person. As a kid I was bullied in school and a disappointment to my mother.

Things have settled down between my mother and I but we still can't talk about personal things.

I think my biggest issue is that I have trouble communicating. I am unable to have conversations with people because I either don't know how to articulate my thoughts or I just don't know what to say. I also have terrible memory. This get's in the way of life to the extent that I can't do things I need to. Anything that requires me to interact with people, like going shopping, visiting the doctor, phoning customer service or buying a car. I think it is a miracle that I have gotten by to this point but I am just waiting for a scenario that I will be unable to deal with.

Have this anger right now I wish I could shake. Anger for how people talk about me and treat me with spite. They can't see me for who I really am."
1182,I got myself and someone else banned for showing support and I feel horrible??,"Today I finally worked up the courage to speak up and make a post for the first time on r/depression after a long battle with myself. I will attach what I posted here:


“The Cycle.

Personally speaking, browsing this thread has been a breath of fresh air for me. This is because venting to a friend or family member only further reinforces this so called cycle I’m about to explain. Profound sadness, hopelessness and emotional torment obviously play a huge part in depression, but what a lot of people don’t mention is the frustration- which is a major part of the cycle. You’re miserable, you despise yourself so much you’re unable to function. You can’t help but get hung up on the situation you’re currently in which is intoxicating to you to the brim. You genuinely don’t know what to do with yourself, everything is so overwhelming so as a last resort you turn to someone for emotional support- and so the cycle begins. Before you even realise it, you’ve typed out long paragraphs and all that you’ve been keeping is out in the open in an emotionally raw paragraph. As you’re waiting for a response, your brain starts to spiral. You’re in an incredibly vulnerable situation, and it’s only a matter of time before the guilt starts to kick in. You regret it all. You keep anxiously checking your phone, wondering what they’re going to say. You’re a burden, you’re so annoying, everyone hates you, you only make their lives worse, everything would be better if you weren’t here, you are a leech slowly eating away at their lives, they’re ignoring you because you’re only pissing them off again, they’re making fun of you, they wouldn’t care if you disappeared in fact you’d be doing them a favour, why would you share your feelings like that- you’re pathetic, nobody needs to deal with your shit. A day later, they respond with less than a sentence not even acknowledging what you said- and whether that was their intent or not, somehow it validates all your depressive thoughts. 
“Aw :( Jope it gets better for you”, you can’t help but fixate on the fact it was clearly typed in a second with no thought put into it. You feel so so guilty. Somehow, you hate yourself more. After mental breakdowns you can’t help but feel yourself unconsciously repeating the behaviour, with the result of feeling worse and worse about yourself every time. Eventually, you get frustrated with them- but that ends up turning into being more frustrated with YOURSELF! You feel like a complete and utter asshole. You feel selfish and entitled and start beating yourself up with the words you said at the very start. Another horrible thing happens in your life and you’re even more triggered, you can’t cope- you try with all your might to not affect anyone else with your childish sadness but... You cry and stare at the ceiling, beat yourself up for feeling sorry for yourself. It repeats and repeats, and somehow you’re annoying others again even though you know you’ll only feel worse. You hang onto the hope maybe they can help this time, you only keep repeating the behaviour because you have nowhere else to turn, no other options- because you’re trapped in a cycle after all. You always type out paragraphs, whether it be your opinion, advice for them or your own demons- to receive nothing in return, it’s genuinely humiliating. You’re afraid of making new friends because you’re petrified of ruining another’s life. You belong isolated in your house, or so you tell yourself. 

I’ve been thinking, and I’m under the belief that fellow redditors that understand the struggles firsthand are our best bet for getting through this. We aren’t condescending and debilitating like therapists, and you know, you feel slightly less guilty putting a stranger out. I’m not quite sure what my point here is, I haven’t had the courage to post here before- but if given the opportunity, I’d love to help break someone else’s cycle because I can’t help but think how easier it would be to fight this without feeling guilt for everything I do. Let’s try and express our valid concerns without guilt dictating our lives. Break the cycle.”


Someone commented saying I hit the nail on the head and was genuinely really supportive and understanding of my paragraph- they felt the same way. And after having anxiety attacks and severe depressive episodes leading up to making that post, I felt better knowing it reached someone in a positive light, maybe I wasn’t useless after all. I sent them a nice supportive message back. Seconds later, I was banned from the server for posting “general uplifting content” in the form of sending the message back to the person who made me feel a little bit better about myself. This is a form of the cycle I didn’t expect to occur. The guilt and anxiety sunk in much harder and I just wanted to cry when realising I got the other persons account deleted completely just for being nice to me and now they can’t access the help they need. Maybe I didn’t read the rules with a fine tooth comb but it seems cruel for them to do something so detrimental to someone already unstables mental health? I tried messaging the mods and all they said is “You don’t need support and violated multiple guidelines as explained in the ban notice.” The ban notice only said I was posting uplifting content, and apparently that’s a crime? And although it wasn’t stated explicitly, I very clearly still needed support :( I’m so scared and humiliated I want to hide away again. I’m forcing myself to post here as I really don’t want my efforts to get help and be seen go to waste. I want to overcome my mental health issues, but it seems everything is pushing me back to square one. Has anyone had a similar experience with unlawful bans on that sub? Or am I actually in the wrong here. I’m not sure what to think anymore ;-;

(I’m really really sorry if posting this here is wrong. I did read the rules over and over for like 20 minutes this time, but I always do the wrong thing so I’m very apologetic if this is incorrect too)"
1183,Anyone have any really good morning mantras?,Im bipolar and I’m in a really bad depressive episode. I typically wake up at 7:00 every morning but stay in bed until around 11 when I finally manage to push myself out. Then after doing some things around the house for a while I get back in bed. It’s finals week and I need to push past this but it’s really really hard to stop acting like I’m dead. My grades were a’s but now I will probably get 1 A 2 Bs and possibly a C.
1184,"I often have these HORRIBLE thoughts, and I’m afraid to tell anyone","Let me preface this by saying that I have never, and would NEVER act on any of these thoughts. 

Oftentimes throughout the day, I’ll have these awful thoughts and images pop up in my head. For example, while I was embroidering today, and I was holding a small pair of very sharp scissors, I had the thought of what it would feel like to stab someone. While laying in bed at night, I’ll often imagine someone breaking in and beating/stabbing me to death. I sometimes imagine myself driving off the road with my children, causing a horrible accident, and my mind creates this whole story/scenario. What it would look like, sound like, *feel* like. Then my anxiety goes way up and I think I can nearly feel what the pain of that situation would be like. 

Why do I do this? What’s wrong with me??"
1185,Struggle to help others but also not expend all your mental energy?,"I absolutely love giving my friends advice and am usually totally open to hear what they’re going through. That being said, this has been a terrible time for me and I’m struggling with anxiety more than ever. It’s always so hard when my friends call with little issues and I’m sitting there, feeling extremely stressed at the same time. I always do my best to help and never turn them away, but sometimes it’s so hard when I feel like such crap myself. I feel so selfish for thinking this, but how do I manage helping my friends out but also preserving my own sanity?"
1186,What are ur thoughts on moms with self harm scars?,"If u saw a mom, specifically a single mom, with self harm scars what would u think of that ? What would be the first thing to pop into ur head ? I want to know for personal reasons."
1187,Was I assaulted?,"I honestly don’t know where else to post this without getting a lot of crap for it. 

I’m a bit inspired by someone else making a post about their abuse story. So, here’s mine, but I’m wondering if it really is even abuse. 

I’m just so conflicted. When I was 13f, I was talking to a guy, 15. I really liked him, thought he was cute and had a crush on him. I went to his house, we made out, watched movies, it was a date in my eyes. A couple months later we’re hanging out off and on. We keep hanging out and having these dates for almost a year. We were like... make out buddies? Because we both would go and be with others, or get in a relationship then hang out when it ended. We did this until I was 14, I went over there, pretty drunk. We’re kissing, (at this point I was still a virgin.) Things started going I decided this isn’t how I want things to go. I told him I’d kiss him and do other stuff. I just didn’t want sex. He started kissing me, holding me down a bit and saying, “it’s fine, just the head, you’ll be okay.” Saying something like this over and over again. I was saying no, and I don’t want that. He pulled down my underwear and just went for it. I was scared and I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t fight him, I didn’t push him off or hurt him to leave me alone. I just laid there, watching him have sex with me. He at one point said, “is this okay?” And I felt bad for him, I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. So I said, “yeah” even though it didn’t feel okay. 

I went home after and I remember inviting all my friends over, and saying, “let’s get fucked up.” And I drank all my feelings about it away. Not thinking more of it than, I didn’t like it. But that’s life. 

What makes me think it wasn’t anything, is that I when I was 16, I went back. Forgetting completely the experience I had. I had forgotten I had ever had sex with him. And still thinking I was a virgin, the same thing happened again. Kissing again, watching “The Ranch” (I still can’t watch it.) I went over there with the intention of having sex, but when he started to initiate more. I told him no, I didn’t want it anymore. However, the same thing happened again. But at the end he said, “yeah, you’re not as tight as I would think you would be.” Which is dumb, but it hurt my feelings a lot. 

I remember when I got to my car. I just started crying. I couldn’t figure out why I was. Didn’t I want that? 

A couple weeks later I was still thinking about it and the first time hit me like a truck and I just started balling. 

However, again at 17, (he’s 19/20 at this point) I saw him again. And these huge red flags popped up. I watched him say racial slurs about stuff and choke his dog. I made an excuse and left. That’s when things started to feel really weird for me. I started wondering if my experiences weren’t okay. If I was actually okay with these things happening. I haven’t talked to him since. 

I told my best friend this story and he got really upset. Saying, “that’s rape.” But idk, I guess I need internet validation before I can fully accept that."
1188,I have a constant fear in the back of my head that people close to me are going to die and it's debilitating.,"Just needed to get that off my chest. It usually happens at night, I look at my phone, analyze if there is any slight out-of-tone sign, and then get hit with a bunch of thoughts like, ""What if they died or are in danger?"" Then I feel guilty for thinking that because I often jinx things unintentionally so then I worry more if by intrusively thinking that, it would've been my fault.  I usually end up crying and get incredibly anxious at the thought of my friends and family dying. I dunno why this happens, I'm not sure if it's because I have GAD, or I'm just caring too much, or if it's normal, or whatever. I don't know. Anyone else like this? Any tips?? :/"
1189,And just like that it’s back.,Maybe it’s because the weekend is over. I’m actually dreading tomorrow. Not that there’s a meeting or something I don’t want to attend. Just the anxious scared feeling. Feeling like I’m useless. Like nothing good is ever going to happen. I was actually feeling good the last couple of weeks. I pray that I’m back to ‘normal’ by morning. Will this ever go away?
1190,Can you break the feeling of not feeling anything after a decade?,"I just feel like i havent felt anything besides depression for so long. I really truly can't really remember a time ive been happy since my childhood. I want to feel that uniqueness of life again, but i feel like ive been so numb for so long that it may not return.

My grandfather died a few months back. We were close, but after he died i felt nothing and still feel nothing. I dont even feel guilty about it. I dont feel any different sitting in my house by myself or being with friends and family.

I dont have hobbies because i dont enjoy much anymore. I play videogames and thats it. I went on a date the other night to see how it would go. I felt absolutely nothing. I dont even have the urge to have sex.

I know this isnt a healthy way to live. I just know that ill probably die at a younger age if i dont meet basic human needs of interaction and happiness.

Ive tried meds but nothing really works. Ive tried microdosing, modafanil, and some other things.

Does someone have any tips on how to feel again."
1191,Opinions on suicide and comparisons to other causes of death,"A girl I went to high school with made a long-winded post on FB about how we should be more concerned with suicide rates than covid-related deaths and that we just need to be kind to one another. That was the gist at least. 

I responded mainly speaking about my experience and saying that suicide is much more complex than people just being mean to one another, and that it is often a complex mental health issue. 

She responded and said that she doesn't have a diagnosed mental illness and attempted suicide because she was bullied (keep in mind that we were friendly in HS, but I really don't know her that well, so I cannot speak to her situation and wouldn't try to.) 

I had written a response, but she took down the post before I was able to respond. I basically wrote this:  

""if you attempted suicide and did not receive appropriate medical care and therapy, that is a failure of the system and not you. Every single person who attempts suicide is meant to be put on a psychological hold and then receive secondary services. These secondary services often get overlooked or tossed aside due to lack of hospital beds, lack of resources, and lack of funding. 

I agree that it's important to shed light on suicide and to advocate for mental healthcare as well. I urge you to advocate for yourself, especially in medical settings where these things are often brushed off. 

Of course Covid is not the only cause of death, but it is the largest issue facing the world right now. I don't think people being concerned about Covid means they also aren't concerned about other causes of death. I certainly advocate for mental healthcare every single day of my life. I don't think the two need to be mutually exclusive."" 

Like I said, I didn't get to actually say this to her, but I did want to get other opinions on the issue and what people think about comparing death by suicide and death by disease/virus as well as whether people think suicide is mainly an issue relating to mental health or if it can be completely independent from mental health. 


TL/DR: A girl I went to HS with made a post saying we should be more concerned with suicide death rates than Covid death rates, and that suicide can be prevented by being nice to each other. I think it's an oversimplification and that it doesn't really make sense to compare them, as caring about one doesn't mean you don't care about the other. What do you guys think about making such comparisons? Also, do you think suicide can be completely unrelated to mental health issues?"
1192,For people who went to alternative school.,"No I do not mean private school. I mean schools not in district that school districts pay to send the “unstable” kids there. We’re you at a boarding school or a day school and what type of experience did you have?

1194,hi my bf is hearing things,"he mentioned something very interesting with his auditory functions. when he is laying down or not doing anything he will hear the noises he has made while walking around the house. (footsteps, opening mouth, etc) or the occasional ruffling of clothes if someone lies still, a tap being used and the like. not sure what this could be explained as. help please"
1195,Hopeless &amp; Depressed," Hi there. I am going through a depressive episode and I want to kill myself. Well, it's not that I want to die, more like I do not want to exist. I dropped out of school (I was pursuing a degree that my parents wanted me to do), but ended up having a nervous breakdown from the stress. Now I am lost. The only majors that truly interest me are ""worthless"" degrees. I am considering going into finance, since I won't have the stress of someone's life in my hands (I was previously in a health-care major), but it doesn't particularly interest me. I am terrified of failure and imperfection, and am so afraid I will fail again and have another breakdown. I feel like I'll never be happy again or will never succeed in anything. These thoughts plague me and make me wish I were dead. I feel like I'm not built for this competitive and sometimes cruel world. I feel so hopeless. Any advice is appreciated."
1196,I'm not sure if i have a mental illness or I'm just lonely,"I think I've really been struggling with loneliness lately and think it could be something more. I'm single and live in a small town with not a lot of dating options. This year has been especially brutal. I struggle to even get a date with the chances I do have. I'm pretty sure this has been a major contributing factor to what I think is a depression/anxiety problem. But sometimes I also think I'm just lonely or even just overreacting and there is actually nothing wrong with me at all. I think i tend to get attached really quickly and get my hopes up, which is recipe for disaster when things don't work out. I've first started feeling down in the past  6 months or so and it seems like it just gotten worse, with the last few weeks being the worst. I've also always kind of though in the back of my head I had something wrong mentally, but just thought it was normal.  I have a lot of the symptoms of depression/anxiety based on what I've read. The part of it that scares me the most is how the only thing I really look forward everyday is going to bed, just so I don't have to be awake anymore. Any advice or experiences with this type of thing would be much appreciated."
1197,Constant thoughts of suicide,"I (19f) have constant thoughts of suicide to the point im hardly functioning. Im so depressed and anxious all the time that I constantly feel sick. I have enormous self hatred and ive tried to run from it over the years but I always end up falling back. I was sexually abused from the ages of 4 to 15 and then raped a couple times in my later teen years. The most recent case being the worst that happened 6 months ago and I have nightmares every night as it was the most violent of all my experiences. 

To make matters worse i fell pregnant by my boyfriend. Im 12 weeks along. I had to go off my mental health pills because of the pregnancy. I dont know what to do.. im still a student and im not ready to have a baby because of how bad my mental health is. Ive looked into adoption and even know a few people who are desperate to have children. But my boyfriend won't hear it and says he will regret placing the baby up for adoption for the rest of his life if we do. 

Im usually pretty good at faking my happiness and everything. But its getting harder at times and my boyfriend has been noticing. Today he kind of upset me and I got so upset I wanted to leave and he got very angry at me and said some sort of mean things that really made me want to end my life even more. 

Im in so much pain its almost unbearable. I want to be okay and feel alright again. I dont want to be so suicidal but I hate myself so much and I know everyone would be happier if I was dead. I dont know what to do..."
1198,Emotional numbness and confusion,"I hate to have to be the guy who comes on here and asks for help. I think I just want to see how I feel after I get this out into the real world. I'm saying this all here because I dont have anyone to tell in person. I think my mind isnt working properly. I'm not able to remember anything anymore and nothing seems to trigger an emotional response like it used to. I cant feel happy or content, but I also cant feel overly sad. I'm lost and am not sure what to do. I feel like I dont have a soul inside me anymore. I've been really depressed so probably 3 years now, but atleast then I felt something. I felt like an actual person. I want to feel like me again and actually remember things and be a functional person. I dont think I can properly explain this, but I'm trying. Im not having severe suicidal thoughts, but they are there. Has this ever happened to anyone? If so how do you break it? I want to move past this, but it seems like no matter what I'm going to be stuck here."
1199,s c r e a m i n g,"A few days ago, I made a post about old friends and stuff (sidenote: I have still not sent a fashionably late happy birthday text lol). In it, I mentioned that last Christmas, I texted one of my best friends when I lived in London whom I hadn’t spoken to in several years because I’d moved. I just said, “hello, Merry Christmas, it’s me by the way, how’ve you been?” I mentioned that the text showed up as read (the two blue ticks). However, I did not receive a response (and I’m not waiting because that was, you know, nearly a year ago). I assumed that, since this was on WhatsApp, maybe he doesn’t actually have WhatsApp, because I remember having to manually add him there and it did not show up at first that he was on there when I added his number that his dad gave mine to my contacts. But literally minutes ago, I found something that changes evERYTHING. Dundunduuuunnnnnn. n.

I randomly opened WhatsApp and because reasons, I was scrolling far down, when I saw the chat thing I had with this friend. Previously, he didn’t have a profile picture but NOW HE HAD AND IT IS HIM. I’M SCREAMING. I’M HAPPY BECAUSE IT IS INDEED HIM. But I’m... not necessarily sad but you know, he didn’t reply last year...

r/askteenboys made me realise I’m being kind of dramatic, thinking “oh what if my old friends hate me now”. I guess that’s probably true. Well — look — to tell you the truth, I got his number last year. I was thinking of texting him for his birthday as my dad got his number from *his* dad around that time and like I said, forwarded it to me so I could have it. However, because I was feeling very anxious about how he might react or basically just the prospect of doing it in general. So the days crept by and turned into weeks and I knew I wasn’t going to do it. But I did! Nearly half a year later. And he didn’t reply. 

So either he doesn’t like me anymore or he just assumed it was a prank. I wonder who he might think it is if he thinks it’s a prank... we weren’t bullied but a few people kiiind of picked on us? And by us I mean just me. BUT maybe he doesn’t like me because his dad told him he gave my dad his number so maybe he was excited and waiting for me to text him (that makes me sound so full of myself, I’m sorry) but then he didn’t get anything until months later and was just annoyed with me by that point so he didn’t reply. I was actually kind of stupid; I probably should have asked my dad to send my friend’s dad my own number too in return. Maybe he’d’ve texted me first or I would have felt more inclined to texting him because we would both have known SOMEONE was going to.

I don’t know, really. Maybe I’ll try again. Should I? I don’t know, really."
1200,i feel like my depressive moods make me unlovable,"hi

so i’m basically having a panic attack right now. i have these episodes when i’m stressed where i just cry and i cant stop and when i feel like this i think, why would anyone want to put up with this? why would anyone love such an emotionally messy person? no one’s ever going to love me.
i’ve struggled with my mental health for the past ten years and for the past couple of years i’ve been getting a lot better at identifying unhealthy behaviour and woking on my relationships with others and it’s been a lot better. but i’m just so lonely and I barely have any friends because i wasted my teenage years being depressed instead of cultivating social skills and when i’m feeling sad like this i genuinely think i’m going to be alone forever
i live with a friend and it’s happened a couple of times where i felt like i was on the edge of a breakdown when we were hanging out but it’s just when i’m left alone that i finally do break down. he’s very supportive but i never want to reach out to him and ask him to stay with me when i’m feeling like this because i don’t know if that’s healthy, since i only cry like this when i’m alone. part of me feels like a toddler crying out for attention and it only makes me feel even more pathetic"
1201,Finally cleaned my room and did laundry after 3 weeks,"Been very empty and numb lately due to a plethora of horrible things that have happened to me/occurred this past month. I finally took the time today to clean and organize everything.🙏🏽 Next i would like to get myself together. My hair has been a mess...I finally got my eyebrows done earlier this week so that’s a start. Going to incorporate some daily exercise and better eating habits since I’ve been binge eating and taking mdma and using alcohol to suppress. 
 I’m just trying to get back into the normal groove of life again. I started a new job too."
1202,How do I (22M) best support my partner (22F) as she begins her transition?,"(Short questions at the end) Hello all, here's a little background info for you:

I myself am also trans, and have identified myself as male for nearly eight years now. I went through the early stages of my transition as a freshman in highschool and thus had the advantage of learning to pass alongside boys who already didn't really look distinctly different from me as far as secondary sex characteristics go, and I had the natural advantages of a low voice, strong ""masculine"" facial features, and a ""tomboyish"" disposition (which was just me being a boy the whole GD time). 

All of this to say, when I began my transition, there weren't a lot of leaps I needed to make in order to alleviate my dysphoria and be at least halfway confident about how well I passed.

 To contrast this, my girlfriend was at work (Unnamed Pizza Chain in the southern United States) last week in her typical masc clothes and sporting the full Winter Beard, her low, twangy, voice commanding the kitchen, as it does. This week, she's been wearing the necklace I gave her, painting her nails, and talking softly and quietly, in an attempt to cover up the lower registers of her voice.

I'll leave the particular details of her coming into her identity to her, because it isn't particularly necessary for this thread. But her realizations about her identity, euphoria of being able to define her experience, and the subsequent dysphoria of needing to realign her body with her ego, has been a visible drain on her psyche over the last two weeks. On my end, it's been stirring up familiar sensations of when I was a young trans person trying to figure myself out, and I want to be able to help her through these feelings as much as I can because I understand how easy it is to let it depress you. 

The issue I keep running into isn't about helping her sort out her feelings about dysphoria, passing, being percieved, and all the other general trans things that are mutually experienced by both MtF and FtM trans people, but rather than things that are so specific to transitioning as someone who has been seen not just as male, but very very masculine not long ago. 

She's planning on starting therapy, then hormones later, and doesn't forsee a need for any major surgies as of yet. The most cost intensive part of her transition that we are planning for right now is laser hair removal as she has an insane amount of body and facial hair that I wish I could just steal from her for myself. All we really know to do for now is slowly rotate out her wardrobe, practice makeup, and do voice training (which has been causing her a lot of of hopelessness as of late. She says she can't forsee it not feeling like an impression she's doing rather than her own voice. I know with time, she'll get there, but it sucks to see her so defeated and quiet after she comes back from a training session). 

Her experience while similar feels so different from mine. She's more at risk, more visible, and will have a harder time passing than I have had. I love her so much, and i want her to be able to explore this side of herself and feel confident while doing so, which leads me into my questions:

What are some ways I can validate her without over feminizing/fetishizing/causing unnecessary dysphoria? 

Some ways to present more feminine even in work uniforms?

If you are trans (MtF or AMAB), what are some cheap, easy ways to feel more feminine? (Unfortunately, we're on a budget) 

What are some resources for trans women that were helpful in identifying the ways you wanted to pass, and how to do so? 

Any other advice or tips appreciated, respectful questions always welcome."
1203,My mental health has been rapidly declining,"I'm in 8th grade and ever since around 3 months ago I haven't able to stop having bad thoughts. My escapes away from them is talking to people, playing games with friends and hanging out with them. I'm always thinking about the worst case scenario. I'm at the point to where I can't even do school work, I just can't concentrate or focus and I've already failed the 1st 9 weeks and I am failing the 2nd one right now. I want to be better, and I always tell myself to do it but I just can't for some reason. When I do sit down and i'm able to sit down, I just feel finished even though I know I still have the weight of tons of overdue work on my shoulders. I want to do better and be able to clearly think when i'm not distracted, I just always never do it though for some reason. I don't want to be viewed as a failure and at this point with my responsbilites, I just want to make it to High School and get promoted to it this year."
1204,What do you do when you realize nobody truly cares about you?,"I’ve been depressed for 2 years and every overdose I’ve had nobody has ever call me, text me, or check up on me weeks before and after the overdose. At this point I’ve realized no matter how many cars, properties, watches, etc. I will never find someone who is real and someone who wants to build a relationship emotionally and financially. I think tonight is the last straw cause I’ve finally realized why nobody cares about me and why I can’t get love and affection from anyone. For people who know me irl please don’t call for help or give me hope, I don’t deserve it"
1205,"I was ugly, but now i feel ugly","Since March, I am living with my mom, and she takes random picture and videos of me when i am sleeping, eating, talking or playing online games, and later she shows them to me by zooming in and tells me how ugly I look.

This is supposed to be a fun thing I guess, except sometimes when she get really angry at me She says things which are even meaner. And her argument for acting this way is that I tell her these mean things too.

My mom is partaking in a beauty pageant, and I am trying to help her, because after fighting she always comes to me to ask for help.

Honestly, I had Lost all the faith and belief in myself, I cant even put a display picture of me. Everywhere I go I can feel people seeing me with disgust."
1206,i just don't function anymore,"I don´t know what's happening, nothing seems to be good enough. i'm doing poorly at school because i feel terrible all the time and most of the time i'm just trying not to cry in front of the camera, i don´t even know who to talk to because it feels like all of my friends hate me in secret, almost like they are just looking for an excuse to cut me off completely so i'm afraid to tell them about my mental health problems so the only i can do is try to suppress all of my feelings. i fell so weak, pathetic and i'm never going to be good enough to deserve anything good.

I've been drinking a lot alone in the darkness of my room trying to forget, trying to stop feeling this way but i can't. i don't know for how long i can keep fighting my own mind i just want this to stop, all of it.

I'm writing this during an attack so i don't know if i'm being coherent, i'm sorry if i'm not but i needed to share this with someone."
1207,Does inpatient hospitalization help?,Does inpatient care help? What do they do there?
1208,How Do I tell her I know she is lying,How do I tell her I know she's lying. So it started with her ED and was just admitted to the hospital. So I'm concerned and ask her if she's OK etc. She starts saying how horrible this hospital is a bunch of terrible events that when you look at it to stick her solo the chances she had them together it's almost impossible. At this point I had a suspicion that she was lying to my face. So I said hey why don't I check your snap maps and what would you know. It says she's at her house. Just to be sure I waited for about 15 minutes and snapped her again. If it was a glitch in it was just and her locations the next text should update her locations. Lo and behold it still says she's at her house. None of her story makes sense. She tells me she's so unstable that she's dying what is stable enough to put in isolation room. Most people who need medical treatment or mentally unstable will get one on one. She then proceeds to tell me that one of the staff members have sexually assaulted her. I don't know how to even tell her I know where she is. Please don’t lie to people. Idk how to even tell her I know.
1209,My thoughts are deafening,I wish i could blow up my ears and dig out my eyes than open up my head and take my brain and throw it across the ocean i feel like even if i close my eyes and listen to the loudest music i can still hear my thoughts i wish everything could disappear but that would make my thoughts louder i dont want to see anyone everything makes me mad for no reason and i cant control my emotions but i also feel so numb to them i feel like if even if someone committed suicide in front of me i wouldn't blink but i cant help but feel mad at everything i will get mad if someone says something and want to throw something or insult them but trying to talk to a friend about how i feel is something impossible all my friends have been people i tried to help emotionally so i its my job to help them and not the other way around when i go to the bathroom room and try to look in the mirror i cant i can only look at the floor
1210,I don’t know who I am. Please help me. Psychosis??!!,"I don’t know who I am.  I don’t know how people perceive me. I litterally don’t know who I am, how smart I am, how I look, how I present. Yes, that’s it... I don’t know how I present to others. Am I secretly Autistic and everyone feels bad for me so they pretend I am normal so I feel better? Or am I completely normal girl with anxiety? Or am I insane and don’t know reality? 

I just got a boyfriend that everyone likes. But is he just dumb and autistic too so they feel bad for both of us and feel better then us? Or are we really attractive people that others genuinely like and look up too? Is the only reason they like him because he is wayyy out of my league because I’m ugly and weird and he’s hot and normal, but he feels bad for me so he dates me? 

At first I thought this weird type of paranoia was the start of psychosis, but now I think it’s just something bigger. Is the reason I feel everyone is focused on me and my life because that are and I’m in a coma? 

I know that sounds crazy but like idk what to believe if I don’t even know who I am."
1211,My normal isn’t good enough,"I haven’t had an apatite in at a least year I get agitated over little things, I lose interest in things in a span of days, I am slow in everything I do, my sleep pattern is awful, and I draw a blank a lot thinking about anything, and rarely but sometimes I get a randomish (once every two months) amazing feeling of uplift in my chest that only lasts seconds. I feel like I have depression without the constant sadness or sducidal thoughts"
1212,Should I see a doctor?,"I was seeing a counselor for a couple of months doing talk therapy and it was of....middling success.

I have a history of anxiety, depression, and have recently realized that I exhibit some behaviors indicative of hypersexuality (which I have discovered is not considered a normal thought process).

I have only ever done talk therapy, and now that I'm 26 the anxiety and depression have kind of...mellowed somewhat. They are still there, but the lows arent as low. On the flip side, the highs aren't as high anymore.

I find I have difficulty focusing on things and just enjoying them.

Ive never gotten a formal diagnosis of any kind of mood or behavioral disorders from a psychologist (psychiatrist? I can never keep them straight.)

Based on these so far, does it sound like maybe I should actually try to see a doctor to maybe get a formal diagnosis ?"
1213,Any tips for anxiety?,"Hi everyone, today I did something embarrassing and now I can't stop thinking about it and I feel so nauseous and shakey and anxious and I hate it. Are there any tips to calm my anxiety? Its usually bad but right now I'm about to throw up and start crying from anxiety so"
1214,Ever feel like some kind of softcore sociopath merely role playing normal human behavior half the time or is that just me?,Anyone?
1215,Help me please...,I was recently told by my parents that they are divorcing. I need some encouragement and help because I cannot stop crying. Please help.
1216,Question for you guys,"I realized something about a habit i have, so im gonna ask you guys here about it. Does anyone else in here get stressed about an umcoming event so they purposefully don't sleep becuase it feels like it'll make time pass by slower or something like that? I don't know how to describe it, but when i was little and my parents would say stuff like ""i need to have a talk with you tomorrow"" or something like that, i would refuse to sleep for as long as possible to make ""tomorrow"" happen slower. Is this normal?"
1217,Is this normal?,"I really hope this is the right sub. I don’t know where else to put it.

So I (17f) get this thing sometimes in my head. I’m just minding my own business when suddenly my head fills up with mist or smoke or something like that. The lights get brighter, and I forget about whatever I was thinking about. The world slows down, and I kinda feel like I’m in a dream. I feel detached from my body and I’m just a soul(?) floating behind my body. It’s really hard for me to focus on anything in this state, but it only lasts a few minutes and then I snap back into reality.

I’ve never seen anyone online describe this before, and when I ask my brothers if they experience it they think I’m crazy. I need to know that I’m not crazy. Is this what disassociation feels like? If not, does anyone know the correct term? Is it a sign of a certain mental illness? I haven’t been officially diagnosed with any mental illnesses, but I have a lot of the symptoms of anxiety and adhd."
1218,i think i am manipulative. i don’t know how to stand anything anymore. i need to know what’s wrong with me but everyone tells me nothing is.,"i’m probably just over dramatic. i have been called manipulative mainly by my ex, but everyone agreed that i have manipulative tendencies. i block stuff out of my memory. people sent me screenshots of my texts with him and i was acting as if i would kill myself if he left me or something like that. i don’t even remember anymore. i was shocked and upset that i would ever do that. it’s not me. i am faking all of this stuff for attention i think.  i keep seeing stuff about borderline personality disorder online and after getting worried that i had it, i started to act as if i did. i don’t. i’m just an asshole. what kind of fucked up person would want to have that? i don’t even want to have it but part of me seems to want to or else i wouldn’t act the way i do. it’s not like i even do.

i genuinely do feel things very strongly. i can’t control that. i have to watch myself do everything else. when i get upset i just watch myself. i’m over exaggerating when i say that but i know of no other way to describe it. i have started to ignore my friends because i don’t want to hurt them anymore. i say shit for their attention. i act crazy for their attention. i don’t even want to. i’d rather do anything else. i don’t want to act mentally ill on purpose, but i’m still doing it. all i ever wanted was to be a good person. i’ve always been a very anxious person, but now i am just so much worse with everything. nothing bad even happened to me. i am clearly choosing all of this. i just want validation. i want someone to tell me that something really is wrong with me. i guess so that i will have an excuse. my brain doesn’t even tell me what i want anymore. i just do things. i just think things with no rational reasoning behind them. i don’t want to be this way. it’s like a hole."
1219,Does anyone know what’s happening (TW: Talk of abuse and disassociating),"Log story short, I haven’t had the best life so far and I’m only 16 (ftm trans man). Most of my recent problems are from my dad being abusive (but there isn’t enough evidence to do anything about it).

The problem is sometimes I disassociate, and sometimes another person takes control (Andy). I am FULLY AWARE of what’s going on around me, but he’s not the same person. I am not diagnosed with DID, and do not claim to have it, but I’m wondering if there is an explanation for what’s happening.
Andy is a different person than I am, but there is no amnesia, so I don’t think it’s DID.
I’m extremely worried about this, because my dad thinks I’m faking having DID to do what I want, but that isn’t true at all! I would NEVER fake a mental illness of ANY kind to do what I want. It’s immoral and wrong. But so far my therapist has nothing.

Is there anything I can do? What is happening?"
1220,I am trying to find out if I have ADHD or not,"I have definitely in staying focus at something for a long time

for example, if I am listening to a lecture class, within 10 to 15 minutes I will lose my focus on it, and I become absent-minded, the same thing will happen if I am doing something that does require a lot of patience.

sometimes I will be so excited about the thing that I should not need to be so excited about. Sometimes I don't have any patience, sometimes I am hyperactive. If I don't have ADHD what is the problem I am facing and what to do to overcome it."
1221,When I was around 7 a dark figure was in my room,"Ok so when I was around 7 I had a nightmare I have a vague memory of the nightmare. When I woke up sweating I saw this dark figure that was the shape of me just staring at me, after about 4 hours it flickered and disappeared. Although for some reason it never happened to me again, and was fully able to move and talk. Does anyone know exactly what happened? because it definitely wasn’t some kind of dream-ception, because in my dreams my body would feel sort of restricted in dreams. And have asked numerous people abou this and none of them could answer it so I hope someone could help me with this."
1222,Attachment issues,"I think I have attachment problems, especially when dealing with women. Every girl I have the slightest interest in, I dive headfirst into my feelings and when they don't reciprocate, I'm left feeling hopeless and depressed.

I currently like a girl who has feelings for another man who lives far away. She's my neighbor and friend. I developed feelings for her over the past several weeks and learning that she likes someone else was expected but it nonetheless left me heartbroken and depressed. I haven't expressed these feelings to her out of fear of driving her away.

What is wrong with me? I develop feelings way too quickly for people and I get heartbroken over the tiniest things."
1223,What would most likely happen if I just stopped taking my medication cold turkey all of a sudden?,"I’m almost 25, missed out on my youth, and now half of my 20s are gone. I am suspecting that the reason I lack interest in motivation is because I’m too sedated.

I’m going to lose my parents health insurance in a year anyway, if I haven’t managed to become financially independent by then, I may have to quit cold turkey anyway.

Since I was 16, I’ve been taking 200 MG of Sertraline (Zoloft) and 1,200 MG (600 MG twice a day) of Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) every day. That’s right, I’ve been heavily medicated for that long.

I was put on this shit when I was in a psychiatric hospital for my OCD. It’s suppressed the symptoms a lot, but it’s still there and none of my problems have been properly addressed (I have so much more psychological damage now).

January 2020, I started Bupropion SR 100 MG a day (in addition to the others) for my rage outbursts that I’ve had frequently since, 18? The way they started was so suddenly, after a series of nightmares I still remember to this day, as if I just had them, I felt all this hatred inside me, which I hated. Had my first rage outburst, and each one got progressively worse.

Bupropion stopped them! Until someone triggered me just the right way, worst one yet, actual physical violence, on an object. Literally wasn’t in control, just watched it happen.

That’s been the only outburst since being on Bupropion.

Also, back in I believe February, my psychiatrist unnecessarily doubled the dose (He asked if I still experienced ANY anxiety, depression, or anger. I answered yes and he IMMEDIATELY said “OK let’s double the dose).

My anxiety went up, and I completely lost feeling in my penis. I somehow managed to rub one out, but felt NOTHING except the pressure of it coming out, but no pleasure AT ALL. It was so unsatisfying and strange. Back to 100 MG, for 2 weeks I experienced VIRTUALLY NO LIBIDO AT ALL.

Function slowly returned. I had NEVER felt like I experienced the level of pleasure I should, but it still felt good enough to do it. Back to 2020, a few months after going back to 100 MG, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, I EXPERIENCED A SUPER POWERFUL MINDBLOWING ORGASM. I just assumed my body/brain was incapable of experiencing that much pleasure. All I thought was “I want it to stay this way so I can enjoy it with a girlfriend one day”.

Over time this faded away, but sometimes it still feels pretty good, but it can also be “meh” too, it varies.

I learned about PSSD back when doubling Bupropion temporarily KILLED my sexuality, and now I’m aware that discontinuing my meds (at least from the Zoloft, don’t know Trileptal may interact with it all these years) could be the nail in the coffin for my sexual function, as well as all other forms of pleasure, emotion, cognitive skills, and worsening my dyskinesia. I’ve experienced all of these things ON the meds, and being that I’ve taken SUCH HIGH DOSES FOR SO MANY YEARS FROM SUCH A YOUNG AGE OF MY DEVELOPMENT, I figure I’m at high risk of long-term or permanent dysfunctions from discontinuing, and it seems unlikely that any doctors believe this or take it seriously.

My life is already screwed, what if I just stopped taking the shit to try and feel free from suppression? 

I’ve never had a girlfriend or sex and most think I’m ugly, so losing sexual function may not be a loss I should care about anyway 😭😭😭"
1224,I should probably be in a psych ward.,"I can’t manage my OCD anymore, I’m becoming more and more depressed each day, I’ve been cutting every day for more than a year now, I don’t go to school anymore, I’ve got anger issues, and I’ve got sleeping problems. I should probably be locked up, I feel like I’m going crazy."
1225,"How do you start being grateful when you lived such a terrible life, and continue to live surrounded by toxicity? Is it possible?","I find my mental health makes it hard to be in the present. Mostly because I’m constantly thinking about how to fix what happened to me in my past. Fix the affects of it, not fix the past. I’m very much aware that I can’t go back and redo all that was done. 

I feel like a lot of the time people don’t understand what my past consisted of. Continuous rape by different men and women throughout my childhood (one of which including my oldest brother), adults refusing to acknowledge or help, sexual assault between those points, neglect and abuse from my mother, emotional abuse by my grandmother, mother, and brother. Schizophrenia, generalized anxiety, depression. Being surrounded by drug addicts, alcoholics, and people who treated me like a sexual object when I was just 5 years old. And being beat and ridiculed for it. 

It feels like when people give me advice it’s so simplified. 

I’m still living with my emotionally and very occasionally physically abusive mother and my siblings who constantly side with her. Still living in the same house as my oldest brother. 

If I stay well behaved and don’t “get out of line”, which is basically anything that my mom doesn’t like about me, then everything’s fine. And that’s what I’ve been doing for a while until she told me yesterday that my PTSD and depression aren’t real, that I’m merely an attention whore. And today everything is fine again. 

Therapy isn’t a possibility right now. I promise I’ll get it as soon as possible, but right now it just isn’t. No I don’t have any friends to stay with. Or any friends at all. I don’t have any other family members but the people in this house. I don’t have money for college, and I’m looking for volunteering opportunities so I’ll be away from the house for a few hours. 

I’m not sure what to do. How can you be grateful when you live in such a toxic place full of memories. I try to write about things I’m grateful for, and there’s a lot. Venus fly traps, animals, children, Christmas, my SO, people in general, cotton candy, my favorite songs, trivia games. But none of those things over rule the feelings of misfortunate. I take walks down my neighborhood, which is only half a mile, can’t go any further for reasons, to try and find things to be grateful for, to try and be present. But those just don’t help me feel all around grateful. It doesn’t keep me present. Because once I go back into that house I’m dissociated. 

How can you be grateful for what you have in the present when the past is full of such hurtful things that’s brought itself into your present via PTSD? Is that possible? How can you be grateful when you continue to live in a place that mentally harms you. Please. I need answers I’m going insane.."

1231,"My brain feels foggy, I'm easily agitated, I catch myself often impulsively telling my wife ""I wanna die""","Hello everyone,

I've had pretty rough two years and I think I'm slowly getting to the limits to how much I can bottle up. I also recently got off of Lexapro (which I've been prescribed for my severe depression and anxiety) after taking it for 3 months as I could not have sex anymore.... Having to deal with sexual frustration was definitely just as bad, if not then worse than both, the anxiety and the depression I need to deal with.

Today I lost my wallet, my bank had me on a 45 minute hold and the clerk accidentally blocked my entire account so I exploded and told her to close my entire account which honestly triggered my desire to share my issues with this subreddit. Also, my entire close family in Europe is currently infected with COVID-19 And my mama's in hospital whereas I'm stuck here in Canada with no proper immigration status, thus I'm not allowed to leave the country until that is settled. 

I'm deeply frustrated as it really seems like whatever step I attempt to take, it just sets me back 2 steps, I feel like I'm stuck in a dead end and there's no way out. 

I feel like life is just chewing me and spitting me out over and over again. Whenever I try to sit down and break down all my issues in order to create a plan, my brain just fogs up, I get a migraine or fatigue and I lose all my energy. It's awful! I also feel very numb, been feeling numb lately. The only emotion I can actually perceive properly is anger and frust, even when I'm aware that I'm not necessarily in a bad situation at that moment. 

If only I could sit down and break down my problems effectively... I really need advice on how I can just ease up that foggy feel in my brain that just seems to congest my rational mind.


TL:DR Lots of stress + depression - Lexapro = cause my brain to fog up and I'm physically unable to do anything about it due to acute feels of fatigue, frust, and anger."
1232,"The world seems so screwed up I'm just angry all the time (TW: Themes of trafficking, rape, crimes, etc)","Today I watched a film based on a true story. In it two women end up being trafficked by a gang. The local police constable, a woman, protects them. Luckily in this situation they got caught and all jailed. But I'm so aware how often this isn't the case.

Then I've been watching a documentary series about gangs in various countries. Often they extort, torture and randomly kill people.

Then in real life there's people like Luka Magnotta, truly sick people. We see police practically executing minorities. We see riots where people's entire businesses are destroyed.

And half the time, these friggin evil people get let out with a mere slap on the wrist. They destroyed lives and they basically went unpunished, the entire system was just about reforming them - and yet it's not even got a way to detect if reform occured.


I'm just left with this rage at the injustice of it all. Why the hell is human trafficking still a thing. Why do we ever release sadistic murderers? Why don't we just *erase* gangs?

I'm just so fed up with the lack of any caring from the state. It's like we've become such a morally righteous and ideological society that we'd rather let victims have no justice than actually punish the criminals.

And I'm so outraged by the disgusting evil, I just wish nothing but pain, torture and suffering upon traffickers, rapists, gangs, murderers, etc. I hope hell is real and an eternity of complete suffering and pain awaits them, cos for what these people do I can never forgive them personally. I cannot accept or forgive human traffickers. Nor rapists, nor gangs or murderers.

I don't know how to stop being angry and caring? I could volunteer but I feel that'd I'd only become more angry."

I found myself falling into old habits, clinging to my current boyfriend, looking over my shoulder. The fear and shaking that took hours to go away. What’s wrong with me? Why does it still bother me? It’s been almost 2 years since things ended, yet I still react like that. 

He called me terrible things again. Threatened to hurt me again. I know logically he’s so far away, yet I act like he’s staring me in the face. The knowledge of the things we shared is my biggest regret. The words I never said, how I wish I ended things sooner, haunt me. It hurts me that he’s still this angry, but I don’t know why. 

Part of me will always care about him because he gave me the strength to leave home. He gave me the words that I could never find. He stayed up with me as I cried the night of, telling me I did the right thing. He knew I was dying inside. Yet that part of me feels wrong. I don’t want to even interact with him anymore. I don’t want to even think about him. 

But it all came rushing back, with just one word. The first name he ever called me after I ended things. When he first flew off the handle. And I know he’ll probably never stop. But I wish it would. I want some peace. I don’t want this fear anymore."

She's shown repeated delusional behavior, very socially isolated, will barely take care of the house and ignores my little brother. I'm concerned she will not be able to take care of my little brother and may accidentally kill herself one day. I want her to be committed to a hospital, but she won't go and I feel like if I called a cop trained in handling this stuff, they won't do anything and it'll be too late before she is qualified to be taken in.

I keep hearing loud thumps and groups of people talking- but it's 2 am on a work/school night and my neighborhood is a very quiet place. I'm almost an adult and I have to keep my TV on because being in the dark makes me so insanely scared of something coming after me that I start shaking. Shadows keep moving on their own- I've been in bed for hours too scared to use the bathroom because it feels like someone is going to be standing in there, waiting to grab me. There are even instances where I am woken up in my sleep with my heart pounding and the only thing I can think of is "" Someone is looking at you. Don't open your eyes, don't move. ""

I am also having suicidal thoughts but I do not want to tell anyone cause I feel super embarrassed when people think something is wrong. I also have not felt myself love anyone in these four years.

1248,"Dude, I seriously need help","I'm in the process of joining the military which doesn't allow anyone with depressive symptoms in the last 36 months enter, so I can't go see a therapist. I really need to understand what is up with me, I don't feel anything, I have no motivation, I have crazy violent outbursts.

1249,Been too long,"There is this girl I've know for past 4 years, we rarely talk but I've been in love with her from the moment I saw her. I couldn't realise it early but when I did it was already too late. I just can't shake off the feeling of loving her. I just wanna be with, talk to her, listen to her every problem. This feeling keeps me distracted everytime I think of her. I don't even remember her face anymore. And this is driving me crazy."
1250,I don’t know how to keep going like this,"Hi, I’m just going to talk about my life for a while without thinking.
 I first started getting sad in seventh grade (I don’t wanna say depression because I’m not diagnosed) after I got mono and had to stay home for 4 months. When I came back to school all of my friends had found new friends and moved on, as I was no longer there. When I came back it seemed like no one wanted to talk to me and  I’ve always had body issues such as wearing a jacket everyday in 4th grade around my stomach because I thought people would look and judge. But it was fine I didn’t talk to many people just caught up on school work. Then in the summer I stopped eating and sleeping and fell into a really bad place. I had never felt that sad or unmotivated before and I had no reason to feel that way which made it worse.
The next year I made more friends and my life improved slightly but I still had the same sadness inside and more bad thoughts about myself and how others viewed me. I also started talking to kai who is the most toxic person in my life besides me. When we first started talking he convinced me to send him photos which I had never done and I felt better about myself and more confident  since someone was attracted to me. That’s basically all that happened that year. 

This next year was the start of my high school journey where I started making really bad decisions. I started smoking weed to help with my feelings and now have a more than slight dependency. I also lost my virginity to a guy who I was meeting for the first time, at a party, in a room of other people asleep. Which I don’t feel ashamed about but I wish I would have waited longer. 

The next guy I slept with was Kai. Let me talk about him for a minute because he is a character. He’s had many many girlfriends that all last about a week or less. Some girls at school would talk in my class about sleeping with him so I asked him and I was like hey just so I know are you sleeping with X Y and Z and of course he was like no I have high standards. Turns out yeah he was sleeping with them but he had been for as long as we have been (about 3-4 years) and he called me a liar and told me something along the lines of “you always lie so why should I tell you the truth.” He’s cut me off for multiple girls so he can date them and then starts talking to me again. Idk why I was confusing lust for feeling but I got very attached to him and he lies to me about feeing so he can sleep with me. I wish he would at least be honest. So yeah I’m simping for a total douche pls help I can’t stop talking to him. 

But the other two guys I’ve slept with were also bad. One has over 11 bodies now and the other one ubered me to his house, slept with me, blocked me, added me back and told me he got back with his ex, slept with me again, and blocked me. I clearly pick them good. 
This causes me a lot of pain though because I am the type of person who wants one person forever to be loyal with and open and just have a good connection which I knows can exist because I feel it with my female friend but with no physical attraction. And every experience I’ve had has made me want to dig myself a grave and never come out. Love is also my biggest desire which probably isn’t a great thing but I’ve never had a boyfriend and I’m tired of being lonely. 

The only guy friends I’ve ever had have all told me about feelings they developed i really don’t know why because I never felt any attraction towards them. But it makes me cut them off cause I end up feeling weird about not having the same feelings and I feel like shit. The only people that attract me are guys I somehow know are going to be in some way unavailable to me.

The worst part is I am aware of how self destructive I am but I cannot change I don’t know how. I’ve tried to talk to my parents about therapy multiple times but it’s not something that they are going to do. I’m not sure what to do because I feel so stuck and so lost and so miserable. I need some help.

So much more has happened too but this is already too much and i know this isn’t written the best."
1251,mindfullness and meditation is bs,"It brings nothing good, it only says accept everyone who abuses you. where the Asians are good at. 

Never bow! Never surrender! Against tyrannical regimes all over the world."
1252,I hate myself,"I can't connect to people anymore.

I just think they'll leave me no matter what I do."
1253,Why do i feel like throwing up when someone touch me/think about someone touching me?,"Hey, so I am 17F .I seriously don't know what's wrong with me.  I have always been repulsive to physical affection since teenage. I don't remember dealing with any of these before my teenage years. If someone touch me i feel like that part where they touch is burning..and nearly have a panic attack. Its like the world stops for a moment,thoughts blank. Its extremely difficult to live like this and I'm seriously having an existential crisis.  No one around understands me and they're telling me I'm being dramatic. Does anyone know what is wrong with me? Is this any type of medical condition? I am scared and I've been depressed and suicidal since two years. Selfharms too. This is making it difficult for me."
1254,I think I'm going insane,"Taking my life feels like a trivial thing. Like simply turning off a TV. I feel anxious almost all the time I feel emotions. I talk to voices in in mind. At times I feel like I'm watching someone go through their own life. I have personality shifts. I searched various ways to kill myself without even feeling a thing. I get breakdowns and feel like I'm three people at once. One of my friends is really depressed and seems like their going to kill themselves but they don't want to have their parents know. Another friend is suffering with their identity. Another one has shadows or bordline personality disorder. My family thinks I'm just going through a phase. The only time I've ever brought up my mental health to them, they told me it's because I spend to much time on the computer. They only care about me if my grades start slipping. 

I've been forgetting things right after I do or say them. I can barely even remember the last sentence I  said. My head hurts constantly. I can't sleep unless exhausted. I eat the bear minimum to stay healthy. I can't hold a conversation with anyone without blanking out. I go an entire two months without talking to any of my friends and they never notice. I say something and they barely notice. I can straight up stand in someone's line of sight and not get seen.  

My mind feels like how three year old's drawing looks. Yet I feel guilty as if I've done something wrong. What's wrong with me?! I tell myself I feel like this because I want to or because I'm taking it. Family members or close family friends die and I can't even feel the smallest bit of sadness. 

Sorry if this made no sense at all."
1255,I have my first ever therapy/counselling session in 30 minutes and I'm getting cold feet. Cannot talk to anyone I know about it.,Any tips? What should I say? I'm getting anxious
1256,I feel so lost.,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (31F) have been together for 6 years we’ve built a pretty great life together (recently moved into a house 6 months ago) and things were going well. I’ve had anxiety and depression but not so much for me that it took a toll on my everyday life. Until recently:

My boyfriend had a seizure about 2 months ago out of the blue and this has traumatized me more than anything. He is doing fine but I am not doing well mentally. The first two weeks after it happened, I felt okay started doing some research but then that research developed into PTSD and with that has made me extremely depressed and anxious. I have recently started talking to a trauma therapist in hopes that they will help me with my issues.

In the meantime, I feel like I am completely on edge at home. I’m constantly watching him and  if he does anything that seems “off” I start to think about the worst case scenario of what could happen and how that will affect our future. I feel like a huge asshole because this was no fault of his own. I feel like I’ve lost all attraction to him. I’m unmotivated to do anything and I feel like I’m just going through the motions of each day. I don’t feel like I’m at “home” anymore. He tries to show affection, but when I look at him I don’t see the guy I feel in love with. I feel like a completely different person.

I want to take a break from our relationship to work on myself. I don’t know how I can take care of someone else when I’m not even mentally strong enough to take care of myself. He has tried to be supportive of me and tries so hard to tell me he loves me and everything is going to be okay, but I can’t seem to process that. I feel like I need some time for myself to sort things out. I don’t know what to do."
1257,Ever felt like this?,"Anyone ever have these thoughts where you just want to cease to exist? Like just blink out of existence.

For me it's like when my thoughts just get out of control and I feel like that's how its always gonna be‌, me fighting to keep my thoughts under control, I feel like they should just stop. I should just cease to exist."
1258,I'm getting paranoid again,I'm starting to think about who really controls the world.
1259,The Cycle.,"Personally speaking, browsing this thread has been a breath of fresh air for me. This is because venting to a friend or family member only further reinforces this so called cycle I’m about to explain. Profound sadness, hopelessness and emotional torment obviously play a huge part in depression, but what a lot of people don’t mention is the frustration- which is a major part of the cycle. You’re miserable, you despise yourself so much you’re unable to function. You can’t help but get hung up on the situation you’re currently in which is intoxicating to you to the brim. You genuinely don’t know what to do with yourself, everything is so overwhelming so as a last resort you turn to someone for emotional support- and so the cycle begins. Before you even realise it, you’ve typed out long paragraphs and all that you’ve been keeping is out in the open in an emotionally raw paragraph. As you’re waiting for a response, your brain starts to spiral. You’re in an incredibly vulnerable situation, and it’s only a matter of time before the guilt starts to kick in. You regret it all. You keep anxiously checking your phone, wondering what they’re going to say. You’re a burden, you’re so annoying, everyone hates you, you only make their lives worse, everything would be better if you weren’t here, you are a leech slowly eating away at their lives, they’re ignoring you because you’re only pissing them off again, they’re making fun of you, they wouldn’t care if you disappeared in fact you’d be doing them a favour, why would you share your feelings like that- you’re pathetic, nobody needs to deal with your shit. A day later, they respond with less than a sentence not even acknowledging what you said- and whether that was their intent or not, somehow it validates all your depressive thoughts. 
“Aw :( Jope it gets better for you”, you can’t help but fixate on the fact it was clearly typed in a second with no thought put into it. You feel so so guilty. Somehow, you hate yourself more. After mental breakdowns you can’t help but feel yourself unconsciously repeating the behaviour, with the result of feeling worse and worse about yourself every time. Eventually, you get frustrated with them- but that ends up turning into being more frustrated with YOURSELF! You feel like a complete and utter asshole. You feel selfish and entitled and start beating yourself up with the words you said at the very start. Another horrible thing happens in your life and you’re even more triggered, you can’t cope- you try with all your might to not affect anyone else with your childish sadness but... You cry and stare at the ceiling, beat yourself up for feeling sorry for yourself. It repeats and repeats, and somehow you’re annoying others again even though you know you’ll only feel worse. You hang onto the hope maybe they can help this time, you only keep repeating the behaviour because you have nowhere else to turn, no other options- because you’re trapped in a cycle after all. You always type out paragraphs, whether it be your opinion, advice for them or your own demons- to receive nothing in return, it’s genuinely humiliating. You’re afraid of making new friends because you’re petrified of ruining another’s life. You belong isolated in your house, or so you tell yourself. 

Unfortunately I bet this sounds familiar for a lot of you :( If only things were simpler, then I think the cycle could be broken. If only things were simpler... but mental health is the opposite of that. I’ve always been rather depressed on different scales- but right now physical health issues doctors can’t fix, a bad home environment and a million other things out of my control make it seem so impossible. I don’t think I’m breaking out of this awful depressive and anxiety ridden cycle when I haven’t had the physical strength to leave the house in a year- but I can still type. Please if anyone has or is experiencing similar things (which I know you are) let this be a place for a well deserved rant without your mind guilting you into oblivion. You deserve it."
1260,Finally am seeing good changes in me.,"Sooo I got diagnosed with moderate depression last week, I have been taking medication and therapy once every week, have stopped crying for over a week now. Barely have thoughts about killing myself or attempt to self harm, even if I do, I ask my family members to keep things away from me and ask them for genuine help. Realized who my support system is and who isn't, cut off my friends who treat me like crap and compare me and put me down, didn't feel bad about it one bit, still feel uncomfortable going to college, but I'm improving, didn't relapse today. Started watching animes again and reading things I love. Had a self care day for myself yesterday, genuinely ask if I've gone wrong and am open to accept that I've made mistakes and improve. Started making a diary and putting efforts on my therapy and figuring out myself better. Left Instagram and Reddit for a week, felt amazing, I realized social media screwed up my mental health. Before that I muted everyone who triggered me on social media so I'd have a calm mind, I didn't do that before because my mind was fogged up. Started spending time with my family more, caring about them more. Openly say if I'm feeling uncomfortable, realized I got fed up of dramas. Still have a lot of flaws not going to lie, but atleast I can say I'm finally putting efforts to work on myself. :)"
1261,I guess I have to struggle.,"Two days ago I was happy that I am going to a physiatrist. My mother was not into it, but told me that if I need help, which I clearly do, we will go. 

We are quite poor, so I have to go through certain methods to get my consultations covered by the insurance. First was visiting the physiatrist, who was supposed to see if I have a problem, then send me further to a therapist. 

My mom was not digging the physiatrist part especially, since she was afraid of them shoving pills and treatments down my throat. She said we should go directly to a therapist. It meant paying which we clearly couldn't afford and left me thinking that we will never go in fact. 

Her sayings maxed my intrusive thoughts, which are already bad enough. Made me afraid of being misdiagnosed, of taking pills that were not ok for me and my mental health, create crappy scenarios. 

Finally, after doing so, she said last night, two days before the appointment, that she doesn't want me to go. Since I am 17, I can't go unless I have the consent of my parents. She told me she is not ready to unravel all the shits we had been going through and it was against the way she was raised. That telling a stranger how she lived was not appropriate. 

To be honest, we had shitty lives and she feels very guilty for all of that. Poor, living in low conditions, sharing a home w my alcoholic dad, who while has his good moments, is madly selfish and verbally abusive. I told her that it doesn't matter anymore and I am not mad at her. Past is past, I love her nonetheless. She was an abused woman who felt lonely, depressed, unworthy, but it hurts me so much that she is willing to let her clearly mentally ill kid to suffer alone. 

It is fair to mention that she had two strokes and they worsened her mental health. She is so much more paranoiac, afraid and hostile towards doctors. This is the reason I can't be mad at her. This is the reason I started to feel bad for telling her about my violent outbursts and my incapability to function normally. But, in a way, I can't help but being sad, but to feel lonely, abandoned. 

She knows about me having meltdowns so bad that I bruise myself, that I have suicidal tendencies, that I am incapable to properly socializing due to not having the energy to do so, that my mood switches like crazy and I lost my only friend due this, that me daydreaming sometimes impairs my function in world, etc. 

I feel like I am no one's.

I want to change, but I wished I had the help of a professional to help me. World around me feels heavy. Everything is a burden. My mind hurts. I feel down every day. Every moment. But I guess I have to strive by myself until I am 18. It's only half a year away..."
1262,It is time,"I think it’s time I give up. I’ve been suffering for far too long. I’ve been in therapy since I was a kid, I’ve had multiple therapist. I’ve been on meds. I’ve been in hospitals. I was in an intensive outpatient program for 13 months. Nothing is working. The hole inside me just gets bigger. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t even know where to start with typing this so I’m just going to type it all. I’m sorry if it’s a lot. It makes me sad to know that I feel the pain I feel. Since I was young I’ve felt depressed. In 8th grade I started cutting myself. It makes me sad to know that as a 13 year old I had to cut myself to feel better. Freshmen year I was sexually assaulted for the first time and got sent inpatient shortly after. I continued to self harm up until junior year. Junior year I was raped. I was drugged and raped. I then was sent to an intensive outpatient program that was more like a brainwashing cult for 13 months. There I was drug tested twice a week, introduced myself as a drug addict because I was a stoner, went to 3 AA meetings a week even though I had been drunk once in my life, and so on. They took away my high school years. It fucked me up a lot. I moved out of my moms on accident and got stuck living with my dad and his alcoholic ex whom I had grown up with since I was 9. She also used dope a lot. Her kid (my step brother) got taken away about 2 years ago by the state. I haven’t seen him since. We weren’t allowed to talk for like a year because his aunt didn’t see me as his sister even though we lived together for 10 years. I then became the alcoholic/dope addicts caregiver. I’ve called the police to my house over 30 times in the last year. I’ve had to take her to rehab numerous times. She’s tried fighting me, has taken off her clothes in front of me, has said highly inappropriate things, would put me down and would say I’m just like her, etc. I then found her trying to kill herself. I dropped out of college the next day. I got a restraining order against her about 6 months ago. But the memories are still stuck in my head. The constant screaming. My dad even got physical with her and I saw and it’s engraved in my brain. But now that she’s gone my dad now mentally abuses me. He started stalking me like he used to stalk her. He followed around my co workers to ask them questions about me and would call my boss and tell my boss if I kept seeing my one co worker that he needs to fire me. He started threatening my friend and friends dad. He started threatening to beat me up like a man. He calls me mental, stupid, but case, lowlife, loser, etc. It hurts. I can’t leave. I have nowhere to go right now. I had my ex. My ex is another story though. He fucked me up. He raped me in my sleep. Then cheated on me with some girl he knew I was obsessed with that I went to high school with. They met on tik tok. He broke me. He then broke up with me on this most recent Valentine’s Day and then ghosted me for 3 months. Then we were on and off again. I’ve chased him around now for almost 2 years now. It would upset me so much that he didn’t love me that I was throwing up 6-7 times a day. I stopped eating. I lost over 20 pounds. I just feel so ugly and fat and worthless. He left for the army 6 months ago. Before he left he told me he regretted breaking up with me and that he truly loves me. Then when he was in basic he wrote me letters the whole time telling me how much he loves me and how he wants to marry me. He even went as far as to send a ring. Well I called him tonight to find out he has a new girlfriend. He then went on to tell me he wrote those letters for no reason basically. Just because he was in basic and because apparently guys in basic just need someone. He continued to tell me I was psycho and it was my fault we broke up. I get for that 6 months of our relationship I was severely depressed and didn’t want any affection and would sleep constantly and stopped having sex with him but after that I did everything in my power to show him I am worth something. Nothing was every good enough. I drove myself crazy. But now, I know I still will never be good enough. I’ve lost about everyone that means something to me. I feel abandoned. I just feel so stupid and worthless. I’ve thought about killing myself for over 6-7 months now. The thoughts have progressed to everyday lasting sometimes up to 9+ hours. I’ve worked on note 9 times these past two weeks. I’m getting closer to ending things. I can feel it. I just can’t do this anymore. Meds don’t do shit. Therapy doesn’t do shit anymore. The hospital only takes your insurance for a week. I’m fucked. All my money is gone. I’m a college dropout. The love of my life left me again. I’m just fucked. Like this is the fucking end.! I can’t take it anymore 

TLDR; it’s time to kill myself"

1264,Does my son sound like a monster?,"My ten year old son, went on holiday with his Dad, and hurt his step-Mum. They were playing a game, where they had to push eachother under the water, and then my son lost his breathe, and got really angry. He thought his step-Mum had tried to hurt him, so he went and told his Dad. Then he got really angry, and started screaming 'I am going to kill you! Why did you do that?', then he jumped into the water, and pushed her under. He said, 'I did not actually want to kill her. I just wanted to do to her, what she had done to me.' I believe him, because he is usually really kind. He has been physically aggressive, on other occassions though. He bit a boys ankle, because they were running away from him. He kicked another boy, at school, when he go into a fight with him. He slapped his brother, on the arm, because his brother was being rude to him, and his brother turned around, and gave him a black eye. He also, pushed his other brother, off of the bed, when he said something nasty to him. I do not think my son is a monster. Some lady said he will go on to rape, and beat women. Do you think that is true? I would be pretty angry too, if I thought my step-Mum had tried to drown me. She said, my son is abusive, and a monster."

It’s like around people I’m fine I don’t mind but can’t wait to be alone, sorta like taking off a mask at the end of the day. When I’m alone I just feel empty and disassociated. At times I even wonder what I am doing or who I even am. I focus on my work but that’s all that’s really matters- but to what point does work become all you really care for.

1270,"As I turn 25, I'm pretty set on killing myself in the next year","I have a continual, ongoing obsession with the past. This obsession has been ongoing for my whole adult life. I constantly ruminate on past people, events, places. I don't know why it happens, but even after therapy it won't stop. I think I'm just stuck with this for life.

I don't believe the mental health support have properly identified it or come up with an effective strategy on how to handle it. I believe they know just as much as I do.

I believe it is a neurosis I can't identify. It could be trauma. I don't know. But it is definitely obsessional thinking.

I'm 25 and every day I think back from 15-21. It is unhealthy to be this old and thinking back to my teenage and high school years every day.

Most people move from one stage to the next - and when they get to the next stage, they gradually think less about the last stage and begin to forget about it. Moving on from the past, no matter how pleasant or unpleasant, is an important part of life.

There are YouTube personalities I watched when I was 15 who, almost a decade later, I still have an insatiable curiosity about them. I still need to search them up and think about them regularly. I've told them this and they took it well.

My life hasn't gone very far. As my peers graduate, buy houses, have kids, start their careers, I'm still at the university stage trying to get this damn degree.

Even if I do get it, I'm just going to be spending decades working in a cubicle thinking back.

I don't want children because what I deal with isn't practical to living life.

Early this year, I was close to killing myself in a hotel room but didn't. I pussied out. Now I regret it. I wish I killed myself and was dead right now."
1271,Why doesn't my family support me eating healthy?,"I am overweight as I used to binge eat a lot, but I decided to be on a diet, eat more healthy and lose weight.

They want to give me chocolate, fast food and fried stuff, but I refuse as I am determinated in my intention, preferring boiled vegetables and rice and this annoys them.
They keep telling me I'm ill and that this diet is just a fixation. My father is the only one supporting my choice and pushes me into a healthy lifestyle.

1276,10 SIGNS THAT YOUR KIDNEYS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AS IT MUST BE," 

# 10 SIGNS THAT YOUR KIDNEYS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AS IT MUST BE

Our Kidneys have a central part of our own life. It eliminates waste products and extra fluid out of our bodies. The Kidneys are responsible for generating numerous hormones; these hormones aid in creating red blood cells and another hormone, which is accountable for coordinating blood pressure and maintaining metabolism.

*We should be sure that our Kidneys work in the right way because we will suffer from enormous health risks if they don't. There are ten signs which show that our Kidneys do not work well, and these signs are:*

**1-When, we face troubles while we are sleeping:**

If our Kidneys do not work in the right way, the toxins in our bodies cannot exit through the urine, and it will remain inside the blood. The increasing number of toxins in the body will lead to trouble sleeping, which may be a sign of chronic kidney disease.

Cautioning: whenever your doctor diagnosed you with chronic kidney disease, you may suffer from sleep apnea and might be signs of migraine pain. You may ask yourself exactly what the significance of sleep apnea is? Sleep apnea means you'll suffer from a sleeping disorder, which contributes to a couple of fractures of breathing through sleeping/mesothelioma symptoms. 

This can continue anywhere in the minutes to over one minute. We'll consider this situation dangerous and the need for a doctor to view it instantly.

**2-Headaches, weariness, and general weariness:**

Healthy and properly functioning kidneys convert Vitamin D in our bodies to maintain healthy bones and to produce a hormone called Erythropoietin (EPO). This hormone plays an essential role in the production of red blood cells. When kidneys don't function properly, they produce less EPO. The decline of red blood cells (those that carry oxygen/mesothelioma prognosis) results in rapid fatigue of your muscles and brain.

**Warning:** It's typical for individuals with Chronic Kidney Infection to get anemia. Anemia may develop when somebody has 20% to 50 percent of normal kidney function. If you are getting adequate sleep and rest but keep experiencing feelings of fatigue, low energy levels, and overall weakness, drop by your physician.... **open to read more**

1279,What is going on? Should I be concerned?,"Hi! This is my very first post on Reddit, please tell me if I’m doing anything wrong. I’ll take down the post if it is too off-topic, but I didn’t find a more suitable subreddit.
recently, I (16F) had an embarrassing encounter with a person named X a few times. It was nothing serious, and later on X teased me about it, we both had a good laugh. 

On Thursday, when I arrived home, I started thinking like X was watching me. I normally don’t thoroughly clean my room, but I did, because if X is watching me, I have to show a good side of mine to them. I studied properly for my classes on Friday, and I even did extra credit work. I am not sure what the real reason behind this is, but it is somehow connected to X “watching me”, which is physically impossible, since I live on the 8th floor of an apartment, and I live with my parents, therefore there’s no way that X could get into my house. X is a lot older than me, I do not know their exact age, but I know for sure that I am not attracted to their age group. I do get a bit nervous around them, and I don’t really know how to explain, but it’s not in a romantic way for sure.

This happened once previously, when I was 14, and I thought I had a crush on that person (not X, let’s call them B), but I never wanted anything, not even physical affection. My heart did flutter around B, and it kept going on for a good year, but I never wanted anything. Sometimes I acted as if B was watching me. They were really interested in sports, so I started exercising not to impress them, since I would have never gathered the courage to just go up to B, but to show B that if they were watching me, I am good at sports too. This happened after an embarrassing encounter as well.

Why do I keep acting as if X is watching me? I am picking up habits that I would normally never think about doing, and I constantly think about them. I tried dealing with these thoughts, and I can control them easily, but whenever I see anything that reminds me even a bit of X, I continue thinking about them and acting as if they’re watching me. I’ve been learning dance choreographies at home recently, but due to this, I can’t move around properly since I feel like X is watching me, and I am uncomfortable with dancing in front of them. 

I appreciate any help or comment, thank you for reading this post."

It's like a very long glitch. I stop frozen in the middle of a war, something like that.  I encounter it when i feel overwhelmed, when things are happening all at once, when there's too much stimulus and when in an argument. Esp in an argument (usually w my SO), i don't speak. I know i come off rude but if i start speaking i might end up saying something i don't really mean. I don't reply with calls or messages. I'd avoid it at all cost. And i told him about it that i freeze, he said that i should atleast try. And i do try. But It's...hard. I know i can't avoid everything and i have to face things i'm not very comfortable dealing with but i don't know how.

1282,Question about Lexapro,"About a month ago I started 10mg Lexapro after a 3 week battle with ruminating, anxiety, depression. I have never had something like this happen before. It all started after weeks of not sleeping well.

After 10 days on Lexapro, I started noticing dramatic improvement. After 2.5 weeks, remarkable improvement. Had a wonderful Thanksgiving with my family of 4.

Then, through this past week I noticed anxiety creeping back in. Slowly. Each day a little more. Over this past weekend, it was elevated but manageable. Being with my wife last night watching shows after dinner was noticeably anxiety free. This morning, however, it's nearly unbearable.

1289,Resentment for people who have felt loss/had real family,"I know this sounds weird, and I know it's wrong that I feel this way.

But as a person who doesn't understand grief, I almost am angry for the fact that I don't understand normal things like how sad it is to have a grandmother with Alzheimer's, how sad it is to lose a dog, etc. I also used to resent people who felt that Christmas (or Holidays) was a time of bonding, because I just didn't understand it. 

If my family members died I would shrug, feel slightly confused, or actually be glad. I've never had much a family in the first place and most of them suck.

I'm sure people will call me a psychopath, but it's more like I'm just angry that I was raised in such a way that makes me unfeeling. Honestly, my mother causes more problems than she solves, and all my father is is a person who gives me money every now and then. My sister raped me, and my other one abused me and trauma bonded with me after going through the same experience. If they all died I would low-key be okay, I already avoid them as much as I can. (Okay, I would be a little sad to be honest with you but most of it is trauma-bonding grief or trauma-related grief). 

When my grandfather died I said good riddance, because he was annoying. I suppose I'd feel a tinge of pain imagining my cousins dying, but at the same time it happens.

If any of my family had some horrible disease where they couldn't remember anything, I would just be disturbed for the fact that a person has to suffer this way, but I wouldn't be sad.

Even after being in love with a person for 2 years, discarding him was easy for me. The only thing I felt for him was a selfish pain where I want him back, but now I don't even want that. And I'm ghosting him with no explanation because I don't care about his feelings after he abused mine.

I also have difficulty connecting to friends. 

Anyone else who basically has very estranged family members feel the same way I do? I've never actually met someone who feels the way I do except for my own father."
1290,Christmas lows and stress,"The last few days have been...chaos to say the least.

It just suddenly been tight and I’m realising it’s going to be super tight to make ends meet till end of January. 

I know I’ll find a way but it’s just a mentally crushing going from a decent financial point to scraping. I’d leave the medication but I can’t risk having an asthma attack at work (I’ll lose my bonus which can make a big difference in how the next month goes) or not being well. 

Was hoping I could have a Christmas without worrying but apparently life has different plans. Anyways hope you all are having better times."

I can’t keep going thru this I need to tell someone but I can’t tear my family apart. Everyone will think I’m disgusting. Everyone will call me a liar. I will suffer in silence until I die if it means it won’t come to light. I need something other than sexual shit to cope. Help? Anything is good.

1293,What is the point of living if you feel nothing. And never will.,"I found out that I have a disorder that renders me unable to feel love. For a long time I thought it was just an aversion to commitment and relationships. Buts its not.

I know that I should love people. I should feel love for my partners and family. But I cant. And likely never will. 

Everywhere I look. TV, movies just having conversations with people. Love is everything. Its what people live for. I have never felt so empty. So hopeless. 

I don't think I can do this. Go through life knowing I won't feel the one thing we all live for as human beings. I can't convince myself that this life is worth living solely for the reason of ""killing yourself is bad, YOU are loved"". For the fist time in my life I genuinely want to die. I feel nothing but contempt for being brought into this existence. What a waste of everyone's and feelings."
1294,I have absolutely no idea what's happened to me,"Hello. I'm 18 and I've had a behavioral change. And there's absolutely no reason why there would be one. It's completely unrelated to quarantine because every day I'm around people. And about a month and a half ago, I was happy to be around people, more extroverted, and generally pretty healthy. 


But, I've changed behaviorally. It's so weird. I've noticed subtle changes. I've get so fucking suspicious of every day occurrences and people, becoming more and more reclusive, I feel like I meed to escape social settings  (not in a drained energy way but just... I dunno), I feel like everyone is working against me, I want to just fuckin run and go somewhere, amd shit. Also have become extremely scared of intimacy and attraction. I used to have no issue with people being attracted to me, but now I've become insanely uncomfortable with it. 



I know it's not bipolar. That's all I know.



But yeah. It's fucking scary"
1295,Any other NHS Step 2 workers here?,"I’ve been a trainee psychological well-being practitioner (PWP) since March, finishing March 2021 and juts gone up to 6 clinical contacts a day.

Am I alone in thinking this is fucking bonkers? This is not sustainable. I feel like I have 12 hours of work a days to cram into 7.5 hours. There is a ludicrous amount of admin and I am actively incentivised to cram as many clients in as possible, regardless of suitability.

I am absolutely not surprised people very rarely stay in step 2 long or that there is such a high turnover rate of staff. The pay is awful for the work and responsibility. I’m curious if other workers find more success in step 3 or how people have managed to stay in step 2, or even what people have pivoted into afterwards.

Cheers
A burnt out PWP"

i can't understand any of this. why am i thinking this way? it's not like i have any real reason to think i'm faking - other than the FACT that my struggles are so tiny and minute compared to literally everyone elses.

it's really taking a toll on me this whole thing. i cant stop thinking and dreading. i feel like ive been lying this whole time about being depressed, wanting to die, my anxiety, all of struggles i have with my appearance, my sexuality :( i feel like it's all a lie done by me to try and get some attention.

i actually feel horribly sick. i feel lke everytjing i do is for appearances or good reputation. i feel like i only told my parents / therapist about all of my ""struggles"" because i wanted some attention. and i've been having moments during the day (albeit after crying fits) after being hopelessly sad where i suddenly get really ecstatic and energetic like im on top of the world. it only lasts a little while before i start doubting myself again and thats when i start to feel like i'm faking it all.

please help me :( does anybody struggle with this too? nd especially the sudden burst of happiness and energy before i start getting anxious again."
1300,How do you put aside the feeling of loneliness?,"First of all, I'm a rather rational person than someone who often makes decisions based on their emotions. But as most of us do, I also value friendships and relationships. Now that one month ago my university temporarily closed due the government measures (to tackle the virus), my social contacts have drastically decreased. 

I met some of my friends since then, but communicaton between us is almost entirely ceased. So, I guess I should have done more or better in terms of friendships at some point back then when life was normal, but it was always me who initiated meetings and conversations and I got tired of putting so much energy into people who don't seem to care about me as much as I do about them. 

The solution would be meeting new people of course but at the moment, everything is closed here and people don't go anywhere, they stay at home. Also, it's fucking cold out there. So I have a really hard time with my feelings right now and this situation will last for two more months at least.

I would really need social support (friends) right now and I feel like I need a relationships in my life too so that I can move forward with my goals. I know I have potential and I could do better but I became lazy and unmotivated because I don't have love in my life. This social incompleteness blocks me from becoming my best self and I feel really, really stuck in self-actualization.

It's not that I don't fulfill my duties or that I don't do well/average, I usually manage to pull of my exams with the results I need and usually I understand things pretty quickly when I have to solve a problem.
I feel like I'm wasting my life and my best years. For example, I have always loved learning languages and reading, but nowadays I just don't do that anymore despite having so much time on my hands.

So I guess I should ditch these thoughts and just concentrate on myself, but when I feel lonely I just watch a film or series, which is, you know, not the most useful thing. And this activity takes up 2-3-4 hours of my life everyday. It could be the time span for doing something useful, to work on myself, but I just can't pull myself together and I get caught up in this lack of affection.

I would love to read your experience with loneliness and how you guys deal with stuff like this. Also, I'm happy to try out your tips on actually following through with plans instead of just planning them.

If you have managed to read through my text, thanks!"
1301,Do I cut her off after getting friendzoned?,"I’ve been friends with (we’ll say) Jess. For almost 6 years now; we met the summer or my 8th grade year. I’ll be honest and say I had a really innocent crush on her for most of the early years. 

As we became better friends (best friends possibly) in high school, I developed stronger feelings. I would suppress these feelings by seeing other people and just trying to ignore it.(She was dating as-well) 

After a bad break up on both ends we spent A LOT of time together. Went out of town and hung out almost every day. I started to realize just how happy she made me. 

We then had a rough patch, stopped talking for a year or so. She ended up hitting me up and we repaired the friendship almost 100% and shit was awesome. We spent so much time together, went out of town, met parts of each others family we haven’t already. 

She ended up asking me “what are we” one weekend at a buddies cabin and everything came out. We had an amazing weekend spent dancing, kissing, drinking and all of the “feelings” came out. This was one of the happiest weekends of my life. I thought my mission was complete and I got to be the man to make this women happy. 

Well after this weekend, we talked and I got sort of a false hope and then ignored for a week or so. We picked up the convo again and it just isn’t happening I guess. She’s just not dating or whatever. 

Now this is all cool with me. However she wants to go about this is fine. Her life she can live it how she wants of course. 

But now i’m left with this half feeling of being friendzoned and it’s eating me alive. It’s rough thinking of how happy I was, how happy I am with her. I’m just beating myself up and i’m trying to just let it go. My emotions, anxiety and depression are really taking it’s toll. 

We’re both young adults moving forward in life with jobs and such. This issue is coming in between me and my career. I find myself stimulating myself more, trying to just forget about all of this and acclimate to whatever it is now. 

Do I cut her off, keep putting up with it regardless of the ramifications on myself or anything else? 

If you have the time to read and give any advice I appreciate this greatly. I don’t want to cut her off but if I need to, I need to. Thank you :)"
1302,somethings up with me and i dont know what to do,"hi umm this is my first post and english is my third language so excuse my mistakes. I dont know how to start so im just going to jump into it. im doing post graduation, living abroad. since last 14 months i have become extremely lazy and i havent left my bed for anything other than essentials. the number of times l have gone out would be less than 20. i had my thesis due last semester but i hardly wrote one page and well as pandemic happened i got to use it as an excuse for extension for my thesis. I have had a comfortable life and a happy childhood with a supporting family. I see absolutely no reason for me to be behaving the way i am. my apetite has slowly dwindled over the year and i eat very little. Although i was never much healthy to begin with (im 5'4 or 163cm and weighed around 47 kgs / 104 pounds before and now i weigh around 41 kgs/ 90 pounds ) but now i dont feel hungry even if a whole day goes by and I eat cause im aware that it wont do me any good not eating for long. I spend my whole day on my phone reading novels, mangas, or scrolling through insta homepage. Im shedding hair like a cat, probably due the lack of nutrition. I dont think im depressed - as i dont see any reason for me to be depressed. My basic needs are always fullfilled, objectively speaking im pretty,  i have had an outgoing personality, i can easily blend in with any group of people, i have friends and family , nor am i bad at studying as i have been always at the top of the class. My dad has always been very strict about studies and getting good grades and i am yet to dissapoint in that regard. Well im sure if things keep going as they are ill be bringing alot of wrath upon myself -failing with a 3.9 Cgpa because i didnt submit my thesis will surely shock my whole family. sometimes i feel like theres a disconnect between my mind and my body and physical pain fascinates me at times - would it be right to say that i have thought of killing my self out of curiosity and simple boredom. no other reason , just because life seems to be an inconvenience. I have contemplated it at times, not sure why i havent tried it yet but im fully aware i cant do it even if i ever plan to because of the hurt and shame it will bring to my family , oh i think i should mention my background is conservative musilm south asian (patriarchal system, big families, arrange marriages, spicy food and the likes so yeah killing oneself is haram/forbidden in islam so you dont even get a proper funeral ceremony)  . lol the more i write the more i think im just being stupid right now because all i have to do is to wake up on time , eat on time, work on my thesis, maybe go for a stroll and sleep on time. Thats all its gonna take to put my life back in order. As simple as it sounds its been one year and i just havent done it. I have this need to run away not sure from what or towards what, im just being absolutelty ungrateful im sure. anyways i dont know what else to write, i dont expect much from this post either  i thought maybe writing would help me gather my thoughts or be therapeutic or idk clear my head but nothing has changed. i wanna snuggle and start another novel."

1304,MY THOUGHTS ON MEDICATIONS,"*Disclamer: This is my experience with mental health medications, I am not a professional or anthing, this is only MY opinion. ALWAYS consult about medications with your psychiatrist!

Little backstory: i started going to therapy 11 years ago, when I was 10 years old. In my mental health road I have tried so many medication, from antipsychotics, antidepressants, stabilizator of mood. 
(Zeldox, torendo and risperidal, wellbutrin, abilify, cipralex, edronax, lyrica, sanval (sleeping pill), depakene,...) 
I think at some point the medications were neccessary, I have stopped taking it 2 months ago tho. But the side effects of all these medications were so bad...i had side effects like: no energy at all, constantly tired, couldnt even function (everything even cooking a meal was really challenging), milk coming out of my breast, shaking, wetting the bed every night when i was small, couldnt control my body, contracted muscles (couldn't even walk), loss of orientation and stability, slow thinking, concentration problems, i couldnt wake up, literally my boyfriend was waking me up at least one hour so i could just open my eyes a bit and sensed that he is trying to wake me up although he was moving me and everything, and so many more i could go on years...
I decided few months ago I don't want to live life like this because this was no life for me. I was living zombie.
After 11 years of psychoterapy, I worked a lot on myself I consulted with my psyhiatrist and my boyfriend's father (he is a really good doctor) and i slowly decreased the medications over months. I felt it was time to do it and i felt I was ready for it (have tried it many times before,didn't succeed).
After stopping taking meds: 
I have a lot of withdrawal effects right now including nausea, vomiting, pains all over the body (headaches, stomach aches, throat aches), insomnia,.etc...
BUT: we are expecting these symptoms so dissapear over time...
I also noticed so much progress: I am more social, I talk a lot more, my memory is much better, I can actually feel emotions again, my thoughts have completely changed and I talk a lot more and am more positive and can have a deep long conversations I couldnt have before, my creativity is better, my imagination, i can wake up way more easily... and many more! 
I think it is completely worth it...still not at the end yet but i see a lot of progress.
So I wanted to suggest things that helped me to get here:
-a lot of therapy, I had 3 therapist at once, one was helping me on analyzing everything, especially traumas and family problems, one was really practical and spiritual that helped me a lot with excercises and meditations (she had an alternative exercises and opinions about ""disorders and disease""), and one for daily life problems
-meditation, meditation meditation (i worked a lot on focusing oriented therapy, mindfullnes, and other meditation tehniques) 
-a lot of nature, walks and exercises and also keeping care for my dog
-being the most social i can (supportive friends are really imprtant, and also in my case my really supportive and understanding boyfriend)
-listening to uplifting music
-when i felt bad listening to metal, sad songs so i got the emotions out
-always 1

*my body is extremely sensitive to any medication"
1305,[Serious] Trying to help somebody who can’t be truly helped is frustrating,"Hello call me AK!

I have an online friend who is fun to talk to and makes me smile and laugh. Unfortunately they are depressed and suicidal. I try my best to help them but it’s hard. We live ten hours apart (I’m American and they are Australian) and I can’t always be on when they are as I have a life too. 

They say things that worry me but due to not knowing any real personal information I can’t do much. Their family isn’t the best and won’t get them help. 

Meanwhile I’m trying to make them feel better but I feel like I’m preventing the inevitable. I’m just a teenager with my own issues not a therapist or med doctor so how much can I really do?

1306,Death follows me,"Somehow, deep down, I believe that somehow I'm the cause of all the deaths in my life.

It started out when I was about 10.

My moms best friend died, I'm not even sure how but when that woman's daughter had a baby a few years later me and my mom went to go visit her in the hospital. I remember thinking I had to make sure I sanitized properly so the baby wouldn't die because of me and then I immediately thought about my mom's friend.

Years and years go by and nobody dies in my life.

A little over a year ago my best friend's aunt dies. It felt so weird to me. I knew her so well. I thought to myself ""why does death follow me around? I feel like next death is going to me or someone I'm close to"" This happened around August 2019.

Fast forward to January 2020, my best friend commited suicide and I found his body. I'm traumatized by this of course. 

Fast forward to today.. My girlfriend's mom is having panic attacks and thoughts of suicide. Exactly a year ago today my best friend, before he killed himself, checked into a mental hospital. Her mother is checking into a mental hospital today. 

I'm so afraid I'm going to lose someone again.

1307,"Am I incapable of love, and is it my fault?","I guess this is a question. I'm not sure. I don't think I'm capable of love. Like familial love or loving animals, I get I understand it. But not romantic love. I've never felt love for anyone romantically. And I don't know if that's my failure or someone else's failure when I was being raised. Beyond that, I don't feel like I'm even worthy of someone else's love. I don't even love myself.

1310,Six years of sadness: depression and me. My story," 

Hi all,

This is the second Depression subreddit I have joined. I've decided to speak about my experiences here to see if it can help anyone here or if anyone can help me as I've found some of my posts have no responess.

I'm 17 years old, nearly 18. I'm male. I live in the UK and the past two months have been the toughest in my life. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, and on medication (will get to that later)

But my story goes back beyond 2 months, so I will start from there.

It's not light reading - in terms of content or length. So I hope you have some patience.

**My experience of bullying**

So I'd say for the entire duration of my adolesence I have struggled in one way or the other. In my first year of secondary school (I'm not sure what grade this is equivelant to in the US and other countries, but the age is 11-12). I'd recently moved to the area. I had a bad feeling about the school from the moment I arrived. My parents however, were keen for me to go. So, I did.

In the summer of 2014, they had a summer school at this school which I attended. That was when my first experiences of bullying there started. Pretty low level. These two girls, stealing my equipment. But it got worse and I ended up having a day or so off. But I did make some friends.

When I started in September that year,I felt alone. I remember texting my mum, as I stood outside in the playground, alone. The ""friends"" I had made, quickly abandoned me. Almost instantly, a campaign of bullying began against me. Firstly, it was just insults and stuff. Low-level stuff, though it did get worse. It was very cliquey - like an american high school or something. Almost everyone bullied me. A lot of them were girls. I started that school with an open mind, perhaps innocent, perhaps naiive. Within weeks, that had all gone. I was hardened. I was bold, I was assertive, something I no longer am. Fights and other acts of violence were almost the norm, happening on a near daily basis. I believed fighting would get me respect, the respect I needed to prove I wasn't gonna take sh\*t from anyone. So, one December morning, I went out into the playground, demanding one of the main bullies come to fight me. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately depending on what way you look at it, one of his lackeys showed up instead. *I wanted the organ grinder, not the monkey!* The main bully in question was supposedly in detention, so I had it off with this kid instead. It wasn't really a proper fight, though I guess you coudl say I ""won"", as I ripped his shirt, and he gave up. Eventually, a fellow student managed to mediate some kind of truce between the two of us.

The school's policy was not to expel any kids, regardless of how bad they were, something which worked great for them, but worked terribly for the rest of us. The school's strategy for bullying? They basically told me to accept it and put up with it. This was coming from the head of year, a black woman. I said to her ""*If you were getting racist abuse, would you like it if we told you to ""put up with it""?"" I can't* remember what she sadi to that. anyway, it was decided in the school's infinite wisdom, that i would be moved from one half of the year to the other, so that the bullying would stop. Of course, this didn't happen, as everyone on that side of the year, many of whom used to be my ""friends"" bulied me. Things went from bad to worse. I was physically bullied, but I would retaliate. Something I wish I could have done later. One of the most brutal forms of bullying against me, and I was embarassed to talk about it for years, was when I was lured into an ambush by these girls. They told me this girl liked me, and of course, me being young and innocent, I thought i was going to meet her. I waited outside of the building at lunch, supposedly for this girl to turn up.

The girl did turn up.

But she wasn't alone.

At least three girls I believe, turned up, walking towards me. What was going on? I don't remember exactly what happened next, but this girl accused me of looking up her skirt or something, and then physically assaulted me, and pushed me over this small fence thing onto some dirt. I was kicked and punched. By a girl! It was both humiliating, degrading and upsetting. I cried, and the girl was merely suspended for a day or two as shes just had ""anger issues"". I can't remember what fight it was, but I remember basically the entire year group chased me, hunted for me like some kind of lynching, and faced me off, shouting at me ""We don't want you in our school!"". I got called all sorts. Most of it went on under the very noses of the teachers, who of course, did nothing, either choosing to turn a blind eye, or believing it was merely ""banter"" or some other menial exchange of words. In May that year, I had enough. After seeing a counsellor, I decided to leave. I went to the school which was about a two minute walk from me, which made far more sense, and in hindsight I shoudl ahve gone there from the start.

**The Bullying re-starts**

There was a hiatus of about a year so from this. at my new school, I settled in well, and made a fair few friends. Well, most of them were merely aquitances, but this was like being in a different world compared to where I was before. There was a girl at my new school who went to my old one, and I was always consciously aware she could spill the beans on my background. She did say a thing or two about the incident of me being beaten up by a girl, but she was the kind of girl that pissed everyone off, and so she lost all credibility after repeating it about sxi times.

Year 8 of school (12-13) was a good year, probably my best school year. though looking back i can see the ""friends"" i attatched myself too weren't really friends. I was the white kid who thought it was cool to chill with the black kids, they were like evanangelical christians or something, and I immersed myself into their culture. But I was mostly just used by them for stuff, like buying them lunch. Nothing came of our friendship, and I lost further contact with them when another white kid joined the group and kind of kicked me out. I had also made a group of friends with these other kids who were local to me. In hindsight, they were all little so and sos, which i will rexplain in a moment. We had a good time though.

But as seems to be the case for almost everything in my life, it didn't last.

Put it simply, they turned on me and started bullying me. I think it started over some childish, pathetic thing over fake instagram accounts. I was accused of saying sometyhing to someone, which IU didn't, by one of my friends, turning them all against me. They then bullied me. It wasn't that bad, a lot of it took place online, other times they would do things like trip me up or threaten to fight me. But I was weak and timid, despite probably nearling six foot by this age.

I had no friends. I started going to this place in school. It's called the oasis centre. It's basically for troubled kids who struggle with mainstream classroom learning. I got on really well with the lady who runs it. I know that year I was close to this girl, her name was Grace, and I think I basically got friendzoned on day one, but either i didn't see it, or i didn't care, I was just grateful to have a friend. But...

It didn't last.

As the year progressed, we got further apart. She stopped talking to me in class, she started sitting elsewhere. I later found out she had a boyfriend. I was admittedly quite rude to her in the end, I was jealous I can't lie, but I was so pissed off about being back to square one again.

**The PTSD years**

If the next two years (2017-2019, so aged 14-16) could be characterised by something, it would be my past coming back to haunt me.

I went into Year 10, hoping to start afresh, and almost be treated like a different person. But that...

Didn't happen.

I honestly can't remember too much about what happened in these years, as for some reason my memory of being in Year 10 (14-15) is prety rough, and most of Year 11 (15-16) was characterised by me doing my exams.

The overriding theme however in these years, was the past coming back to haunt me. Meaning? The bullying.

The bullying was probably continuing at this point, but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the bullyign i faced in Year 7. They weren't trying to bully me again or something - they couldn't, they went to a different school. But rather, I was becoming increasingly paranoid that somehow, they would find me again, and expose me and reveal how they bullied me, and then bully me again.

This, whilst somewhat irrational, was not completely out of the question. The shitty town I live in (yes its expensive, yes its very green and upmarket but theres nothing to do and i h ate a lot of the people) is small, and everyone seems to know everyone, particuarly with the youth population. Ocassionally, they would try to follow or message me on social media. I began to have nightmares, about being attacked again, about being found by these bullies. I would be so paranoid, whenever I went out in my town centre, I'd either literally hide in the car, or cover my face. My first, and my only instinct, was survival. I knew I couldn't fight - so I had to run, or hide. Something I've done too much of in my life. Running or hiding (avoiding) from situations, people, places. It was no life. I had imprisoned myself in my bedroom, a place where I am still in captivity. I began to see a psycologist, or some other official soundign person. But he never helped. Instead, he just expected me to open up, and seemed to be more interested in my ""*sexual fantasies""* than anything else. But he, and others believed, I could be suffering with PTSD, given my symptoms. I'd go out ,and I thought I would see them, these bullies. But they weren't there.

I did a stupid thing that year. I don't know if it was jealousy or just me being an arse, but I catfished this boy online who I had been good friends with for a long time. Our friendship had drifted apart, and I guess it was just a joke that went wrong. He found out it was me, and it ended. I had fucked things up again. I ended up catfishing other people too. I often ask myself: why? I never did it malicously. One of my rationale - me being very self conscious and self aware that I had never had a relationship - was to create an online persona of a girl that I could claim to have a relationship with, or to have her comment on my pictures. I'm so pathetic honestly. I stopped it earlier this year, though in periods of intense boredom in my life, i've done it. I never really take it very far, and I stopped doing it to people, and instead just got off on it tbh. I've found it weird, but given i've been catfished myself two times (pretty obvious , but perhaps karma lol), I'm actually quite comfortable discussing it, its more common than a lot of people think. As said, I never did it to get nude pictures of people to manipulate them with ,God no. In some ways, it benefited me? How? Because I got to see how other guys talked to girls online, somethign I was ,and probably am still terrible at. It made me realise how much guys objectify women, but also taught me a caht up line or two. I also managed to catch this arse\*hole basically cheating on his gf, as he msessaged me asking me for nudes. I never exposed him though as it would be obvious as to who it would be. this happened quite recently. But alas, back to 2018. Now 2019. In this year, I ignored the fact I had no friends, knowing it was my last year of school, and most of the people i didnt like wouyld be leaving. I focused on my exams instead. In January, I managed to see a specialist, offering help to me with my PTSD or symptoms of PTSD with EMDR. ( Eye movement desensitization and reprocessin ). This is a relatibvely novel treatment, created in 1988. I had never heard of it, and the national health service (NHS), the free at point of use service we have in the UK, had just begun offering it. I was considered eligible for it. It aims to deal with traumatic events, such as rape, child abuse, bullying, etc etc. I can't remember exactly how it worked, but it was less about talking, and more about fiollowing hand or finger movements. Within a few months, I could go out again. I was no longer scared of the past, and the bullies. I credited this to me having faith in God. I still had faith at this point, and I believed God, not the EMDR had helped me. In hindsight, I know it was probably the EMDR that helped, but I was also perhaps unwilling to admit it.

During these years I had also developed problems with my back. I was always self conscious of my rear sticking out quite a bit, and my spine being curved. I found this was due to kyphosis and scoliosis, as well as scheuermanns disease. In the early stages of my diagnosis, I considered killing myself once or twice, just to end the physical and mental pain of it. I couldn't run, my main hobby, my main outlet - was gone. I used to love running. I ran for miles, and miles. In the searing heat, or the frigid snow, I'd be out almost every day. And I loved it. I was self conscious about my increasingly tall stature already, at about 6'2, and having surgery would just make met taller. So I decided against it. But the pain - its bad, and it still hasn't gone. I still can't really run. But I've moved on.

**A new start?**

The summer of 2019 aws one of the best times for me, even though it paled in comparison to other people's summers that involved partying, going to prom etc etc. I had no one to do these activities with. What did I do instead? Quite a lot. I began to see a lot of my grandad. I loved spending time with him. We would sit together in his room in my grandparent's retirement flat, sharing our love of country music, and sharing stories with me. He had dementia, worsening, but we could still talk. It was an extended summer, as due to exams, we finish school about six weeks earlier than everyone else. We went to Barcelona as a family, and then to Norfolk, in eastern england. I had been talking to this girl fir a while, who I had met online through social media.

In the UK, sixth form/college is the equivelant of American High School. I was hoping this would be a fresh start, as most people there were new. However, I struggled severely. I found incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to find peopl to talk to who were willing to sustain a conversation with me. Again, everything was very clicquey. For the umpteenth time in my life. I was alone. The girl I had been talking to online? We had been due to meet, I had been prepared to travel well over an hour, nearly two hours, to see her, but I found out she had been talking to someone else and was having a relationship with them. I was fuming. Then I was just upset.

I seriously considered leaving school, and going to another one. But the other two that I emailed woiuld not accept me. I was screwed. I'd just have to hold out for two years at my current school. I spent mots of my free time in Oasis. I used to like it there, but now most people there were younger than me, i was the only sixth-former there, and i felt so isolated. I hated life.

**Losing Grandad**

When someone you love is suddenly admitted to hospital in an ambulance, it's never good news.

However, my grandad had been in the local hospital so many times, and had left unscathed, usually as a consequence of a urine infection. However, I was well aware of my grandad's age, now 80, and the fact his dementia was worsening. My dad was worried - he had been called at God knows what time in the morning, some ungodly hour, and had lost patience with the hospital barrier, ramming it out of the way, much to the pleasure of other motorists waiting to get in the car park. How he avoided getting fined I still don't know.

Visiting grandad would be a regular occurence in the weeks around Christmastime. What a time! He was increasingly delirious, believing he had been kidnapped by my aunt, and that he had committed a crime that he needed to ""hand himself in"" for.

He was transferred to a smaller hospital. I hated hospitals. But this one in particular. The ward was filled with other mostly elderly patients, with one shouting his head off at 10 second intervals. We'd be sitting around his bed for what felt like hours, painstakingly waiting for dinner to arrive and then for him to eat it. I was impatient, and I regret it. I remember asking my dad one time when we left hospital ""He's not coming out of hospital, is he?"". But my dad appeared to dispute this, believing he was on the road to recovery.

Winter that year was a bleak and blustery affair. It was mild. Wet. Stormy. Windy. Snowless. Everything winter shouldn't be, the winter was. I'll explain it more later, but I believe due to my possible ASD, I ended up having a fixation with the weather and tempreatures, and probably had some kind of ""eco-anxiety"" for a while. It's not something I talk about often, but I do remember constantly reading alarmist headlines with regards to the climate and scarign myself to death about the future. I laugh at this now. How can I worry about what will happen in twenty, thirty years time when I have to worry about just making it to the next day?

It was one morning in...I think it ws January, maybe early February, but I could be wrong, when I was told to come downstairs ""for some news"". This...this was never going to be good. Like when my nan died, I knew something was wrong. ""It's grandad isn't he?"" I said. ""He's got cancer"" dad replied. ""He's got 3-4 months"" or something like that. I instatnyl began to cry. I was already having a sh\*tty morning. My brother did the same. My dad didn't cry, and I've never seen him cry. I applaud him for that. He muts be a very strong man. Though I found out recently he too suffered with depression around this time due to his dad and work pressure.

I saw grandad later that day, in hospital. He was going to be released and sent home. They had given up trying to help rehabilitate his mobility, and would now send him home, his final resting place.

Lockdown in the UK begun on the 23rd March. Schools had ended a few days earlier, the government bowing to the inevitable. I had no idea when we would be back ,but in some ways, lockdown had done me a favour: it meant that a large chunk of those two years at sixth form could be bypassed.

Lockdown was eerie. For the first time in my life, there was uncertainty as to whether there would be food on the table. Okay, maybe that is *slightly* dramatic, but nonetheless, there was a risk we would go hungry. I remember queuing up outside of shops, something that seems surreal, as we all piled into supermarkets, maskless, and standing right next to each other in the middle of a FUCKING PANDEMIC.

Two days into lockdown - the 25th - my nan emailed me. something vague about wanting to speak to a doctor. My nan usually sends erratic and erroneous emails and so I chose to ignore it, though I showed dad. He then got a call from nan.

There was a knock on my door.

There was bad news.

Grandad had taken a turn for the worse. He wasn't well.

I had not been there when my nan on my mum's side of the family had died, and I wasn't going to do the same with my grandad. ""Yes"" I said, when my dad asked me if I wanted to come. I had a duty to.

I dropped the coursework I was wroking on, grabbed my phone and a charger - and we were off. 60. 70. 80. We were speeding down that highway as if it were a racetrack. It was completyely void of other traffic though. We arrived, passing friends of my grandad, oblivious to the fact he was on his deathbed. Nan had chosen to keep it from them for now. I went in to see my grandad. Social distancing had gone out the window.

Grandad...grandad was in a bad way. His breathing - it wasn't right. I've never been wiht someone when they were dying before, and it made me a lot more emotional than I thought. I began to cry, as I clenched his hand. I couldn't tell if he was trying tol say something or not. He couldn't speak.

We left, and headed home.

It was later in the evening, when we got a call: grandad had died.

There was no emotion, it was, after all, the inevitable. I cracked open a bottle of cider, the only alcohol I knew at that point, and drank. One of those days! Little did I know there would be plenty more of them to come.

The cermation was a solitary and grim affair. I didn't even have a proper suit. I just wore an old school shirt and tie, my grey coat, and a pair of trousers and school shoes. I remember my nan's funeral, it was bright and lively. This was just depressing. The limits on people meant hardly anyone could be there. I had often planned about speaking about grandad's life to a large audience, but this sort of celebration never happened. The only comfort we were allowed was to toucha nd put a rose on the coffin as its made its way into the chapel. Ironic. Grandad was an atheist. The chapel doors were then promptly shut. And that was it. We were to disperse. I cried. I had not only lost my grandad. I had lost a friend. A fucking, fucking good friend. In some ways, despite the age difference, he was almost like a brother to me. And the worst part of it? WE couldn't even give him the send off he deserved.

**Lockdown**

The first few weeks of lockdown weer okay. I tried to be optimisitc, patriotic even, thinking that this virus could genuinely be defeaten. I tired to think of the wars in the past and how my ancestors would have coped. All we had to do was stay inside. I told myself to stop worrying, and make the best of long walks in the frosty mornings. It really was surreal, and a part of me embraced this dystopian like world. Wearing a mask was a novelty then, I had worn one before lockdown even began. But after a few weeks, when it became clear that this would go on for more than a month, I became depressed. Particuarly given my birthday, which really was, despite my mum's best efforts, pretty crap.

I wanted to make tghe most of lockdown by using it as an opportunnity to try and build relationships, friendships and otherwise, online. My new years resolution was to get a girlfriend. I was, and still am, hugely self conscious. I hate the way I look. My parents tell me im handsome and that - but they're your parents. They're not going to tell you you're fucking ugly are they? I talked to lots of girls. Nothing ever came. One of the girls i talked to - and when i say talk, i mean pretty brief - was this girl in Oasis. Her name was Alana. When i first saw her there, i thought she was about 13/14. Year 9. I found her attractive, and im cringing because of this, because I liked her tits. I found out she was year 8, which means 12/13, so i kind of stopped feeling that way about her. But in lockdown, I admitted to her online I did find her attractive. When she asked me what i liked about her? I said her tits. I'm a terrible person. I don't know what age i thought she was then, 12 or 13. She said she had a girlfriend, and nothing happened.

A month later ,she asked me out. This flattered me, because this was the first girl to ever ask me out. How fucking pathetic. I said i hjad to ""think about it"". this was a delaying tactic. I knew it would be weird, especially when I established she was a fcouple of monthgs away off being 13. I'm not sure if i knew this from the start, and i have beaten myself up about this fact in the last three months or so. I ended up asking online what ppl would think of a 13y/o going out with a 17/y/o - i turned 17 a month before. The responses, confirmed my belief that this wouldn't be a good idea, even if I didn't engage in any kind of sexual activity with her. she wanted me to screw her! she asked me ""what would you do to me?"" I could kind of see where this was going. ""What do you mean?"" i ASKED. ""Sexually"" she replied. I was like ""Nothing, because you're underage"". FFS. Had I given out the wrong impression? I can't remember everything I said, but I do ask myself if i did give the idea that when we originally spoke i wanted to go out with her or something. Either way, I felt bad after first saying this, but still - did i know her age or not? She clearly acted very old for her age. She tried to convince me we could have some kind of sexual relationship, but I said no. And that was the end of it =- but all thes emonths later, I worry myself sick with this.

**My first (and only) girlfriend**

The sad thing about that girl, is that I for a moment did consider about going out with her. Why? I was lonely. So, fucking lonely and pathetic. I didn't want sex from her or whatever. I even thought just about saying we were going out for lockdown, giving me time to think about it so i didn't have to see her, just to say I HAD a girlfriend. But, I'm glad I didn't just go for the first thing to come to me, esepcially not her.

I began to post more on instagram in lockdown, and I re-made contact with a girl i knew from primary (elementary school). she was a couple of years younger than me (15) and began commenting on my pictures. She offered to meet me - we did so as friends. Her name was Katie. I really liked her. She was attractive, and I loved her personality. She was kind and everything. One day when we were talking online, she dropped in ""I really need a bf"" midway through a converation, casually. I offered to be hers- and she accepted. The euphoria I felt! I had a girlfriend. All these years. Finally, I had struck lucky.

I remember our first date. A day or so before, trying my luck, I went to an off license and bought a bottle of vodka. I blagged my way through it,. I had been told they sold to under 18s. It wasn't even proper vodka, smirnoff ice or something. i took it with me on our first actual date. I remember sitting by the side of a dual carriageway with her, my hands around her as we drunk vodka straight from the bottle! Fuck me, we must have looked rough. But she really wasn't.

We walked and talked across town, ending up at another off license, where I bought more booze. Don't even know what it was, but it was good. We ended up snogging in the middle of a park! I was chuffed. Finally, finally. Life was being good to me. Things only got better. We met again, and again. At my house, we went for a picnic at the park, we went on ad ay out to London. This may sound sad, but this was probably one of the best times of my life, and the best thing of this entire cursed year.

But.

It had to end.

And it only had to end too fucking soon.

About a month and half or whatever, she sends an ominous text about wanting to speak. she says she wants to postpone our next meeting to take a break. I'm shitting myself - is it a break up - but she says no. And so I let it be. She goes on holiday. No, this isn't the bit where she meets another boy. It's the bit where I seemingly f\*ck things up again. I'd noticed shed always sounded a bit prejudiced when talking about Muslims and other groups. More scared of them than anything. I just casually asked her about it, what she was afraid of. She flipped. She began spouting out general right-wing, racist/islamaphobic rubbish about muslims and black people. She saiud i was weird for asking her about this. I noticed she then didn't respond ot my messages properly, like one word answers. i asked whats wrong. she wasked to break up. i was upset. i was devastated. I hated myself. Why did it have to end? I asked. Everytime I get something good in my life, it dissapears!

**The Depression begins**

Somehow, we managed to remain on rather amicable terms, staying friends and keeping in touch. I'm not lying when I say she texted me every day. I still had feelings for her. But they weren't replicated.

We arranged to meet. For the first time since we split up - as friends. We chose the gym, as we both shared an interest in boxing. I liked boxing. Why? I realised I was half decent at it - I had so much agression inside of me, I had to channel it into something. I had turned to the bottle. Spurred on by muy success in aquriing vodka in an off license, I had also managed to get served in lots of pubs. I wasn't drinking that often. But it became an outlet for me. Alone, of course. I remember one afternoon, I came back from school. I was so angry - at my self! I had no one to blame. I just went out. I said I was going to the gym. That was a half truth. I spent the first half an hour going through town, trying to get served, throwing money down the drain as they wouldn't. I went to the gym in the end.

When I saw Katie that day, I realised how much I missed her. What I was missing. It was almost torture to cotninue to be friends with her, but she convinced me she had MH problems of her own, and that iw as her only friend. so i stayed. But that day, I went to the pub straight afterwards - double whiskey. Scotch. It was good.

But even our friendship had to end.

I was talking to her for a while before, and she was getting quite agitated at times. She said stuff like ""appreciate me - i'm all you've got"", taking advantage of the fact that it was true - she *was* my only friend. Then hse accused me of arguing with her when she said she thought I had autism, and I challen ged this. She finally flipped one day when we were etxting, casually, she said she had to stay behind at school for revision. ""that's rough"" or something lik ethat i replied. All of a sudden, she swears at me, her friends send voiec messages saying im weird, that she doesn't like me, and she blocks me. I'd had enough. It was my fault, AGAIN! I ran downstairs, looking for the first alcoholic drink I could find - cider, took it with me, and stormed out into the fields, sobbing my fucking heart out. Not just about Katie. But everything. I was a freak. I was always to blame. I couldn't do anything right! That day had torrential, and I mean torrential rain. I went outside, getting myself soaked whilst drinking. I don't know what I intended to do - run away perhaps? Kill myself? Fuck knows. But it didnt last long because my mum saw me and took me back home

**Suicidal Thoughts**

I began to feel extremely suicidal. I contemplated death - how would I die? I planned on suicide by cop. It's very easy to get shot by the police. This is not juts an american phenonemon. You can easily call the police, claim to have a gun or a bomb, ro say you've seen someone, wallk up towards the police, and they will shoot you. It makes you feel you have control in your death too. If you get cold feet, you can surrender. However, I was aware that I'd be putting the officer through the psycological trauma of potentially killing an innocent person. an innocent, suicidal person at that. i'd rather kill myself wiothout having to involve anyone. jumping in front of a train? A train driver will be left scarred for life, and potentially passengers. Overdosing seemed too 50/50. Eventually, my parents and school found out, and I had to get emergency phsyicatric help. They diagnosed me with clinical depression, and I saw a private consultant who diagnosed me with the same. I began my first dose of antidepressants - 20mg of flureoxeotine. It sent me up the walls. I was now off school. Before that, I already wasn't eating. I just stayed in bed. I couldn't do anything. I would now have prolonged outbursts. I'd self harmed 3 times. A fourth on the higher dose. But where before I was sleeping loads, now i kept waking up. My dreams - so vivid! I'd have struggle to pass water. Very low sex drive. Suicidal thoughts. The medication was not working.

I was getting so obsessed and upset about this girl, the one who was in year 8. What if i did know her age and still said i liked her? I must be a peadophile? I deserve to die, im a terrible person? Did i say this? wait, did I say thjat? i was dreaming, thiking id said stuff which i had to wake up and ask myself - of course i didnt! I cried so much. About my grandad. Having no friends. Hating myself. The problem is me!

The closest I came to do anything suicidal was out on a walk.

The day in question - a saturday. The first day of my new job. My first job, at a supermarket. a few months prior, i would have jumped at the chance, but now i was not os sure. I've been crying lately by the easiest things. an emotional piece of music, a thought here, nature here. it makes me well up and cry. I burst out crying in broad daylight that morning.

I went past these vicious, barking dogs at a farm - usually I would have shat myself and ran. But I didn't! I just stood there, and faced htem off. Nothing could scare me - if they attacked me, it wouldb e painful, but i could die at least! I crossed a bridge across the motorway. We had passed under it in a car so many times. I had seen on another bridge earlier that tyou could get tyour feet onto a surface ont he ohter sidef. I went to the side, not on the road, but just bnefore it went over the road. I climbed over, and edged towards the carriageway. I turned back. It was so spontaneous. Like the self harm. I hate the way I look. I'm skinny, i must be ugly, ive only had one gf and it didn't even last two months! Girls comment on my pictures for jokes. I went home and cried. I cried basically every day after that.

**The present?**

A week on from the bridge incident, I still feel so depressed. I've started back at school - an achievement, but its making me feel worse. A few people were pleaesd to see me back. It touched me in a way. I'm sure im not alone when i say suicidal people have contemplated who would be at their funerals. I'm sick of living this life. Seeing other people livign their life, going to parties, having sex, having friends and things to do. I'm juts a pathetic, sad excuse of a person. Who in their right mind is attracted to a 12/13 year old at my age? Who would make fake girlfriends because they're alone? Apparently I'm basically at the threshold for ASD. I'm getting a diagnosis, a proper one in the new year, which both reassuresm e, but also makes me feel i might just have to give up on a socail life. im fed up of living my life alone. no - im not living. im existing. I sometimes go to sleep, and hope i dont wake up. I feel like dying would take a burden off the shoulders around me. I'm disgusting. im a freak. im weird, im pathetic. But anyway, this is how someone gets to a position like this. Everyone has their own jounries and how they ended up with depression, and I encourage you to share yours if you feel comofrtable. Fuck me, its taken a long time. I'm surprised I haven't cried yet. im willing to answer or talk to anyone below. Advice, comments, criticism, whatever, feel free to put it below. I have no faith anymore, I've given up in believing in a God that would inflict such suffering on a person who has tried to be the best they can, and the suffering on the world that we have endured. If there is a God, he must be punishing me. I'm going to be 18, and to show for it? Nothing. my 18th will just be me alone. I've drunken a lot lately. Whiskey. I even had a cigarette when offered by a guy at my work. It was the only thing that could calm me down that first ,stressful shift when my thoughts about that girl, alana and everything else was goingf around my head at 100mph. Don't intend on making a habit of that though. I'm just fed up of living alone. People acted concerned when i was off (ive missed 5 weeks off skl and now worried as im supposed to be doing exams this year and then going to university) but acted like i didn't exist when I *was* at school. My life has had its good moments, but tragically, having written this, I've actually realised how much suffering I've endured over the last six years, though this probbaly styill pales in comparison to others, and if you're still going after losing multiple family members, having a life threaten*ng or changing* condition/illness, living in poverty etc, I salute you. You're a better person than I could ever be."
1311,I might go to jail for a DUI didn't commit. If I do they'll take me off all of my medications.,"

Last August I got cited for a DUI I did not commit. I may go to jail and they won't give me my Seroquel, my Suboxone, my propranolol and most importantly, my Klonopin. I've been on Klonopin for 7 or 8 years for seizures, it also helps with anxiety. I've tried a bunch of other anti-convulsants and none work as well as Klonopin. I take 2mg twice a day and don't get me wrong, I do wanna wean myself down to the lowest effective dose, maybe .5mg twice a day.

When I was in there for five days they gave me this BS ""wean down"" with Ativan. I got 2mg twice a day for like a day and a half, then 1mg for a day and a half, then .5mg for a day and a half then got bailed out. Imo that isn't a wean down that's essentially taking someone off cold turkey. They claim they're afraid of drug diversion. Why would I give my meds to someone else?? I want those. Hell I wouldn't even tell anybody if they did give them to me. They could crush the pill in a cup so it cant be cheeked, good luck trying to salvage a Suboxone strips once it's in your mouth. I feel like this is an infringement on my 8th amendment rights.

I'm afraid of going through withdrawal if I go cause they three me in medical, which is solitary confinement but the lights never turn off. I never knew what time it was and it was  hell. I'm honestly concerned of dying, I have just thought, ""if they don't give me my meds, I'm just not going to eat, fuck them, It'll just speed up the process of me dying. Fuck it"". If I did go to jail I wouldn't care too much if they gave me my damn meds and I don't get how jails get away with not giving you your medications. I also don't get why they just willy billy put me in solitary confinement just for having a seizure disorder. I know I'm gonna get suicidal in there. I'm depressed as hell over this whole thing and like I said. I've just thought. I mean it's gonna be bad... Be so WD made worse by opioid withdrawal which is then going to be made worse by being taken off my Seroquel suddenly and then my heart is just going to be beating out of my chest more than it would with benzo WD without my propranolol.

I'm gonna be out in solitary no matter what I do. The WD is going to be mental and physical hell, and I just want it to end. Im lonely anyway, I have no friends. I have a job i hate. I'm a loser anyway, so who cares."
1312,A Little Reminder: PM’s Are Open,"Hey there, everyone! 

Just a mini reminder that my PM’s are open for general chats. Unfortunately, Christmas isn’t always a wonderful time of the year. For some, it’s agony. The holiday season can be difficult for many different reasons: 

- They are lonely 
- Nobody to spend time with 
- Nobody to love 
- Nobody to share and receive gifts from 
- Nobody to talk to 

Because of that, I am offering my free time to help out as many people as possible. If one day, you’re feeling down, upset or worried, give me a message and I’ll try and cheer you up as much as I can! We don’t have to talk about your feelings, emotions or your past, we can have a lovely conversation about the things you enjoy, your hobbies or what you like to watch/play on TV? Anything to get your mind off of the things that is bothering you. Before someone starts to question, I have been doing this for 3 years, I have helped people who are going through breakups, going through the stage of NC, depression, anxiety or simply having a downer day. Remember, you don’t have to message me, this is just an offer if you’re available and free. :) 

Thank you for reading, 

Speak soon, take care!"
1313,Pharmacy won’t give me prescription anymore?,"Hello! I’ve been taking Citalopram and Bupropion for a couple months now, but recently CVS told me my insurance company needs me to “mail something in” or else I can’t keep getting my meds? The number CVS gave for help isn’t helpful. Has anybody experienced this? I just don’t know how to proceed and don’t want my psych meds to lapse. 

Thank you!"
1314,Advice for dealing with general anger toward the state of the world?,"I try so hard not to care but listening to the ageism, racism, and just general divide amongst the citizens in this country is exhausting. I stay away from news sources if I can, but it doesn’t stop people from discussing things that end up upsetting me intermittently for weeks. Please help."
1315,Dealing with People Not Believing My Story / Calling Me Crazy?,"Hey everybody. I been having some issues lately in my life with trying to get over crazy stuff from my past. My problem is that nobody believes me once I start to tell them what’s going on, and they almost immediately tell me that I’m delusional, hallucinating, etc. I’ve posted more details on other subs looking for help there, but haven’t had any luck. So I won’t go into what my specific background is, because you’d probably all also tell me that I’m having paranoid delusions. I’ve had other mental health issues in my life, but delusions and hallucinations aren’t one of them. 
Anyhow, how do you guys deal with that? Does anybody else here have a ridiculous real problem that nobody believes them about? How do you cope with that?"
1316,I'm afraid that my new friends see my scars this summer,"I'm afraid that my new friends see my scars this summer,( I don't self-harm as a long time) moreover I would like found a summer job, but I'm afraid that nobody want to employ me. I don't know what I should to do, and I just think of isolated me and no see and no go out for all the summer, but this can get worse my depression, and I don't want it. What do you think that I will doing? Sorry for my English but I'm from Italy and I just learn English"
1317,Actively reach out to your depressed friends instead of just offering support,"If you know someone going through a hard time take the initiative to talk to them. Call them, text them, ask them questions to make sure they're okay. Don't say generic things like ""I'm here for you, let me know if you want to talk"". When you're in the depths of depression you feel so worthless it's impossible to reach out to someone even if they've previously offered to support you.  

Just something to think about with the holidays and covid."
1318,Suicidal thoughts last throughout 2019 and 2020.,"At the beginning of this year (2020) I considered a Self-Execution date to take my own life (commit suicide).  Due to stress and depression. 

I originally scheduled such an event at midnight between the 18th and 19th of December, place moments after midnight on December 19, 2020. Shortly After 12:00am. 145 Days after my 25th Birthday, In the 145-Year-Old Blue Ghost Tunnel.

This Particular Tunnel, is an abandoned railway tunnel built-in 1875, running underneath the former third Welland Canal between locks 18 and 19. 

I keep having intrusive and obsessive thoughts of a lot of beautiful women that I had the fortune, or rather misfortune to go to school with (whether it was elementary/high/college or all three levels), I keep thinking of them talking complete shit about me these past few years. Not necessarily to me, but about me. Both online and in person. 

Because I have had serious problems masturbating, which highly likely to be the result of being home alone far too often. 

Over years, many of the girls I grew up with shared popular memes on social media, frequently, mocking, ridiculing, and humiliating people who are just like me, if they do it to them, they may do it to me, not even caring that I am on the spectrum (Autism), or tease me for being a homosexual, when in fact that is not true, I can find either gender sexually attractive but far greater commonly age-appropriate women 18+, meaning I am 95% straight but I would say, I'm like maybe 5% gay. 

But not even knowing how to talk to someone about this hurt like absolute hell, not right away, but after weeks, or even months, it hurt most when I was staring up at the ceiling at 3 AM many times over the past year, and even the year before as well. Covid made things much worse for depression, but I feel that is a universal dilemma inevitable to everyone. 

There's been a great deal of extremely devastating consequences, and as I have no job, and no source of income, nor have any way of forming a long-term relationship such. 

I'm too depressed to do anything.  

This past not one but two years now, both 2019 as well as 2020. All I do is Smoke Cannabis, drink Alcohol, and Masturbate chronically.  

I struggle to get out of bed, I struggle to shower, I struggle to shit. I struggled to even simply take care of myself and my personal hygiene. 

Also, I am having extremely intrusive and distressing thoughts of one day eventually end up committing an unforgivable crime, whether it be drunk driving, manslaughter, murder, uttering a threat, theft, burglary, drug possession, or literally anything unlawful that would seriously hurt my dignity and well-being. 

I thought to myself these past two years, A good person can become a total piece of s\*\*\* in no time at all, and that once they're a piece of s\*\*\*, they're always a piece of s\*\*\*. 

I don't wanna be a piece of s\*\*\*, I wanna be a kind, sweet, and gentle person. much like a dog. 

Put even dogs can be put down, I don't wanna be mean, I wanna be nice, I wanna be a good person.

I don't want to be shot with a gun and a bullet, I want to be shot with a tit and milk.    

I want to feel loved by someone. 

But it's just that I'm always feeling unwell, with a bad-apple mindset thinking that I am stupid when I shouldn't have to, I'm a drug addict, and I have an embarrassing masturbation problem I struggle to control, and fear for my future.  

When you absolutely love someone who absolutely hates you, it's like a nuclear bomb in the mind.

It be like, me having an open wound, and she just poured an entire lid-less shaker of salt on it."
1319,My(35) older brother(39) has been battling his mental health since his teenage years and I’m not sure if I can or want to help. Any advice?,"I started my family in my early 20s and left the house. Recently he was hospitalized due to a schizophrenic episode and my mom is gettin too old to deal with him. 

He kinda scares me because about 7 years ago I let him stay with me in my garage. I came home one day and the police knocked to tell me my brother called them because he was having thoughts about hurting me and family. I never told my wife or mom about this because I decided then that he’d never stay with me again. This is so difficult and I feel helpless, I just wish I had my brother back like when we were teenagers."
1320,Finding a reason to live on a dying planet,"I have something called enviornmental anxiety. The News about the climate, how each new month is record warm, that the emitions are increasing, that animals are dying on massive scales and that the oceans are getting choked to death, its all to much for me. I feel like there is no hope and i dont want to live in a world that i am slowly seeing getting killed. The worst thing about it is that i feel like no one understands me. People dont understand how much its making me want to die. I dont want to see the world become inhospitable to humans, and i dont want my children to live in a world like this. Im young and i shouldnt have to worry about something that is so out of my control. All i can do is sit back and watch because nothing i can do could ever change anything. I have tried to talk about this with my parents and friends etc, but no one understands me. I dont know what to do! Right now, everything i feel is that i wont die a natural death, but that om going to kill myself because i dont want to keep going when i know there is no hope.."
1321,Why would someone claim they are being bullied when they aren’t and it’s made up?,"

My on and off friend for the past 6 years. She told me a few days ago that she was being bullied on Instagram by a group of girls. She showed me the disgusting DM’s they sent her. They were degrading, threatening and just being down right cruel to her. There was multiple accounts repeatedly attacking  her. They were also sending pictures of themselves to her trying to one up her claiming they were better than her. This was next level mean girls type bullying. This started on Thursday. 

So I got involved Thursday night because I don’t like it when people bully period but I don’t like my friends being targeted either. A few other friends joined too. We posted it on Twitter to expose the bullies with their nasty DM’s and IG accounts and got 11.2k retweets. My friend even posted a video of her crying about the bullying. We were spreading awareness while trying to get back at the bullies 

The bullies claimed that they never bullied her and don’t know who she is. They claimed it was entirely made up, the DM’s and everything was fake. Of course we thought they were trying to cover their tracks. Then she started getting even more hate and DM’s saying “we are going to make it as if you are behind this and bullying us and nobody will believe you” and “keep crying you look so weak”. 

I slept over at her house last night and found out the whole thing was indeed made up by my friend today when she showed me DM of one of the “bullies” attacking her but the POV was from the bullies account to her account. Her account was the recipient. I called her out on it and deleted my tweet. 

I said “There is something seriously wrong with you, why would you make up something like that, you made everyone attack random girls who didn’t even do anything, you made up a bunch of fake DM’s to yourself, you are disgusting. You wonder why you have no friends other than me well gee maybe it’s because you pull attention seeking stunts like this, nobody did anything to you to deserve this” and then I said “I’m also not your friend anymore, you need to go seek mental help, this is not normal and I’m going to let everyone know on Twitter, it was you behind this, you should be ashamed of yourself, I don’t even want to know you anymore, this isn’t cute or funny. You need to grow up”. 
 She said “well I don’t like those girls one of them blocked me for no reason” 
I said “You did all this over someone blocking you, you really have too much time on your hands and honestly this is just ridiculous, we are 20 years old, when are ever going to get out of your middle school mentality, maybe if you grew up you might be able to maintain friendships with people but honestly you are such a toxic person that I don’t want to continue this friendship, it’s been a rocky road for a while with you and I’ve had it” and I left and I blocked her number. 

I’m still debating if I should call her out on Twitter or just leave it alone. I don’t know wtf she was thinking. I don’t even know why someone would do something like this. I’m just honestly frustrated and feel like an idiot for going along with it. I honestly thought she was getting bullied."
1322,Why do I cry so easily??,"I’m a 16 yo girl and recently I just got out of a relationship with a boy which is now my best friend. I was hertbroken for months but I got over and still I cry at the smallest bad thing he does. Like today I cried for hours because he said he wanted to play games today and not see me .Another  day I cried because we were with another girl out and he only asked her where to go , and whenever he wants to go smoking he asks only her if she wanted to join him and I am a smoker too. One time all three were out and he wanted to smoke and said to her ,,Are you letting me smoke alone?” Even tho I was right near him too .And I cry for these little things . And no, he doesn’t has a crush on her or something because he’s gay, that’s the reason why we broke up. So why do I cry for hours when he does little things like these? And to be understand I am not an emotional person at all, like I have no empathy  for anything. I’m the most heartless person I’ve ever met and before him nothing made me cry ."
1323,I want some PEACE.How do I shut down my brain?,"I have been dealing with this for a while and it's absolutely frustrating. I have no idea what to do or how to deal with it. I feel exhausted and never well rested or refreshed even when all I did was stay in bed all day. Although I do what needs to be done everyday, it's hard for me to focus because my brain just jumps from one thing to the other. I also have trouble sleeping. People suggested to try meditating but I couldn't do that either because something still sneaks in somehow. 

It's like a constant background noise that doesn't stop. And they are mostly random thoughts from problems of the world to the smallest of issues.I can control it enough to function and some days are better than others but my brain just refuses to 'chill' for the lack of a better word. How do I turn it off so I can have some peace?"
1324,What’s wrong with me??,"I’m 14(m) and I don’t know what’s wrong with my brain and why it hates me because I have a problem where I’ve done 2 embarrassing gross unethical things in my life and my brain punished me for it every day and I don’t know why... the thing is if I told people these things it would ruin my relationships with them and I don’t want to do that. When I try to forgive my self for some reason my brain says that I shouldn’t and what I did was bad and I shouldn’t be forgiven and so the cycle continues the thing is aswell I did these one of these things multiple years ago and it still bothers me deeply. Does this have a name? What should I do? Or is it just nothing and I’m just worrying and that’s what everyone does?

Thanks"
1325,I was sexually harrassed today,"On the street, as I bended over to grab my phone, someone walked by and intentionally put his thing in my butt.
The feeling of something hard being pressed on my butt is haunting me. It is haunting me a lot....
Help me..."
1326,Is it wrong if I feel this way?,"about a few days ago, i almost did something where there’s no turning back. One my bffs knew that I wasn’t doing okay and needed someplace to stay to ease my mind. He agreed to help me and allowed mo to stay on his place but kept cancelling on days that we agreed. He then offered to visit me here in my place to provide some comfort. On the day that he was supposed to come but he didn’t. On that same day, something happened in my household and almost did the stupid “thing” 

Also, one of my bffs (we are a group of three) stopped talking to me because I forgot to post an IG story for her birthday. 

I felt that those people we put in our “support” system couldn’t really live up to their promise that they will be there when u needed them. I stopped talking to both of them and deactivated all of my soc meds account except for this one. I don’t know if it’s right to push them away just bc they failed to support me on the days that I really needed them."
1327,"Told my mum I'm suicidal, kinda regretting it/Mentions of self harm and Suicidal thoughts","She took it better than my dad whose only response was ""my mental health is shit too"" and uses me as a therapist, but that's not important rn.
 
Everything has been shitty since August last year, I'm not going into reasons because I don't wanna share too much, but it's taken great strain on everyone, and not to sound narcissistic, but especially me because I feel like I should be stern and not say anything to be strong for my younger brothers, even though all I get is shit from them.

I've been crying for help for a while but no one takes it seriously and I finally snapped.
I told my mum about my self harm urges/suicidal urges and I felt relieved yet guilty.
It's not fair I've projected it all onto her, she's been through too much.

I don't deserve anything, even though getting my emotions out is a good thing, all so I'm told, I don't feel great about it.

I'm feeling like a attention whore."

Mostly im fine but some days, ecpecially at night i make my self feel so bad and i crave that feeling. 

Is it a valid reson to talk with someone, maybe i could solve it on my own? i really dont know..."
1329,Guys I finally swallowed a capsule first try!,"Okay I know this is such a pathetic win but I wasted about 6 anti depressants because I couldn’t swallow them but today I didn’t waste one and swallowed it I can’t use water it just touches my throat and makes me gag so what I do is I let it get a little squishy but not about to fall apart then put a few biscuit piece in my mouth start chewing them then mid way put the capsule in my mouth and swallow and my body just swallowed!

Before I couldn’t do it I’d just keep gaging and almost threw up because of the anxiety but now I can do it easily!! I hope my way helps other who have trouble just don’t chew the capsule probably doesn’t taste nice"

1331,I’m unhappy with my current situation,"I graduated in 2020 and I’m currently looking for full time work. I’ve been doing an internship but the contract is about to end. 

I hate living at home. For the past few months I’ve been either fighting with my dad or mom. I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now. Not having a stable job or job I like doesn’t help. Not being able to see friends doesn’t help (my parents are controlling and won’t let me go out every weekend). Covid restrictions also means there’s less to do, esp in the winter. I’ve also hated the city I live in for some time now. I’m tired of the snow and just tired of it overall. I feel like I need a fresh start. 

I had such a bad fight with my mom yesterday that my body had an immediate negative reaction to it. I thought I was going to pass out from the cramps I got in my uterus. My period just came today on time but I’m sure it was the anger that set off the cramps. I’ve never felt pain so severe and came so quickly before. I also broke out in a cold sweat, had heavy breathing, and my heart was pounding. After this fight I decided I need to move out at the minimum. 

Right now I’m looking at jobs in the city and outside of the city. The reason I’m looking in my city is because I know more people here and it’s more likely I can get a referral from someone. I’m also taking rent and cost of living into consideration. I don’t think I’d be making much (I’m assuming anywhere from $45-$60k) since I’m a new grad, and places like Vancouver would be expensive to live in. 

It’s kind of making me feel hopeless. I feel lost. I know the first step is to find a full time job, but when I think about cost of living it kind of deters me from going somewhere I’ve always wanted to go. Also I realize that no place is perfect. Even though the temperatures in Vancouver are nice, it rains so much. 

I don’t even know if it’s just a problem with me and I’m unable to be happy no matter where I go. Or if I’m blaming everything on my parents. I just know I need to get out of their house. But I’m struggling with my mental health and unable to be happy living at home. I need to be alone and find and peace. But also I don’t know if I could afford living in Vancouver alone. I’m not sure I can handle living with people right now.

I’m looking for advice or stories of your own. Thank you."
1332,"I want help, but do not at the same time.","The title of this sounds indecisive, which pretty much sums up what I'm feeling towards the idea of reaching out for help.

I'm a 16 year old and I've been experiencing these indescribable feelings of sadness and emptiness for quite a few years, say about 4 or 5. It started out not so intense, but for the past 3 years it's been fucking me up a bit too much, especially this year.

For the longest time I just pushed on, because surely it's something minor and if I go through with it it'll disappear after a bit. But it kept lingering.

I stopped talking about what troubles me for quite a while, but in the rare times that I do, I'm always met with the usual ""You should try getting therapy.""

Now here's my problem;

Part of me agrees with this suggestion. I haven't been functioning well with this feeling always in my chest, therefore my past self who was a hard worker and did her best is visibly deteriorating right in front of my eyes.

My performance in school is going downhill and it pains me to see myself go down this kind of path. I also haven't felt any positive emotions for so long - well, genuinely. I do smile and laugh but it's never really the joy I used to experience in my early days. I want to feel happy again, I envy those who effortlessly feel this way, and I expect therapy might be able to help with this aspect.

I also want to put a label on my feelings, instead of not be able to describe them to people and giving up. It would be nice to feel like killing myself less, too.

All this stuff screams, ""I do want help."" But then again, I do not want it. Rather, I cannot get any help.

No, I don't have an unsupportive family that stops me from reaching out. The only thing stopping me is.. myself. My own thought process that I find hard to let go of.

I feel as though I don't deserve this kind of help; I'm such a horrible person and this is kind of like a debt I have to pay for even existing. Another reason is that I haven't really gone through anything extreme to be reaching out for help, my life has been perfectly normal from its start up until now so it leads me to believe I'm the problem or cause of this situation.

And deep down, I've acknowledged that I have this fear of going to therapy. What if I'm just overdramatic? What if I spill too much? What if I'm diagnosed with something and it holds me back from many things? What if my friends and family change their attitudes towards me because of this? What if the people dear

I apologize if this post is a mess, but it's exactly what I am right now. A complete mess of clashing thoughts.

I don't know what my purpose is writing this, but feel free to share your opinions or experiences here. If you have any advice, that is welcome too, it may help people other than myself."
1333,"Over the past six months, I began to regret a lot","Hi everyone,

A few years ago I couldn't even think that I would start thinking about finding a psychologist and about my mental health, but this time has come and it seems to me that I really need help.

A month ago I turned 19 years old and I began to regret my past very much. I have been passionate about programming since I was 12, but my first game I created was at the age of 15, and I took programming courses only last year, i.e. at 18.
Before I was 15, I was self-studying myself, but now that I'm 19, I began to realize that I could do a lot more if I was between 12 and 15 years old.

Now I am studying at a Swiss grammar school, in class with a focus on physics and mathematics, and I see that some of my classmates can participate in different mathematical competitions and even take some prizes. I can't do it, because I simply don't even fit in age. I don't know what to call it. Maybe, I am just envy? But compared to them, I feel stupid.

I also regret that at the age of 5 my parents did not give me to the chess club, although I was very interested in it. Now I understand that it's too late to do it, simply because I don't have time.

Also, my native language is not German and I began to regret that I did not start learning it earlier.

I understand that I could have achieved more if not for the sequence of events. But when I realize it, I start to wonder: ""What do I even want to achieve? I understand that I have no goals in my life.

And yes, I also often feel shame. Shame for what I say and for expressing my thoughts and emotions. Even now, when I write this, I am ashamed, because maybe I only exaggerate and turn to the wrong place at all."

1335,I'm sick of my current situation and I wonder if it's because I'm just depressed or lazy,"So I have a part time job as a freelance writer and it was OK in the beginning but it's beginning to drain me and it's been a month. That is freaking embarrassing. 

I do what I'm told and I write my assignments but I can feel that I dread when I have to write more and I look forward to when I'm done with everything so I don't have to write anymore. 

With that said however, I'm also going through the slog of sending at least two applications for full time jobs per week and dealing with mental issues. 

I think with that, added with my overall uncertainty about my ability and just a general lack of things to work towards, I feel like I have failed myself. 

It's so hard for others to get a job and here I am in my first position, getting depressed from the whole thing."
1336,OCD is like I never wake up from my nightmare,"It's so terrible and I am sick of being doubtful, paranoid, and hard on myself. I know I am a good person. Ever since I was young, I had this masterplan of ways I wanted to contribute to society. But this chemical imbalance in my brain is ruining my childhood. I can't take it anymore. I want this disorder to go away. Today, I had to do a presentation, and I got so scared that I would say something bad, that I had a full-on panic attack and had to run to the bathroom before even a word could come out of my mouth. I can't talk to anyone about my issues. Why in the world is mental health not talked about? Why don't schools talk about mental health in more depth? Why in the world is mental health a crime in today's society? Yes, I would love for my OCD to go away. Don't you think that if I could, I would want to be positive? Why do people look down on it like it's a decision that we make to constantly suffer? 

This felt really good to just type haha"
1337,I think that I have hit rock-bottom,"Hi all.

I am posting here today as I am concerned about my mental health and general wellbeing, and I wondered if anybody would have some advice for me please?

Recently, a series of different events have happened in my personal life, which I feel have really disrupted me as an individual; normally, I feel like I am very stable and on top of everything, but the things that have happened to me recently, have made me feel I am losing it all, and some of the major things that I have been emotionally repressed in recent years have all come to light.

Most of the time I feel that my emotions are very volatile, and I have been crying a lot more than is healthy - I have also had trouble eating, starting to feel sick when I do so, and have lost some weight as a result, in addition to shaking, and lacking concentration and motivation. I really do feel that I am in the darkest place that I have ever been in my life, but I have sworn to myself that I will never try or attempt to do anything 'stupid'.

One thing that concerns me a lot about this is that I am currently completing my mock exams for the final year before college/university, which could have a big impact on my destinations in the future. I am trying the hardest to do what I can, but it really isn't my best, and I find that is just getting me down even more.

Does anybody have any advice that they may offer me please, whether it be for myself or things at school? I am really sorry for sharing this at this time, as I know that this time of year can be difficult for many."

1339,Is this relevant? (Question about mental health).,"Hello, 

I am college senior. I don’t really know how to say this but I’ll write it anyways.

So senior year of high-school, I had an incident that I don’t really know how to describe. The past two weeks, I had been super talkative, full of energy, didn’t really need to sleep, and had a hard time staying on task. However one day, I decided I didn’t need to eat breakfast because I wasn’t hungry. My mom said I had to eat something so I said I would eat hotdogs for breakfast. Which I did. I went to school I was very jumpy, a few of my teachers said they had never known me to talk so much before. I didn’t really eat lunch, just some candy. I worked, or attempted to work on my art assignments, it was mostly me pulling out supplies and scribbling on paper. Then the last class period of the day came. I was still full of energy then I just fell asleep. I don’t know how long I was asleep but one my classmates woke me up. I then started laughing uncontrollably, falling out of my chair, walking around the room. Nothing seemed real and I felt as if I wasn’t in control of myself. I felt as if I was outside of my body. I kept thinking, someone help me. My teacher thought I was joking at first then she looked scared and confused. Some of my classmates were laughing at me. I didn’t know what to do. I don’t remember what happened next. I only remember this many years later because I was scared. 

That happened three years ago. I haven’t had an incident as bad as that happen again. I have had many times that I felt outside of myself and that I wasn’t in control of myself. I’ll have weeks in which I am extremely energetic, don’t need to eat or sleep(can stay up to 3-4 in the morning and carry on the next day perfectly fine), and I am extremely talkative. I also have issues with impulsive spending and reckless driving. Then other weeks I am fatigued, can’t get out of bed, can’t do my work, over eat, and have suicidal thoughts. 

I don’t know what I should make of this. My aunt has bipolar disorder and I had another relative who had depression. Should I put any thought into this?"
1340,Why does my mind create sexual scenarios involving my family,"I saw a video of a girl explaining her emotions and thoughts, she mentioned that she has sexual scenarios involving her family. I didn’t know that anyone had these too. This may be uncomfortable for others but I usually have these thoughts from time to time. I am always having intrusive thoughts but these ones make me contradict myself and my thoughts. It usually involves my dad, which make me very uncomfortable since I love him dearly and am super close to him. I don’t know what I feel all the time, so this just added onto the ‘confusion’."
1341,Living with family during these times can be challenging...,"So I live at home with my family and a family member of mine gets these random bursts of aggression. Like, he will joke around with you one moment and likes to spend time with you and then he gets angry at minor things that he doesn't like. As if he cannot control his anger, he then begins to get really into it and yells at whoever he thinks is responsible and says really nasty things. Way out of proportion. Someone does a thing not exactly the way he wants it? He gets angry. This happens in phases, so maybe a month of good mood and then he has some stress in an area of his life and seems to transfer that unto us. 

My family and I have already confronted him about it and he promised to change (apparently he wasn't aware of how bad it was?). The thing is, of course, he does it all over again. After these bursts, he often ignores the hurt or tension in my family or pretends/thinks there is nothing wrong, so much so that he returns minutes later and talks to us in a normal voice. When confronted he will often deny or reduce his actions to make them sound harmless. I'm not sure if he really thinks his behavior is not that bad or if he actively disguises its damaging effect. 

I'm already in a stressful situation and all of that just adds to it. Does anyone have advice on how I can reduce the impact he has on me? Obviously I cannot move out at the moment and cannot avoid him completely, but I wish I could become more immune to the attacks, worry less about his words and just become ""uninteresting"" in that I won't give a reaction to his action. Don't know why he is that way, he wasn't like that (and to this extend) a few years ago. And he is not bad through and through, as I said he is normal most of the time."
1342,"Please, don't post your random thoughts on why people commit suicide.","Last night I came on this subreddit and was very hurt and upset by a post here. It was a blanket statement, a reckless opinion on why people commit suicide. Posting your individual experience is one thing, but posting a random thought that just pops into your head about such a painful subject is extremely disrespectful to those who have lost someone to suicide and / or struggling with suicidal thoughts. Please, don't do this.  


I lost my father to suicide almost four years ago.  He was one of the kindest people I have ever known, he was a joyful person who always looked on the bright side. I loved being his daughter more than anything else in the world. He was also had severe bipolar disorder.  


When I was seven he had a very extreme psychotic break. We tried so hard to get him help. He became violet and did many things he was ashamed of and could never talk about or get over. Once he crashed into the depression phase we were finally able to get him help. He fought so hard to rebuild his life, he decided to become a teacher and he was wonderful at it.  


Fast forward over a decade later and it was decided, for reasons I won't get into, to switch his medications, he was switched to Abilify. It was okay at first, until the crash. I watched him suffer in mental agony for months. He couldn't eat, and lost 70lbs in about 2 - 3 months, he couldn't drink and I watched the skin on his face begin to peel off. I tried but could not offer him any comfort, he was just beyond that. He was convinced he was a burden to me and I could never convince him otherwise.  


I found him after he put a shot gun in. his mouth. I don't think I will truly ever heal. It hurts me every single day. Some times when I cannot sleep, when I cannot stop remembering, I come to these kind of subreddits to feel I am not alone. Reading a post last night where someone had the audacity to say people commit suicide because they want to be remembered, was extremely painful to read. My father didn't want to be remembered he wanted to be forgotten. I don't have suicidal thoughts because I want to be remembered, I have them because I am desperate to forget.  


I would like to say again, someone posting an experience is one thing. That is someone's individual experience and everyone's experience is different, no one's experience should be judged and everyone coming here should feel welcome to do so. Offering a casual rumination that they thought over coffee and decided to share on a mental health forum for people needing support is just damaging and harmful to people who are seriously struggling."
1343,what should I do?,"Im 17, still in school. I have a learning disability (diagnosed), it makes it almost impossible for me to focus. In my country it's possible to not pass and repeat a grade. I feel like the dumbest person on earth because it's likely going to happen to me this year. I lack basic math knowledge, to the point that it makes it hard to understand anything. My math skills are equal to a maybe 11 year old. I feel like a complete failure because of this and it really gets on my self esteem. Every time I sit and try to learn I can't focus, I can't understand anything, it takes me 2 times longer than an average person, I have no motivation. I get bad grades which makes me extremely depressed to the point im almost suicidal, I self harm, barely eat and I just want it all to end. I can't go to a therapist or someone of that sort, my parents won't let me go and im afraid of judgment. I just want to be smart, worth of living and taking up all that space, i can't find any reason why should i keep living because I probably won't achieve anything and I dont see a bright future for me, only suffering and a minimal wage job. 

I hope everything is understandable because my english is bad as well."

1345,I haven't seen myself in a while...,"A bit of background first, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and maybe I have other things, I'm not sure. I've hated myself for a long time to the point that I don't remember much before I started hating.   


Anyway, I haven't looked in a mirror or taken a picture of myself in a while. It's not really a ""body image"" thing as much as it's a ""self image"" thing. I'm fine with my body, but god damn do I hate myself.   


I don't need to know why I do this because I already know it's from self hate, so my question is this: What is this thing called? I tried looking it up, but I always find ""body dysmorphic disorder"" and while some of it fits my description, but a lot of it doesn't add up either.  


Anyway, it's 4:00AM and I haven't slept in a while so I'll be going now. I'd be grateful to anyone who replies."
1346,Can someone help me understand my boyfriend’s depression?,"Let me start this off by saying that anything I bring up is not meant to discount his mental illness. I’m just at the point where I’m skeptical about some of his intentions/actions.

My boyfriend (ex now) blindsided me with a breakup a month ago. We were together for 3.5 years. He often hid his depression and was very charismatic/outgoing. A few weeks leading up to the breakup, he started partying more and ignoring my calls. The weekend of the breakup he was uncharacteristically rude to me. He was unsympathetic my grandpa had just passed the day before. He compared me to his new female friends that were more “fun” because they drink more than me. He took me on dates all weekend, only to blindside me at the end of the weekend.

Haven’t heard from him in a month, now he’s begging for me back. He said he can’t even remember most of the breakup weekend and said the depression basically took over his brain and made him break up with me (like it took control and caused him to say those rude things to me)

I’ve forgiven past fights that he said was the depression not him (screaming in my face, punching walls). He bottles up his emotions until he explodes. He has a lot of family problems and I feel a lot of empathy for him because he hasn’t had an easy life. It’s just hard on me because I’m so reserved and even-tempered.

My question is does depression really take over a person’s brain to the point where they don’t know what they are doing? I’ve believed him in the past, but being blindsided really hurt me and I don’t know what to think anymore."
1347,"So, I have a few bad feelings about my therapist"," 

**Hello,**

first time poster here.

I’ve been struggling with my mental health for about 5 years now, I’m 24.

It’s been so bad that I moved in with my parents again, because I couldn’t muster up the motivation to even take care of myself. 

After being hospitalized really long for depression, I searched for a therapist. At the hospital they recommended analytical therapy, because in my country it  simply is the therapy form that has the most frequent sessions, in my  case three times a week. 

So I searched for about three months and was so relieved that finally I’ve found someone.

We’ve been at it for about six months now.

I  can say that I do more now in comparison. Doing volunteer work two  times a week since a month, tutoring one time a week, helping out at my  fathers work, helping around the house as good as I can, met a few online friends.

I should feel better now, right?

I don’t really have the feeling that it’s much better than before I fell into the hole.

Over the course of the therapy I’ve got the feeling that my therapist tries to shove me in a form, directly telling me what to do. From time to time  she makes comments that make it harder and harder for me to tell her certain things, for example that my tiredness is not tiredness but me  avoiding life at all costs and that I live the life of a disabled  person. And I can't muster the backbone or strenght tell her that this hurts.

I feel constantly judged by her. And I feel like I‘m whining around for even writing this post. Sorry if I really am. I always try assume she means well. Maybe it‘s just my subconscious resistance.

But  it’s gotten to the point that all my peers tell me to get away from  her, because I feel bad after therapy a good chunk of the times.

I  really wanna get better, even if I‘m scared about what comes after  that, and I don’t know if keeping up the therapy with \*her\* really makes  sense.

I  just think: „Maybe she‘s right. And if you switch therapists, who know  if it‘ll get better? And isn’t that the avoidance she was talking about  all along?“

I would love to hear your thoughts about it. "
1348,Boyfriend of 10 years feeling anxious and angry a lot,"Hey! New to Reddit but just thought I'd try and get an outsider's advice. My boyfriend and I have been together 10 years now and have a great relationship.

However, for years now he seems to let little things get to him and blow them way out of proportion. For example; if you were to leave the house to run errands and forgot to pick up your purse, you'd be pretty pissed right? But you'd get on with him and go back home to collect it. If this happened to him, he'd fly off the handle... I'm talking yelling, shouting, slamming stuff around. Naturally when this happens I tell him to stop being so ridiculous over something so trivial go which I get ""leave me alone, don't speak to me I don't want to be in the same room as you"". 

This obviously upsets me and then puts me in a bad mood. Give it 30 mins he gets upset, apologizes and says he hates himself for getting so angry over something so stupid but it's like a different person is controlling him and he cannot physically stop it. I'm by all means not concerned at all that this would ever escalate, I know he wouldn't harm me at all, 100%. However I'm sick of feeling like this and having to deal with ridiculous mood swings that I don't know how to handle.

Could someone please offer some helpful advice. Thank you."
1349,What should i text him? (Friendship fallout dt mental health),"Hey guys. Ive had a fallout with my friend whos having depression a few months ago. I was finding it unbearable to be friends with him cs it was so emotionally draining, stressful and i felt like i was carrying his burden with me. It was affecting my mood and happiness a lot. I reached peak when he was guilt tripping me for avoiding him. I am avoiding him but its because he was too needy.... i told him once before that it was overwhelming. Okay anyway after that i subtweeted him on my private acc. This, im guilty of. It wasnt something very mean, it something along the line of “dont ever try to make me feel guilty for not reaponding”. He flipped me off when he saw it. He did send an apology text few days later. And a few more texts the week after, all i didnt respond to. I am aware he is in a bad position but it was getting too much. I did that cs i wanted to set boundaries and because at that point i was too lazy to entertain him. I know i am a bad friend.

Ok anyway, i wanna apologize to him for not being there for him and i  also want to explain why i did what i did. But i dont think i should apologise :/ i was only doing it cs i had to prioritise myself first. What should i text him? im actually very happy right now and im scared ill have to go back to how things were 🙂 i do wanna say something to him tho so... help??"
1350,I feel like I need to go to therapy or get some other form of care but I’m not sure how to set that up.,"I feel like I am about to break at any point now and I really need to to talk someone about all of the mental issues I’ve been going through but I don’t know how to set that up under my parents insurance. I’m in the US so I know I’m under my parents insurance for a few more years. I would like for them to not know I’m doing this because I feel like they would just start asking/harassing me for a million answers on why I’m seeking this out or tell me I don’t need it. 

It also seems way to expensive to pay out of pocket for me and I’m not currently going to school so I don’t have access to any form of counseling a college may offer. I just feel completely lost and if I keep going like this I’m just going to snap and kill myself or just refuse to leave my room and talk to other people forever. There is very little positive going on in my life right now and majority of those positive things have some negative thoughts or effects on me as well.

I just want scream everything out and feel better but I just continue to march on in my quiet agony. I have no idea how much longer I can last in this mental state."
1351,Struggling but not drowning: OCD/anxiety opinions,"Hi everyone,

I have been struggling with anxiety for quite some time now (as far back as I remember) - it has not completely stopped me from doing things but it has been a major factor in my decision making and overall mental health.

As of late, I started noticing more OCD tendencies but it has manifested itself in terms of:

\- my nightly routine (having to stare and touch the oven knobs to make sure they are off - often for multiple minutes/visits - until it just feels right, staring at my door lock until I feel okay with it being closed, etc.)

\- work activities (re-reading emails and documents I create over and over until they feel just right, making sure over and over that I sent emails, etc.)

None of these things have made it impossible for me to function but they have caused stress and making me feel ""crazy.""

Does it seem like I have OCD? I have not gone to a psychiatrist because I wouldn't know what an official diagnosis (or not) would do for me.

Any and all opinions/resources are welcome."
1352,Anxieties that rise as a consequence of Covid Isolation,"I have noticed that due to lockdown and sparse social interaction, a lot of trouble seems to arise in my mind. Things I normally don't worry about, I do now. 

1. I am getting older and I've wasted most of my youth 
2. Why does life even matter if we die within the next hundred years
3. We're a meaningless product of evolution
4. Etc. 

These are not actual problems, but just caused by the negativity of lack of social interaction. And there lies the only fix."

1355,My Mom Experienced an Abscess Tooth and Backpain a few months ago. Now she's a completely different person.,"My mom has been very active and a positive thinker my entire life. She was into holistic medicine. She didn't avoid standard medical care, but also was very much into mind and soul as a way to help the body heal. Sometimes it went further than I liked such as practicing such new age treatments like Reike and energy healing. 

A few months ago she had an abscess tooth and back pain. It triggered anxiety attacks which was unusual. The tooth was fixed. The back pain continued. And the anxiety attacks are nearly constant. Every little thing sets her off. She went to physical therapy yesterday and came out a wreck even though they spent most of the time talking. Just turning over triggers fear and dread. 

She's been to the ER a few times. The doctors have ran every test imaginable. Everything looks great and she should be in the top 99% of healthy 62 years olds. And yet she can barely manage to get out of bed.  

I know it was planned to speak to a counselor and move on to a psychologist if she doesn't start improving. I don't know if that has happened yet. Also, it's worth nothing that her mom also had issues that led to taking psychiatric drugs, uppers to get up in the morning, downers to go to sleep, and she ended up killing herself while my mom was just a teenager. I don't know if there is some sort of disorder that got triggered, or if that piece of history is aiding her anxieties. 

I haven't seen my mom for over three months. This is an entirely different person. My dad is doing all he can to support and care for her but it's been a long hard process. Watching someone change so drastically so quickly has been shocking.

Any advice on what to do to help her/us figure this out would be great."

1357,vore fetish stemming from childhood,"i have a vore fetish and i know it came from my childhood (i guess this can maybe educate some people on where this fetish comes from)

when i was younger, 8 or 9 years old, just being able to feel sexually flustered i would fantasize a lot

i would have a lot of inappropriate fantasies such as one specific fantasy where there was a princess and a knight. one day, the knight goes crazy and kills the whole royal guard and everyone in the castle. though, he is head over heels in love with the princess and kidnaps her and takes her to an abandoned house while she pleads for him to let her go.

he rapes her many times (yes, i thought of him having forceful sex with her without her permission) and even gets her pregnant and she gives birth many times. (makes no sense but i was young) 

soon, i got bored of the rapes and births so i imagined him having really passionate sex with the princess, then the princess turns around to put her mouth on his genitalia and starts to suck him into her mouth. i remember thinking of her belly swelling up like a huge ball as the knight went inside and her just sitting there. i never thought of any dialogue, but after a bit of her sitting there she’d birth him out and he’d ejaculate. 

now, as an adult i have a vore fetish along with some other fetishes. hope this brings some insight.

(i personally think this fetish came from boredom with the rape and pregnancy stuff so it would take more to turn me on while fantasizing; that’s where the vore fetish comes in.)"

I'll also have to tell her that I can't participate in a competition where I'll have to present my degree work the day before the competition before I haven't written a single work in my thesis for a whole months and I didn't even do anything to progress...because of my damn anxiety and depression.

1362,Only getting worse with no one to talk to,"I really thought I was getting better but the more I think about it I was just repressing. I’ve noticed that I’ve lost a lot of memories and it’s getting harder for me to recall things from my childhood that aren’t even related to trauma. I don’t know why but I thought it would be a good idea to write out my feelings towards my trauma from sexual abuse - not detailing specifics but just writing about how it affected me and ever since I’ve been having episodes of crying, shaking, and feeling like I’m going to be sick. It hasn’t been this bad in a very long time and I’m starting to get worried. Usually I would just wait for this to stop (because it always does eventually) but I’m starting to worry this only makes things worse for me in the long run. I really don’t know what to do I haven’t been to a therapist in over a year and I don’t know how to ask my mom for help. I haven’t talked to my mom about my abuse since the last time I asked to go to a therapist and she always gets annoyed and procrastinates setting up appointments. I usually talk to my grandma about this stuff but I haven’t talked to her about my abuse in a long time either. I don’t really have friends anymore since moving to virtual school so it feels weird to reach out to them. Not really sure how to cope.

1364,Overwhelmed...,"So this is my first Reddit post...any advice would be great. 

So the beginning of this year, like everyone else, I thought it was going to be great. However, I was fired from a job that I really liked for reasons that, for now, I’ll keep private. It was my own fault tho, I should have known better. A couple of months later, I was struggling to find a full time job. I finally found one that was suited for me. At the time, COVID-19 was barley starting to affect school and other work places. During the month of March, my state (Utah) had an earthquake of about 5.7 in magnitude. I was at work at the time in the fourth floor when it hit. For weeks, for some reason I became easily scared and paranoid about everything. Whether that be my cubicle shaking a little bit to walking alone to my car early in the morning while it was still dark out. I had no problem with these kinds of things, but the earthquake really messed me up. 

A month later, I was laid off due to COVID-19 decreasing the amount of work my job had. I was once again struggling to find a job, but thankfully, after 4 weeks of being laid off, I finally got my job back in May. Now, the following 4 months were good, up until some recent events. In October, I got really sick and I actually thought I had COVID-19 based on what my nurses told me. When I went to get tested, I came back negative. I got really scared because I didn’t know why I was having a lot of body pain, chills, and high fever. 

I went to the emergency room, and I got tested for every kind of virus that I might have. Everything came back negative. I had fevers of 104 and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. I had to be hospitalized for 2 weeks and during those two weeks I had to get 3 CT scans and 3 small surgeries. What they ended up finding was an abscess close abdominal area in which they had to drain. They were confused because I was suppose to be in extreme pain and I wasn’t. 

After I was discharged and got my drain taken out of me, two weeks later, my boyfriend had an accident at work. He had fallen off a roof and landed on his feet straight down, in which caused him to break both of his ankles. I can’t describe the feeling of the thought of losing him. Last year, in March of 2019, his dad and younger cousin were both killed in a horrific car accident. When I heard the news about his accident, it caused me to have a severe panic attack. I thought I had lost him......

Now in December, my boyfriend is doing fine. He had two surgeries on both ankles in November, and in three weeks, he will start rehab to learn to walk again. 

However, just recently, my boyfriends van was broken into. I should note that this is the third time this had happened and before, his van was parked outside of the indoor parking garage, but it was still within our gated community. When that happened, we decided to pay an extra fee to have it parked inside the parking garage, but that didn’t help with anything, because they were still able to break in the second and third time. 

Because of these recent event, I’ve just been feeling overwhelmed. I haven’t been sleeping good, I’m still recovering from my surgeries, and I’ve been really stressed out. I feel like I can’t catch a break. I don’t know what to do and it’s been affecting everything I do. I’m trying to be there for my boyfriend and for his family. I usually come home late at night from spending time with my boyfriend so I can make sure he is not alone. However, when I get home, I have things like cleaning the dishes or having to do homework that do not get done because I get exhausted. I don’t know if I sound like a bad person, but I would really like one day to sleep in and just catch my breathe. I can’t handle anymore bad news. 

If anyone has any advice or words of encouragement, I would greatly appreciate it. At this point, I don’t know what to do."
1365,I really am not sure what to do anymore,I feel so paranoid and anxious.. I feel like everyone is against me.. I feel like my partner is just gonna randomly leave and hate me..

1366,"Having some pretty severe physical issues because of mental ones, and I can suffer through the mental but am worried about the physical repercussions","So after a major life change about a week and a half ago I've been having at least daily panic attacks, sleeping at most an hour or two a night if at all, severe suicidal ideation, regular vomiting, and 0 appetite / what feels like a constant knot in my stomach. 

I can deal with the mental problems as I have dealt with them before, and I would genuinely say I do not think I am at risk of harming myself, but I am seriously concerned with the physical impacts. I was already on the lighter side of BMI, and in the span of a week and a half I've lost over 10lbs which is rapidly approaching underweight, and when I can force myself to eat I often can't keep it down. This is also causing lightheadedness, shakes, etc. and making my normal responsibilities almost impossible to manage. I've started to take vitamins and have been trying to at least keep down a protein bar daily, but really don't know the path forward to at least mitigate the physical problems. Primarily just trying to stop losing weight at an alarming rate and have some ability to eat because of the slew of other health problems that will certainly come from that"
1367,I'm mad at myself for getting a 98.21% grade. I know that's dumb.,"I got a 98.21 on my first college class (photography) that I've ever take. (I'm in high school.) I'm crushed. I don't know why, its not a bad grade I guess. But I'm so mad at myself. I messed up on 1 PHOTO. I thought that a photo was a great example of direct light and it wasn't. I'm so mad. I hate it. That 1 assignment that I got an 85% on, ruined my 101% overall score.   


UGH WHY AM I CRYING ABOUT THIS"
1368,I’m just really conflicted and feel like I’m a horrible friend.,"So long story short: we’re in high school in my country. It’s our last year. Exams are stressful and are just looming over everyone. My friend was recently forced to tell their parents about their mental health issues because of the school finding out. I told my parents about my long standing mental health issues last January and have received little help because of Covid bringing everything to a halt unless it an emergency- and because on the days they called to ask me questions, I was feeling pretty good- I must’ve gone to the bottom of their list. I’ve recently been going through a bit of a mental health crisis, but because everyone is having a tough time, I tend not to mention it to anyone (and not my parents because they’ll freak out). 

Anyway, some stuff happened today: my friend was upset because they broke up with their Gf yesterday, over text, because my friend thought they would be better as just friends. My friend realized what a bad decision that was when their Gf said “I want absolutely nothing to do with you for awhile”. My friend was very upset about this whole situation and said that they felt like a horrible person. I tried to offer some support (“everything will turn out fine” “it’ll be okay” “you’re not a horrible person, you just made a dumb choice that plenty of people do, it’ll sort itself out eventually”... just clichés like that) and they blew up at me, twice today. The first time it was a little hurtful, the second time I almost cried because I have a problem with people talking to me harshly (sounds dumb... I can’t help it). They ended up going home at lunch. 

I don’t know how to feel about this. I feel like I did something wrong, maybe I did? I don’t even know, this entire situation is just upsetting me. I don’t want to go to school tomorrow."

My brain had found it easy patterns to project those thoughts and keep repeating it again and again. Even though it hurts, it would still keep on repeating again and again. I cannot explain why my brain keeps repeating a thought that it knows it hurts other than, it's an easy pattern and neurons firing together like a way for it to loop in the circuit.

I feel like I am investing too much energy in someone's life that I am not living my own life. I cannot explain that but I am never in my own self now. Even while writing this, I am thinking of someone else. Does that make me multi tasking into many things at the same time. I keep on trying to bring back my attention to now than worry about my actions in the future and it's consequences. I am a firm believer in the energy of the thought and how it manifest itself in my physical world."
1372,I just want to say,"I beat my mother loving depression today, LETS GOOOO random internet strangers, I LOVE ALL AND EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW, ain’t nothing going to bring me down from this height of happiness"
1373,"I just want some advice, but the ranting part was also nice","So how do I start this, I guess by just doing so. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for it but I don't really care at this point.

I'm just so tired of everything, so fucking tired. Especially, my parents, I wish they would just see reality for once, christ. I don't know but the fact that they have decided to put parental controls on our router, although small, felt like the straw that broke the camels back. Here is where I would normally say something along the lines of 'I have been diagnosed with \*insert mental/physical illness\* but sadly not.

See my parents don't believe that I could possibly have anything wrong with me, although they talk about how accepting they would be every time I try to rase **anything** with them I'm always immediately shut down. ""Ye but \*insert name\* actually has that"", ""Ye I'm glad you'll never have that"", fuck its hurtful, I cant rase anything with them ever, it feels so suffocating.

Even after all I've been trough they still refuse to even acknowledge that something could be wrong and I'm so fucking tired of it. I'm pretty sure I have these, depression, anxiety and insomnia. I thought the insomnia part would be fucking obvious since I've always struggled to fall asleep even as a child, so I would do stuff witch my parents would notice and yet nothing.

You would also think that it would be obvious that I have some form of mental illness considering (trigger warning) since they saw all of my self-inflicted cuts. I've been self-harming for about 3 years now, with breaks in between, because I'm ashamed, spaning from 1 week to 8 months but its been 3 years and I relapsed about a month and a half ago, exams and other stresses got to me.

My mother saw the cuts about a week after I had made them and instead of asking me if I was ok she shouted and threatened me for about 15 minutes, not to kill me or anything just to remove all furniture/sharp objects from my room. Plus I have scars, pretty obvious ones too, that I know she can see because when she does she just looks at me disappointedly and sighs.

I'm so stressed because of school it's killing me slowly, I'm a generally good student but the one thing I'm terrible at is Afrikaans, I'm really bad at it, it feels like I'm stuck in one spot whilst everyone moves past me and the way she treats me because of it hurts. She always says that she's there for me but them will pass passive-aggressive comments about how much the tutoring costs or that shes put her hand out but they have to accept it to get better.

I work so fucking hard, I can prepare for tests for months and ill get a 30% and it feels like I've been kicked in the stomach and all I get from my parents is a just work a little harder, study more vocab, etc. **I fucking am, I'm trying so dam hard, all I want is to do well.** It hurts even more because I used to be good at Afrikaans but no longer.

I've always been told that they are human and they make mistakes and to forgive them but fuck it hurts, **it hurts so fucking much**. I feel so shit for being like this because I've been given all the opportunities I could get but nothing fucking helps, it feels like I'm stuck in an endless pit of quicksand

I've got dickheads for friends, one of which is falling down an endless pit of sadness and fucking up everything he fucking can. Another always pushes me down for what I do, for context I put **a fuck** of effort into the way I dress, fashion has always made me feel better and he knows this. Yet every time I wear something he will find **some fucking way** to insult it or put me down for it.

I hate my school because they pipe about how accepting they are yet when I came out they said I did it for attention, called me a whore and bullied me mercilessly. My sexuality still confuses me to this day, I've been BI for some time now but I'm pretty sure I'm lesbian and I'm so fucking confused and tired of it. I just want to leave but I don't know if I will function anywhere else.

The food itself makes me feel nauseous, so I'm eating less but sometimes it doesn't, I hate the way I look and act so fucking much, I just want it all to stop, I'm supposed to be smart but I always feel like a fucking fool, I hate it so much, but I'm a privileged white kid, what can I say, what does my opinion matter.

my house is completely white without any colour and that doesn't help either, it feels so fucking suffocating. It's like an endless white abyss, with all of the perfect wooden bars to tie a noose on, I walk up some mornings and just look at those bars thinking how easy it would be

1376,"Ugh hi, it's my first entry here"," I'm 22. Honestly i don't know what to do. For years now i am struggling with my mental health i though that i can beat it alone but now i no longer feel that way. No one knows about it. not my family or my friends (and i would prefer this to stay that way).  Tried a couple times to get some help from specialists but it never worked. Please tell me what i am supposed to do.

Ps. English is my 2 language so don't criticize me for that please

1377,Im looking for research and info about the difference between thinking and being. Anyone who can recommend some studies/books or just any info at all?,I just have a really hard time to define my being without clearance on this.
1378,Friend Has Social Anxiety &amp; Keeps Ghosting Me; I have depression so it makes me feel extremely alone,"**I just don't know what to do in this situation.** My friend has social anxiety; she often masks the severity behind jokes, but I suspect it's probably a lot harder on her than what she's conveying to me (I don't want to assume her mental health, but I believe it's quite clear through her actions that she suffers with it a lot more than what she outwardly says). She also has never seen a professional, despite me recommending her to. We've been friends for 6-7 years now and \~1.5 years ago, we were extremely close.

Because I'm an extrovert and many of my friends are introverts, I have usually always made the first move in scheduling hangouts, hitting ppl up, etc. It usually never bothers me unless I'm in a depressive episode..which is right now. But once COVID hit, you'd imagine everyone would want to connect even more online due to the fact that we can't really meet up irl. Well this friend just kinda disappeared. She responds to my texts 2-6 weeks after I originally send them..and she usually won't respond unless I prod her to. During the past 9 months of the pandemic, we've video called twice..both through my constant effort. Before the pandemic, she wasn't always the best at responding &amp; I usually had to nudge her a little to go out with me to public spaces. Again, I just always took the initiative since I knew she has social anxiety. But all of those prior experiences + her attitude now have started stacking up &amp; it just makes me feel so alone. I also have past negative experiences in toxic relationships where I was always the one making the effort to keep it together. So this is just really not helping. It's like the one friend I really trusted doesn't even care about me enough to check in with me and I have to practically ask her to respond to me. I'm going through such a dark time and she won't even shoot a simple text my way. I am trying to be understanding since majority of people's mental health have been impacted during this time and the pandemic has made her anxiety worse, but I just can't help but feel like it's unfair for me. I've had past conversations with this person about how I'd appreciate it if they took the initiative in contacting me. She always says she'll try, but she never does it. What do I even do? Does she even want me as a friend? Is a friend who ghosts you during a time where you're hurting so much even truly count as a friend?

1379,How to Get Someone Committed,"Tw: suicidal/homicidal ideations, weapons 

Is there any way to get someone committed to a mental health facility without calling the police? My mother had what seems like a psychotic break last night and pulled a gun on both herself and me. Luckily, my stepdad was able to intervene and get it away from her. Do I call her therapist? Idk what to do. 
Location: virgina, usa"
1380,"I feel completely broken, worthless and unloved.","I hate myself so much I can't take it anymore. My mom emotionally abuses me whenever I speak. My dad lets her do it and never cares. My brother tells me im over reacting. 

I barely have any friends. I have about 6. I only really talk to 2 of them. One of them I don't even know if they like me. They talk to other people and seem so happy then I come around and they seem so bored or annoyed. 

I make fun of basic girls but I want to be them so badly. They have nice parents. They're skinny. They're beautiful. They have so many friends that theyre so close to. They post saying ""who wants to come hang out"" and not even an hour or 2 later they're posting about how much fun they're having with their besties. Meanwhile I'm at home all alone hating myself wishing i was never brought into this world.

Whenever I vent to people I drive them away. I give my boyfriend PTSD from it and my friends just ghost me or say ""damn that sucks im sorry"" 

I wish I was skinny and pretty and popular and had family members that cared about me. 

My brother has his friends over meanwhile I'm crying in my bed like a little baby. 

I don't know why people hate me so much. I do so many weird things so I think I'm autistic but at the same time I think it's just because im broken and the only reason nobody wants me is because I'm the worst person to exist. 

I think that if I died the world's problems would cease to exist and everyone would be happy again. 

I feel like such a self-centered brat but I don't know what to do. 

I just wish I was fucking dead so I don't have to feel likw this anymore."
1381,What are these symptoms linked to??,"Hi guys,

Lately this weird thing has been happening to me where I lose control of myself and I feel as though I am going crazy (cognitively). My tongue sticks out a lot, my head feels scattered, I giggle uncontrollably, I say weird things and feel giddy too. In addition to this I’ve been having intense mood swings that quickly go up and down: I am really depressed/dark inside with suicidal thoughts and have constant existential dread, then when a slot opens for rest/escape from reality I become real happy. This is horrible. I really want to sleep and do nothing all day long. I feel this way during the weekends too. Can someone please help me figure out what this is."
1382,Bad day - TW precious self harm talk,"So I've struggled with depression, anxiety, and BPD for many, many years now. But this year was one of the biggest years of change in my life since the year my oldest child was born.

I got a great job.
I finally left my abusive spouse.
Got a new (to me) car.
Got my first ever apartment completely on my own (no co-signed, that's huge!)
Got almost equal custody of my children.
Invested in my art (sewing/embroidery).
I met an amazing man who constantly amazes me with his thoughtfulness, kindness, and patience.

Everything was coming up aces, after I spent three days in the behavioral health ward of the local hospital back in May at the beginning of COVID.

And then I got fired today.

I am not okay.

When I lost my job in January this year, the person I was dating at the time left me immediately after, (I am polyamorous), my then husband started to physically abuse me, and my depression got so bad I still have self-harn scars on my arm.

I'm terrified that the man I love now is going to leave me, and since I've just lost my job (within the last three hours) I won't be able to pay for any of those new things I have (car, apartment), and will subsequently lose my custody agreement, and end up homeless, unemployed, and ready to die.

I write it all out here because otherwise I'm going to do something dumb (NOT kill myself, that's not even an option) and I've worked so hard to not return to those bad habits, I will not take another L today.

Thanks for reading."
1383,I have no idea if I'm just depressed cause the pandemic put my life on pause or if I genuinely need to leave my BF,"I'm driving myself nuts. I turn to Reddit for help/reassurance my relationship isn't bad/is good almost daily at times. This isn't me. I feel like a weirdo, who posts on Reddit as a crutch to cope with their unwavering stress? Normal people get drinking problems or gamble. I've been seeing my BF sporadically for the last 9 months thanks to the pandemic. I used to see him almost every single day as we were in the same college. We're doing our junior year online thanks to the pandemic. Praying I get a normal senior year in fall 2021. My mental health is in the bin. It alwsys gets worse when I'm not busy. I've spent 9 months without working or seeing friends or going to college. Spend my days doing online college work or worrying. I convince myself I have a new cancer every week or 2. I stay up till 2am usually, worrying about my future, should I leave etc. I'm always tired as a result. I'm irritable. My dad said I've lost my ""spark"" these last few weeks, although I've been like this for 3 or 4 months now. 

I was so sure he *was* the one and maybe he still is and I'm blind to see it. We've been together over 2 years. He has a lot of baggage and a mental illness which makes him confess things you should never ever say to a GF. Stuff a therapist should be hearing. I'm a business major. Not a therapist. This can happen daily for weeks. It's gotten like this twice in just two years, the last time being this summer. It hit me in August, after I cried over something he confessed out of guilt, that love shouldn't really feel like this and maybe there is a relationship that's like 80% great out there? Since then I've been so confused and guilty. He still talks about our future kids while I'm thinking ""how dare his anxiety make him think I'm not popular/hot enough for him?""  or ""do I wanna go the rest of my life having never slept with anyone else or orgasmed?"". I just feel so freaking exhausted and little attraction anymore. I feel like turning my brain off and going through the motions till February and analysing how I feel then cos I doubt Im in the mental state to make decisions.  I can still have fun with him but I rarely miss him and I really don't wanna move in next year. Sometimes calling him at night feels annoying or texting him back feels like an effort. I still love him but I don't know if I feel *in love* anymore?"
1384,Therapists are dumb,"Not dumb in a literal sense of course but rather conceptually. I’ve been to 3 of them so far and non had helped. I even lied to my parents that they were beneficial so that they won’t get mad at me for wasting money. 

Like, you are basically talking to some dude who gets paid to use their “expertise” to somehow make you feel better. I just realized it’s all bullshit. I get that it may help people with basic and less complex problems such as temporary depression and anxiety, but for those with chronic and “unique” illnesses like I have, they are simply ineffective.

For emotional support I usually rely on my friends and the plushies I sleep with. With my friends we actually have a mutual connection so we understand each other better than these supposed experts that barely know anything about you and are not really trustworthy. The plushies act as a stress relief when I’m in bed and listen to hours of music while cuddling with them.

As for dealing with my illnesses, I currently strictly rely on medications. However, I am also experimenting with cannabis. So far it has shown positive effects for me if I smoke it when I’m having a depressive or anger episodes. I still have yet to come to the conclusion whether or not it’s a good enough solution, but I see a lot of potential that it has. 

Those are my thoughts for the day."
1385,Am I allowed to be mad at my partner for this ?,"Back story - earlier today my partner told me she was selling her violin . She said a woman came to buy the violin at her house and they where laughing and giggling together. As a joke I said “oh do have competition ? Do I need to get my boxing gloves out ?” We both laughed and moved on . 

Story - later on , she sent me a screen shot of a gymnast I have never heard of . So carrying on the joke I said “ oh do I need to fight her as well “ in reply my partner replied “ you better fight yourself because you have all my attention . Well..... at least one of your personality’s do “ . She knows I struggle really badly with my mental health because I have borderline personality disorder. This also isn’t the first time . When we first slept in the same bed she rolled over and said “your not gonna kill me in my sleep are you ? You know ...... because your mental?!”

Do I have the right to be mad about this or should I just let it go . Am I being to sensitive?"
1386,I need advice,"This is a bit like a vent post/cry for help. My girlfriend has lately been harming herself and talking about suicide, and I want to stop this before it's too late. She thinks that no matter what anyone does, nobody can help, no matter how much I've tried to persuade her it's not worth it to give up. Unfortunately, we are both self isolating for two weeks after being in contact with someone who has covid 19. I've tried to distract her and give her alternative methods to cutting, but she ignored them. She has also been threatening to stop eating. I think part of this is greif from that fact that recently her sister passed on, and from what I've heard, her sister was a supportive, strong young woman who constantly stood by her side even when others turned away, especially when my girlfriend came out as trans (Mtf). I am seriously worried about her mental health and I only came to Reddit as a sort of last resort. If you have any ideas or thoughts on what I should do, they would be highly appreciated.
