0,"My friend feels like they're not being productive enough and hence feel like they're not being committed to their goals, how can I help as a supportive friend?","I really want to be there for them and make sure they're well aware of this, I also hope to maybe make them feel better."
1,walking contradiction,"I have dealt with my depression &amp; anxiety since I was a child. I remember having my first panic attack and believing I was going to die. if you told me then that I would be here at 26 years old, I would have laughed in your face. 

the thing is, for the last couple of years I have really tried to not just survive but live. 

I’ve learned coping mechanisms. breathing techniques. have a good support system. 

yet. I still find those thoughts creeping in &amp; bleeding onto this new chapter I’ve written for myself. 

is it just always there? 

even when I’m happy &amp; in love?"

3,Feel like giving up,"I have nobody to talk to, I have one friend and I can’t risk losing him by putting all this stress on him.

For the past year i have lost all confidence and happiness i once had, i was known for being funny and sociable but i have become distant from my past self. I feel like a burden to those around me and i always seem to let down my family. 

I from the UK where another lockdown has begun, i am currently training to be a barber and my barbershop has closed down. I risk losing my role as apprentice and all the progress i have been through.

I honestly have never been this depressed and alone and i am only 16. I have a girlfriend but i feel nothing anymore, both physically (sex) and mentally. I feel I can’t do anything right and i am just useless.

There is 3 weeks of lockdown left and i don’t know what to do. 

This is my first time ever opening up (even anonymously) and i feel it is my last hope

Thanks,
Sam"
4,Im starting to feel like im not enough. And that i let down everyone around me.,Just of recent I've not been feeling myself and im unsure why. Its like a constent down feeling in the back of my head. I suffer from PTSD and have for a few years now. I hide behind a smile and crack on with my day. But its starting to really hit me hard. Im posting here as I dont wanna bother the people around me. Thanks for listening reddit
5,Falling apart,"I started university a month ago , I was still not doing very good at all mentally but I was slowly starting to have an good time . Then lockdown number 2 happened and most of my flat ( including myself ) went home for lockdown as there wasn’t any point in staying and might as well save money ( loads of other reasons too) I’m so behind on my work already and I feel like everything is so overwhelming . It has gotten to that dark place again and I can’t get out and the more I stay here the harder it is to do anything . It’s just downward spiral . I want to see a doctor but because I’m back home idk if they will make me a temp patient or not and I’m too anxious to call and ask . I feel like giving up at this point and then non of this would actually matter and I would be bothering no one . Dying is slowly becoming my only option again"
6,Am i being silly? Maybe im just too sensitive...,"Hello :) 
So im not really good with talking about my feelings or problems. Especially out loud, especially with people i know. But im feeling very emotionally drained and broken tonight and feel like talking to someone.So in seventh grade i started going to a private Christian school. My family wasn't really religious so it was a huge culture shock for me. I didn't know all the songs and stories that all the other kids had grown up with in there extremely Christian homes. But it was shoved down my throat the first couple days so i learned fast. I remember breaking down crying during a sermon and doing the whole "" letting Jesus into my heart thing"" However that summer, once i was away from constantly being told that i needed saving, i began to have serious doubts. I quickly realized i didn't believe in what i was being taught. However i was not allowed to change schools. What followed was 5 unbelievably painful years.I realized i was bisexual, but couldn't be open about it in my extremely homophobic environment. I felt like i had to constantly wear a mask. No one could find out i was a bisexual atheist so I retreated into myself. I was terrified and angry all the time. I suffered severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Most days i didn't think i was going to make it until graduation.When it finally arrived, i was so ready to get out of there. I was going to but that behind me and be happy. While im better than i was 2 years ago, im still struggling to move on completely. Im so bitter towards religion and when i think about that school, i spiral and break down. I dont feel like i deserve to use the word ""trauma"" because compared to other people, what i went through was tame. However the thought of stepping into a church makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry. In one of my psych classes we talked about religion just in general terms, and i broke down crying.Im hoping these feelings will go away with time, i just feel like its silly that i can't just get over it."
7,antidepressants?,"i’ve been thinking about going on antidepressants for a while now but i’ve been thinking more seriously about it ever since both my coworker and friend started talking to me about how they’re on zoloft/lexapro. i have a few questions about it so hopefully someone can help out 
 - how would i go about getting them? do i just ask my regular doctor or do i have to go see a psychiatrist or something before being prescribed something?
- is it possible for the doctor/psychiatrist to refuse or to attempt to talk me out of them? i already feel as though i’m not “depressed enough” and even asking to get them is a big deal to me, so i’m terrified of asking for medication and them turning me down
- although this differs from person to person, are most antidepressants covered by insurance? and is it still expensive after?

if anyone has any advice as well i’d really appreciate it!!"
8,Happy Diwali,"Happy Diwali everyone! For those of you that don't know much about this event, it is widely celebrated around the world mainly by those of Indian background. Diwali reminds us all that evil will inevitably be conquered by lightness. 

On Diwali, I always remind myself that there's light at the end of the tunnel (something I say to myself when I am feeling down). My family doesn't ever celebrate anything. Ever. It's just me in the festive spirit every single occasion which is why I want to celebrate with my Reddit family by wishing you all a happy Diwali.

Remember, this storm will pass."
9,Deleted Everything,i recently deleted all of my main social media apps that i use. i was in a very bad headspace to  the point where the tiniest things were triggering me and i was very close to committing suicide. i’ve felt much better since i deleted everything and i’ve done this before but only for a few days. i wanna come back to social media but i’m so terrified of getting into that awful headspace again. any tips on what i should do if i return anytime soon?
10,"I can't stop having thoughts of suicide, is there something I can do?","Early this year my Step Dad finally left. He dumped my Mom after 8 1/2 years of torturing us (Mom, Sis, and me), mentally, physically.... just, making life horrible. Making me want to stay at school because I knew he'd be waiting to yell at me when I got home. Just a lot of gaslighting and putting us down. A few months ago I started getting paranoid that he'd come back and start hurting us again. I was having difficulty sleeping and wouldn't be able to dream without him somehow being there too. After begging my Mom for help, in the form of therapy, she found someone, but the first thing was ""So let's talk about your mother's ex"" and I blacked out. But eventually I had to talk about it and I just... ended up feeling like shit. When we got home I cried until I fell asleep. I thought that talking about it would make it better but I just got depressed, I couldn't get motivated to do anything and I got really numb. I can't say when it started but I started thinking about starting to cut myself again (I'd been able to break my addiction in May), and I thought about how far I could go. I was being flooded with these thoughts and now I can't stop. Please, I need help."
11,Living without receiving any affection?,"Hello, i'm turning 20 in few weeks. I want to know will i developp some mental illness something like this if i  never have received like hugs kisses holding hands being loved etc..? Like right now i'm having some ups &amp; downs during these past few months ."
12,Someone please nap on me,"The other day i had a pretty bad panic attack, although I know that pressure or weight can be grounding,  i figured I'd share my experience. I was alone and panicking for quite a while but once i realized i might be a danger to myself in that state i made my way to the livingroom... where i continued to panic just with my mom present, she noticed and tried to comfort me a few ways but nothing really helped, eventually she called one of my dogs,this one was trained as a support dog for my brother. she had my dog lie down on my chest and leaned on me herself, it helped a lot but honestly the thing that helped most wasn't the weight(although that helped a lot) it was the fact that it was someone who cared about me that was doing it. 

I know this wouldn't work for everyone but honestly it really helped me figure out what works for me. all i need is for someone i trust to lie down on top of meand just chill and i instantly feel a lot better."
13,People stop caring after a while when you're almost always suicidal,"I've been dealing with severe anxiety and depression this year and I've had multiple bouts of being extremely suicidal in the last 6 months (like, not just 'I wish I was dead' thinking, I was actively planning on how and when to do it), and each time I've gotten through solely because of my therapist and my therapist alone. Everyone who I'd lean on for support has made it extremely clear to me almost every time I try to reach out that they're too busy dealing with their own stuff and would prefer to not be bothered with mine. My therapist is the only person who seems to actually care about me and every so often I remember shes paid to do that so it's not like she actually *cares*, she just has to act like she does because it's her job. 

When I was at my most suicidal a couple of months ago,  my therapist reached out to my boyfriend and told him it would be best if he held onto my medications and tried not to leave me on my own. She gave him crisis lines to call if he needed to and he agreed. He left me alone the next 6 days in a row for work, which I guess he couldnt help, he has to make money, so he reached out to my best friend and asked her to check in on me. I was alone without being checked in on at all for the whole time. I honestly felt sort of dumb for not just killing myself at that point. 

I'm told all the time to reach out to friends for support when I'm feeling suicidal, and today, with such huge covid numbers and just all kinds of personal stuff, I started feeling really suicidal again for the first time in a few weeks. I reached out to two of my best friends and both opened and ignored. I feel stupid and like they think I'm looking for attention but really I just cant do it alone anymore. I cant sit alone with these thoughts because they get worse and worse and its terrifying, but they just seem annoyed at this point because I've been suicidal so many times that they dont think I'll actually do it and they're tired of dealing with it.

I dont know why I'm posting this I just needed some outlet I guess since I dont really have anyone else to talk to :( every time I start feeling better I realize how shitty life is and how people only care about their own lives and that's it."
14,My life has no meaning,"Just like the title says, I feel like I’m wasting my life away. I have no self motivation and I don’t know where to start to turn things around..."
15,"My mental health has taken a terrible turn this year. I am constantly going through periods where I am fine, and periods where I feel terrible. Why?","I'm not trying to ask for a handed diagnosis or anything. I just want at least a hint of why I feel the way I do, because I don't understand why.

Last year, I was completely fine mentally. I was doing really well. I didn't really have any problems whatsoever. I was pretty detached from my emotions to be honest, but at least I actually felt at peace.

I'm not sure if it was the quarantine, or something else, but this year everything just went downhill. I've taken time to think about my own feelings and realized so many things about myself, that now I suffer from them. I have started to experience anxiousness, stress, feelings of depression, unmotivation, overthinking everything, and that's what I can remember for now.

Lately I've been experiencing a pattern. For a few days, I feel great. I don't need to vent anywhere, I have fun and feel alright. My daily worries and stress are still present, but I manage to distract myself from them very fast.

But then after those few days I just... Start feeling bad. It's usually something different than the last time. It's me feeling anxious all day, or me getting terrible thoughts about myself, or me feeling depressed and too tired to do anything, or me feeling lost and clueless and unsure of what to do at all, or feeling scared that everyone is going to leave me, and it goes on. And in that time period, I feel miserable. Sometimes, I even reach the point of thinking that living isn't worth it anymore.

But after a few days... That just, goes away. I stop worrying that much. I start feeling fine, and it goes back to how it was before. And the cycle continues. Every month, every week.

I don't know why I feel this way. I've had bad experiences in my life that have changed me as a person, however, almost none of them were anywhere near traumatic, and even the ones who impacted me more don't affect me *that* badly. I don't know why I feel this way. I wonder if it's adolescence. I am a very young teen. Basically a kid. Old enough to be using Reddit of course, but a kid nonetheless. So maybe it's normal to feel these highs and lows due to hormones?

But at the same time I find it so odd. I don't think a kid my age should be feeling so... bad. I don't think it's normal for me to feel nearly suicidal at times. I want it to stop. I don't want to take my own life, and leave my friends and family behind. I want to see where the future takes me. But given my life circumstances, and given that everyday there's a different struggle for me, I don't even know if the future is worth experiencing. And I feel many other little things that I haven't mentioned here because the post will be really long if I do.

I apologize if this is too long, or unsolvable. But please try and tell me, do you have any idea of why I am feeling this way? If this is anything I should be worried about? Or is this just teenage-hood?

Are things going to get better? And most importantly, should I seek professional help?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much if you made it this far. I appreciate you hearing me out.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mental health went down severely this year, now struggle with a lot of bad feelings and thoughts. Feel fine for a few days, feel like absolute shit for a few other days, cycle repeats. Sometimes feel almost suicidal. Is this just adolescence, or should I seek professional help?"
16,What can I do about an ongoing panic/anxiety attack?,"It's been 4 days. I am wondering what else I could do. My heart feels like it's not beating at all or it's going too fast. I can't stop shaking and my hands keep trembling when trying to do things. I cannot keep down food and have been puking all the liquids I try to drink. And worst of all my chest hurts. 


Anytime I feel myself start to have an actual panic attack, I go to the mirror and talk myself out of it. Or I just try to give myself comfort through it. I can't seem to calm down though. I attempted to take a walk to town to be around people and distracted, and to breathe the cooler air outside, but the thought of people passing by in cars worries me and I have up way too soon. I don't know why. It's almost a 2 hour walk just to the edge of town also. That's a long time of figuring out directions and watching for cars, and just being overstimulated and away from home. 


I can't stay distracted long enough. Even to do small things, my hands shake. I don't feel strong enough to get through it even though I know I am. I just hate this feeling in my chest and want it to go away. Is this dehydration or just anxiety? Is there anything else I could do."
17,A university professor of mine committed suicide on Friday on campus. We were escorted off campus by SWAT teams and dogs. They’re saying we avoid the area and demand we come back in person for classes. I am not okay.,"I don’t know what to do or say right now even.
It’s been less than 24 hours and we’re all still in shock. 
We’re expected to return Monday like nothing happened- like we didn’t see the ambulances and forensics. Like we don’t know his two daughters or saw their drawings by his office.

Here’s our small petition we’re trying to send to the university to give us more than 2 days to goddamn mourn. I don’t know if this breaks rules but, I don’t know. I don’t want to have to walk back through the hallways knowing a man just shot himself days earlier.
[I am so fucking tired.](https://www.change.org/p/saginaw-valley-state-university-svsu-delay-opening-of-campus-and-provide-trauma-services?recruiter=572187482&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=3e7ee740-4787-1)"
18,“One year from now you’ll know how it all turned out”,"This simple phrase means so much to me. This time last year I was in the midst of a depressive episode. The beginning of that summer I lost my insurance and was forced to stop my bipolar medication cold turkey. I remember silently crying in the bathroom as I contemplated suicide yet again (this went on for months) For some reason, that episode seemed to be the worse, because I also began exhibiting symptoms of OCD. That’s beside the point, though.

I remember debating between the ways I would end it all. I remember being angry that I had family members that cared so much about me, because my fear of their life without me always outweighed my desire to die. Their love for me continuously pulled me back from the ledge; without them ever even knowing it.

I saw this quote pop up on my feed during that time. Now I can’t even remember whether it was here, Twitter or Instagram. But I can remember typing it up on word document, printing it out, and putting it in my journal. I remember writing a list of all the things I still had to do in life under that phrase to. 

So, I’m looking through that old journal that I haven’t used since late last year and I’m just shocked at how low I was feeling. The past few months I have been at my happiest, even with the bad days. I know after that episode- that I can survive another when that time comes.

I just wanted to tell you guys that I know some of you have been experiencing some rough times. And at the moment it always seems like the worst thing in the world- and at the time, it probably is, but hold on! Cry it out. Write down your thoughts. Paint. Go to therapy. Talk to other online strangers that are just as sad as you are. Anything it may be- a year from now you’ll know how it all turned out. ❤️❤️"
19,Anyone else get depressed around the holidays?,"For some reason, it seems like my winter blues are especially triggered by classic Christmas music. I did some thinking and googling last night, and I have some ideas about why this might be, but I’m wondering if anyone else here can relate?

Here are some thoughts I’ve had:

SAD—I already live with depression, and it gets worse in the winter.

Child of divorce—My Christmas memories come with mixed emotions, having to always be without one of my parents on Christmas morning.

Apostate—I grew up really religious, and I’m now an atheist. The Jesus stuff can be triggering, as I believe I have experienced religious trauma in the process of leaving a very rigid religion.

Expectations—My wife and her family are SUPER into Christmas. They have a lot of traditions, and everything about the holiday is always 100% positive. I feel pressured to be happy when I don’t feel happy which just makes matters worse."
20,How many of you have struggled getting hold of therapy sessions with the NHS?,"So I have a friend who lives in Scotland and I found out today that she hasn’t had a therapy session for her BPD since January! 

Now her sessions are essentially check ups but it got me wondering if people who are still in therapy as a treatment are struggling as hard to find sessions?"
21,Ending my life is genuinely an option for me if I don't achieve my dreams,"NOTE: This is a long thread.  


If I wake up at like 35 or something and I haven't achieved my dreams, I don't see the point of going on.  


I'm 24M, introverted and shy as shit, don't like going to parties so I don't meet people that easy anymore, I work from home because I can't bother an uninspiring work environment anymore full of people I don't want in my life long term 

I grew up with shitty self esteem and self worth, due to being bullied, and that made me avoid things, I thought I was unwanted and unlikable, I never had any experience with women cause I never even bothered to try. 

Yes I am a virgin, both in the sexual and the relationship department. Never been kissed (unless you count 1 when I was 10, but I don't count that)  


Only this year did I realize that I'm not fucking ugly, I actually have an above average looking face and if I become fit, I'll look fly as fuck. Thing is, now I am digging a grave for myself because of my age, lack of experience and lack of competence in the romance department, since I missed crucial years where you're supposed to develop this. 

I know how to make friends with people I meet regularly, but I don't know how to ever bring anything further than that or how to express any sort of affection without being needy

I have big goals, I want to work for myself (hence the reason I work from home now, I want more time to work on making that a reality, and getting used to being alone more is a Plus since I won't exactly be working with others to begin with).

Thing is I just become so overwhelmed of everything, cause if I go all in on the business aspect, how am I going to improve in the romantic aspect and vice versa? 

I also want to hit the gym and become Fit AF, and I did start last year but got a back injury which to this day is still hindering me. I get pain/discomfort in my lower spine everyday, and my upper spine/neck whenever I am bent forward just a tad bit for a short amount of time (ex: when cooking or doing the dishes). I really want to start a Martial Art, and I believe that could be a huge boost for me confidence wise, and also develop me as a man, I just don't know how long until my back gets better, or if it ever will get better, and it frustrates the shit out of me. Especially when I see people my age or even younger with amazing bodies that I want myself. 

I've been doing physio for it and it did help in the beginning, but no improvements for a long time.

I just moved back home from living abroad for 3 years, so I left all my friends there. I had to do it though, cause the place (Malta, Europe) was not making me happy anymore, and I saw no future there. So I moved back home temporarily to my parents here in Sweden, just to regain and figure out what's next. I don't have any friends back here, and it's not like I want anything to do with people here either. I am very selective of the people I keep in my life, and I highly believe in the ""You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with"", so I am only looking to connect and keep friendships with people who want/need to be an entrepreneur themselves and/or have similar goals and vibe on the same frequency as me.  I don't fuck with people who go out partying regularly when they have absolutely nothing to celebrate.   


I live in a village 30 minutes from a small city, and I genuinely don't believe there's anyone here that I could connect with, and even if there were, I am basically socially incompetent and can't network for shit. 

Put me in a room full of new people and I'll say about 5 words maximum throughout the whole thing, because I can't hold a conversation with strangers to save my own life. Unless there is already a subject of conversation going on, then maybe I'll be able to, but in a very insecure way. 

There is also not a very positive atmosphere back home here. 

I have 4 sisters and I've never had a particular good relationship with any of them. The oldest one is a psycho, and the other 3 is just a neutral relationship, and I know I'll never have a special bond with them. No brothers so no one I can have that brotherly bond with that could help so much. My dad is a fat, tired and constantly pissed off asshole who I don't want anything with. He is literally the definition of pathetic. Basically he was just there in physical form, but he was never ""there"", you know? So in other words, I grew up with way too much of a feminine influence, as he never taught me shit about anything. I and the rest of the family has tried to help him, but at this point he is just hopeless.  
When he dies, I'll be more sad over the fact I never got to have a proper son - father relationship, rather than the fact that he is gone. 

2 months ago, I decided enough is enough and that I would not disrespect myself anymore in terms of eating shitty/being fat (got that from him, all of us kids got that shit from him because he fed us tons of shit when we grew up. Kids do what their parents do, not what they say. Now we are left to repair this shit when we've grown up).

I started to count everything, so I knew exactly how many calories I ate per day, and also did daily walks.

You know what this piece of shit does?? 

He fucking complains about it, and think that I am being ridiculous by making a GREAT CHANGE FOR ME.

I've lost 10kg in 2 months, and he STILL continues to ridicule me for it, while he is a fatass who can't cover his ass crack, who passes out on the couch every day. 

He thinks that I should ""live life, stop counting and weighing everything"", as if just eating good is ""living life"". 

Whenever they eat some dessert or whatever he's like ""You should have some""......

I look at him with so much disgust and disrespect, it's unreal. He literally wants me to end up a WORSE version of him. As if that's possible. Sometimes I wish I would just lash out and tell him EXACTLY how I feel about him, but that would probably crush him to pieces and ruin every chance of him ever getting better. He's not a strong minded individual, he would not be able to handle what I have to say to him.

I probably should move away from home again already, only been home for 3,5 months, but I have no clue where to go. 

I live cheap and that's a good advantage for when starting a business - minimizing your expenses. But then again, I have to deal with him being a negative piece of shit all the time, and the fact that I am at home - it makes me feel less independent. I want to move to NA, but that's impossible right now, and it also would be a stupid move cause it would be expensive as shit. That's probably not an option until I make enough as an entrepreneur, or if I would find a job there. 

I could sign up for an apartment in the city, but that would just be paying more money to not meet anyone anyways (as I have no friends here as mentioned). The only positive would be that I don't have to deal with this negative household, but that's about it. 

.

.

.

.

Whenever I see people my age or even younger people, who have made it in the business game, I should be encouraged, but I have a very hard time to. I don't get annoyed or jealous, they deserve it and they are inspiring, but I proceed to bring myself down for not starting sooner, and I end up thinking things like ""I could have been there 2 years ago, I could have had my own apartment and everything in North America, I could have had a relationship by now and be happy"" etc. etc. 

But I am at Stage 1.

Had I been 18 and seen all these posts, I wouldn't have been discouraged because I was only 18. Sure, I am still young and I realize there are a shit ton of people that realize this later than me, but I am talking about myself and my situation now, and how I feel. 6 years is a long time and I could've made such progress. Maybe I would've been fit, training a Martial Art 3-4 times a week and not had a damaged back? I'm genuinely worried that I might not be able to step foot in a gym or Martial Art class for years, and I don't want to have to wait until I'm late 20's/early 30's before I'm fit. 

I want to experience it when I'm really young, you feel me? 

Anyways, this post got a bit out of hand and I vented a lot of different stuff that got on my mind. Point is, if wake up at 35 and I am still in the position I am now, I wouldn't want to live. I mean even now I just want to escape this pain I am enduring every single day.

Thanks for reading."
22,"“Have you got eyeliner on ?” No Karen , this is a special brand I like to call “lack of sleep and anaemia “ 👍",My depression keeps me up all night crying. But thanks for pointing it out so I can feel more shit 😬
23,I've just always been shit,"Ever since fucking kindergarten I've been at the bottom. I'm just terrible at everything you can think of, incredibly dull minded, boring, uncoordinated, weak, slow, and just downright unapproachable to people. I've always been like this and yet some try to convince me I'm worth a damn. How? How can you look at someone who's never even come close to accomplishing anything of relative worth that they aren't a useless pile of shit? How does the person who's been in last place his when damn life do anything besides die in a fucking alley? They don't. They never get better, they get worse. Ive only ever gotten worse. I'd say I'm the personification of shit but even that has its uses. Fuck everything. Fuck life. Fuck trying to struggle along and scrounge from dumpsters. I don't want this, and I should be able to choose not to fucking accept it and simply die instead. Why is that so much to fucking ask?"
24,Is something wrong with me?,"For the past 2 years of my life I have had on off feeling of feeling normal, then feeling empty/sad and then angry. Whenever I feel empty or sad I completely lose interest in almost every single thing I do, I lose my appetite and feeling of wanting to socialize and opinions on things and at those moments the only thing I want to do is sit there and do absolutely nothing whilst thinking about absolutely nothing. Then I get angry at my self for feeling that way and I don't exactly know why, when I get angry at my self I say stuff in my head like ""Stop being stupid"" and stuff like ""Something is wrong with me"", and in all honesty I sort of feel that way writing this right now. I sometimes purposefully try to make my self feel sad because in a strange way I enjoy it, I feel as if I have done something wrong and deserve to give my self some sort of consequence. Then after that I go back to normal and don't want to feel like that again, but when I'm actually feeling mad or upset I want to feel that way. Sometimes I write song lyrics and use it as a way to write how I feel because it helps me understand how I think about these things, but sometimes the stuff I say in them is stuff I didn't even know I felt. Sometimes I genuinely feel scared about the way I feel, one time I walked back and forth in my room repeating the sentence ""What do I do"", even though I had done nothing and had no clue why I was saying it, and that scares me. Sometimes these thoughts can get ridiculously bad and some of the thoughts I have consider self harm and one of the thoughts I had close to a year ago was a thought about suicide but I instantly pushed the thought away. It feels like there is 2 voices in my head fighting, one of the voices is the feeling of being angry or sad or lonely, and the other voice is the feeling of being calm or neutral, it feels like sometimes one of these voices gets in my head and I listen to that voice for the next hour or 2. Then after I snap out of it I think I'm going insane but then brush it off as nothing. Sometimes when I'm talking to people I let out subtle cries for help that the majority of the time aren't noticed, but whenever they are I just say something along the lines of ""Never mind"" and then feel bad because I missed my opportunity to talk about it. I beat my self up in my mind whenever I do try ask for help because it feels like I'm vulnerable and I say that ""That is just me being pathetic"". I don't trust any of the people around me and most of the time I feel like they are against me. A lot of the time these thoughts of mine go unnoticed and it builds up then when something bad happens I let everything out in one big go which I like but hate doing at the same time. I sometimes consider getting help but then think that ""Everyone will think I'm weak"" or ""Stop being an idiot you don't need help"". As I said, in a weird way I enjoy feeling this way, but hate it at the same time. When I feel like this I feel like I'm getting what I deserve and that I no longer have to be anything, but then as I said at those times I feel sad and empty. I have incredibly low self esteem and have had a lot of issues throughout my life and have social anxiety but I wrote this to find out if I should be checked for anything else. Does this sound like any sort of mental illness or is this a normal thing that happens?"
25,"My (27,f) cousin (18,f) opened up to me about her mental health issues and idk what to do","(I don’t know if I have to put a trigger warning but: TW Self Harm) So a couple hours ago my cousin was asking me questions regarding mental health and life in general to which I had to answer with one or two words, almost like a game. I answered all her questions and could tell that she wanted me to ask her the same questions back so I did. That’s when she told me about all her mental health problems which were caused by trauma and showed me her wrists which were almost covered in scars. I feel so dumb for never actually having checked on her mental health until today. I tried suggesting her to go see a specialist and she told me that she tried it once and her dad gave her shit for it afterwards. Also she’s pretty busy with life in general so she won’t be able to find time for therapy sessions she said. I wanna be supportive and help her with everything but I don’t know what to do or say. I know what she must feel like because I’ve had similar issues but I’m at a loss of words every time I think about it. I also don’t wanna say the wrong things which could easily happen because I’m pretty bad at showing empathy, I try though. Any suggestions on what I could do or say to help her?"
26,"Why do I overthink so much, and as a result freak out about it?","This is a little difficult for me to explain, but I allow myself to become obsessed with very specific things, then I correlate it with an emotion or idea and latch onto it. For example, I wear gothic clothing and try to obsess over the aesthetic and the color black. I obsess over it because I correlate it with things like space, different forms of architecture, etc. Then one day I'll wake up and suddenly don't feel the same excitement when I think of space or architecture, and it's then that I completely freak out. By freak out, I mean I'll sit in one place without moving all day and try to force myself to think about space until I have the same emotions I usually do, or have the same ""understanding"" of it that I did the day before. If I don't like space anymore, then that means something that's important to me is missing, and it means that I can't feel the same excitement I do when I wear black clothes. I do this with a lot of things, and I really don't know why. But at this point it's completely taken over my life. If I'm not at peace with one thing, I'm not at peace with anything - It's ridiculous that the things I overthink are so small, but they usually are the things that define my happiness. 

Is there anyone who relates, or anyone who can give advice? I'd like to know other peoples thoughts about this."
27,Got too high last night and now feel like shit,"I smoked week last night and such a bad panic attack for like 2 hours and all day today I’ve felt so down and anxious :(

I started smoking a few weeks ago after not smoking for several months. I used to smoke very often a few years ago. Prior to last night, I only smoked occasionally after a really bad anxiety incident I had from an edible last year. Lately, I picked it back up and it was fine! The last few weeks I’d smoke before bed and it’s actually been really nice to wind down and sleep through the night rather than using melatonin and whatnot to fall/stay asleep.

But then idk what happened last night because I didn’t think I smoked more than the last few night. Reflecting on yesterday, I had a large latte at noon, forgot to take my Lexapro, and then smoked at like midnight to fall asleep but had a major panic attack and thought I needed to go to the hospital for like two hours. Obviously, I didn’t, but it sucks.

Idk if this sounds dumb, but I just hate not being able to drink or smoke anymore like I used to because now I get super anxious and feel like I’m going to have a heart attack or stop breathing or that the next day I feel like dying. It sucksssss. I just want to mildly alter my consciousness and not be consumed by the massive pressure of existing! Is that so wrong? 😭

Now, today, I just feel really fucking depressed about everything. I hate being stuck inside, I hate the current situation in the US, I hate being jobless, I hate that my friends and family are struggling too, and just everything sucks.

I don’t want to die or anything, I just wish I could go into a void for like a few days and not have to think about or process anything lol ya know?"
28,If anyone has a spare minute or two I would really appreciate if you could lend me a ear,"I am alone and I'm afraid I'll do something drastic..
My mind is fucked, my mind wants to do shit I don't want to.. Please help"
29,Some questions about therapy,"Do therapists always tell your parents everything? I don’t want my parents to know anything, since I’m not comfortable with them 

Do certain pills make things worse?

Can you request a certain age/gender for therapy?

should I get it? 

How do I ask for it?

Can you just ask for it or is it more of a “You have to go here” kinda thing?"
30,WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO BE SO TOXIC,TELL ME. WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE TO SAY MEAN THINGS AND HURT MY PARTNER WHEN I HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. WHY. LITERALLY MY EMOTIONS CONTROL ME. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I WANNA FUCKING DIE.
31,I feel like I am psychologically scarred from having a BPD girlfriend,"It  started with her seducing me, she knew I was the perfect guy to hold a  grasp of, I tried my hardest to not show any kind of signals that I was  interested, I tried my hardest to not show any kinds of emotions or  reactions, and yet she still desperately tried to connect with me, her  devotion to me was so much to the point where I almost became a  narcissist, the ego boost and supply from getting such  a huge amount of  attention is absurd that it would be odd if one didn't become a bit  overly confident. I gave in and she managed to make me feel so fucked  up, she kept flirting with other people, making me feel so insecure and  jealous all the time, and it was completely intentional, her constant  fear of abandonment caused her to do these really toxic things that  probably left a scar on my mind unless i get help, it was so bad that I  became a literal cuckold, I get turned on by cheating fantasies, I  became so addicted to her, she has ways to make herself so addictive and  attractive it's like a highly addictive drug, and years later I still  can't get over her, even after been in a new relationship, she's on my  mind 24/7. I spend most of my days thinking about how she's probably  with someone else, someone better, I can't get over her looks too, it's  average when i first met her, afterwards she became a near 9-10/10 for me,  it's insane how feelings can change your perception of someone. I can't  focus, be productive, she's on my mind 24/7, it's literally [r/limerence](https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/)."
32,I don’t know what to do,I’ve been feeling very weird this week. Last Sunday my mom scolded me and I just started crying and I couldn’t stop I felt like I was dying until she held me. I felt and feel like I want to die. I don’t want to kill myself but I just want to die. Should I tell my mom? I’m afraid to get her worried because she’s been going through so much already seen how much I’ve cried but she doesn’t know that I feel like dying. This is the second time in my life that I’ve wanted to die. The first time I was in 4th grade and it’s been years and years after that. I’ve also cried because I thought my cat was dead even though he was perfectly fine. I’m afraid that if I get to sad or angry I might hurt myself. I’m scared and worried because some times I feel so happy and then I feel like I wish I was dead. Is there any advise I can get? Sorry if this is a bad post I’m just not sure what to do any more.
33,I feel kind of hollow a lot of the time,"mainly at school or at night, i don’t feel particularly sad - but i don’t feel very happy either. 

i don’t feel like i have anything going for me, and i don’t feel like i really belong in a lot of places. i find it impossible to start up a conversation with someone face to face because i’m too worried that i’ll mess up or i won’t know what to say. i don’t have many friends, but the ones i do have normally hang around with the popular kids and they definitely don’t want me anywhere near them. 

i don’t like a lot about myself, pretty much nothing except i can be funny sometimes. this self dislike is fuelled by the fact that i feel like i’m just looking for attention because i don’t get a lot, and i can’t decide if the reason i want someone to know how i’m feeling is a cry for help or i’m just being an asshole.

i feel like i’ve matured faster than my peers because i can’t seem to relate to them on a lot, and sometimes i force myself to laugh or act like them just to feel included. but at the same time i don’t want to get involved with people because i i feel like they don’t like me or that i’m an annoyance. for example, in english we were put into pairs and i got put with one girl called Amelia and when i moved my chair over i impulsively apologised.

i can’t relate too much to my parents, and i don’t want to talk to them about this because i know their reaction would make me feel worse, even if they didn’t mean it like that. it gives me this longing for some kind of relationship where i can actually express my feelings, because at the moment i’ve never had a friend like that. but i still feel like if my parents wouldn’t be destroyed, and i didn’t have any friends, i would either kill myself or disappear.

despite all this i’m not overwhelmingly sad, which makes me feel like i’m being attention seeking as i said before - which is the reason i made a throwaway for this post. at the same time though i fucking hate a lot of my life."
34,I just need a friend,"For 6 years I have been diagnosed and struggling with depression, tbh I am fairly certain that i have BPD. When i was in school, i had a few friends that i saw everyday and talked to and then i went to college and i tried desperately to connect to just one person that i could call a genuine friend. I hung out with people everyday and still never felt so alone. Even since I left college I have been trying, trying to attach myself to people and then they all let me down and abandon me. I am an attractive guy, I try to be kind and personable, I even sacrifice my money and time for people who dont even look twice at me, but people still just don't want me. It just makes me feel like why try if no one cares, do I really gotta be famous for people to actually notice me"
35,Proud of myself - small win,"I’ve been struggling with chronic depression and a severe anxiety disorder for most of my life. This got significantly worse a few years ago, and developed into an episode of psychosis and PTSD after I experienced a traumatic series of events. I stopped taking care of myself, never left my house, and ultimately stopped talking to everyone I knew (some by my choice, some by theirs). The past few months, “not taking care of myself” was at a bit of an extreme as I dealt with suicidal thoughts that seemed to bring me closer than actually taking my life than I ever have been before. 

This week, I started a new medication. It was terrifying as I’m very hesitant to try any medication that can seriously alter the composition of my brain (maybe an irrational fear, I’ve just had some terrible experiences trying medications). I’ve been eating. I ate more food in the past week than I probably did in the entire month before it. This may seem like nothing, and I haven’t really done much else other than plan my meals and try to eat them, but I’m sitting in my car smoking a bowl thinking about how full I am and I feel proud of myself for the first time in a very very very long time."
36,My biggest fear is somebody breaking my daughters heart.,"I fear that I won’t have the answers, due to the way I’ve coped with grief. With heartbreak. How I’ve shut down and shut off and let a person walk away with the last ounce of my spirit. I want her to handle her traumas, if any, with a healthy mindset and support system/professional help. I don’t want a single man or woman to take from her, the light and the joy that I’ve instilled in her eyes and heart. The thought of somebody stealing her sense of self and being clumsy with her feelings puts me on edge. She’s only 4, and has already experienced let downs and a broken heart due to being mistreated, tortured, and abandoned by her other parent at just 3 years old. It’s a blessing they’re gone, but painful to watch my child ache over the absence, not knowing the suffering she and I endured. People have said “at least she won’t remember” but she does! The “when will life be normal again”, the “they hurt me but I need them” and “why mom?” shows for that! The “are you both tucking me in tonight”, the “am I going to eat before I sleep tonight?” and the “when are we eating as a family again” prove that. 4 going on painful adulthood, that I can’t bear to accept. She’s young but beyond her years and has already seen enough of the world to fear it. Life should not be feared, should not be regretted, nor dreadful or terrifying. I fear for her, that it will undoubtedly be and my hands will be tied behind my back while I’m dodging stabs from every angle trying to protect and save her."
37,New to this...,"So I'm a 22 male and I need help figuring out whats going on. This will be a long post so sorry in advance.

To start I've never had mental issues of any kind and for a while I didn't understand what was going on with other people. But then 4 years ago me and my gf at the time broke up. She has depression and anxiety, and I just didn't understand. Well I've been really screwed up ever since to the point I moved states because everything reminded me of her. So she still cares about me and I have it stuck in my head that I made her life worse because we wold have worked if I was good enough. First me and her were best friends from the nursery in the hospital till we were 18/19 ish. She was my everything and she will still text me on my birthday and holidays. Just to check up on me and try to get her friend back. But I can't bring myself to respond to her. Every time I see her name or a picture of her I shut down and get super sad. After 3 years I responded and she said she had a bf and moved states and still misses me because of how close we were. I don't blame her but the more I have learned about her the madder and sadder I get. All these years of her life that I missed. All the bad experiences that I could have been there for her. I've stayed looking out for her by looking up her social media and scrolling till I break down. I would marry her tomorrow if I had the chance. Anyway my mind has been racing for the last couple years about everything but nothing at the same time. I see her contact and go to block it but I can't. She moved on and I can't. She shouldn't need me. She is better without me. Stuff like that runs through my mind every day since we broke up. But recently it's gotten bad where I've looked down the barrel and considered it. I know the only people that would show up to a funeral would be my 4-6 closest friends and my family. But I know she would be sad so I put it down and move on. Then drink myself to sleep or push it off and deal with it later with video games or videos. Then fast forward to 3 weeks ago and she just out of the blue calls me and I answered after like the 3rd call and we talked for 4 hours and I told her everything. How I don't feel like I have a reason to live, how I don't care about anything anymore, how my hobbies have change to just throwing money at it until hopefully I feel again, and how I drink like a fish so I don't have to lay in bed and think of her or anything else. I think about it daily just disappear and no one will care. And she broke down begging me to not do it. Then last week she asked me what I was doing this weekend and I replied nothing like usual. So she drove down 5 hours straight to come see me. Once she walked in all the noise and thoughts just melted away. I was genuinely happy. It was like we picked up where we left off. She was fighting with her bf and said she needed to get out. So we talked all Friday night. Then when I went to go to the couch so she could sleep in my bed she took the couch and we joked around until we decided to watch a movie in bed and I woke up the next morning with her right beside be and I couldn't do anything but smile and cry. Keep in mind the last time I cried was when we broke up. Then she woke up a little later and we just talked about everything mentioned above and she told me I needed to get help. I can't because that means that I'm accepting defeat. It means to me that I can't handle myself and I need medication to do it for me. I can't. I'm too prideful and stubborn to do it. But she said that she needed to head back tonight and I wrapped my arms around her and bawled. My body just shut down and I started shaking from the thought of going back to me by myself with the thoughts and the noise. I was terrified for the first time in a long time. I hugged her and kissed her forehead like I always used to do and she looked up and me and we were both crying. I told her I loved her as I led her out. And as soon as the door closed I collapsed and just sat there and cried. I've always been able to move on past any relationship or family death or anything. Except her. And it pisses me off that she is the think I can't get over or drink away. And I hate that she still cares about me when she is better off without me. She says that I'm depressed and I don't know if she is right or not. I just don't know what to do. I need her but I don't want to hurt her. I need her but I can't get her. I blew my chance and I can't get past it. My life has came centimeters from ending and I'm not even scared of it. I'm just scared ill never see her again. I just want to feel again. I just want to be happy again. Its been so long since I've felt anything. 

Sorry for the long post and the bs that you have to read. I hate pushing my problems for others to see. I'm the one that my friends come to to talk it out. I'm supposed to be the strong one. Its come bad enough I have to distract myself 24/7 or I start planning my own funeral or start writing my will. Because ik my friends and family don't need to go through my stuff. I'll just have it all lined out for them. I don't want to disappoint my parents by ending it. But I don't want them to see me this way. I have to be the strong person everyone sees me as... thank you reddit."
38,Where do I go from here?,"Like how long is too long? To keep fighting a never ending fight. To lose every day, get back up and lose again. There is no small steps forward, no light in sight, it’s just defeat after defeat. It wears you down and just breaks you apart. You go from having a glimmer of hope in the beginning to accepting defeat &amp; knowing that this is it. This is my existence. If in ten years it’s only been a deterioration how can one still have strength &amp; hope that things will improve."
39,Endless hopeless,"I’ve just feeling extremely hopeless and whenever I think about what’s been happening for the last few months in my life I start to cry.

I feel like a complete loser in life and that I’ll never be happy.
I just hate myself..."
40,Is there something wrong with me?,"I’ve been having very messed up thoughts recently. I’ve been thinking of murdering and seriously injuring my parents a lot recently. I want to make them suffer like they’ve made me suffer and I hate them with all my passion. I want to squeeze the life out of them and feel the warmth of their blood in my hands as I shove a knife into their hearts. Maybe that will teach them a lesson. I’m so sick and tired of their bullshit, I hope they both tucking die."
41,Want to know what my friend has.,"OK so, not even sure if I should be posting this hear. But here it goes. So, I have this friend in school named Leo not his actual name. Now, he is one of my best friends. But he’s a little bit, weird.He is almost fourteen and he has a speech problem. Like, he’ll say his Rs and his Ls like his Ws and pronounce words like a Cheyenne cyan. He’ll also randomly get up, take a couple laps around the room, then sit back down again. Your sometime make these random noises that are low and usually not too noticeable in the back of his throat. He acts a lot younger than he is, like you watch a lot of little kids shows like Dora the explorer or stuff like that. And, whenever he’s speaking to you, he has a habit of for some reason I think involuntarily getting very close to you. Or if you’re sitting next to him at a table or something, he randomly just lean his head on your shoulder or arm or whatever new service there is to lay his head on. He doesn’t just do that with me either, he does that with everyone. He’s extremely nice and kind of Phil, and I love him as a friend. Amazing kid and he’s always willing to give you a hug or something like that if you need it. Whenever I’m really sad which is a lot you usually rest my head and say it’s going to be OK. Sorry ment to say grab my hand. Ao basicly, i’m just wonder if based of what I’ve just sed if you can tell if he has a mental condition. And if so, which one? 

 PS. Forgot to mention a couple things. One, we all go to a school for the blind. And two, one thing he does a lot is leaves a table or conversation or group of people to go to another group of people or conversation or table without any warning. He has better vision in the most of us, so I’m not sure if this is just something people with a lot of vision do or not. Or if it is not normal."
42,Negative Nancy,"You know when your in a zoom call with other people and everyone goes around talking about all the positive stuff that’s going on in there life?

But you don’t want to be honest with what’s going on in your life and how you feel, because you don’t want to be that negative person?

Sometimes I just completely avoid going to my improv class because I don’t want to explain myself..."
43,I don't understand people that are open/loving to everyone. I don't understand people that are really inviting to others. What is wrong with me psychologically if I am super hateful and want to shut people out?,"I don't understand people that are open/loving to everyone. I don't understand people that are really inviting to others. What is wrong with me psychologically if I am super hateful and want to shut people out? I usually assume the worst in people before I get to know them. So I don't understand the people that always describe themselves as open, sociable, loving and tolerant. I look at what humanity does collectively (war, inequality, destruction of the environment, political corruption, murder etc) and also refer to all the horrible people I've ever met to get my view of people."
44,How do I stop resenting those around me?,"I feel guilty for even thinking this, but I can't stop thinking about the people in my life that *don't* have depression.  They can just *live* without having to have an ongoing mental battle throughout the entire day.  I know this shouldn't cause me to resent them, but it still does sometimes.  How do I stop this?  I don't want to push people in my life away, especially not because they're happy.  I think it's just because they'll never fully understand what it's like."
45,I need to vent,"Life has been really hard lately.I’ve been so stressed out with school that all I do is have multiple breakdowns every couple hours.I’ve done self harm once but can’t stop thinking about doing it again.I can’t stop thinking about ‘traumatic’ things that have happened to me.I don’t even know if there considered traumatic I just feel so fake when I use that word.I’m questioning my religion which has affected me more then I though it would.The one thing I’m guaranteed was my faith in god and even that is being tested.I say guaranteed because I’m so unsure in the world it scares me just to think 5,10,15 years from now.Corana has been really hard.Social distancing and online school has stopped me from staying ahead of myself and it doesn’t sound bad at all but with hours to waist and is much time to think I can’t stay ahead of my thoughts it’s like a race and I have to be 10 steps ahead of myself or else I collapse in my thoughts.I joke about life and hardship to lessen the serious of it but I’m really fucking struggling.My anxiety is the worst it’s ever been.I just hate this I hate it all,I’m in fucking 8th grade and things get so dramatically worst ever year how much lower can my mental stability go.I’m sure someone will come after me for cussing at 14 but all I can say to that is after years of repressing my feelings cussing is practically the only way I can express my feelings and that’s better then nothing.I just want to be happy,not a insecure emotionally unstable wreck."
46,How to deal with loneliness/boredom,"So for as long as I can remember, boredom and being alone has bothered me. I’m 32, recently divorced... and really trying to figure out how to be happy on my own. I have a 3 year old son, and I love him to death. 

I know the typical advice, get some hobbies, read some books, etc but I still fall into the bad habits of drinking and mindlessly scrolling through social media, looking for some sort of connection. I feel like this has effected my luck with dating tremendously. I’ve had a few unsuccessful relationships, some with pretty toxic people. I feel like these problems are causing issues in other parts of my life as well. I have a decent career, but I’m finding it hard to apply myself for any amount of time. I’ve changed jobs a few times and each time I come in swinging hard, but then have a hard time following through after a year or two. 

I know most of the steps I need to take but it seems like my own laziness/anxiety/stress/depression holds me back. How can I turn over a new leaf and actually be happy?"
47,am i the only one that does this?,"(you don’t have to comment anything i just want to say this...)

it all started in 2018 when i got depression and my memory kept getting worse because of it and in the summer of 2019 i began to think “what if i forget everything?” And then i started to write everything down.... every thought, every youtube video i watched, every interaction with another person just... EVERYTHING... and i haven’t stopped... i don’t like it i think it’s very bad for me, i just want to be normal and not think “oh what if i forget this?” about every little thing.. It’s normal for me at this point... i just do it automatically..... sorry if there’s any mistake in here, english isn’t my native language, also don’t comment mean stuff...."
48,Do you find it hard to accept even simple help?,"I find it hard to accept even the slightest bit of help. 

I accept help from my partner, but if it’s anyone, I say “thank you, I can handle it” because I don’t want to cause inconvenience to others.

Here’s an example...

I’ve physically not been in the right place for the past few days. However, I insist on doing my own dishes even when my MIL offered to do mine.

Am I weird?"
49,I’m losing hope for my future...,"Before anyone wonders or asks, no, I don’t and have never thought about suicide. I’m 15 and a freshman in high school. I personally don’t like to complain about my life because the way is see it, it could be much worse. I am very privileged to be living in such a great and prosperous nation, however, I feel like my own life is absolute shit. Yesterday my parents had to put down my dog whom I had owned for 2 years and loved so much, he was probably the closest and most trustworthy friend I’ve ever had and right now I just don’t know how to feel about his death. I feel like I didn’t do enough to give my dog the live he deserved and I’m so ashamed of myself. Moving away from my dog, I haven’t had a proper friendship with a girl in years meaning that the chances of me getting in a relationship are low as hell currently. I hate seeing everyone around me saying how they have gotten so close to their crush or how they finally went out on their first date, meanwhile I’m over here sitting in bed fully aware that supposedly the best era of my life is flashing before my eyes while others are out there living in a fucking movie. I never leave my house, I only have like 2 friends left and they rarely invite me to stuff so my usual day is spent playing video games or doing homework and I hate it, I don’t like it anymore, I want to go outside and explore, but I have no one to go with or know what to do if I do go outside. I lost a bunch of weight during the summer and then almost immediately gained it all back thanks to online school and AP World not giving me enough time to do my own shit. Oh and on the topic of AP World, the two main passions I had are now dead to me thanks to that annoying ass class. History, which used to be my favorite academic subject, is now dead to me because of how much homework my teacher has bombarded me with and now I’m shit at video games because I haven’t had enough time to play which doesn’t sound like a bad thing but video games are current my only source to fill my melancholy brain with dopamine, and I’m not receiving much dopamine from a 0.3 KD in nearly every COD match I get into, only a higher blood pressure. I have no idea what to do with my future, I don’t what I should study what I should practice if I should go to college or join the military or some shit. I’ve always wanted to join the Marines but I’m afraid that I’ll become that stereotypical Hollywood homeless Marine with PTSD. I also don’t want to go to college because I just don’t feel like it’s my thing, but I’m worried that if I don’t go I’m not gonna get anywhere in life. I’ve lately sacrificed nearly everything for school and even then I feel like I’m not doing good enough. I have a B on every class which doesn’t sound terrible but I feel like with the amount of time I’ve invested, I could definitely be a straight A student. In conclusion, I’m worried about where my life is headed and I need some serious help or advice. If you read all this way, thank you and I’m sorry I had to write an entire chapter of a book to complain about my life lol."
50,Inescapable nostalgia,"(to preface, I'm a 20-something female with aspergers) 

I'm usually a person who doesn't cry at films or music unless it's some seriously emotional stuff. But recently, every time I listen to about 50% of the songs on my playlist, I just start crying - remembering times when I was truly happy. I get that stuff like this happens sometimes to everyone, but it happens at least 10 times an evening when I've got my headphones in, just trying to chill. Is this ""neuro-typical"" and what would you recommend I do? I've only noticed it happening over the last month, never anything this extreme before. (I'm so sorry if any of you have to go through this more intensely, cause I just can't deal with the constant bombardment of the past, no matter how good it was)."
51,I don't know how to help my friend,"Today one of my friends had a talk with us about how everything in there life is changing to fast  and they don't know what to do. They said that it feels like they are weak and that they are having problems with there family. And after hiring what was happening with them I didn't know how to respond all I could say at the time was ""I'm so sorry"" and ""we are here for you"". I don't know what to do and I'm worried about my friend.

Any advice would greatly be appreciated."
52,Too tired to care anymore,"I really want my life to be better, I want to be a better person. I'm just too tired, it's gotten to the point where I don't care anymore. I don't care about getting help it's like I've just accepted that this is the way it is. My relationships are getting worse and I've been drinking a lot more, I don't know anymore, maybe this is it for me, I literally have no hope for thing's getting better."
53,Is an inability to verbalise things a symptom of trauma?,"Hey all, I need some help here.

I'm not gonna go into too many details, but a somewhat close friend of mine has been through their fair share of trauma. Her dad's an abusive alcoholic, in and out of prison, mostly due to repeatedly breaking the restraining order her mum and her have on him. I've seen her have anxiety attacks, I know she sees a therapist etc. She fits the traumatised bill pretty well.

It's worth pointing out that I have very little experience with mental health problems. I'm aware of how lucky I am, but that also means I don't fully understand a lot of it, hence this post.

Anyway, to cut to the chase, myself and this friend of mine both kinda had a thing for each other. It was a mess of situation (still is). She was all over me at a party but the next day was insistent that she didn't like me that way, next party we both get drunk and make out all night, then she says she doesn't want a relationship but doesn't know what she wants. I tell her to take some time to think about it, but after nearly a week she hasn't mentioned it but has become noticeable closer with me at school. I say you know what, the more i think about it the more i just wanna be friends if that's cool, she says yeah, then she's cold with me at school, then she gets drunk at a wedding and messages me to say that she still likes me. This all happened in the span of like, less than a month.

Anyway, the next day she messaged me, saying I've really upset her with the things I've said to her and others, as well as how I've acted. Hand on my heart, I can't name a single thing I've said to her or others that would hurt her, and I thought I'd acted pretty maturely so I asked her to actually like tell me what I've done. She said that she can't verbalise it due to her trauma and would appreciate it if I just took her word for it and apologised. I essentially said that a) it defeats the purpose of an apology if I don't what I've done, and b) that's total bullshit. She's insistent that she can't like vocalise what I've done, but I stand by there's no real way to resolve this besides me knowing what I've done wrong so I can apologise for that if I've legitimately fucked up.

As I've said, I'm far from an expert on mental health and the impacts of trauma, so I just need some help understanding whether my stance on it being a cop-out is correct, or if being unable to tell me what I've done is a legitimate thing.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated because I really want to just sort this out so we can be friends."
54,"I’m having a hard time determining if I’m just obsessed, attention seeking, or actually feeling these things.","This years been rough on me mentally. After months of cycling through different struggles I’ve become fixated with the idea that I’m forcing myself into this. I (16) think I’m just making myself sad, it’s practically all I think about but I don’t feel that deep, gut wrenching sadness anymore. But I’m not numb to emotion. When I’m not thinking about that, I’m thinking about self-harm or how invested I might be in suicide. I have no plans for the latter any time soon, but I think about it so much it’s like I want to get to that point. Same goes with eating, I obsess over starting myself or purging and I can’t ever follow through and it upsets me. I doubt I’m explaining this coherently. I’m likely just forcing myself into all of this. 

Any outside advice or opinions is appreciated. I’ve tried reaching out to my mother but it doesn’t seem like talking to a professional will happen any time soon. I also may not even need one if I am just simply obsessive. It’s just weird I can’t even think anything or have feelings without doubting my own validity."
55,how do you cope with emptiness in a relationship,"so i guess this question is more so towards people who suffer from bpd but if you suffer from chronic emptiness i’d still appreciate the advice. 

the last time i made a post in this subreddit i was calling psychiatrists and contemplating having a second therapist. i’ve been in the middle of an emptiness episode. i don’t really experience emptiness for this long (i think it’s been three weeks) so i guess it’s an episode at this point. for a little bit i felt like it was pointless to keep getting help. i felt like i was going no where with help and no where without it so it didn’t matter if i continued or not. but what do you know two psychiatrists called me back and now i have an appointment in december. and my therapist is seeing more bpd symptoms the more we speak. 

even after that i still didn’t feel like continuing to get help. i was just gonna let my mental health go to shit then pick it back up again. normally i’m very empathetic but because of the chronic emptiness people’s feelings have been going over my head. there’s been a few times where i could have given my fiancée more attention or been more empathetic. i felt like me feeling empty got in the way. i didn’t realize or consider how me not seeing my therapist or my psychiatrist would make my fiancée feel. the best way to put it is i made them worry and feel bad.  things are going in the direction i’ve wanted them to go into so i’m gonna continue with help. 
 
so how do you stay aware of people’s feelings while experiencing chronic emptiness?"

57,Body weight issues.,"I used to be very skinny when I was depressed. This is because I didn't eat very much. My apetite would lower as I got sadder, and the increase in sadness didn't seem to stop so as you would imagine, I got really skinny. After taking medication and being much better than where I was mentally, I am also eating a lot more. Like A LOT a lot more. That combined with quarentine has gotten my body up a lot of pounds. I am not obese, just overweight, but it still makes me upset. I feel disgusting and the extra weight certainly doesn't help my lonliness issue. I catch myself thinking sometimes, is it worth it to go back to being depressed? I mean, I had better grades because nothing except homework made me feel anything, and I was skinny because I never ate. It just feels like I was more productive and good-looking back then. I just feel really dissapointed and even a bit angry with myself."
58,Worried about seeing a friend after a panic attack,"My best friend accidentally triggered me to have a PTSD panic attack yesterday. we were hanging out and talking and I complimented her on her makeup and outfit and she got a little defensive about it, not in a mean way or anything it's just she had been in that outfit and makeup all day and thought she was looking like trash and called me out on just trying to flatter her and she wasn't in the mood for it, again not in any kind of mean way or anything she'd just had a rough day and deals with her own self image issues. She apologised and stuff and was nice to me about it but unfortunately she'd managed to bring up memories about my abusive Ex without realising it (she doesn't know about my ex) and I had to excuse myself from the call and had a panic attack on my stairs for about 30 minutes.

Now the issue is I'm not sure I can face her. I am terrified of  f\*cking up again and upsetting her and I can't shake the feeling that she would be better off without me around, I feel like I don't deserve to be her friend anymore and just running away despite knowing that's probably not a good idea and it's just going to lead to more pain for me and I am worried if I do talk to her again I'm gonna be stuck in my own head scrutinising everything I do and say, be on edge the whole time and not be fun to be around.

I don't want to lose my friend but I'm scared I will"

60,How can I make college work for me having bipolar type 2 and ADHD?,"I (21F) struggle severely with school, not that the material is hard, I’m very smart but even on medication and in therapy it is so difficult for me. I have this pattern where I enroll in college and it either goes two ways... a wave of mania hits which means I’m starting 4 new projects at home I will never finish and I’m looking to impulsively move to another state (some may understand that), or the worse depression hits and it’s always so bad for me. On top of all that I have ADHD which I’m not taking medication for and I work 40 hours a week. I put in a lot of effort into getting my mental health stable. I feel pathetic because this is my 4th time enrolling and I can never get it right then end up having failed/dropped classes on my transcript. This semester is the worst though because even though I’m in a depression I still had some drive to do my work and was on the right path UNTIL my paranoid schizophrenic mother turns on me thinking I’m out to get her and kicks me out (also takes all my clothes and shoes) then I move three different times across the valley with my dog and car have trouble finding a place to live or at least stay..now I’m so behind on my classes like 7 past due assignments per class.. 28 missing assignments and finals are in two weeks. Do I have a chance? What resources are available to help me that I might not know about? I’m in the United States az. Feeling so much and not at all. 
Thank you"
61,Not comfortable taking this medication,"I used to take it \~6 years ago. It affected me much differently back then because I had been younger, not going through medical issues including menopause, and I had been drinking heavily still.  


I don't like how it takes away my urges to set fires. That seems like a GOOD thing, but believe me, it is NOT. I am not going to explain why because I will get downvoted to fucking hell and nobody gives a flying fuck anyhow how I feel...just that I am not setting fires and being a ""danger"" to society. Yeah. I was NEVER that. I wasn't wildly going around burning buildings and shit. I was burning paper and boxes up in the woods by the railroad tracks, away from people and even vegetation and animals (there was none of that where I used to go). So fuck that. I am not changing the biggest part of myself--a part that has been with me since I was actually not even in elementary school (Kindergarten starts at 5 years old here). ANYhow...this medication makes me a LOT less anxious but a LOT more depressed because that part of me is missing. I don't expect y'all to understand...or care. Just venting I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took it again tonight because I do want to give it a ""fair shake"". I will see how it makes me feel tomorrow and I will determine if I want to keep taking it or leave a note for my psych this week (I go to the Counseling Center on Wed and Thurs) that this medicine is just not effective anymore.  


I wonder what specifically has changed in me that has rendered it ineffective. Is it physical change? Mental change (I have accepted and embraced in a way that part of me that has loved fire all my life)? Or...I don't know. Thoughts?   


I am going to bed. I am feeling more like myself (until this pill kicks in again)...and it is a welcome relief knowing that I can go back to how I am used to feeling once it wears off. At least the urge to self-harm is not so strong tonight. Whatever. That is one I don't mind getting rid of."
62,My sister tried to kill herself and I don't know what the fuck to do,"This is my throw away account, I don't want my  Reddit friends finding out because so far only some people know. my brother and younger sister wont know until they wake up, but I have to talk about it somewhere.I found out about 15 minutes ago, she had tried to slit her wrist and kill herself. I don't know why the fuck she did it.  The only reason I would understand is that she's going through stress in college and wanted to end it but she has a boyfriend and a pet and a family that loves her i don't know why she did this. She's the only one home, we all left her home to do schoolwork because dad had a dentist appointment in another town.   I don't know what to say to her I tried talking on the phone and all I did was breath. I could think of a million things to say but they couldn't come out. I didn't even cry I just started shaking, mom and dad  probably think I'm too fucking young too understand what's going on here.  It's 2 in the morning, I don't know if I can sleep or not. this came completely out of nowhere by the way. She's the last person I'd expect to do this in my family. I can't imagine why she'd even think to do this . I wanna tell someone but I don't think I'm allowed so I'm doing it anonymously, at the same time I don't even know how anunomous this is or if I should be posting this on the internet.

64,Is it possible to manifest symptoms?," Can you manifest symptoms by worrying and thinking about it?

I've been having a lot of mental issues, like memory. I've been researching my symptoms, and the results always had some relation to dementia(my doctors disqualified it by doing a single, simple test, and was confused at the time one, but passed anyways), which gave greater confusion towards me, causing me to research more.

Yesterday, I forgot about a person entirely, who I knew for 3 months, even though I heard her name, and saw her face. I didn't even think about my problems or the symptoms and was pretty much calm for the whole time until that happened.

I don't really think I have dementia, probably b12 deficiency or thyroid issues, and I'm getting a blood test Monday.

I'm wondering if it's possible I have manifested it, by focusing on it too much, and if yes, if it takes a while to heal from it."

66,What does it mean if I constantly fluctuate between neutrality and wanting to die?,"Throwaway account because I don’t want anyone who knows me to connect this with me.

It seems like since the last two months I’m going back and forth between burying myself under the covers and wishing I was dead to just living life as normal. 

For more details, it’s like I’ll get in this mood where I’m certain I haven’t and never will contribute to society in a meaningful way, and I’m nothing but a burden for the people around me. And I have these thoughts where I wish I had a terminal illness, or better yet, wish I never have existed to begin with. It’s detrimental to my grades, because I’ll just lock myself in my room and forget about classes and work and then end up having to turn in a bunch of late assignments.

But then I’ll wake up the next day, log into my classes, do my homework and late work, watch some TV or scroll through social media, and just cringe at my previous negative thoughts. It’s not that I’m in a good mood or anything, just neutral. But then the negative thoughts come back and the cycle repeats itself again. I just don’t get it, I’ve never felt like this before. What’s wrong with me?"

68,"“I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.”","I’m really going through a tough time, mentally, and don’t know where to turn. It’s 100% mental. Outside of my head everything is basically fine, but I feel like my brain is getting worse.

I’ve been thinking about seeking out a therapist, but I don’t know what that would be like. Knowing me, I’ll be too skeptical and too quiet for it to even be effective. I also have to consider cost of going..

Do y’all have any experience going to a therapist? How do I even shop for one that may be a good fit for me?

Sorry I don’t want throw this junk at internet strangers like some weirdo, but I’m way too quiet about how I feel IRL, so I really don’t talk about this stuff at all. I know if I shut up eventually the wave will subside and it’ll be ok again, but these feelings always come back and I feel like it needs to be addressed.

69,So I went hiking today...,"I live right outside of a decent hiking trail out here in the desert. It’s a mountain about 600ft high and it’s about a 4 mile hike. On my way back down, I’m smoking a blunt, as a usually do, and a guy in a truck pulls up. He asks me if I’m smoking a blunt, I say yes, then I offer him a hit. He hits the blunt and immediately starts letting out all of the negative things in his life. Apparently he is going through a divorce, his wife is hiring investigators to watch him, he’s losing the battle to have custody of his son, etc etc. I felt bad for the dude and he seemed decent enough so I stayed there and tried to talk to him. After a few minutes he breaks down how his wife and him are swingers and she loves to get fucked by trannies...and all kinds of hilariously fucked up shit. Apparently he has already spent over $35,000 for his divorce and it isn’t finalized yet. Idk, this was the last thing I expected on my hike. This guy insisted on giving me a ride and he wanted to smoke me out. I declined because that’s too weird for me but I told him I’m out there hiking all the time and if he sees me, I’ll smoke him out because I always have weed on me when I hike. With all of that being said, his problems made me feel a bit better about my problems lol. Plus, it gave me a good laugh."
70,Is my bf an addict or bipolar? Both?,"Hi everyone. 

I have been dating my Bf for 6 months so far. When I met him he was a great guy, great conversations, instant attraction. He was unemployed because of covid 19 but got back on his feet quickly and was working 3 jobs at one point and worked his way up to a job in telemarketing with good pay. 

Only issue is it seems his mental health has been declining. About 2 months ago he freaked out at me over a person I knew that used to have a crush on me, his car trouble, losing the remote, being just upset etc.... 

I started having increasing trouble waking him up and eventually he lost his job. He sleeps all day and won't wake up till 8 pm etc. But after 4 or 5 days he has energy and is happy as can be etc. 

I also noticed during his really bad moods I see motor skill issues with him. Like, he has no concept of time and can't do anything fast, his driving declines, and he seems slightly distracted. 

He admitted to me having a small pill problem years ago but not doing drugs. He tested positive for speed, meth, cocain etc at his psychiatrist. He swore to me and the doctor that he bought Xanex off the street and didn't think he was investing that. 

His next drug test his levels went down and he would continue his meds with the doctor. He also agreed to take another home drug test with me. But, he leaves for sometimes 2 or 3 hours at a time an I'm suspicious. He stated he leaves when hes in a mood as not to hurt me. His mother vouched that he wasn't a drug addict but did have a problem years ago. 

We agreed that he would get Baker acted himself and he kept holding it off. Eventually I woke him up to go and he was in a sedated like sleep. Me and my roommate and her bf had to walk him to the car and he kept throwing up. He admitted to being scared and cried and freaked out with anxiety while waiting aswell as fall asleep. 

The psych doctor that baker acted him said he is most likely having a reaction to the subutex after long term use. I'm on the fence but my roommate and her boyfriend want him gone and won't give him a chance with the baker act. Am I also wrong to want to wait for the urine test before calling him a drug addict. He was fine 2 months ago. 

My roommate and her boyfriend have made comments about this situation every day. 

I thought maybe I can have my BF move in with his sister until he cleans up his act? 

Am I wrong you still have faith that he can turn this around and get back on his feet? 

Is he bipolar or a drug addict in your opinion? I've just got every person on my back about this."

82,How to let go of someone who ended the friendship with me and be ok with him moving on,"I have a friend who has been my best friend for over a year. About 6 months ago he told me that he liked me but I didnt feel the same. I was too afraid of losing my friend and he was too . So we let this slide. But soon after that he started getting protective and possessive over me . We are polar opposites to begin with and when he couldnt get the response he wants from me , he gets depressed . For over a month now both of us have been feeling the strain of this friendship. 
We also have a third mutual friend who has a crush on my best friend.  She feels that I stand in the way of their happiness. 
Last week he told me that he has decided to end this friendship and he wants me to move on too. He says that it is much healthier for him and me to do that.
I havent since tried to get him out of decision.  I don't want to. I just want to be able to love on from him. But the thought of him being happy with someone else really stings. He also told me that our mutual friend will now be his support system since they are extremely similar and she really takes care of him. 

So I am asking advice on how to move on from this. When ever I think of them being happy I feel extremely sad and guilty for feeling sad . Especially since that mutual friend is my roomate.
How can I make myself feel ok seeing them together?"

Warning TW TW


I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do. The moment I get stressed or have anxiety I go straight to attempting suicide. I don’t know how I’m alive at this point, I’m waiting for the birthdays to pass because I don’t want to kms on someone’s month that’s the only thing holding me back atm. College is hella stressful my counselor said I shouldn’t even be in school but I went because that’s what I thought was best. I can barely hold my shiet but I’ve been surviving so far and now its falling apart again, they told me in order to continue my major (I changed it late) I need pay off my student loan.. how can I pay it off if I don’t work and don’t have support? So I’m planning on dropping out, possibly doing community but at this point killing myself seems ideal. Besides I don’t fit in life or with my family, I’m a literal ghost to everyone. If I die it’ll just be like I never existed which works for me."

And when you’re speaking it all comes out wrong. Or when you’re typing you stare at the text for like 20 minutes saying it over and over again in your head, ultimately deciding to delete it since it didn’t make sense.

But the issue I have is that I forget to do basic things: like drink liquid. Literally, I can go from waking (around 8am) to 2pm before I realise I need to drink. I've done all the alarms before, bought the bottles that have measurements and inspirational quotes (like 'hydrate bitch'), and NADA. I push it off and then once again it's hours before I drink. 

How do I ignore such a basic thing? I literally need it to live. But my mind just has this blackout zone where thirst is supposed to be. 

Recently had blood taken and the woman was so freaked out by how dehydrated I was. 

Anyone else like this, this feels like a really obscure thing as my only advice has been to 'drink more'. Sure Karen, that's my issue, I'm just purposefully not drinking 🤷."
87,Stress,"I have such much stress at the moment that i have ""allergic reactions"" on some parts of my body and heart racings... do you have so tipps how i can handle a situation like this? what are you doing when you are stressed?"
88,My therapist told me to quit wasting his time and that I’d be fortunate if I committed suicide because at least then I would have accomplished something..,"At first I was shocked he said this but then thought, maybe he has a point?"
89,Am i a pathological liar?,"Ive put up a very elaborate front for almost 4 years, sometimes even believing my own delusions and certainly convincing loved ones and health professionals.

I definitely have an anxiety disorder and a disassociation disorder and medication has helped 

Especially with coming out with the truth, though I've experienced panic it was never to the level i said or alluded too.

Ive read a few things and honestly(haha) the symptoms sound scarily similar 

Lmk what you think or if you need more details"
90,A beautiful mind,"So for the past few years I have been battling schizophrenia. I battled it silently for a long time, my family only finding out I had it with a trip to the mental hospital. The thing is I'm better now, a functioning schizophrenic if you will. I just wanted to know if there was anyone else who battled schizophrenia, if so how'd you do it"
91,Dorm living might not be for me,"And I'm stuck here for the next 3 months. I've been here for 2 days and my social phobia is kicking up to a level that's hard to control. 

Today was the worst because I had the whole day to meet people and make friends during the Diwali celebrations happening. Instead? I spent the entire day in my room watching YouTube and doing odd bits of organising. I only left to go to the bathroom or eat, and even then I'd spend a few minutes standing by my door listening to see if I'd be able to make it out without meeting anyone new. 

I wish I knew why I was like this and how to control it more, because it's not like the people here are horrible. In fact everyone I've met so far has been lovely, even the ones I've just smiled at as I walked past. Just gahhhhh I hope it gets better/easier in the next week or so."
92,I need some help please,"sorry if I add a lot of unnecessary stuff in this post I've never written about something like this,

so I've been having an extremely hard time mentally I was pretty happy around march of this year but around June I lost it, I had to confront a group that I used to hang out with that also bullied me, I hang out with two people that were in that group that left with me and helped me confront the group, after that I started just zoning out a lot I have a hard time thinking and paying attention, I just play games all day most the time with the two friends I mentioned but recently the friend that I'm closest to made up with a old friend of his and is hanging out with him and some other people, while I'm fine with that since he's been able to talk to more people I've realized that I put no effort into anything counting the friendship, I will try to put in effort but give up thinking its impossible that I'll just mess up. I'm extremely scared of what I'm feeling sometimes I never know what it is but I'm not very familiar with my emotions, I've begun to just hate myself completely I feel sick a lot I get more emotional over dumb things I feel so sad that I just want to crumble and die, I cant look at myself in a mirror without getting mad I don't try for anything but I still have friends and if I try and stop trying I hate myself even more but I just cant stop, vie driven myself insane I will try to play games or listen to music to help and be at peace which does work sometimes but only ends in me coming back into reality, I think I might just be lazy I don't want to say I have a mental illness because I don't want to make myself another excuse but I just have been feeling so sad and suicidal I don't want to have to live with myself anymore. I don't want people to say don't kys or pity me I wont commit suicide I'm to worried about family and friends,  all I want is for someone to tell me truthfully what you think.

sorry if this was all over the place I just kind of typed whatever came to mind idk if this is the right subreddit I don't really use reddit but thank you if you spent time reading this."
93,I've never felt as worthless.,"Yesterday I just snapped when for the third time this month I was depressed and visibly crying my parents refused to acknowledge the situation. As if I was literally invisible. I got mad at them and walked out, and when I got back home I just refused to talk. Because if I'm the one that's been suffering for years now (keep in mind I went to family therapy with thek for a few of those years) and I have to explain why its not ignore a situation like that again I'm done. It's like asking someone who's house is on fire to keep explaining why it's on fire. And now they are pretending nothing is wrong again. They expect me to go and talk to them and justify myself and tell them what's wrong with me, but it's more what's wrong with them. It makes me feel so incredibly worthless to just never be recognised, and in all honesty I hated myself enough without all this.

Sorry for such a rant post but it was getting too much for my head."
94,Mental seesawing,"As title states. Recently went through some health issues during which two close friends outright told me they couldnt help me, despite it being almost the one time i have explicitly asked for help in years. There were other issues with those friendships, but this was the last straw that made me realise they werent healthy for me. My bf was out of town on an extended sick leave himself (bike accident+a bunch of infectious diseases right after)

I spent a very lonely, stressful and anxious two months during which my bf supported me as much as he could while being out of state. But i suppose I got used to this idea of being completely alone (never been close to family) and on my own.

Now that he's back, I'm glad when he comes to visit but start to get annoyed after he's been around for a couple of days. I still have an acute health anxiety and get episodes where i think i have some serious disease and will die soon. At those times, i'm grateful for his presence and support but once that phase has passed, i go back to being irritated and detached. I dont believe in the idea of ""love"" that is touted by books and movies, that you just ""know when you are in love and when you arent"". I was diagnosed with BPD a couple of years back and i know that my emotions are not always that genuine or cleancut (as i believe nobody else's are, but that's a discussion for another day). 

So what i am hoping for is some insight on how to deal with this situation. I have tried explaining these mood swings to my bf, and he always tries to understand, but i still dont know how to stop them or rationalize them. 

Is it the lockdown as well? The way this pandemic has severely restricted how many emotions we DO feel (mostly i have been feeling anxious, annoyed and suffocated for the past however many months)? Or maybe i should just end this relationship? Though i'd prefer a less drastic step. 

Sorry for the long post, but i tried to use as few words as i could to describe this complicated tangle of emotions i've been experiencing."

98,i feel so terrible.,"when i’m not occupied with daily activities or if i’m a bit tired, sometimes i feel so disassociated and empty, but at the same time like there’s a weight in my chest or my core. it hurts. this is always for no reason. or sometimes a situation or subtle thought starts the feeling, and i don’t recover for hours. but other times i feel happy and fine. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. i read this over and it sounds weird, but i don’t even have the motivation to fix it. i don’t even feel like getting up, maybe i’m just tired. i try to talk to my boyfriend, but the fact he cares just makes me feel like a nuisance. however when i talk to friends it seems like they don’t care at all. i haven’t been diagnosed with anything, i typically lie on doctors sheets about any negative feelings. but they’ve been popping up more often recently. ive only contemplated harmful acts upon myself once, but believe me when i said i’m far too pussy to ever try. wish i could stop existing for a little while, then come back. maybe that’s what sleeps for. i dunno."
99,At a loss of how to be un-busy,"For the past few years I've been really busy and maintained a very unhealthy work-life balance. This only got worse with covid once I started working from home and everything blurred together. I've been really struggling recently with anxiety, stress, and depression. I'm taking steps to get better though, including professional help and medication. I'm also trying to make more time for myself as I'm realizing how negative of an impact my work is having on my life. 

But as I'm creating time for myself, I'm realizing I have no idea what to do with it. It's been years since I've really just sat down and relaxed. Usually my free time is spent socializing, running errands, doing chores, browsing the internet or watching TV until I fall asleep. Beyond that I have no idea what to do or what I even want to do. I used to have lots of hobbies like reading, baking, hiking, gaming, but now...? I feel unmotivated to even start anything. 

The most I'm able to do is mindlessly play Animal Crossing, go for a walk, or call somebody to make the time pass by faster. I know this is absolutely not how it should be. It's like I've gotten so used to working and being busy all the time that I have no idea how not to be. Any suggestions on how to overcome this?"

**Now i know dats not necessarily what normal ppl thrive at. also lost my job in july, dropped uni more so ghosted and have no intention in fixing my petty life rn** 

feel really guilty dat im not trying but thats the thrut 

and honestly its hard to want to do more for myself now that i aint repressing my suicidal thoughts"
101,I don’t know what to do about getting help. Any advice ?,"I’m just struggling with my mental health at the moment. I’m up and down and sometimes I’m fine and for a day or two it’s like it never happened (except for the anxiety). But then I will just get really really down again and guilty and I’ll freak out and sometimes I disconnect from myself and I’ll feel suicidal. 

It’s tricky to get help when you start feeling better so I just haven’t got the help I need. Every time I feel better I just forget about it and think it’s fine but it always comes back. I want therapy or something (I don’t really know what to do) but free therapy (in the uk/nhs) has been so hard to get since the waiting lists are always too long and it just puts me off and I give up. I want to get private therapy but I’m scared to ask my mum to help pay for it and I’m scared she just won’t believe I need it."
102,Self-Venting but I’m at square one,"About once a week I’ll randomly stay up and vent in a document until my hands are tired. I wrote 3 pages of what is wrong with me during a week, it used to help me process, but all it does is stress me out more. The worst part, there is nobody I feel comfortable opening up to.

I’m worried about my family in general, my only friend possibly moving across the country, myself possibly transferring to a new college, and deep stuff about my sporting career that has been mentally exhausting for the last 3 years.

I do not want to open up to my family, I do not want to burden them. We are a close family, but I worry about them enough, this would take it over the edge. My one friend isn’t the emotional type, he’s not very understanding. Lastly, I’m scared to talk to a counselor because I feel like it’ll get elevated to a point of no return.

Any advice for how to deal with this? Self venting used to help, but now it creates more problems, I feel like I need to get these things out...but I have nobody to get them out to."
103,The Time I Went To A Therapist,"As a little disclaimer: I'm not mentally ill to the best of my knowledge, and if I am, I sure can't afford a diagnosis. 

The only reason I went is because said therapist was a friend of the family who agreed to see me for free, and I wanted to go because hey, healthy people can still benefit from therapy, and I have issues I'd love to work through!

A few sessions in, and she told me to stop complaining. 

Like, literally, she said something to the effect of ""Listening to you one would assume you went to war or something"" (I'm paraphrasing because it was in a different language), and told me not to take myself so seriously all the time. Whenever I'd talk about an issue she was more likely than not to just tell me not to worry. 

This was accentuated further by the one time my boyfriend accompanied me to the session - we'd met beforehand and I didn't want to leave him outside, and not to mention I wanted them to meet because at the time I was also looking for a therapist for him. 

We talked more casually that time, and she, right after telling me to relax, turned to him and told him he needs to start taking his issues more seriously. 

So, yeah. You know you're too whiny when even your own therapist tells you to shut the fuck up - especially when it's immediately followed up with her giving actual advice to someone else. 

There was also the time I was talking about not feeling attractive. She asked if I had facial dysmorphia - and, thinking she was maybe asking if I'm diagnosed, I said no. She told me ""don't worry about it then"", and either scoffed, or just repeated the question forcing me to say no every time I brought it up since.

So yeah, two things I learned in therapy - I'm insufferably whiny and I do not have dysmorphia.

Great."
104,Am I the only one who just knows one day I’ll kill myself?,I just know for a fact one day I’m going to snap and end my life. I’m not happy and I don’t think I ever will be. I truly believe all human life is cancer to the earth and I know that one less person is just one less burden on the planet. People will be sad but I don’t think they would be if they truly understood what went on in my head. Some would consider me a nihilist. One day I know that I will kill myself. The only thing I’m afraid of is pain but I have everything I need to go out peacefully. I’m just waiting for the day that something so awful happens that I just can’t take it. I almost can’t wait for that day because everything is fucking dull. I get the same people saying that I have so much to live for and all that basic crap people who don’t understand but want to help say. There’s something deeply wrong inside of my head and I don’t want to medicate. I don’t want to feel the way those meds make you feel. Either I’ll just be normal or I don’t want to deal with it. Does anyone else feel this way here? I always thought that there were a million people who feel the same way I do but I’ve never come across them.

106,Insecurities in friendship and relationship,[deleted]
107,How to better explain to my SO what's happening to me so he can offer me better support throughout panic attacks?,"Quick background: started having nasty symptoms in summer. Several doctors, tests and one ER trip later, no medical cause was found. GP and I both agree based on symptoms that I'm actually experiencing panic attacks. Thery have been getting worse in the last few weeks, seriously interfering with my daily activities. Have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon. 

Explained to my SO (my biggest support) as best as I could what I feel. Although I sometimes manage to reduce the intensity of the episodes, I have no ""off switch"" for the physical symptoms (dizziness, nausea, tremors, headaches etc) but his physical presence and physical contact, helps me feel safe, therefore reducing the severity of the episodes.

I'm having a hard time myself understanding what is happening to me. My SO even more so. I'm having difficulties finding a sort of straightforward way of saying:
[This] is happening to me. Can you please [do this] to help?"
108,Insecurity in relationship,"I'm not really sure if this post fits within this subreddit, keep that in mind.

I  \[20M\] have as long as I can remember had this insecurity of being left  by my friends. I don't really talk with anyone about it, I have just  gotten used to the feeling from time to other. Usually I get this  feeling when I'm by myself and alone, and they are often irrational  thought where I look for signs they gave for them to leave me. I usually  write them down, and when I look at them in retrospect they are often  very irrational, but they always feel very real and it hurts very bad  when I'm in this ""period"". They rarely last more than 24h, and I might  get these thoughts once or twice a week. Sometimes it's worst than  others

2 months ago I got my first  girlfriend and I'm generally very excited whenever I see her, however  we both are busy as students and we mostly see eachother in the  weekends. We have been communicating very well and I've told her about  my ""fear"", and she really wanted me to tell her whenever I got these  thoughts next and at first I felt reassured it would be ""easy"" the next  time. Well, it wasn't. On thursday I was sure she was about to leave me,  and I could barely sleep just imagining a future without her. I did not  manage to tell her, she had a good day and I didn't want to bother her  and i was sure she was about to leave me either way. Whenever these  thought get really bad I've gotten into the habit of SH, becasue it  sorta helps me (Kinda hard to explain how). She knows about this aswell,  and whenever we talk she is really supportive. I saw her again  yesterday, and everything felt at peace again. It felt natural and I was  happy, she seemed happy however I did not bring myself to bring up  thursday.

However  I'm not sure how many of these episodes I'm able to manage. They are  mentally exhausting and I feel broken beyond repair, but I always manage  to stabilize somehow. I'm scared what will happen if I talk to her  while these thoughts are at their worst. I've almost called her to break  up, because I'm convinced she will break up with me but I'm sure I will  regret it, because I really love her.

Sorry  if this post comes up as sort of rambling, but if anyone had any  similar thoughts or experiences; please share. Is there any way I can  communicate ""better"" with her because whenever we are together  everything is great and I don't want to lose her."

115,I live with the devil.,"Hello I’m a 27 years old female from the Middle East. I’ll keep this short and simple. 
I am weak and I admit that. I fear confrontation. Especially with someone who has anger issues and not the kind that you have seen anywhere. It’s in fact so bad that I think I have a heart condition from getting startled regularly by her sudden anger outbreak. In fact any conversation I have with her about literally anything I’m always left with confusion and emotionally disturbed. Her absolute need to be right all the time under any circumstances and judging others religiously is so exhausting. But dare to comment on a flaw about her. All hell break loose. There is a lot more I can say about my mother believe me but...this hole is deep..very deep..but for now I need a solution. I can’t move out right now. I’m about to start my 8 month studies for graphic design and I can’t work. And when I do move out she will disown me because of cultural reasons so my only option is moving to another country for a better job opportunity. My question is..how do you live with the enemy and not be completely mentally damaged? Is there a way to cope? Is there a way to draw a line without having to confront her? What can I do? I need help and I’m desperate."

If I stop and really look back, I think I have always struggled with my mental health a bit. 
I’m starting to think that I may have BPD or some other form of depression. This is probably the first time in my life that I have really looked at myself and how I have acted and thought that I may seriously need help. 
I have been very irritable and angry over what should be not a big deal. I depend on my SO for a lot and if she gets some details wrong I make her feel terrible for it. I have a problem with being jealous of my few friends and feeling like I am being left out. Even if I know I am not intentionally being left out, it kills me inside to see a my friends doing things without me.

117,I’m 13. I’m not sure what to do right now.,"If you want to skip the backstory just scroll down to the final paragraph to see my question.

Today has been one of the worst yet relieving days of my life. My parents found I self harmed because I just so happened to be wearing a short sleeved shirt and the scars are in my arm.

My mother responded quite mad at first because she was disappointed in herself for not saving me sooner and my dad who is a doctor sat me down and we talked through it. My sibling later joined the conversation and we talked and calmed each other, cried many times and had to use three tissues to wipe that stuff up.

After a long conversation they let me go and I promised never to attempt such a thing again and I lied down for a bit (in fact I’m lying in my bed as I type this) to take my mind of off everything that just happened and to rethink my choices. My mother came in later explaining a couple things and chatting with me about any other problems I’m face currently before taking her leave after two hugs, my dad came midway through to explain I’ll be going to a professional for advice.

And I guess that’s where my question begins. I still feel conflicted but I know for sure I won’t be self harming again, I just want a little bit of comfort atm and know what can I do as of now to mentally prepare myself and get better?

120,Can i have some problems later in life from taking MDMA as 15yo,"Hi, i did take 3 pills when i was about 15 yo.  So far (M19) i am ok, but it worryes me a lot. Also i may have HPPD from my bad weed trip which i've had year ago. Since then i have standart HPPD symptoms as Visual snow, tinnitus etc.

I am just worryed if i cant develop something bad."
121,Need some help interpreting what I am going through,"Some background information. I sent this email to a random psychologist in my area about a week ago because I thought I was going crazy. I was freaking out when I wrote it but after re reading it with a calm mind I still feel like it holds some merit. 

He just referred me to some other private practice.


“Recently I have been feeling like I am going absolutely insane, I have ADHD and that tends to make me hyper focus on topics and hobbies that peak my interest. 

A couple months ago, maybe almost 6,  I stumbled across self help videos that were inspired from the theory of self actualization. That video made me realize a lot about how my mind works and I began really digging deep and trying to find my own problems and fixing the ones within my capabilities. The more I have done this, the more I have fixed, the more I understand, the more I realize about myself.

I believe I have paranoid personality disorder and I find it quite ironic from your point of view that I'm saying this as this whole email seems a tad paranoid in nature in hindsight. I identified some weird thought patterns, summarized them into a statement, and then googled it to see if I could find something and I believe PPD seems to match. 

Attached to this email will be a picture of the criteria in the DSM with a colored dot beside each one: Green ( Not a problem ), Yellow ( Things that I only portray sometimes, but have been getting worse) , and Red ( Things that I feel are in me too deep). I also tend to translate my hurt into anger, apparently it's because anger is easier to feel than being in pain/vulnerable which made ALOT of sense to me (Learned from an article). 

I'm worried that I will develop schizophrenia later down the line because I have had traumatic events happen to me in the past and I have been around someone for the past year maybe who is diagnosed schizoaffective and very low functioning. I'm worried that if I have the gene for it,  and the fact that being around the illness that you are already genetically predisposed to, can cause it to trigger.

I have been feeling excessively paranoid the past couple weeks, but I have always been just a bit paranoid. I should really just end the email, I can't explain everything here. Maybe I am just being paranoid. I am a person who STRUGGLES with keeping appointments. I tend to mistrust therapists because giving someone else the power to influence my mind scares me but I am more open to change now than I have ever been. I just don't know what to do. If this isn't your specialty maybe you have a colleague you can refer me to. I just need some professional advice on how to interpret this stuff.”"
122,Anyone else scared to recover?,"TL;DR - Not being depressed means fighting for things and worrying about stuff, easier to just blame things on depression and just stay sad altho not the person I want to be. 


I've been depressed for about 7 years now and before then I was bullied a lot and struggled with things anyway.

I've made some progress lately but also had some big dips. I have more coping mechanisms but then also more suicidal thoughts and more days I can't think about anything else.

I'm very skeptical about therapy at this point, and I'm sick of trying antidepressants, I'm on a third one and it's useless but I'm also fed up of dealing with my useless doctor. I've had great therapy for anxiety but that makes sense to me, therapy for depression just seems pointless when I'm this far gone, you know?

But, I realised something the other day. I'm aware of the part of me that self sabatages. The part that thinks well if _____ happen, it's because of my depression and not my fault. It's like I've given up trying and fighting because it's easier to just blame it on the depression.

I don't want to be depressed but then at the same time I'm not strong enough to fight for things to be better, so it's just easier to stay this way? I know my thoughts are biased because of it and I can't see a future at the moment which makes fighting for it harder, but, I just don't want to be someone that '*wants*' to be sad? I see my normal self sometimes when I have bouts of good moods and I like her, but to be her I know I have to worry about stuff like my health and my hygiene and I have to fight for a job and put myself out there for friends and whatever. Its just too hard, but how am I supposed to get there feeling and thinking like this?

Anyone else feel similar? Or how did you get out of it?"
123,I just wanna know what’s “wrong” with me and get some actual help,"
Ever since I was in my early teenage years I’ve been trying to find out what is “wrong” with me. I remember when I was around 12, I used to answer internet tests on different mental illnesses which always ended with me thinking “I have BPD, I have OCD, I have Autism, etc etc”. During that time I had a therapist, but I think that my searching for what is wrong only ended with no one believing I actually was suffering. But they started an investigation for if I was autistic, but they never finished it. Now, that contact ended pretty quickly because I didn’t like my therapist. Mostly because NO adult in my life believed me. 
Several years later I’ve been diagnosed with Aspergers and ADD, which really felt like a weight lifted off of my shoulders. But I’m still searching you know? A year ago I started going to the psychiatry again. For a long time only meeting a nurse and speaking about everything and nothing. I’m extremely frustrated with feeling like no one ever does anything. No one ever tries to find out what is wrong with me. I got to meet a psychologist who was only to make an evaluation for eventual therapy. Then I got another psychologist who I completely despised. So that ended, and then just nothing again. But eventually I got to start seeing a CBT therapist, at first for my emetophobia, but we changed directions because of a trauma from last year. But I wasn’t ready to talk about that and still haven’t been able to. Then another trauma happened and put me in complete chaos mentally. Which is when they FINALLY let me meet another psychologist for an evaluation for eventual trauma therapy, specifically for psychotherapy. He said that I fit in to the diagnostics for PTSD but didn’t actually do the investigation for it. So no diagnosis. Closely after that they said that I was gonna have to have a diagnosis for them to put me in the queue for psychotherapy. And that I was gonna meet him again for an investigation. Which never happened. This was this summer. Now they say that I’m in the queue. But from my understanding that contact that I’m gonna get is specifically for my trauma last year and this year. But what about the rest of my fkn life that is fkn haunting me? How does one know if something has been a trauma or not. I was emotionally neglected as a child which (what I think) has caused SO MUCH problems in my everyday life in how I work and react etc. Everyone says I have anxiety but no one actually diagnoses it, or depression. No one does anything. “You might have c-ptsd” okay so are you gonna actually do something about it? I feel like all of the years I’ve had contact with the psychiatry has done nothing. No one has ever talked about doing some actual treatment until I was fkn raped. Did I really have to go through that for them to just begin talking about some kind of treatment? I still have all of this other shit. What about that? I’m so fucking frustrated. I’ve always only met low educated people with no experience for my kind of problems even though they know I’m suicidal and what not. Just PLEASE fucking DO SOMETHING."
124,I'm tired all the time. I rarely experience happiness. Is this normal?,[deleted]
125,I leaned on Reddit and got burned.,"Last summer I started live streaming on Reddit and got a bunch of love from some very nice people. So many were supportive and confident in me which is something I am not used to at all. It felt like being intoxicated, great but probably didn’t put me in the best state of mind.

So with the help of some generous viewers I was able to take a big gamble on a job out of state and it did not pay off. In fact it screwed me harder than I was screwed before. I was so embarrassed and defeated. Depression was pushing me to the limit of what my body can take. Then as if to salt the wound I discovered someone from Reddit used my information to fuck me over hard. I’m not going to go into specifics and I honestly don’t know if I should ever even talk to anyone on Reddit again? 

Just by getting the little bit of information I provided on live streams at least one person was able to completely ruin any hopes I had of recovering from this loss. For every ten good people on Reddit there’s one Asshole who’s just out to ruin people’s lives. I feel like I’ve lost the last community I could turn to for help. As quickly as Reddit restored my faith in humanity it was just as quickly torn back down to the bedrock it has rested on for decades. 

It felt good to trust people and talk to them but it seems like no matter what anyone says I’m better off alone and as far from everyone as I can get. I have been betrayed and I don’t know how to trust again."
126,Ex best friend vent,"I had a best friend this year. Our friendship was toxic and I’ll be the first of us to admit that it was toxic on both sides. I will admit I did make some jokes that I thought were light hearted, even though she took it personally after looking back at it. But she won’t admit she did. She would always call me toxic and that the friendship was all about me and one sided.

She would always bring me down and made me feel ugly. She had called me the girl from the movie that had the pig nose and to try to soften it she said ‘she’s pretty though’... and this was probably early-mid last year. That still gets to me to this day and hurts and makes me self conscious. She would always cut my opinions down and tell me they are invalid instead of letting me have my own opinion. She even tore down my coping mechanism, which she knew nothing about and didn’t know I do it (it’s age regression. I regress into a younger age to cope with depression, anxiety and stress). She called it disgusting and that they need to grow up. She would let her other friend call me names to the point where I’d cry in front of them and say ‘he’s just playing around’, even though it hurt me since I’ve been called those exact things in the past. If she looked upset during the day I’d ask her if she is okay, but I’d never get that in return. I ended up going quiet to the end of the friendship because I never felt like I was allowed to speak, and I wish I actually ended the friendship months before.

I would stay up with her at night and try to talk her out of self harm. Yet whenever I came to her about my mental health issues and needing a friend to talk to about it bc I was feeling like self harming she would tell me to stop and that she doesn’t want to hear about it and that mine isn’t that bad. This year my mental health has been extremely bad though. I was put into hospital 3-4 times during January and February due to my anxiety. I started to do part time school because I couldn’t get to school at all due to anxiety and depression, and she hated that. 

My therapist recommended to get her to meet me at the front of the school at recess or lunch when I turn up so it’s easier for me to walk into the school, but my friend refused to do that. Yet I’d wait for her if she was running late etc. 

She then ended the friendship. With a massive paragraph about how I’m toxic and it’s one sided and all about me. But the thing is she’s done that to multiple other people she was friends with. 

This is the first time I’m coming out about this because it is hurting my mental health still months after. I also am scared to type this on Reddit because she has shit talked me on Reddit before... as well as I believe she’s shit talked me in real life to people I were trying to make friends with since they now seem to always try to avoid me, even though my ex friend never even liked them. I know she’s talked about me to them as they told me when our friendship first ended. She’s done it all to ruin my life at school.. I now have no friends at school. I’m mutual with a few people but that’s it. No matter how hard i try they just keep avoiding me.

I wish I ended the friendship months before instead of acting like I was happy in it..

Edit: I don’t know if I added this in here already, but she also blamed me for her self harming again. Something that she’s in control of, was apparently my fault"
127,"I don’t have energy to do anything, even hobbies feel like work. I suffer from it greatly and don’t know what to do","I’m 25 yo woman. I’ve been going to therapy for 2 years. 

Thanks to it I found a job and started to go to the university to learn psychology (in a form of combined studies quite popular in Ukraine, where i am from. It means you visit the uni 2 times a year for several weeks to learn and pass the tests and study yourself all other time). I’m in the first year. I also do gestalt therapy training, which is once in 2 months.

The problem is I am a very lazy person. Even the hobbies feel like a chore to me, I have no energy to do them. Same with my studies. I already have my Bachelor and Masters degree and I kinda didn’t make great effort to study hard. I was very motives that THIS TIME I will start studying from the day 1, not leaving everything for the last moment... Nah, I left everything for the last moment, even though I understand that I cannot be lucky and just get by with it every time. I do understand that, and I wanted to change it, but... here we are.

I also can’t stand to work in principle. I do all I can, but suffer impostor syndrome, everyone is older than me at work. This is not the first job I have, and each time I work from 9 to 6, come home at 7 and have absolutely no wish to do anything besides laying in bed with my phone. I’ve been like this all my life. I realize the problem is not so much with the jobs, but with me. The job I have is not of my dreams, but it’s good enough, though I feel all the time that I will fail and they will fire me (or I will quit, I did once, but I can’t quit all the time every time I don’t like something),  I don’t have a habit of working and trying. Except until my teens, when I didn’t have any responsibilities and swallowed books and knowledge and it gave me a lot of energy.

Now, I feel like I can’t adult properly. Everything feels like a giant annoying chore to make money to spend them on keeping me alive. I feel so bad for this... as for my studies - I’m sure this is what I want to do in life, be a therapist. However, I don’t do a lot for this, because as soon as it becomes a responsibility (prepare for tests, read the books), I just can’t bring myself to study. At all. All I can do is consume some content but producing it (hobbies, therapy knowledge for myself etc) feels unbearably tiring for me. I can literally spend my whole day in bed with my phone. Even reading a book or a magazine is too tiring for me, I just cannot concentrate for longer than 15 minutes. I take my vitamins and overall feel relatively ok, I fell like the problem is psychological. 

I discussed it with my therapist not once, she says its because my fear of failure blocks me and my energy. That geniuine interest in what I do will allow me to be interested in my job,  the hobbies should give me energy and studying should do this as well.

 I agree, but it just doesn’t work for me. That’s why I’m so afraid all the time - it’s supposed to be so inspirational for me, the therapist profession, and this I should feel so motivated and energetic to pursue it, but I just don’t! Which is so confusing, because I’m 100% sure this is what I want. And I feel so jealous seeing my friends or just other people want to change their life and just go for it and it works for them. With some obstacles, of course, but I don’t see the laziness I have.

For example, I used to love to paint in my childhood but now it feels like I will spend energy on painting, and will not have anything left for studies etc, such limited my energy level is and every single activity is perceived as SPENDING it, not producing. Like work, not an enjoyable activity. 

So my question is is anyone else feel this way? I have no idea what to do and how to motivate myself. I tried to press myself to do something, but then I’ll always find excuses or just imply don’t do anything. 

Any advice appreciated, thank you so much. And sorry for the foggyness of my post, this is the first time I write about it and I feel like said to much and too little at the same time

128,"As a rape survivor, I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don’t give up!","Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.

I am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now."

130,Laughing hard turns into uncontrollable sobs?,"This has been happening for years back, at least since I was in high school but more so recently which is why I figured I would seek out answers. Whenever I find something funny, to the point of ‘cry laughing’ I’ll have to cut myself off abruptly or else I’ll start hysterically crying. I can always feel the change in my mood and know when I’m going to start sobbing. It’s like a switch. 
It’s never on particularly bad or good days, it’s random. For example, the other day I showed someone a funny video I came across on Instagram, just a random dog doing something funny so nothing I could relate to in a negative way. (I’ve never had a dog pass.) Afterwards when I brought up the video again I was laughing so hard I couldn’t say my words but I could feel this overwhelming dread feeling accompanying my laughter and the tears started flowing, suddenly my heads under the pillow and I’m holding in my sobs. It usually doesn’t get too bad because I’ll be out in public and I know I’ll have to control my emotions. However once when I was alone I didn’t stop the emotion from overtaking and just let myself sob for a few minutes. Nothing specific is ever going through my head in these moments, I just come across a funny video or post and laugh myself into tears. Again, it only occurs when I find something extremely funny or amusing, never just a simple giggle or anything like that. 
Does anyone know why this may be?"
131,I need someone to talk to please,I made some very dumb and selfish mistakes and now I’m backed into a corner where everything is going to fall apart. I need to talk to someone about this because I don’t know who else to talk to. Please help me. Please
132,"First time posting here. Am I normal? And if not normal, how severe are my issues? Please help.","Sorry it’s quite long, but I hope it’s worth the read. 

I feel normal, but only probably because I have been this way my entire life. 

I am incredibly paranoid. I always think the worst possible thing could happen. When I was younger if my dad was even 10 minutes late getting home from his usual time I would be worried. If it was 30 minutes I would be afraid he was in an accident or something happened. When he eventually came home like he always did I would run and hug him so tight. And even though time after time it was proven to me that he would eventually be home every time he was late I would worry. 
A very prominent memory to build on my childhood paranoia is one time at, while vacationing at Disney World, my mom got separated from the rest of the family. I immediately started crying, I was about 8, and I remember I was so afraid she had been kidnapped. Later she got back with our group of course. 
Also as a child, if my dad was late to pick me up from school past a certain time I got scared that he once again got into an accident or something terrible happened at home preventing him from picking me up. 
To this day I get paranoid about everything. If I make a mistake at work, big or small, I’m always afraid I will be fired for it. I worry that when a car is behind me for too many turns that they’re following me. I worry that when a friend doesn’t respond to my texts that they don’t care about me or I annoy them. I worry that when someone texts me out of the blue after a long time that they have an ulterior motive besides just catching up. I worry about everything everyday. When COVID began I convinced myself I was going to die: that it would be the end. When my leg has muscle pains for a long period of time I’m afraid that it will become chronic and the pain will never go away. I get scared when I get phone calls from random numbers, hell I even get paranoid when my sister calls or when she doesn’t answer my call. I fear that soemthing bad has happened. 

These paranoid thoughts are crippling. I won’t be fully aware at work. I will take sleeping pills to just escape the fears. I will research things to find answers or reassurance to my fears. I hate it. But to me it’s normal because it’s been this way my entire life. I don’t know anything other than this constant paranoia and resorting to the worst possible thing. 

I also have issues with change. Not as much, but whenever something changes in my life, even for the better, the first few weeks of the change I am very depressed and very sad and want to go back. For instance I just got a new job in the healthcare field. Quite a step up from working at Target and a pay boost. And even though I was so excited to leave, once I left I was sad. Very depressed. Even considered going back for a bit. I’m better now, but there’s that. 

I also do have a history of depression. Some suicidal thoughts. I’ve made plans in the past, but never acted upon them. These days not as much, but once in a while I will relapse. 

The bottom line is this.. I guess I already know I’m not totally normal, but how severe is this? Is my situation kinda common or am I a dire case?

Thank you for any and all feedback."
133,How can I stop ignoring my messages when they feel like so much work to open?,"basically like the title said, I have recently gotten horrible at responding to messages because they just feel like way too much mental energy to open. it was never this bad, but over the last month or so my responses have gone from every couple hours to days. I feel bad leaving people on delivered because I know I get upset when people do it to me, and I’m worried I’m going to start losing people in my life. Has anyone else dealt with this? how do I respond to texts or call people back or do anything social without feeling like it’s too much work? thank you :)"
134,I feel so hopeless,"I know I'm probably not the only one who's going through this but I'd like to share my thoughts anyway. Sometimes it's hard to accept that I'll never see my family again. My parents are very racist and abusive, especially my mother. They also are against me being m to f trans, while my brother and sister follow suit with their opinions. I had to cut ties with them towards the beginning of the year, for my mental health and my safety. I currently live my girlfriend with her and her mom, but I have nothing else. If we're to break up, I'll be homeless. I feel like I'm a leech because she probably feels too much pity for me to break up with me. I have nothing, no education or money, no job because of covid. And whenever me and her argue, I'm scared. I feel like the biggest burden in the world. I also have borderline personality disorder, which makes things even harder. I don't have any money or insurance for therapy to help treat it, and I don't expect other people to be my therapist, so I just feel hopeless. I don't know what's gonna happen to me, it's so scary. I don't have any other friends to rely on, so I wonder why I keep going, struggling on my own while trying not to drag others down."

136,It seems like it works: I had a painful thought this morning. I sat with it and let it pass through then I was relieved. How do I do the same with all the other thoughts that I have similar? I am depressed and I have many of them.,"

I usually have thoughts and replace quickly to numb the pain. I tell myself a different story so I wont have to deal with the negative thoughts, well, it only keeps looping instead of just passing. So today this morning I had a painful thought. I decided to sit for a minute and let it go through. I felt it and sat with it. Then it passed. I am not sure if it will no longer pain when it will revisit but I felt a little relief when it passed gracefully. 

How do I maintain or improve? I am not naive nor delusional. I want to feel those thoughts so they wont hurt anymore?"
137,"Can eating disorders start out small, then escalate?","I struggle with anxiety pretty bad. My job is incredibly stressful, and I probably need to be medicated for it, but the medical insurance doesn’t kick in until a few more weeks. So I can’t see a doctor at the moment.

A way to calm myself on my breaks I usually get some comfort food. I’ll order something not so healthy from the grill, or just get a cookie or something.

I don’t gorge myself, if I can’t finish the meal, then I won’t force myself to. I try to be healthy for the most part, the food I bring with me is mostly vegetables. Lentils or black beans mixed in with minced cauliflower is my go to. (I get three breaks, and one free meal from the kitchen a day)

I’m not obese, so I didn’t think much about it, but then my brain just wondered how eating disorders start in the first place. Can they go unnoticed for awhile until it’s really bad? If this is a habit I need to break, what should I do about my anxiety until I can see a professional for in the meantime?"

Even when my grades are dropping a fuck ton, they fail to learn their lesson. Constantly harassing me, threatening violence, pushing me to the brink of assaulting them. I tried to ask them to stop being cunts and be supportive, when I actually do something, they still ignore me. 

All I've ever wanted are loving parents, but they've always been neglecting my mental health. I fucking hate it. They think I'm just lazy, but I genuinely just have no feelings, I'm completely apathetic. I have no motivation at all. They fail to realise how important of a role they should be playing in my life, yet they are shitty role models, and generally shitty people."

Moreover to sharing this video, please watch this if you think you may have BPD. I was told by a nurse that he thought I had it, told by a therapist that it’s rarer than schizophrenia and it’s dumb to believe I had it if one person thinks I had it. I got curious and looked it up and found this gem.

I can’t put this into words how happy and how understood I feel. I have to share this with people and hopefully I’ll help someone before something goes wrong in their life due to their misunderstanding of themselves and their mental health.

150,Waves of overwhelming nausea from thinking that I'm developing covid? Being bulimic isn't something I can use anymore to cope.,"Basically: I don't know how to feel less scared about getting covid. I don't know how to challenge my thoughts about it because the threat is so real to me.

Hi everyone

3 weeks ago my flatmate developed covid and I sort of had a nervous breakdown. Like I was crying randomly on the street, felt like throwing up often. Went for a walk to calm down and go on the swings but the walk felt unreal to me? Like I was high or something and then I felt extremely fatigued from swinging for a minute and generally unwell that I was worried I wouldn't be able to make it home. These were all potential symptoms of covid so once it started I think my anxiety/fear spiralled 

Since then I've been getting waves of nausea and dizziness and it it's kind of debilitating :/ going outside is now too scary for me. I'm also bulimic and stopped purging once we got the positive result. Maybe that's why I'm getting these symptoms? Like I don't have that old coping mechanism anymore so it's manifesting in these feelings and it scares me so much because I start to think the illness is starting whenever I feel nauseous/like vomitting."

And even severe problems like me having pretty severe underweight (BMI around 15) get treated like just a minor problem. Honestly, I want to be able to feel happy for other reasons than empathy, which is rare in itself, but with parents more dense than osmium and me being too shy to upfront tell them, everything just keeps getting worse. Can someone give me tips on how to make them realize that something is wrong?"
152,"My friend deals with panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety , panic attacks and self harm. How can I help her?",What can I do when she gets a panic attack? I really want to help but I don’t know what to do. And when she talks about mental illness with me and my friends their and my response is often “we have our own problems to deal with” I have since then realized how harmful it is to say that. What can I say instead or should I just listen?
153,Affection from anyone other than a significant other makes me uncomfortable,"Title basically says it all. I'll tolerate some affection from a friend, but I absolutely hate getting affection from a family member. Whenever my parent or sibling gets close or shows love, I feel uncomfortable and move away, and sometimes I'll even feel disgusted. I've also been told by friends that whenever they hug me, I push them off (something I wasn't aware I did).

However, with my significant other it's a complete 180°. I crave their physical contact and need to be constantly touching that person in some way. It's comforting and makes me feel safe and warm. Hearing my significant other tell me that they love and care for me is like music to my ears.

I'm wondering if anyone feels the same way and/or if anyone can give their take as to why it is I might feel this way. I've tried looking online but don't find anything related. :)"

156,Speak Up About Mental Health,"Hello again, everyone! 

How are you doing today? 

It’s funny, the people who you least expect to be suffering are the ones that suffer the most. But, do they show any signs of it in person? Absolutely not. They would rather keep it to themselves, not make any fuss about it and suffer in silence instead. Behind every smiling face, there is sadness. But, we’re able to change that. People will show strength and hold themselves together to the point that they will not show any signs of weakness in-front of others. We all have weaknesses, triggers and something that brings us down to the point that our heart beats quicker, we start to worry more and the anxiety levels shoots up. Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we allow ourselves to suffer by not talking to others about the problems that makes us worry, fear and overthink? 

When *you* believe that your thinking is getting darker by the day, it’s time to talk. Don’t allow your mind and thoughts to be taken over by a dark cloud, it will bring you down to the point that you wouldn’t want to leave the bed, eat some food, go and see friends, communicate with family members or even get some fresh air. Keeping everything to yourself is a dangerous game to play and it’s unnecessary. When you fully believe that your anxiety levels have risen, your Mental Health is deteriorating and your mood is constantly swinging from good to bad, speak up to someone. Don’t worry, there are many people who you can speak to about your health, such as...

- Family
- Friends
- Your GP
- Samaritans
- Therapist
- Psychiatrist
- Psychiatric Nurse

Before you get your issues and problems out in the open, there are ways you can make it a little easier for yourself... 

- If you’re afraid to talking face-to-face to someone, write them a letter or a card and throw all your feelings and emotions in it.
- Start journalism.
- Practise speaking to yourself in front of the mirror, as if you’re talking to a family member or a close friend. 
- Repeat to yourself that you’re not alone and there’s always help out there. 

Everyday when you don’t speak up about your Mental Health, it’s another day wasted of not receiving the right and deserved treatment that you need. If you’ve been feeling down for 6 months-a year, I believe it’s the perfect time to get everything out in the open. Otherwise, things will start to get a lot worse. Speak up about how you’re truly feeling inside, what’s going through your mind, how your mood swings and how you have 0 motivation for anything. Believe me, you’re cared for, your health matters, **YOU** matter and you’re loved. Don’t ever think there’s is nobody out there for you, because there is. We will always listen to you, we will show you the best support and we’ll get through this together, as a team. 

Speak up and out loud as possible. Let *them* know how you’re feeling, we want to hear from you. 

We care and love you."

160,Can’t stop thinking about my abusive step dad growing up.,"Not technically a step dad, he was my moms boyfriend. But I cannot stop thinking about him, he was an alcoholic, jealous, disgusting person. He would keep me up at all hours of the night, yelling at my mom, yelling at me... I had to put up with him for 8 years of my childhood, that is - age 7 until around 15 or so. Well anyway, my brother died - I had a dvd his best friend converted from VHS at the time I was around 10, this dvd had videos my brother recorded home videos and stuff, my moms bf broke it in front of me and laughed in my face, a year before this I got a game boy for my birthday from my grandfather and he tormented me and I got really mad, he grabbed a hammer and got in my face a yelled at me, told me to break it over and over and I ended up smashing it and crying. Another time, he threw away my scooter and skateboard , because I was frustrated about homework. Guy was a prick and a fucking cunt. I’m 26 now and I see parts of his personality coming out in me.

161,Loneliness,"I am only 16, still in school, yet I feel a crippling loneliness. It seems every time I seem to start something, a friendship, they always leave me. I have had one serious relationship with someone, they were very mentally unstable and it was a toxic relationship. I fear this has given me commitment issues, even just with friendships. I have not lived with my mother and father for many years now, and am very emotionally detached from my family. Even old friends feel fake, always talking about me behind my back, never inviting me to anything. I just wish I had someone, someone to talk to, about anything. Reddit has been nice, feels like I can make friendships, but everything is temporary it seems."
162,i dont know what is going on with me,"Im not sure if this is the right subreddit for my problem, but I can definately say that I am not the same mentally as I was a month ago but here is some context:

I am currently studying at my university and I have not been home in about 3 months. The only source of social interaction I have really is when I go to the gym. Here is some background...There has been this girl that I have always seen at the gym and I  think I lowkey like her or something (ive never been in a relationship so I dont know what this feeling is). I try to go to the gym at the same time as here so I can see her and stuff. This past week, I finally had the guts to break the ice and we've had some conversations and stuff for the past week, and I guess we can be considered ""friends"". But heres my problem, every time I finish my interaction and I come back to my appt, I have these constant regrets of how I talked to her and how I interacted with her. I question everything that I do, and I see everything that I do as negative. I feel that I always leave a negative mark on my image and that I am just flat out annoying her. Another thing that is going on with me, is I have gotten extremely emotional, especially when thinking about her. I have never felt like this for any situation but I get emotional even when I think of her... and we havent dated/broken up or anything.I also have noticed that I am getting emotional for things that are not really related to her at all either...like I am getting teary eyed writing this very sentence.  I just dont know what is going on with me...I go to the gym 2x a day, I go for walks in an effort to clear my mind and try to focus on other things but shes still clogging my mind. I have dreamt of her multiple time, I've rehearesed fake conversations in the shower and as much as I hate to admit it, I've cried thinking of her when listening to certain types of music.

Basically, I get extremely emotional thinking of her.. basically on the bridge of crying, nervous talking to her, and regretful of almost every single interaction I have with her. I feel that I am nothing, and I feel that I am just a lonely piece of trash that has never known what love is and I am just a negative person.

any insight/advice on this would be appreciated. please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for this situation that I am in. thanks."

178,The forbidden phrase,"It's all in your head. 

Oof

That's triggering. 

But when you look up from your phone, see how everything around you is doing just fine and is at peace, while you are internally at war, one must conclude it is true.

Now I'm not saying this to judge. I've been struggling with my mental health for pretty much my entire life, and with generalized anxiety disorder (meaning literally 24/7 anxiety) for the last 6 years. 

But I'm beginning to get out of it. I'm experiencing happiness again, and I'm no longer seeing the anxiety that does come up as my mortal enemy. 

The change started to happen when I accepted the fact that it literally IS all in my head. Now that's a forbidden thing to say these days, as it can trigger people suffering from mental health issues. But in reality, if we keep pampering to mental health issues as if they somehow spontaneously arise from a combination of genetics, environmental factors, whatever explanation you want to give, IT WON'T CHANGE. 

Because how can it change when you're unwilling to admit it's all in your head? If you say ""it's not all in my head"", then how can YOU ever make a change? Then you might as well not even TRY to change it, because it's not in your head anyways, so trying to change it is pointless. 

Why do we feel fear? Why do we feel anxiety? Why do we feel depression? 

Emotions are there to alert you of something. Anxiety, fear, depression, they're no different in that regard. But they can become so omnipresent in your life that they've seemingly lost any causality to anything happening both within and without you. But there's always a reason, otherwise you wouldn't be feeling it. 

Speaking from my experience, I was so often anxious that anxiety itself had become a trigger for my anxiety. Now that's a vicious cycle and a tough nut to crack. So how to crack it? 

Awareness! 

The natural instinct when an unpleasant emotion arises is to wish it goes away. But just like how it's impossible to not think of that which you don't want to think of, wishing an emotion goes away only increases its potency. 

Ideally you want to be in a place of awareness without preference or judgment. If you can find that space of awareness within yourself that simply OBSERVES the emotions and thoughts, you will find that the awareness itself doesn't actually have a preference for any particular emotion or thought, it is fine with anything. It is quite literally peace itself. 

And what happens when you become aware of the stillness of awareness itself, you can start to disentangle your identity from your mental health issues. Because the truth is, YOU are not your anxiety, depression, thoughts, whatever. YOU are simply that consciousness that observes it all. 

And as you raise your awareness, you will find that negative thoughts and emotions, once you become aware of the whole drama playing out inside your head, naturally tend to subside. Because nobody who is AWARE of what is causing their suffering would choose to continue doing it. So the only conclusion is, suffering is caused by lack of awareness, and the way out is increasing your awareness. 

If this makes even the slightest sense to you, I recommend you read for example a book like ""the power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. He talks about these things in a very clear way and helped me a lot. And once you get started on that journey of awareness, the rest will unfold itself. 

If this only triggers you, that's also okay, I do wish you all the best and hope you can all find happiness one way or another."
179,Boyfriend believed he hit me for over a year,"I just found out that my boyfriend believed that he had hit me. However this never happened. He said he thought we had gotten into a massive fight and he had raised his hand at me. He also believed that we had fought for over a month over this. he's never mentioned this before today. He's never even yelled at me before. I'm super concerned that he's fabricated a major event. He doesn't have any history of mental illness, except some minor depression. He's almost 22.

183,I think my boyfriend does not know where his mental illness ends and his personality starts,"Hi, I hope this is appropriate here.

I have been with my significant other (26m) for half a year now. Before we got together, he told me that he was diagnosed with a mental illness (I don't know his exact diagnosis, I think he is not comfortable telling me), he is in therapy and he takes medication. Soon after we started dating his therapist terminated their relationship and recommended an in-patient program for him, which he did not want. Ever since, he hasn't gone back to therapy.

I have my own experience with mental health issues, am diagnosed myself with an anxiety disorder and a panic disorder, was in therapy for 2 years and am on medication, and doing fine. So I know how it is, I am patient with him, but recently I've been losing it. 

W often fight about the same thing, where his recollection of things is far removed from reality.   
For example, when I leave a room while doing a task, like putting away groceries to wash my hands, he is pissed off immediately and asks why I am leaving when I am not done. When I am annoyed by that, he does not think that what he said was aggressive when it clearly was. And this happens constantly.   
Another example is that he often thinks he told me things, when in fact he hasn't, and then gets mad at me for not knowing the things he hasn't told me.

Today he accused me of wanting to change him and he told me he won't. But I don't want to change him, I have never said I want him to change, I just react pissed to situations such as above. Since I also have been in therapy, I think his behavior would improve if he went back and stuck to it.   
I am in no way a professional, but could I be right with the assumption that he does not know that this behavior has more to do with his mental ilness than with his personality? Should I just move on or should I try talking to him about it?"
184,Wellbutrin has been doing me so well,"I'm from Canada.

I'm only 150mg XL. Started about four months ago. I started noticing the differences slowly. I started following my health routines more reliably. My number of depressive/nonfunctional and fatigue episodes are down.

Make no mistake, I still have really shitty days. In fact I've had one really shitty day each week for the past little while.

But as a whole, I am doing so much better right now. I have better self-control. I bounce back from down points faster.

Most importantly, I feel like I can finally focus my anger and resentment about my situation in life towards fixing it, instead of just shutting me down.

I think my doctor originally prescribed it because I was really unhappy about the sexual side effects of SSRIs. Honestly, that hasn't gotten better, but I feel like Wellbutrin is the first anti-depressant I've tried that isn't screwing up my brain.

My doctor doesn't want to put me up to 300mg because she's afraid of me going ""manic"". But maybe I fucking need to be a little manic. Maybe that's what I'm missing in my life. Cuz straight constant depression is not where it's at, at all.

I have a med referral with a local hospital coming up real soon. They're gonna try to push me onto an SSRI, but I'm going to bring this up.

This is just my review. This is just me trying to focus on the bright side of things despite the shit that's going on in my life lately."

187,I am recently seperated and rushed into another relationship. It ended too. I feel sadness in my voice. I feel like my vocal cords are strangled.,"January this year, I (29M) told my wife (27F) that I am unhappy and I want to end things. I felt so sick right away and hyperventilated. Emergency service had to come to calm me down.

Six years of marriage. I told her we would work on it. Late August I moved out and ended things saying that my decision was clear. We never communicated well and that was our demise. In the last year I had so much resentment. Even though it felt really bad, I was relieved and felt happy right after. My ex is seeking for help now as well since she finally decided to deal with her anxiety issues.

I spontaneously met someone that I knew on the street in early October and we went on a date. Then she said yes and we decided to give it a try. (I told her my whole story and she was understanding). It was going to be a long distance thing since we live 3 hours apart and we kinda knew that we won't have a lot of time since we both have to study.

This new ""relationship"" was stressful for both of us. She said she is coming to visit me. I thought its going to be a date and she broke up.

I just feel sad since then and my voice is different. My vocal cords somehow hurt.

I have a lot to learn about life and how to pull my life alone. I think being alone makes me afraid for some reason and that's why it hurts now.

I am alone in Germany with no family at all. My family is supporting me through my decisions and in constant contact. My aim now is to finish my studies and the future after that scares me because I don't know whether to stay here in Germany. I really like people here though, so I haven't decided yet."
188,My cousin can't play tag,"I have a 5 year old cousin. She is smart and shy and a good kid in general, but the nurses of the kindergarten said that she doesn't want to catch other kids in tag. 

She says that she doesn't like to get caught and she doesn't want to make other kids upset by catching them. Another reason is: she doesn't think she is fast enough to outrun other kids, so she doesn't even try. 

For me it seems weird, this is not the way of thinking of an average child, she should run and fight and catch others. At least she should enjoy tag but she can't. She has friends in the kindergarten, but she is able to play alone for hours, she always has long lines of toy animals in her room in a strict order, and the first one takes one step forward and the second and the third... According to her mom she can play this forever. 

Her family is worried about her, do you have an idea why is she like that? I know the second thing I mentioned can be a sympthom of being on the Autism spectrum, but what about the tag thing, do you guys have an idea? She is not diagnosed with anything though."
189,Does anyone else feel burnt out?,"I’m in high school and I have been buried with class work, extra curricular activities, and a small commission job I have to do for a scholarship. Ever since school started, I started to forget when work begins and resting starts. Often there’s a fine line separating the two. I feel like every day I wake up tired, look at a screen for 8 hours, then continue to look at the screen for 2+ hours to do the homework assigned for the day. And on top of that I have tennis practice and scholarship work to do. I stay up till midnight just to wake up and to do the EXACT same thing over again. I’m losing motivation to try. My school even has something called a “wellness Wednesday” to give students a break from the screen, but it’s very contradictory since teachers assign double the work anyways. Therefore, I struggle to find time for self care.

Anyways, that was my little rant, I would keep going on and on but I don’t want to bore you. What have you guys done to “spice up life” again. I used to wake up everyday and be excited for the possible things I could do in a daylight’s time, but now I seem to just want to lay down and catch up on sleep.

Like you did this cuz of x or y and that’s why I hurt you. Instead it’s not that I offended them, it’s not that they were trying to be mean. It’s that they literally didn’t care how it affected me as a person. My existence didn’t matter even though I spent night and day worrying about if their heart was still beating. If they felt pretty, if they felt loved and it’s not just relationships. Friendships the reason she was such a big part of my life at all was cuz people I thought were my family didn’t care if I lived or died and I spent everyday with them and it felt like the same thing just romantic three years later. It’s not that they hated me it’s that they didn’t care. I was just there and easily replaced. I just I’m easy to replace and that’s harder than being hated."

I did that because I tend to push myself really hard and work really hard. But everyday I spend between 10-12 hours at my desk studying and working on school and college applications. I do that 6 times a week. It’s definitely taking a toll on my mental health. I went from being confident on getting into certain good schools to not expecting to get accepted. I don’t have to energy to do anything after I’m done with my school day, and everyday just feel a little worse than the last. I’m usually a very disciplined kid but now even things like homework just feel dreadful. My grades are worse than they every have been and although they aren’t bad. They’re bad for me. 

I feel like I’m burning out but I can’t just stop i have a whole school year ahead of me and I still have to finish my essays for college. And I don’t know when i won’t be virtual so I have to plan on staying that way. If anyone has advice on how to just keep going I’m all ears and would appreciate any help."
198,Is this normal,"Ive found myself not being happy for 2 - 3 months now, yes i do still have moments of happiness but only for 10 minutes max, other than that im just unmotivated, but not ""sad"" just blank and tired.
My grades are falling and my entire life is built upon a fake persona.
Is this something i need to deal woth or is it just a edgy teen phase?

199,Advice?,"Hi friends. TW: depression, mental health, mention of a possible ED/weight loss, anxiety. (I tried not to give specifics.) Please take care of yourself!

I'm coming here to see if anyone has some ideas (or support!) on how to handle this situation. Many thanks to those who read everything; this has been an ongoing struggle for a long time now. Sorry it's long! The most important part is towards the end.

Before I start, I do want to emphasize that there are so many great things in my life, and I am very privileged in life. I am very thankful to be where I am, and I hope this post doesn't come off as complaining. My friends are my family, and I am on track to becoming a doctor, which has been my dream for years now!

&amp;#x200B;

I went online in March (for school), and college first semester is online as well. Meaning I've been home a large majority of the time since March.

**Background:**

Ever since I was little, whenever I would do something wrong (like I forgot to do something my mother asked, or I said things she didn't like), my mother would generally ignore me until the next day. I thought it was pretty commonplace/normal until one of my friends told me it wasn't. I'm an only child, and no pets as my mother is allergic.

As I grew up, my mother was very controlling of my life. She always claimed it was to keep me healthy (I have had a plethora of medical problems over the years: immunocompromised, surgeries, appointments, etc.) and yeah, I understood that. I got sick all the time, and movie theaters probably weren't the best place to go for a sick 10 year old. She always apologized, and I could tell she felt bad, but she was always joking ""well, now you're stuck with us!"". My escape was dance, where I got to go a couple of times a week and just have fun, get some exercise, etc. 

The more I grew up, the more I got to go out with friends, but then she took control of my life. She wouldn't let me go out with friends until x amount of homework was completed (I had straight A's), saying that ""school comes first. School is the most important thing."" And the thing was, I believed her. I wrote essays at 2am in the ER, studied for my math test in the car driving to an out-of-state appointment, etc. I didn't go out on the weekends because of homework (I did have an excessive amount, as I was able to attend a private school). I never really got breaks. As soon as I sat down in the doctor's waiting room, my mom would ask ""What do you want to start on first?"". I would ask to go out, and I wouldn't get a response, I would get, ""How much homework do you have? Is it all done? Do YOU think it's a good idea to go out?"" or the other lovely, ""Hm...I'll have to think about it,"" in which 3 days would pass with no mention of an answer, until I brought it up again and made her mad.

In 6th grade, my first year of middle school, she thought it was a good idea to take a year off from dance to heal an overuse knee injury (that was already healed) and allow more time for the homework load that was sure to be increased now that I was in middle school. My only escape was gone, and I was constantly denied breaks, etc., and my mind went into overload, and it was a very bad year for me mentally. I was officially diagnosed (because the school required me to) with clinical depression in 2014. I was never told there was an official diagnosis; I just found the paper in my medical records less than a few weeks ago when we were packing boxes to move. On the paper with the diagnosis were appointments for therapy, which had the word canceled next to them in pen (meaning it was written in after they were scheduled). There was also documentation of me being on an antidepressant, but with that a note saying ""melatonin was making me depressed"" (I know that it can). So, I was somehow diagnosed with depression, but nothing was ever done to help me (and still hasn't).

This continued throughout high school, with complete control of my studies under my mother. She would ask me every single time before I went to dance, ""Are you sure you have enough time to go to dance tonight? Do you think that's a good idea, given the amount of homework you have?"" While I completely and totally understand that parents want their children to learn how to make good decisions and learn to prioritize, at some points I just wanted to see my friends and get a break from the stress. If I went when she didn't want me to, she would get upset with me.

During my sophomore year, I gained around 30 pounds from a medical problem. Concerned, she took me to a doctor at the end of the school year, where they diagnosed me with Pseudo-Cushing's (and said I was Pre-Diabetic due to PCOS). I got on medicine, and I started to lose some of the weight.

But there were comments. For fear of triggering, I'm going to refrain from saying them. By the summer before senior year, I had lost around 40 or 45 pounds. Nothing was done about it. Since I don't have an official diagnosis, I cannot say I have an ED. However, my friends have all said that if they were doctors, they would say I did. But I digress. Even after the weight loss, the comments still came. And then she started making comments about her own weight.

At the end of my junior year, my grandmother (who was essentially the mother figure I always wanted, she was the purest and kindest soul who would hide Kit Kats under my pillow at her house because my mother wouldn't buy them for me) had a heart attack. During my entire senior year, she was in and out of the hospital with heart problems, meaning my mother was out of town helping her.

She tried to exert more control over me from afar. I have recordings on my phone of her asking, ""Do you still love me?"" or ""I feel like you don't love me anymore"". I even have one of her threatening to withhold my medicine if I didn't stop eating sugars. (She also believed the one medicine was the reason for my loss of appetite and that I needed to be taken off of it, despite the fact that doctors said I needed it, but that's a different story.) It was a very bad time for me mentally, but my friends helped me as best they could. \*They're really the best friends imaginable, I can't say enough amazing words about them.\* 

We lost my grandmother in February, and that was one of the worst moments of my life. I had lost the only person who was on my side and fought for me. My mother refuses therapy to help her deal, saying the lake behind our house is ""therapy enough"". Yes, it's definitely soothing, but I would imagine actual therapy would be helpful? 

**Now:**

Now to the good part. About a month and a half ago, I discovered my mother was having an affair. With a pastor. The pastor that said prayers in the hospital where my grandmother was. She doesn't know I know. I've been taking pictures of their conversation (when safe to do so) before she can delete it, as she deletes the messages constantly. Although, every day, I can hear her typing (she keeps her ringer on, and since people call her, she says she has to so she doesn't miss an important message). As far as I'm aware, I don't think my dad knows. He's kinda scared of her anyways, never stands up to her, tells her things said in confidence, etc., but he's such a sweet guy and a great dad. He's given me strong support over the years, and honestly so has my mom. She's done a lot for me, and they have both sacrificed a lot to get me to where I am.

However, with this news, and being home since March, I've asked if I could go see a therapist for anxiety—and my depression that I ""don't know about""—but the response every time is, ""Well my elbow's been hurting for weeks now, and I haven't gone to the doctor for that!"" or ""You can always talk to me!"". My friends think it's because she's scared of what I would tell the therapist. But I'm really struggling. And I would really like to find out if I have general anxiety, an official ED, or anything else, since I don't want to self-diagnose, but I can't get to the doctor to find out. Therefore, I can't get help.

Some quick little notes: I'm not allowed to get a job, even though I want to (my mother says school comes first, and they'll pay for what I need). Therefore, I don't have my own money. My parents check the credit card statement regularly. I'm not allowed out of the house anymore during the week, since I'm too distracted from school (my grades are A's in college, Pre-Med), and I can't go out on the weekends with my friends that are still here (safely, of course) until x amount of work is done. She made me come home early to do chemistry last night when I was with my friends after not leaving my house for 6 days.

When I was upset the other day, I tried to talk to her and tell her how stressed I was about doing school 24/7 like she did when she was in college. Her response was, ""I don't ever get to go out"".

My college can only offer therapy to in-state students (I'm out of state), and even then, my parents elected to keep me on our own insurance plan. My mother also made me sign HIPAA when I turned 18, so she has access to everything.

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it this far, thank you! Honestly, that felt nice to get off my chest. My friends are doing everything they can to help, but they're not therapists/required to be my built-in therapists. They have their own things going on, and I don't want to add to that.

Does anyone have any thoughts about what to do? My parents cannot find out regardless, especially since they're a major source of the problem. Thoughts? (Or words of encouragement, I'll take those!)

&amp;#x200B;

Please stay safe and healthy, everyone. My best wishes to all:)"
200,I've lost all motivation,"Recently I lost my part time job cause of covid, now I realize that job was the only thing giving me any motivation to do anything. I'm now failing 2 classes cause I literally cannot come up with the energy or motivation to do my work. I havent left my room in the past week besides to eat and go to the bathroom and do my chores. I used to do a writing series on this account that I want to pick back up but I just can find the motivation to do so. I dont know whats wrong with me or how to fix it. My parents are on my ass about my grades, anyone know any tips that could help?"
201,Why do I even bother anymore,[deleted]
202,I made an app to improve your mental health through conversation.,"Hello, I've actually been working on this for a while - here's my last post (the first post I made is the only one that really got any interest): [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hz0x2x/do\_you\_need\_someone\_to\_talk\_to\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hz0x2x/do_you_need_someone_to_talk_to_update/)

But I'm basically done now. For some background I made it because I, along with a bunch of people on this sub, want to talk about our problems but not with anyone we know irl. If you post on this sub it's almost definitely going to get ignored because like 90% of the posts are ignored.

Why is my app different? First off it's a chat and its completely anonymous - no usernames or anything. Also, every time you create a chat another user gets notified that someone created a chat to hopefully make it easier to get responses.

There's also a part of the app where you can swipe through cards/conversations and join someone's conversation and talk to them to help them out.

It's only a beta right now so you have to download it using these links to the app store if you're interested, please check it out if you think it would be helpful or let me know why you don't think it'll be helpful if you don't think it would be.

iphone Link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/nA3mcuim](https://testflight.apple.com/join/nA3mcuim)

note: to run on iphone you need to download testflight which is a beta testing app made by apple.

Android link: [https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4699409169792572868](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4699409169792572868)

edit: the android link is an internal test right now, if you are really interested in it you can dm me your email and I can add you to the beta. Also, you can just wait a day or two and I'll have an open beta running and will make an update post. Sorry.... first time app developer issues... - I'm gonna try and make a new beta post next Sunday at 5pm and  I'll make a quick demo video as well so hopefully it'll be easier to see how to use the app to your benefit

Thanks!

Disclaimer: this is my first time making an app like this so sorry if there's lots of bugs or problems that might come up :)"
203,Idk this is me I guess,"This is both a question and venting at the same time so sorry if it's a hard to read. I'm very aware most of you aren't psychologists or anything but if you would like to share your thoughts please do so.

So anyway I've always had this thing and sometimes it scares me. Like sometimes I feel like I'm not myself and I'm just like a spectator watching someone control me (picture abit like get out). That's in extreme cases btw. Sometimes I have weird mood swings, like I'll go from my normal positive self, to a angry pissed off at everything self etc. This behaviour led to me trying to make a joke from it and said I have split personality, to brake the tension and things.

Another thing is I get depressed sometimes but sometimes when I should feel sad I just feel empty. And I noticed often times after I hurt someone in some way I just feel a lack of empty or sympathy. I'll say sorry but I don't mean it if that makes sense. 
Additionally, I often lack the will to do anything. 

Some bonus things about me
I like to have things in a certain way, some changes or actions done in a certain way annoy me and I get a bit irratated I guess is the right word to say.

I'm often positive-Well as much as I can be

I also had anger issues when I was younger 

Well this is me. :/"
204,is it worth asking my therapist abt personality disorders,"im 15f and frequently manipulate, but feel remorse when doing so. i match all of the symptoms of avoidant, but i also match the nine symptoms of borderline. ive been clinically diagnosed w major depressive disorder, and anorexia nervosa, and have a little childhood trauma. i match all of the symptoms of anti social personality disorder except for the lack of remorse and empathy, and the grandiose self esteem. 

does this sound concerning???"
205,Is self diagnosis appropriate in this situation?,"i was diagnosed by multiple professionals while i was in inpatient treatment, ( Residential to be exact where they monitored me for months. ) with shizoaffective. my outpatient team refuses to diagnose me with anything other than depression and anxiety, and my mom lies about my symptoms to my doctor ( shes a narcissist. ) which makes it hard to get the help i need, but besides that my team just doesnt ""see it"". can i self diagnose? i feel like it fits and im almost 18, meaning i can just find a doctor and my own team then, or just find ways to manage without medicine i guess."
206,Confused about sexual identity. Pls help.,"Im a 24y old female, and I can say for sure that ive never been into women. So i always thought i was straight. Ive never had a a boyfriend before /never dated.and never seriously liked anyone /fallen in love. Whenever i think of prospective relationships in my future , i envision it fairytale , movie style. I know relationships need effort, compromise and I'm not sure after giving it all I'll be any more happier than I am now. Im always happiest when im alone. I barely have 2-3 friemds . Talking in terms of sexual atraction/preference, i like men. But neither am interested in casual sex nor serious relationship as of now. Am i asexual , aromantic or straight with commitment issues ? Any help appreciated."
207,Not too sure if this is just normal or whatever,"I grew up and was bullied a lot. Later in life I started realising that I was surfing (?) from a massive lack of self confidence and everything kinda stemmed from that. 

Recently however I’ve been feeling very self conscious but to the point where I visualise myself doing something I cringe at the thought of it and have to block it out. I get how it is probs jusy my lack of self confidence but then I also get confused because I’m quite often described as confident just when I think of how I look specificly I’m like not for me thanks 

I have a slight feeling this lockdown has kinda exasserbated it but I’m not too sure."
208,Should I ask to work from home due to lexapro withdrawal?,"This will sound pretty stupid but I went to up my lexapro last Monday and it turns out they sent it to another state, so I was going to have call there and get it released. Well I waited until Sunday, today, to do that. That was after I realized today I was starting to go through withdrawal symptoms. 

I had already been going through trouble sleeping and a lower appetite, and my anxiety and obsessive thinking was starting to go back up (ocd). Today though I was getting chills all day, was manic/obsessively thinking about one topic for 2 hours, pacing the house and talking to myself unable to shift my focus. Later in the afternoon I started getting brain zaps for a little while (now gone but they could definitely come back) and the anxiety kept up. I felt like was my on a wire all afternoon and felt super lethargic at the same time, much more than usual. Usually I’m pretty energetic. I’m having trouble concentrating too, and I’m feeling the beginnings of hopelessness and depression deep in.

None of this has reached bad levels yet but I can’t get my meds until tomorrow morning, half an hour until after I’m supposed to start my one hour commute, and I’m at this point where I kind of want to work from home or take a sick day because this stuff may be worse tomorrow. My boss is actually very understanding of mental health and all (I’ve even posted that) and she’s worked/been home three days in the last two weeks (her commute is also further than mine).

I kind of want to work from home tomorrow or take a sick day but the thought has me feeling silly, ridiculous and kind of guilty because it’s no that relatively bad yet..."
209,Does growing up make it harder to think?,"Bit of background information, I (21M) grew up homeschooled, smarter than almost everyone I've met (the education was really good, 10/10 would recommend). I used to be really good at logic puzzles, rubik's cubes, etc. My thought processes were logical and well defined.

However these days, I am struggling to get 40 minutes into a lecture. I can barely soak up information and whatever is retained is mostly useless. I can barely concentrate on a task without getting distracted by something, which I will either do straight away, or just stare into space, leaving the original task unfinished and forgotten. My thought processes are no longer linear and well defined. The best description would be similar to a cloud of electrons around an atom, they are going around at really fast speeds but you can never catch hold of a useful one. My solutions to problems have become mediocre and I am constantly getting frustrated at myself for  finding solutions that are not optimal.

Recently, I have been getting complaints at work that my shift changeover is messy, and not a lot has been done (I am a manager at a fast food restaurant). While this is true and I am inexperienced in a few areas (I am only just getting through training), I am constantly failing to identify the optimal strategy that will get my jobs done on time. 

Personally, I believe that my mental health would be much worse if I had not disciplined my mind so well in my childhood. I used to love being alone with my thoughts, organising them, analyzing them, etc. But now whenever I am alone, there is usually nothing (which drives me to boredom and usually back to reddit).

Now days I have trouble remembering people's names (I've always struggled a little bit, but some of my favourite co-workers names I forgot multiple times when I went out with them the other night).

That seems to be all, if I remember anything that I missed I'll edit it in."
210,I don't trust anyone,"What do i do if i need professional help gor my depression but i don't trust anyone, not my parents not my family or my teachers"
211,Streaming 600hours for the depressed and isolated Dec2020 Jan2021.,"Hey everyone I am a working editor and I am going for a world record 600 hrs streamed in a month, December 2020 to January 2021 to support those suffering from mental health issues especially during COVID which is extra isolating I have to do 20 hours a day on camera to beat record. I am doing it to bring awareness that the depressed have no voice in this world. With social media being as big of influence on the population as it is on our mental health, more needs to be done. Gaming, filmmaking tutorials, immersive audio visual experiences, music reactions, cooking etc. will take place during the marathon stream. Im probably live while you read this! 24/7 irl stream commencing early 2021 and I am dedicating all my streams to those with no voice. Today I am doing no speaking for 24 hours. A vow of silence since you have no voice, I have no voice. I was once suicidal, once depressed(still struggle some days). I hear you all, I know what it feels like. The world doesn't understand.

212,Can anyone tell me if this is normal?,"Hi. So I’ve been struggling for a while now, and I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with me, and trying to figure out if it’s normal. I feel like I go through these phases, where I just feel so depressed and anxious, that I just start feel like a shell of myself. Everything just hurts, and I just wanna lay and bed and sleep cause that seems to be the only way to get away from it for a while, and that feels like the only thing I’m capable of doing. I don’t wanna be around anyone. And I guess the thing that I’m really struggling with, and trying to figure out is like I’ll have weeks where I’ll feel like this, and then I’ll have days like today where everything feels fine. And I feel like none of the pain that I felt before is real, it just doesn’t feel valid. And my brain starts convincing me that it wasn’t real, that I’m just tricking myself into feeling like shit. I don’t know what to do. Is this normal?"
213,Never sad,[deleted]
214,I’m on the verge of suicide. I’m sorry.,"It is an alt account but can give my main or secondary if you prefer. 

(15m) Diagnosed with Severe anxiety, depression, ADHD, PTSD, and suspected autism (waiting for results to come back).

I’m just gonna say, my mum doesn’t know i’m suicidle. 
We sat down to watch a tv show together, and as always, i can never sit still. I need to move like every 10 mins and when i’m around people, even my family, i get anxious all of the time. My mum doesn’t know how bad it really is. She just thinks that i can’t focus and i’m hyper and she says “everyone has ADHD, you just have it more.” We proceeded to get into a small 2 minute argument because i went to go upsfairs because i had the urge to move. She proceeded to call me (sorry if this offends anyone, i’m really sorry) a weirdo, retard, crazy and a dickhead. Now these are probably ok to use insults for most but what she doesn’t know is that i have stopped myself from ending it 3 times in 2 weeks because of her. I’m crying alot rn. 

I have been hiding my emotions for 4-5years now. I can’t take it anymore. I’m gonna end my life tonight or probably tomorow after school. It’s a monday. Everyone hates mondays. It would make more sense. 

Also, life doesn’t get better. I have gave it chances. I have seen people. I am on medication. 

I might include a suicide note soon. I just need to think of shit. I’m sorry."
215,Never sad,"Why don’t I get sad, Every since I can remember( in my 20s now), I don’t ever get sad. I don’t get sad when people die, regardless of who they are or how close they are to me. Breakups regardless of how long we are together don’t make me sad. I’ve done lots of farm work and have had to put down my horse and dog, not sad. Got diagnosed with a hella rare disease, not sad. I can go in forever, I just don’t get sad, why?"
216,Laid off School Counsellor....Twitch?,"Hello.

This might be a long shot, but here it goes!

So I have been a school counsellor for a year, and due to Covid, I have recently been laid off. I have always been interested in Twitch as a form of entertainment (watching video games etc.). And with all this free time, I want to bring my general excitement of communication, mental health. and just trying to be entertaining to twitch.

A little about me... I am diagnosed with ADHD, and have recently became sober, almost 1 year! I have spent most of my career in some form of counselling position, and have a University education. I absolutely love being a School Counsellor, it has been able to teach me so much! My time spent now is hanging out with my newly adopted dog (Loki), cooking, fitness, and learning to produce music! I recently purchased some production equipment, which I will probably bring into the streams a bit!

During my stream I want to share personal stories, learn personal stories, give advice, and just talk. We are facing some very tough times, and I have recently became to value Time as a currency more then ever! As previously mentioned I will also stream some of myself learning how to make music, and hopefully inspire some people to start new hobbies where ever they can. I will mostly be in the Just Chatting, Music, and Talks Shows &amp; Podcasts for now. I will might stream some gaming if I ever get the PS5.. lol..

I am going to aim to stream about 4-5 days a week for now. 12:00pm CST or possibly 7:00pm CST (still figuring it out)

If you want, send me a personal message on here and let me know if you are interested in something like this or maybe you are not, and thats cool. Any advice or tips are always welcome as well.

217,Everything feels better now,"I don't know that happened, just last month I had mental breakdowns everyday because of stress but now its finally better
At the beginning of october I started writing what I think about when I'm alone in the notes app, and the titles alone say it all
(1) ""Depressing thoughts at 4am"" - 500 words talking about my struggles with depression
(2) ""Depressing thoughts at 2am"" - 300 words, talking about why I thought other people hate me
(3) ""Its weird"" - less then 50 words, my girlfriend fell asleep on me and this is the first time I thought that this might not be so bad
(4) ""[no title]"" - text just says 'I love her'
(5) ""I feel good"" - wrote this today, text just say 'This is nice'

Everything will turn out for the better in your life, if not now, then maybe later, I'd suggest doing stuff you like, if it's going outside with friends or staying inside and just watching the rain fall, both of those stuff helped me when I felt depressed, maybe it can help you too"
218,How do I get over the compulsion to start something on a particular date?,"I’ve been doing a lot of soul-searching lately and have a lot of changes I want to begin working on. The usual stuff like eating better, exercising, having a routine, going to therapy. But I feel immobilized because I feel like I have to wait for the new year.

Obviously I know that I shouldn’t think like that, and I should just make myself feel okay about starting now. Especially because I’m stressed about the interim month and a half and how to fill that time and the self-hatred building up in me by the day for ignoring those things I want to change about myself.

I’ve been like this my whole life. Every change I want to make or new thing I want to start always has to be on a Monday or the first of a month. I literally can’t get it out of my brain no matter how hard I try to just force it to go away.

A big problem right now in particular is that I plan on using my bullet journal to keep track of the changes I want to make along with journaling and some other mental health activities. I find it really effective for me but I absolutely cannot let go of the idea of getting a new journal for the new year and having it all organized the way it is in my head.

Any advice is appreciated. I want so badly to let go of this compulsion but nothing I do will make it go away. I want to change my life now, I want to start feeling better now. But everything in my stupid reptile brain is screaming at me that I have to wait."

With it being Trans Awareness Week I feel it's a great time to share a life update! I came out pretty abruptly this summer and things got exceptionally cranked up in August when my parents reacted exactly as I expected. It really lit a fire under me. I couldn't file for a legal name change fast enough and I feel I have absolutely stripped off the shackles that kept me as a fraction of myself for my entire life. I have since been working incredibly hard at advocating for trans rights in quite a few situations and so far I am pretty proud about myself. I've found most of my time over the past few months on r/Twitter. I don't have r/Facebook or r/Instagramaccounts for example and I ended up in the middle of a ... [rather serious project](https://twitter.com/energy106fm/status/1299527429485203456).

Ultimately, I've got three goals I'd like to accomplish as part of my journey. My first goal is based on my belief that we are long overdue for visible r/trans inclusivity in r/sports, and by that I mean have dialogue present regarding rules, policies, divisions, insurance and so on explaining that divisions are based on r/gender identity &amp; expression, not biological sex. That said, I am aware of the fluidity of that statement and understand there are times where in the interest of competitiveness or player safety physiological factors need to be considered, especially at elite-level play or in sports where weight classes matter. Overall though, there is no reason otherwise why trans r/athletes should be prevented from or discriminated against competing in a division that is in line with their preferred gender identity and/or expression.

[I've got a thread that I'm using](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1317475890691928065) to keep some awareness up particularly relating to Sport Manitoba (while it also was [a retweet throwing a bit of shade](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1298790120447852545) to a local radio station hiring [a known transphobic radio host](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-wheeler-trans-comments-1.4749616) who [has been endorsed by a member of our queer community](https://twitter.com/ctvwinnipeg/status/1298775987761553413) and insists they will continue to be [one of the strongest media allies to the LGBTQ community in Winnipeg](https://i.imgur.com/3mRIcuj.jpg). \*sorrywhat.gif\*

I'll get back to the radio station in a bit. That thread also dropped [a note to Slo-Pitch National regarding their rules](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1316459613038886912) and of where trans athletes are to fall in with their verbiage. I'm happy to report that unlike the [bureaucratic approach I feel I received from Sport Manitoba](https://i.imgur.com/SuNDvfq.jpg), Slo-Pitch National was almost [immediately engaged after a few tweet attempts went their way](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1319835275351085056). I had an absolutely wonderful conversation with Trish and I strongly believe we will be having more follow-up conversations about how to implement things effectively, assertively, competitively and in a way that prevents abuse.

If I can help encourage programs to start having more visible acknowledgement of trans athletes and having inclusive dialogue and programming in their systems, that will do nothing but benefit one of the core obstacles about trans people in general: awareness. That verbiage can introduce conversations earlier, end controversies sooner, offer courage and support to trans people from children to adults that they have a welcoming place to belong, provide an improved fundamental understanding that people are different and to open minds and hearts about it, and even to improve demographics so that better social, medical, educational, and r/mentalhealth services can become available.

My second goal, as a matter of fact, is to at least be put in consideration for the [Order of Manitoba](https://www.manitobalg.ca/awards/order-of-manitoba/). I never thought about it before but I remember coming across it at some point and thought, ""Screw this. I'm earning it."" The Order of Manitoba was established to recognize individuals who have demonstrated excellence and achievement in any field of endeavour benefiting in an outstanding manner the social, cultural or economic well-being of r/Manitoba and its residents. I feel that if I continue to work as hard as I can to break barriers, raise awareness and continue to denounce injustice against not only r/transgender Manitobans but transgender people as a whole, the least I could hope for is to be thought of when it's time to think of who helps make Manitoba be a better place. Personally, I've suffered a walled-up life for pretty much 39 years and if I can do my part to ensure that no person has to feel like they need to be anyone but their authentic and best selves, I will pull out every stop that I am able to because unless you're trans, you simply don't get what it's like.

A rather surreal experience that reminded me that I'm on course to my goal lately was having conversation with the national director of the Run for Women! It started after I pinned [a note](https://i.imgur.com/cJEisYc.jpg) on my Twitter profile which eventually led to an amazing response and a subsequent Zoom session with Ted and Stephanie. Hearing the interest, recognition, and commitment to make the Run for Women a more welcoming and inclusive event for all r/women was exciting, and being asked to be kept in touch with during the progress has felt immensely meaningful.

I feel I have really taken advocacy for trans rights seriously ever since I came out and that leads to my third goal that I currently have. I feel I am on a path of creating a legacy and I can only hope that one day people will hear my name and immediately recognize my effort to raise awareness and help normalize the belonging of trans people in a predominantly cisnormative world. Sometimes it feels petty but I would absolutely love to get verified by Twitter at some point because of that. As much as blue isn't my favourite colour, I feel it would look great beside [my name](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst). I feel it's a great way to suggest that I know what I'm doing and I'm not taking any of this lightly at all.

When I came out as abruptly as I did, it was with the full intention to raise awareness and educate, especially using the element of shock to prompt reflections into the minds of others. I came out right after George Floyd was murdered because our planet was reeling on yet another example that if you're not White and Right, you're fighting for a place to coexist. Minority groups all over the planet, and obviously the Black community at large, were screaming for reforms to improve diversity, r/Equity and r/Inclusion. To eliminate r/racism. To eliminate discrimination. I felt there was no better time to capture that momentum. After I came out, I lost track of the amount of times someone would say that they had no idea, and rightfully so. I began to come out socially on my 39th birthday so for all intents and purposes the only person most people ever knew or recognized was a white, athletic, 39-year-old r/Canadian male. I was as close to the top of the food chain that someone could really get. I bled privilege that I didn't even want because it was nothing but imbued irony because it would almost all be erased if I allowed myself to be vulnerable and authentic.

Becoming vulnerable and authentic is exactly what I chose to do. I didn't do that necessarily because I wanted to, and it certainly wasn't because I was ready to, but I had no choice except that I HAD to. As a person, I am far too strong, far too vocal, far too educated and far too articulated to stay quiet any longer. I know I've got the skillset and r/resilience to help make the world a better place and if anything I feel guilty for not allowing myself to start working on it years earlier. Even as I write about this life update, I think about [a blog post that was written about me](https://spitfiretakesontheworld.blogspot.com/2020/10/what-taylor-should-say-to-energy-106.html?spref=tw) and to this day am so humbled about it. More than ever have I felt like I'm making a difference instead of being a burden and it inspires me to keep pushing forward.

I've alluded to it a couple times already and one of the biggest missions I have been on lately is advocating on the absolute faux pas of a local radio station hiring someone who has [said dehumanizing things about transgender people](https://imgur.com/a/fTBn0CX), [has not shown public atonement for it](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/winnipegs-radio-radical-is-ready-to-wrangle-572233362.html), and then being protected by the radio station while they affirm to be r/LGBTQ\+ allies. One of the biggest reasons I am invested in this is because of the message that is being sent to minority communities across the board: If you are privileged, you are protected. The message that forgiveness is to be expected of the victims instead of earned by the offenders really sums up segregation, discrimination and overall mental unwellness in a nutshell.

Personally, I felt my drive for this situation to really light up after Energy 106 FM posted their ""Official Statement,"" which for the record was Friday, August 28, at 9:00 PM. Only until recently in a meeting I had with [Adam West, their Program Director](https://www.energy106.ca/adam-west/), that they had intention of posting that late largely due to Facebook algorithms. All I really had to reply on that was considering the amount of controversy regarding the release of the message, they could have at least addressed the concern with an explanation instead of perpetually ignoring the call-outs. Another interesting take in that same meeting was that they were waiting for that memo to be vetted by one transgender person, which I learned after asking who the ""numerous meaningful and significant conversations"" involved because I can't imagine a single resource centre in r/Winnipeg that would have given this hire a green light. Regardless, I had no problem [expressing my thoughts about the situation](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1299539266561744897) and since made a decision to keep my eye on it.

One of the reasons why I struggled to feel comfortable coming out was because I wasn't ready to be as loud as I knew I was capable of being. For at least half my life I've felt that people like me needed a warrior to be there for them. I wanted to be that warrior but I simply did not feel like I was capable of the fight. As much as I knew I already was being suffocated, I needed to know I could be there for others. It took me a long time but when I finally found it in me [I have never been more proud to be myself](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1321581036304621568) and to fight for my community. r/Allyship isn't a part-time job. It is like being that warrior I mentioned. It doesn't necessarily mean you're looking for a fight, but you must be ready to go to battle when the time comes. I wasn't ready to fight for myself before. Today, I fight for change.

Twitter certainly was a hotbed after Energy decided to release their ""Official Statement"" affirming their belief that [their hire was the right decision](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/provocative-dj-dave-wheeler-gets-a-new-mic-572220242.html). There were links and stories and updates and advocates and affirmations from all angles, [even on the other side of the ocean](https://twitter.com/Energy106/status/1298689207955869697). After realizing how many stories and concerns there were, I decided to make my path of advocacy easier to follow, literally, and I did that by [creating a thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1305894111925288961) that sourced everything to follow in one place.

One of the biggest obstacles with advocacy is it often means you're fighting from a weaker position, as in, it's not uncommon for change to be made because of necessity instead of r/morality. When it comes to advocating against corporate boondoggling often change would only ultimately be recognized after corporate partners disagree with the decision and decide to withdraw, and [that's where the adventure really began](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1305900918735425536).

It was fantastic and encouraging to see many corporate allies of the LGBTQ+ community to stand in r/Solidarity with us and denounce the decision made by Energy 106 FM, or more specifically, the Evanov Radio Group. During the unrest it was uncovered that Dave Wheeler was [hired with approval of Paul Evanov](https://i.imgur.com/YascAtG.mp4) himself, which he shared during one of his podcast episodes of Wheeler After Dark.

I still have conflicted feelings about that. How does Paul Evanov, who's father Bill developed the [world's first 100% LGBT front-to-back radio station](https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/radio/cirr-fm), [who passed away on February 28, 2020](http://evanovradio.com/vasil-william-evanov/), personally approve this hire, affirm support by a PR firm (of which I have solid hunches about but am still piecing it together), and be OK with this? Why does Wheeler say in that soundbite that ""they're ready"" now? I can't imagine what the delay would have been, unless we think of crazy supervillain vibes where Paul was waiting for all the legal stuff about Bill to be finished. Dave was unemployed for two years. Was Adam asking Paul to ask Bill to give Dave a job for two years, and now that Daddy's out of the picture Paul can finally be the one to say yes? How does any leadership in an organization that has a globally-accessible r/LGBT-focused radio station that is one of their jewels completely overlook the responsibility of public atonement at a value greater than public shaming, or more accurately disregard its importance? It's completely baffling but truly represents again what life is like with privilege.

I completely understand that Wheeler's termination from his last station [wasn't without controversy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dave-wheeler-sues-rogers-92-citi-fm-winnipeg-1.4831614), but what feels like something completely overlooked is that his language was spoken with fluidity. He utilized an opportunity to share unfiltered thoughts AND get paid for it. That's privilege. The idea of being able to speak your beliefs for personal gain with no disregard for hurt or harm: that's privilege.

To get the opportunity to have a public voice again, especially now targeted TOWARDS the demographic who have been harmed by the hateful and dehumanizing speech without any sign of public grief or atonement: that's privilege. To expect forgiveness and acceptance instead of earning forgiveness and trust: that's privilege.

That's why I advocate. The message that your privilege will protect you and anyone lesser has to fight for r/equality continues to be too strong, too frequent, and [too deadly](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dave-wheeler-fired-trans-comments-1.4751460).

What had me so confused, if not frustrated at the situation, was how the hire didn't raise concerns of transphobia but other forms of discrimination such as racism and sexism as well. One of the most ... eye opening ... experiences was Adam's response to me in one of our meetings where he didn't believe ""[Black Olives Matter](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/wheeler-after-dark-with-dave-c-707535/episodes/196-days-72288477)"" (Starting at \~16:44) was racism. Adam's argument to me was that Dave is a comedian and as such this should be considered a parody. I am not a person of colour by any stretch to know what racism feels like directly, but for him to flatly reject the message that has been spoken LOUDLY by our BIPOC community showed, again, privilege and another reason why I have to keep fighting. What's baffling is that podcast episode with the ""parody"" was uploaded on August 14, 2020 ... only TWO WEEKS prior to Energy's release of their ""Official Statement"" defending their hire. Further examples of racism were brought up by other members of our community, such as [a podcast episode validating Blackface](https://www.buzzsprout.com/194867/3930497-blackface-part-iv?play=true) (starting at \~35:20, released on May 27, 2020, two days after George Floyd was murdered, and with no hesitation to shame the ""woke"" generation), an [anti-Indigenous parody of the Wet'suwet'en protests](https://streamable.com/f3g1xo) on February 21, 2020 (plus referencing to the protest as [looking like an anus](https://i.imgur.com/UB24QlA.jpg)), and [validating police brutality](https://i.imgur.com/TdAbZtK.mp4) to the death of Eishia Hudson (the 16-year-old Indigenous teen who was shot dead on April 16, 2020). He's stated and has been defended that he ""[has done a lot of work](https://www.chrisd.ca/2020/08/24/dave-wheeler-morning-show-energy-106/)"" since getting fired, but I'm struggling to see where it has even started. I am at an absolute loss when it comes to seeing how this history is even close to being welcome at a self-professed LGBTQ+-friendly station, especially considering they fired a woman who was an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community to make space for him and another woman. His personal Wheeler After Dark! podcast explicitly describes the episodes as ""[not intended for those that are easily offended by adult themes, spicy language, satire, dark humour, etc, etc, etc... If you're a kid... You likely shouldn't be listening to this, but you should tell your parents to, they'd find it hilarious!](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/256-wheeler-in-the-morning-wit-43049197/)""

Being an ally doesn't have on-and-off ""modes."" You can't be a representative of allyship when you're under someone else's watch and especially while under someone else's salary. Allyship is an authentic effort from the heart. It isn't always flawless and it isn't always life-possessing but the motivation has to come from within yourself and it absolutely must represent your honest values. It absolutely stuns me about how Energy 106 FM, and more specifically the Evanov Radio Group, is completely dense to the insensitivity caused by their hire and exceptionally so by standing behind it. [The responsibility of being an ally is not to be taken lightly](https://guidetoallyship.com/), otherwise the actions will be exposed and shown to be [performative activism for personal gain](https://medium.com/illumination/the-difference-between-performative-activism-and-genuine-allyship-c1071133d0e0). As such, I continued (and continue) to advocate. Our minority communities have been run over far too frequently to stand aside to reckless privilege.

A few weeks after it was clear that Energy was firm in their decision, I decided it was time to [get even more involved](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306628473390166016). I was right on the cusp of socially-transitioning to full-time and used that moment as a chapter in my life to [show I'm taking advocating for what's right seriously](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1309278746491273217) and have been on it since. One of my most important processes was identifying business affiliates with the radio group. While it started with raising awareness to direct advertisers and implore them to assess their values, see if they are in line with the decisions at Energy, and withdraw their advertising if they don't support it. Many advertisers pulled which was wonderful to see as support, but I personally had a fire ignited after [I came across a video from Wheeler in the Morning parodying transgender people](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306996490833854464).

The video has since been set to private and in [a meeting I had with Tyler](https://i.imgur.com/OtfZz1S.png) he explained the video was set to private after I called it out because of the aforementioned legal dispute. Regardless, I advised that setting it to private doesn't address the video existing. The message of setting it to private is ""Oh, this is worth keeping, you're not supposed to see it though."" I advised him to have someone on Energy's Twitter account acknowledge my post with that exact remark about legal, to do something that represents anything close to allyship instead of continuing to be deflective and secretive.

Regardless, when I saw that video for the first time, the comments had a description that lit me up more than ever. ""Superheroes... Every last one of 'em.""

[A superhero possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses their powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and stopping evil.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306997230771920904)

[I'm transgender &amp; I am god damned proud of it. I did NOT abruptly become socially &amp; publicly visible to my workplace, sports leagues &amp; peers immediately after the Floyd murder to have Energy's clown car run over MY goal of raising awareness about diversity, inclusion and equality.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306997691264557056)

Between my parents responding exactly as I expected (who I still have not heard from them to this day, and we're going on about 3m1w at the time of this post), plus Energy and Evanov clearly embracing their decision, my fire has been lit more than ever. This world has never seen as strong as a version of me, and I have barely even teased my potential. I decided that Energy is not enough. If Paul Evanov decided to sign off on it, [Tyler picks up an additional role in the Evanov Radio Group with a segment on the aforementioned radio station PROUD FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1306621705146646528), and zero suggestion they are reconsidering their decisions, I decided the right way to gain awareness was to expand deeper into the radio group. I decided that it was time to [address not only advertisers but any visible business associate](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307355411972980737) with Energy 106 FM, [Hot 100.5 FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307354292639076353), [CKJS 810 AM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307354599058145280), and PROUD FM.

Ever since I started to advocate on this project, I was close to certain that Energy 106 muted me. If they blocked me I would have seen it, but if they muted me I would have had no idea. However, I realized eventually that Energy [did in fact have the ability to see my mentions and replies the whole time](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307051046372548612). I blocked out what Matt mentioned as sensitivity to his message but it seems he chose to engage it further. He chose to react on a post on Energy's account regarding a pizza promotion, and a picture he used on the post was one of him and his child. [It was Energy's account and I had a question to their promotion sponsor](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1307072376081985541), but what ultimately transpired was Matt's wife deciding to ... well, [here](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307043843477471233).

That's not to say that Energy or any accomplices hasn't been aware of my advocacy otherwise. From Day 1 (or as close to it that I can imagine), AJ blocked me for whatever reason but had no problem following a [conversation I had involving a business partner to PROUD FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1310786943177744384) and [throwing likes to the counterpoints of mine](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1310932294425890818). Of course, sometimes the [main account will make accidents too](https://i.imgur.com/9C808yQ.png) but I had no problem capturing it. Why would they continue to be silent when they insist to be ""allies?""

[I am DONE with this world running on hate &amp; dollars instead of heartbeats &amp; common sense. I did NOT abruptly put MY health, MY safety &amp; MY neck on the line inspire change to have Paul Evanov, the Evanov Radio Group, Adam West and Energy 106 FM suggest that being queer isn't profitable enough &amp; try to prove it during a GLOBAL SOCIAL CRISIS.](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307413726358724610)

I feel I have shown with more than enough character and conviction that I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm talking about, and I'm fighting so that we don't need to keep fighting in the future. I advocate strongly for mental health awareness and do my best to engage as much as possible with patience and objective reasoning. I have had people ask if it's OK to come out to me in private messages because they felt there was a safe space. I have had businesses reach out to me about various topics up to and including what could be an appropriate course of action with some of their decisions so that they continue to represent themselves as strong corporate r/allies. I have lost track of the amount of praise, r/gratitude and r/encouragement from so many people in our community. I have had mindful conversations with people immensely frustrated with racism and white supremacy. I have had compassionate conversations with people who want to be allies and are unsure what to do. I have had educational conversations with people about what a trans experience may be like, and I have had many wonderful conversations with trans people of a variety of backgrounds and experiences and shared stories about our journeys. I have had conversations with people who have felt inspired from me, I have had conversations with people who were feeling unwell, and I have had conversations to the point of committing time and awareness with people who were feeling suicidal so that we could get through the moment and work on recovery strategies.

That's not to say that it hasn't been without it's challenges, but has led to some awareness as well! After about a month of constant backlash since sticking to their hire, [Energy posted a podcast episode Tyler did with a local podcast group, Winnipeg's Finest](https://www.energy106.ca/2020/09/30/tyler-carr-has-an-honest-talk-about-energy-106/), which would to me suggest that Energy shares the perspective and sentiments he shared. I felt it was a good opportunity to express frustration about [not being given the opportunity to discuss these changes after being force-told to forgive a transphobic, sexist, racist bigot](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1311281926892695552). The podcast inspired me to respond with a video of my own, as a matter of fact. After [listening to the podcast](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1311367467986378752) a couple of times I decided to [record a YouTube video of my own](https://youtu.be/lZYJyhmwSzQ), completely unfiltered and unedited, pausing at every talking point that contradicted an experience, questioning bias, and so on. The video took me hours! 5 hours, actually! It was my very first time on r/YouTube too! I felt I had no time to waste and took a huge gamble on how it came out but I feel really proud of myself for what I did! I made sure to include [chapter markers of every talking point](https://imgur.com/a/dKMFH7R) as well and ... gosh, there are lots.

Like I said, it hasn't been without its challenges, that's for sure. [Cranking up the advocacy](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1307420054280003585) absolutely raised the eyebrows of many for both [good](https://twitter.com/Hoodedarche0/status/1307529836605452289) and, let's call it ""[uneducated](https://twitter.com/TheLadySmoke/status/1307068286421606402)"", reasons. I'm very grateful to be part of a community who helps support each other especially when there is a serious social concern in the works. I feel especially grateful to be a recognizable and trusted person during this entire adventure and I truly would never wish to have taken a different path. Even though I believe that Adam and Tyler only agreed to speak with me out of obligation to a CBSC ""[Complaint re ENERGY 106 CHWE-FM Broadcast](https://imgur.com/a/7NT7eLj)"" (even though it was never addressed as a reason but the timing to start talking and the dis-interest of engaging in r/Zoom conversations when r/COVID19 restrictions ramped up feel incredibly coincidental), I did do my best to be a helpful liaison between the radio station and our LGBTQ+ community. I continued to be engaged and [offered awareness, consultation, advice and concerns via email](https://imgur.com/a/oL0ZEjN). I started and maintained [a thread about what allyship looks like to people and what it would take for them to see Energy 106 FM as an ally](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1313236963995000832) again. For that project alone, I went as far back into relevant time as I could and tried to connect with nearly every user I could find that reacted to Energy 106 FM hiring Dave Wheeler. Loose math from my notes suggests I have tried to connect with about 1600 people. I have personally DM'd about 750 people and every last piece of feedback has been included in the thread. In my [last meeting that I had at Energy](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1318972358711939074), Megan told me that she has been following the entire thread so I at least had an affirmation that the effort has been acknowledged.

Unfortunately, that's also about where it ended. While the start of my emails and correspondence was pleasant and positive communication, it didn't take too long to redirect the focus to some rather important pieces of discussion. It's very clear that since hiring Dave and promoting Wheeler In The Morning as their new morning show, they have enabled a safe space for an extremely far-right culture including [white supremacy, transphobia, racism, and a general disrespect for human decency. There has been stalking, doxxing, libel, cyberbullying](https://imgur.com/a/y6G5WEM) and an absolute maelstrom of right-wing chaos and panic.

What has been incredibly baffling is how Adam and Energy were literally [offered an example of a script to use to stay engaged, not overpromise their direction while denouncing all the values that authentic allies fight against](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1318526814986268679), they decided to ignore all that and ask for everyone to ""[be kind](https://twitter.com/energy106fm/status/1318276615705690114)."" If that doesn't have ""stand back and standby"" written all over it, I don't know what does.

So, this is the part where I ask for r/feedback! I have a few considerations in my mind so far but am curious about where the next part of my journey should go. I know I'm going to continue to raise awareness of the situation to any visible business affiliates, and likely I will up the ante now to all Evanov Radio Group stations from coast to coast. As a matter of fact, I will be including affiliates to the Winnipeg Goldeyes as well because [they censored me when I asked them about their values compared to their affiliation with Energy 106 FM](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1320019452772012033). As a trans r/athlete, the simple concept of our local r/AAbaseballteam promoting Diversity Day in the past but censoring me about their values towards diversity, inclusion and equity disgusted me and prompted me to [immediately throw my jersey in the garbage](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1320437091910627328). I will never wear a Goldeyes jersey again, especially so long as they don't respond to my questions.

See, I know what I'm doing is powerful, successful and fearful. Why else would the Wheeler-in-the-Morning-fanclub cry to Twitter to [suspend my account](https://i.imgur.com/CrPLgHp.jpg)? That is arguably one of the most flattering things to come my way, to know that I am the haunting reason for people who are so insecure with themselves they have become possessed and obsessed with my existence, and know they are utterly desperate to silence me during my advocacy about trans rights and fundamentally basic r/humanrights means WHAT I AM DOING IS WORKING AND I WILL NOT QUIT. I must express reservations about Twitter's judgement, however. Oh well. I will earn the blue star, I will be verified, and I WILL bring our trans community to a safer, healthier place.

This cycles back to seeing what feedback is available. I firmly believe these accounts are affiliated to Energy 106 FM or the Evanov Radio Group as a whole. The biggest reason why it comes to mind are based on three things: 1) One of the main antagonists has an account that opened in September 2020, shortly after Dave Wheeler deleted his own account, and [targeted a tweet I commented on](https://twitter.com/TaylorLakhryst/status/1309486497591042050). 2) After my last meeting at Energy, Adam affirmed to me that ""he'll take care of them"" when I told him that the little band waving Energy's flag is doing nothing but making his brand look worse, because they are absolutely not doing anything to me. I noticed a near-immediate decline in activity from the fun-club for a small period of time and struggle to believe that wasn't as per Adam's memo. Add the fact that Tyler affirmed to me that he would publicly denounce their behaviour and that has not happened either. So, Energy, Adam, and Tyler have all the means to blatantly denounce white supremacy, harassment, racism, transphobia, r/doxxing, r/stalking, libel, defamation, and so on ... yet completely refuse to. What other option can it be? 3) [This is a little too coincidental](https://twitter.com/svnflowers_k/status/1322208994333741056), and if it was done ""in satire because Dave is a comedian"" (as per Adam) then it shows they are aware of the situation and continue to refuse to address it.

I find it interesting that these accounts have a massive obsession about broadcasting far-right political beliefs and stalking me. Feel free to see for yourself about the obsession since the end of September for all these folks:

I'm sure there are more but if I really wanted to look for Cancer I'd rather go r/stargazing. And frankly, these are simply about things I see directly. I have been told my more than enough peers that this crowd stalks them as well, but peculiarly block those peers if this fun-club doesn't get the reaction they want.

What's especially curious about the situation is that while these users are beyond obsessed with me an have lept over so many lines, I still have no reason to believe that it's not within the Evanov Radio Group and of all things they even have my home address which I needed to include when I wrote my concern to CBSC, so at what point am I to not feel as if Adam or Dave would not use it out of vengeance against me by the time I am done advocating against Evanov Radio Group and their perpetual injustices? People may ask why I shared my address, and the answer is to continue to be open, transparent, and show validity that Energy is a local radio station that is poisoning my local community. People ask why don't I block the aforementioned users, and the answer is because they are not hurting me. Everything that they are doing does nothing but make Energy look worse, make Evanov look like an even more pathetic radio group, and every last itch and twitch they do to try to upset me does nothing but empower me, inspire me, and give me more to work with. Our community has far too many people suffering from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, r/bullying, r/cyberbullying, transphobia, racism, stalking and so much more. I have the means and the mental health strength to absorb all of their hatred and ignorance and show it to people who are in positions to make change that it is happening, it is dangerous and it is deadly. I can not and will not be broken, and that is why I allow these users to continue to try to break me, because all they are doing is making this fire inside of me brighter, stronger, more fierce and ultimately more beautiful. I will not quit.

So, as I've mentioned, I would love to hear your feedback about what you think appropriate courses of action would be! Remember that I'm from r/Canada, from Manitoba to be more specific, so if you have any feedback that is jurisdiction-specific that may be relevant to your consideration!

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! Happy Trans Awareness Week!"
224,When your losing interested in everything and other shit,"Alright straight up this probably gonna be alot of ranting. It might be shirt it might be long. Oh and me be deslexic so sorry.

I want fucking out. This need to end. It will end i dont know how yet but one way or a other it will fucking end."
225,how do i keep going and stay positive,Lately its been hard to keep myself staying positive. Everything I like to do I feels is just looked down upon by my parents. I feel like I never can meet their expectations with what I do. I am very extroverted so its hard to be quarantining and the pressure of school and keeping my grades up is starting to take a toll because of how stressed I am to preform and not having the time to truly relax. I have so many negative emotions I'm trying to fight off and my mind feels cloudy and my thoughts pinpointed in one place in my head. So I ask how do I keep going and staying positive if it gets harder every day.
226,How do I break a social media dependency?,"Because of quarantine, I (and I'll assume others) have been relying heavily on social media to scrape out some kind of social life. The problem is that I have become super-dependent on social media for stability and happiness. Up until now, for example, I used to get around one new follower per day. But I haven't gotten a new follower in a while, and that break in routine is making me feel down. On top of that, my brain feels compelled to overanalyze the break in the pattern: do people not like me anymore? Is it something that I did? And I know that that sounds completely irrational, but, like, try telling my brain that. 

Any advice?"
227,anxiety at young age,"hey I’m young (not comfortable saying age) and I have really bad anxiety. it’s been getting better though which is good but it randomly spikes and gets so horrible just as it’s getting better, recently I’ve been feeling trapped and having horrible, HORRIBLE thoughts that are suicidal. stuff like I will never be happy once I’m older, or nobody will ever like me etc which is making me act as those thoughts. of course I’d never kms but this is getting out of hand and I just want to be happy and not worry. I already do see a therapist but it doesn’t help much. I want meds but the side effects worry me very much"
228,I think i have anxiety,"I think i have anxiety. Anything and everything stresses me out, such as: walking to the teachers desk to ask a question, asking a teacher any question, talking to my family, little things people say to me, and even just playing sports in gym class. And obviously lots more.

I dont want to be disrespectful to people who actually do have clinical or self diagnosed anxiety, but i think i may need medication for my nerves? Im not sure but even the slightest little thing i will over think for hours about it, and i cry about everything. Everything that happens in my day to day life bothers me.

When i talk to my mom about how i feel she turns me down, and just says to stop being so sensitive. 

Im not sure what to do. Any suggestions?"

230,How do I stop this?,"Since last last Friday I’ve been anxious. It started with my moms car not igniting, triggering a panic attack. It was the first time having one in my entire life, now it’s been nearly a week and a half and I’m still short of breath and my heart sometimes speeds up. I’m terrified of getting ocd, I don’t know what to do and if this is normal or not.

233,Keeping your dreams.,"How do you keep and maintain your dreams? 

I’ve had a dream since I was about 16 of living in a skoolie. I’ve been working hard trying to save money and researching for the past year or so. 

My grandma is my closest in distance family member. She and I live in opposite ends of the city, but since c-19 we’ve been trying to help each other out as much as possible. She’s..... hard. I’m currently the only family member that hasn’t cut her off completely. My mother and uncle, her children, have completely withdrew from her. As have my brothers. It’s hard. She’s difficult. Every time I see her she comments about my appearance in some way. Most of the time my hair color(dyed black, natural redhead)and how I should be proud of my heritage and looks and stop being ashamed of myself, or my weight (120ish @5’5”). When I lived with her a few years ago and weighed 130 she made me stop eating as many meals and drink protein drinks in order to slim down. 

I talk to her, my mother, my father, and my grandpa the most about my nomad dreams. Everyone is super supportive besides my grandmother. She constantly likes to play “devils advocate”. 

I was diagnosed bipolar disorder about two years ago now. I’ve tried many meds, but my depression and lows are so bad that I often have a hard time waking up. I daydream about my future and it’s really what keeps me alive day to day. Working for the goal. 

My grandmother has been nothing but hateful about my dream. She thinks it’s stupid. A waste of money. I’ll never survive on my own. I should just be grateful for what I have. Ect. 

I am trying to stay positive and distance myself from her. It’s hard. I feel so lost. How do I keep motivated when she talks me down like this. I already struggle enough to keep my head above water. Everyday I’m drowning."

235,"Does anyone else occasionally get hit with the realisation that someday we all have to die, and then basically suffer a panic attack afterwards? This happens to me quite a lot.",And I don't know what to do about it.
236,i think that hard work is not worth it and its easier to just die.,"i am amazingly lazy person. i remember my parents always mad at me for that when i was in primary school. i never did my homework, i just hated it. it would take me literally 5 minutes, but i prefered to get a bad grade and punishment from my parents, than spend a moment doing something i didn't want to do.

i am now 19 years old and nothing changed. actually, it's worse. before the whole e-classes situation i couldn't get up too school. my mothers boyfriend had to drive me everyday because it was the only thing to force me to get up. although i still often told him that im not going this day or skip classes.

my mom compares me to my dad who got fired from job because he was too lazy to get up and go to work. we're really similiar, and i think this is what awaits me if nothing changes.

im at my final year in high school. i never failed a year (tho it was close ngl). i have important exams this year (final exam and profession exam, im in technical school). as you can imagine, i don't study for them. actually i failed one of profession exams already last year. i cant force myself to study. my mother threatens to kick me out of the house if i dont pass this year/exams (and believe me, i know my mother is able to do that) and i just kinda... accepted that.   
basically, my brain prefers to be kicked out of the house instead of doing some school work.

its worth mentioning i have depression. i go to the doctor, eat some meds that don't help that much. i am still in the queue for therapy - i can't afford buying one. 

also i have problem with food, probably a slight eating disorder. i dont have that much energy from food.

i really don't think i will live for much longer. i hate this world, not only my life. i have no idea how to say it the other way: i don't vibe with living. because i am lazy, i don't want to do anything. even my interests are now not giving me joy. i force myself to draw and play games and they just make me frustrated. i just want to not feel anything, do nothing. and i was like that since a kid, but more 'i want to dissapear' than 'i want to die'. how can i stay motivated if all of my hard work is going to waste because i will die soon?

i partly destroyed my friendship with my approach. we dont know each other for that long, 2+ years, but we got really close quickly. they are getting out of depression. i vent to them too much. i am a slightly toxic friend, i try to fight it because i don't want to make them feel bad. if i'm toxic, i am not doing it on purpose.   
we argue a lot about my depression. i think it's not that big of a deal because after all, i will die soon. they think i should get help asap. i tell them often that i will kill myself, my venting is not good for them. i think im not worth helping, they want to help me. we got more distant since it started. its like that for like a year, maybe a bit more.  
i tried to read things on the internet how to get motivated, but none helped, because they assumed i already did the first step - thought that i will do something. considered it. i just think work isnt worth it.

i suspect i need to work on myself before i should work on my motivation, but i really don't know how to force myself right now.

so here i am. and my questions are: how to start thinking that something other than death awaits me and my work is not going to waste? how to start working on myself? how to believe that i might get a good life if i dont kill myself?  
i would appreciate some links or tips.

TLDR; too lazy to do anything since a kid, i am now 19, depressed and still too lazy to do anything. my brain prefers to be kicked out of the house instead of doing some school work. how to start thinking that my work is going to waste because ill kill myself soon anyway?

sorry if this post was made 934859358 times already. i wanted to tell my own story. also sorry if something doesnt make sense, its late, english is a stupid language and i just stopped crying after arguing with my friend."
237,Should I get medicated if I still live with people that stress me out?,"I've been considering seeking out a psychiatrist to help out sort my behavior. I wanted to see what my options are, living in Florida. I've been diagnosed with general anxiety and depression 6 years ago, but I feel like it's only gotten worse over time. I've had several panic attacks over the last 3 years. Two of them happened while I was on the clock and I just froze up from all the panic and confusion I had, it even led to why I got fired.

Lately, I started to notice some developing swing in my character. It was always kinda there but I always chalked it up to just emotions because they would last such little time. This time, however, I can feel how drastic it gets. The most obvious case for me was about a month ago. I was really feeling confident in myself. I was outperforming in my games and in choir, I started to draw again, and I even went to the gym often. At the time I had lost about 10 lbs that month. But then one weekend, as I was finishing my sketch I started to question myself. I thought, if I took a short break from it I could focus again. So I started to play some games and I just sucked. It was really frustrating. I switched to something less intense and the boredom washed over me, despite enjoying it usually. 

The following weeks after I would spend staggered hours in my bed just laying there. Sometimes I would look at nothing on my phone, and sometimes I wouldn't even do that because it would make me feel like a POS that won't achieve anything and I'll be the same as I always was. Whenever my ex (we are friends still) or my parents would call I would just ignore them. Whenever I did, however, I would get agitated easily and blow up things a bit too much, like if I got blamed for something I would defend myself way too much and storm off.

I really don't like to claim things without seeing a professional and I'm not saying I do have this, but I think I might have PTSD, and be bipolar too. I still want to see somebody before I get treated for that. I was considering a psychologist first to see if maybe talk therapy could help me, but I've had talk therapy for other things before and it never really impacted me. It felt more like I could just vent about whatever I could remember.

I wanted to ask what steps should I take. Should I even take meds if my parents are just going to stress me out more?"
238,My hatred towards myself just keeps on growing,"My mum hasnt spoken to me in like 3 weeks, my dad still speaks to me but in a very passive aggressive way. Like when he speaks to me theres always a hint of aggressiveness of snarky remarks. She stopped talking to me because im not doing the course at uni she wanted me to and in general I'm not doing so well at school.

Honestly it's making me feel so shit. Like, this whole household is making me feel so shit. I make jokes about my mum not speaking to me and pretend its whatever but it's just so hard. I feel like I'm the worst human ever. I tell my friends and they tell me it's fine, she has a right to be like that. And, I guess she does. I'm her child and I'm a disappointment and im embarrassing her.

 But I just want someone to tell me im not that bad. That I dont deserve this and I deserve my family to love me even if I'm struggling with school. That my worth isnt just based upon my academic success. 

I feel so alone ngl, it's so lonely. I feel like I'm detached from everyone around me and I have no one to go to. Like it's honestly so fucking lonely. Talking to someone through text and having someone actually physically there for you is so different. 

I feel like I've made jokes about my feeling so much that I dont know how to  genuinely go to someone and ask for help."
239,ECT cross post,
240,"every time I read about some mentally sick person, I reflect on him.","this time I read the blog and the Wikipedia of Terry A. Davis the creator of temple os he is schizophrenic. I mean I have an uncle who is smart and schizophrenic too, I might be schizo as well, still, after 11 years of treatment, I don't have a diagnosis of my mental state.

I just wanted to share that with you guys, that may be reading the case of other mentally sick people can make you self aware of your situation. I do post weird stuff on Facebook just like this guy terry, I try to contact the gov behind it and tell them how unfair they were with me. I feel I have been mistreated and I proclaim I have been mistreated but I have no proof. and the bad thing about my case, is somehow I am tech-savvy, not good, but good enough to notice some stuff around on the internet or some networks on some companies. for example on one of the companies I worked at there was a sniffer that sniff all the phone calls and all the text messages that happens around this place and it records them, later I figured out they made it to avoid robbery because this company generates lots of money cash at the same place, I had no proof about it, I had just deduced that from my intuition and some luck and when I talked about it, it happened to be true, and I figured out some stuff from here and there. and here is the thing I should proclaim myself smart because I can figure out these things but I am not, it makes me more vulnerable to believe in things my mind makes up sometimes with no proofs, like the government being unfair to me."
241,...Sexual assault,"As a F14 who this year has been sexually assaulted 3 times once by an old man, once by a friend, and the other by family all I want to say is no. No I didnt want it. The old man, walked past me and grabbed my bum and started smelling me. I walked away. Second one the “friend” grabbed me and I said I need to go and he said no stay and I said no. I said no. No was the word, he still made me do it he grabbed my arm and my waist and I stood in panic but no was the word that I said. Still he begged and grabbed and did it. Third time (not too long ago) this was by my to be step brother, I was drunk passed out on my bed and he wakes me up, i ask where am I and who he is but he started kissing me I didn’t kiss back. He pushed my head down and asked is this ok. In panic I said nothing at all I didn’t answer I didn’t even think this was real. He pushed my head down. I called him my bf (now ex) name. He said no it’s (his name) so I stopped, I did, I just stopped. He left. I told my bf but he blames me. He told my whole school I cheated with my step bro. I get bullied now. I should be able to get drunk ( I know I’m only 14 shouldn’t be drinking) without having the fear of someone doing something to me.
“No, “stop”, “I rather not”, silence, drunk, “I change my mind”, “I don’t want to”, “a different time”. If it’s not a solid yes then leave it. If they want to they will say yes. Don’t beg. Don’t do anything. If someone is clearly uncomfortable just let them have their space. It can be traumatising and gives people anxiety and depression. 
Also I haven’t told anyone about this. No adult knows because no one will believe me. I try telling school students I didn’t want it but they silence me and joke about it and blame me because it’s my fault I was drunk. I can’t even say anything about that “friend” who also did the same thing again to my other friend but yeah again it’s all our fault."
242,I Want Too Much,"I’m new to reddit and just kind of wanted to get my feelings out there and see if anyone ever feels this way or maybe for some advice. I feel like I want to do too much things. I have too many interests. I love music, it’s why I’m Majoring in Music Technology, so I can improve my music. I’m also very interested in Politics, it’s why i’m double majoring with Political Science, i love debating, discussing, arguing. I also love writing, which I consider a kind of root for my love for film, poetry, novel writing, etc. The problem is I just am so obsessed with being perfect and amazing at everything i want. I’m literally considering getting a minor in writing or film even tho I already have a double major. I want to so bad but I know I can’t. I have this unrealistic fantasy that my music will take off, that I’ll become one of the best artists in the world, i’ll change the world of music. That I’ll have an amazing legacy, and that this would allow me to venture into film directing, writing novels, writing plays. I have dreams of always being heavily involved in politics. that one day I’ll have enough social influence to run for congress or state level positions, and sometimes i even think about becoming president or something like that. It’s all fantasy, which is always fine, but I feel like I just stress myself out over it too much. That i’m such a perfectionist that I try to do too much. I have 7 classes i’m balancing, while trying to make my music, trying to write a novel, and recently i’ve been going to the gym a lot to relieve stress. 

I’m still not diagnosed yet, but my therapist and I are looking into the possibility of me having Bipolar Disorder. I just get so hyper and so manic that I commit myself to so many things, example, i took 7 classes. Then when I fall into my depression I’m overwhelmed with so many things and the fact that there’s a possibility this fantasy won’t come true I just completely fall apart. it’s been really affecting me socially, I get so stressed from having a night out with my friends just because I could be working on other things. I just want to be the best at everything I do and whenever it seems that I won’t be able to do that I fall back deep down into that depression, which makes me work on these things even less, which makes my depression worse. It’s a never ending cycle and I just feel so overwhelmed and so alone."
243,What's wrong with me? What do I dooo :(,"TW: mentions of self harm

I dont know what's wrong with me. Like for weeks on end I feel soooo shit, like I cant do anything. No motivation, nothing. I feel suicidal, I self harm and I impulsively delete pictures, social media accounts and write suicide notes and plan my suicide and get ready to end it. But then for like 3 days I for some reason start doing stuff. I dunno, it's not much but doing normal everyday things that I didnt do before. It's not like I felt happy, more like I had energy but didnt get the happiness with it but I looked happy, if u get what i mean? But that lasts for a couple of days and then like now, I'm back to wanting to die, hating myself, wanting to cut myself and not do anything. My brain makes me think there's nothing I can do to get control of my life again I feel like I'm in a spiral and keep going back and forwards. I dont know how to ask for help because I dont know what to say or start with."
244,I finally found what is wrong with me,"Ages ago, I was posting on subreddits about how i need a girlfriend and stuff like that. I have recently discovered that that is not the case.

248,I hate feeling like this,"Ahh why do I feel so alone. I hate feeling like this. I want to cry but I can't. God I hate this.

I can't tell my friends or anything because I feel like I'm being a burden on them."
249,I can’t enjoy food anymore,"I used to be fond of food, don't get me wrong, I would never turn down on fast food. But I feel like I can't enjoy food the same way as before. I could look forward towards breakfast, but lately I can't barely put anything in my belly. I eat eggs very infrequently, and if I am lazy, I eat a sandwich, or simply down a tea until my mother makes food when she's back from work. I'm 24M, by the way. It's also that I don't feel like the taste is pleasant anymore, whenever I used to eat something I enjoy, I would be in a better mood. It feels more like a substance that I just fill my body with. I am not looking forward to most of the food we have in the refrigerator, or the freezer. It's simply ”that substance which is needed to fill my belly.” This doesn’t work, and food simply isn’t delicious anymore to me.  
I don’t feel like wanting to eat anymore if I can’t enjoy it. I’m just filling up my body just to survive.

These 2 past days has been great, my depression oscillates between good mood and bad mood throughout the day, but some days can be completely great, and some can be completely bad the whole day. I can definitely feel an impact from stress and burden, though. It's enough that I feel insignificant already, without a job, education, etc., just today my mother asked me if I have money, told me she would transfer money, and so I was feeling like a burden again to her. I have a father too, so thankfully my load of burden is not only on her. I can't work, simply because I don't do well socially, all my past coworkers have been pricks towards me because I didn't socialize with them, I have felt alienated in my past jobs too much, I can't go back there and risk making my depression even worse, being told that I am not good enough again. It's similar with my studies, constant F's on community college.

Anyway, you can see that my problems are multifold, I don't take any antidepressants, I don't think I can manage to be on them and being caused more sadness and pain when they don't work. I am tired of failing."
250,Can someone take a look at my symptoms list? I’m unable to see a doctor but I want to know if this is normal or not,"1. I don’t seem to care about anyone other than myself. When people are upset or talk to me about their life I simply have no interest 
eg my friend told me they were suicidal and I (internally) shrugged it off and told them “not to do it yet because they won’t be remembered for anything just wait till you do something crazy then go for it”
2. Social anxiety? I am extremely uncomfortable in social situations 
Eg struggle to make eye contact, feel like everyone is watching/laughing/talking about me, I falter at small talk, hate social events like parties and I overthink every small thing I do Infront of people 
3. I need to be told exactly what is going to happen when I’m doing something new 
eg the other day I went to an art gallery and I needed to be told exactly where the entrance was, how to approach reception, what to ask for and when to present my ticket etc etc otherwise I get scared
4. I hate conversation in general, I love to just sit and listen/ zone out in my own head space 
5. I have to pretend I love my friends and family and I feel disgusted expressing it because i view it as “fake and gross”
Eg I’ve never hugged my mum (Don’t get me wrong I appreciate that she has given me a house and has fed me, but affection is not my area) 
6. I get very very uncomfortable when someone expresses love towards me 
eg my friend asked me if “I was ok and they were worried about me” and I physically felt sick
7. I hate physical touching 
8. My dad committed suicide when I was 11. I was closer to him than I was to my mum yet I didn’t feel sad or cry when I heard the news. I accepted it and moved on almost instantly. 
9. I do feel emotion, I feel happiness, sadness, irritation, anger, stress etc etc 
10. I have self harmed in the past, not because I was numb or overwhelmed but because I was curious and it eventually just turned into habit 
11. I think I’m asexual, I have practically no desire to have sex and the thought of touching someone’s genitals makes me feel a bit nauseous

I will not take any replies as a diagnosis obviously since the internet isn’t the most reliable place, but it would really help if I could get some ideas and if I should see a doctor (in the future when I can)"
251,I need help,"I don’t know if I can do this much longer

I am a 15 year old male. Quite frankly I don’t know how long this will go on. My parents are always heavily fighting. Since the day they have been married, they’ve had a shitty relationship. It’s worth mentioning they had an arranged marriage. Over the last 15 years, their relationship has only gotten worse. I should mention I have a 13 year old brother, who is on the autism spectrum. My dad was risen in an abusive household as well. My mother grew up with depression, as her mother passed from cancer and her father lost his business. 8 years ago, my dad got involved in a legal battle with his sister over property. It has had a huge impact on his life, draining him to this day. It has gotten to the point where he talks about his death constantly, even joking saying he won’t live much longer. They’ve fought for as long as I can remember, with a couple times standing out. 6 years back, my parents fought and there was verbal abuse, and it even got physical. In the end, my dad threatened to commit suicide by pills, and I had to call a friend of his to mediate. To see my younger brother crying while I stood there has traumatized me to this day. Since then they have had many more fights, till today. Then, we moved to the United States, where our family is completely alienated. We do not have many family friends, as compared to before. Recently, my dad has been suffering from increased stress which seems to have led to him having major depression. Today seemed to be the final straw. My mom made a comment which sent my dad off on a rant. He talked about how his life has been ruined by other people. He talked about how he spent the majority of his life in stress, working and working to get us here. Eventually, he started crying hysterically, saying he just wants to live to see his sons successful, after which he will willing fully kill himself. I really do feel sorry for my father, he has suffered a lot. I believe he just wants peace for once in his life. I also feel for my mother, who has lived her entire life as a housewife. It pains me when they fight, and it hurts me more to see my brother in this environment. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I just want to go to sleep and not wake up in this mess. I can’t help but think of what will happen to my brother, and wonder who will support him if I pass."

253,What's the point of living if you can't feel alive?,[deleted]
254,growing up,"I can't fucking breath in my own home. every single time I do the smallest thing I get hell from my parents. for instance today I god chicken wings for dinner and was sitting trying to eat. then my spaz of a dog decides to jump and eat it. of corse it is all my fault and I am going to kill the dog. I say i'm sorry but nothing Is ever enough. so then I stop eating and try to leave and my mom yells at me and says I always ""run away from my problems."" It is so degrading to live with them. my therapist thinks that I should just apologize to them every time. but, when I know i'm right its just building up my anger. this is just a small example unfortunately, these small things happen everyday. sometimes I'm just so tired from school and everything else in life that whenever they yell at me I just cry. so my entire life I've been called a cry baby. but in reality my dads just drunk and when he starts to insult me it hurts. his memories of everything in life are so different cause he's never in a clear mind. to add to it my mom is his bitch and refuses to see something wrong with him. my mom would be such a good single parent if she would just leave him. but instead he yells at us everyday and I often find myself in the hospital or in the never ending cycle of drug abuse. but I also justify my drug abuse because my doctor has been giving me a different prescription sense 3rd grade."
255,i’m tired and angry all the time,it’s been like this for years and years. is it possible i’m just an angry brain inside a tired body and that’s ok and normal? idk anymore.

257,"I (14F) have such a strange relationship with food, and I feel like it's taking over my life and affecting my mental health"," 

I just want to disclaim that I don't have an eating disorder.

So I am 14 years old and I have never been overweight in my life, but I have been borderline overweight a lot of my life. I've always been at the end of the healthy weight range. Because of this my parents have both insulted me, commented on my weight, fought with me about weight, humiliated me, etc. At least 3 sort of jokes or comments have been made out of it since I was in 3rd grade. You might think this probably lowered my self-esteem, but it honestly didn't. If anything it made me more confident. I would hate them so much for this that it made me feel better about myself. Like I knew that what they would do is abusive and wrong and because of it I would tell myself, ""You're more than perfect just the way you""

Over the years every time I eat it has become something I have to think about way too many times. I avoid eating in front of my dad except dinner, which I have to, I eat light portions at dinner, or sometimes I'll eat a lot just to piss them off, or sometimes I will purposefully eat a lot of food like after having a meal just to piss off my parents. It's become such a convoluted thing and I have to think about everything before I eat. Whenever my parents aren't home I make myself eat junk food even if I don't necessarily want that food. Cause in my head I think well this is my chance to eat whatever I want and I can't waste this chance. If I don't eat junk food I think it's this terrible opportunity I missed and I get mad at myself. They make me so nervous and everything I eat. Especially in quarantine.

It becomes the most stressful thing and I have to decide if I'm trying to make them mad or just comply and it just it's all confusing and stressful. I feel really guilty when I don't eat junk food but I feel guilty when I do. Another thing I do is I always make sure I have all 3 meals, and you might think well that's a good thing, right. But a lot of the times I won't even be hungry for lunch but I force myself so my parents don't think I'm skipping a meal and trying to loose weight. In my mind my parents seeing me trying to loose weight would be the worst thing in the world, or seeing me willingly eat healthy foods. I'm sorry I'm being so confusing and inconsistent in this explanation but that's really how my diet is- confusing and inconsistent. Sometimes when I crave healthy foods I make sure to eat it when my parents aren't home. When my friends, family, and people online are talking about how much they ate in a day or the meals they skip I feel so guilty. On weekdays my parents don't get back home until lunch time and I either eat tons of junk food or I skip breakfast and contemplate skipping lunch out of guilt. I never do end up skipping lunch cause I realize than I'm letting my parents win.

But since quarantine I HAVE gained weight I'm at the very end of the healthy weight range scale and I feel so shitty because a lot of what my parents say is now well right. I just feel so shitty about myself and kinda wanna loose weight but I'll never admit to it, while living here. I just feel like one day I'll wake up and starve myself"
258,What is best way to stop overthinking stuff that puts you down?,I have been recently overthinking on stuff that has been putting myself down like my future like if stuff turns out bad or lets say i overthink about what someone thinks about me. Like constantly i have been like this everday for almost 6 YEARS and still can't stop overthinking. It  gets to a point where i just want to commit suicide because this overthinking keeps messing up with my emotions.

261,Why am I giddy about cutting a best friend out of my life?,"So basically my plus one for a wedding lied about a Covid test which came back positive. Once I texted her that I was completely ending things, I felt the biggest sigh of relief. I’m seriously so happy right now.  Is this normal?"
262,Severe Sunday Blues,"Hi All,

My husband and I both suffer from depression and anxiety - I’m currently managing mine fairly well with 450 mg of Bupropion daily, and he has been working on finding his most effective combination for the past year or so, and it’s been challenging and upsetting for him, and me as I feel frustrated that I can’t help him.

Something that has always impacted him has been the “Sunday Blues,” where he starts to get very stressed and nervous about Monday, and it causes him to have heightened anxiety during some portion of the day on Sunday. As the years have passed, and things have gotten a bit more stressful for us (we have a toddler, serious financial challenges, living in a one bedroom but preparing to move some point this upcoming year) it seems that this has been getting worse. His entire Sunday seems to be derailed - wakes up frustrated, quiet/mopey/snippy most of the day, and develops into tears and frustration by the evening that the entire day went by. This happens nearly every Sunday, and it comments on the fact that he feels no desire to try anything new or do something proactive in any way in order to combat this.

I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m so upset for him, because I hate seeing what this does to him, and the fact that we cannot seem to find a winning medication combination to help him regain some energy and motivation. It’s also taking a toll on our family, as Sundays typically feel tense and somber, and I start to deal with creeping guilt that I’m not doing more for my toddler by planning outings on Sundays or something. I’m still dealing with serious depression myself, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t feeling some amount of frustration or resentment that it feels like any opportunity for family time comes to a screeching halt every Sunday. 

He’s been on bupropion for the past few months and it’s helping a bit, and in the past month he started taking vyvanse for newly diagnosed adult ADHD (really positive step forward for him) but he went off the vyvanse because of severe headaches. Now he’s going to try some short acting Adderall, as prescribed by his physician.

If you have any thoughts, feedback, guidance, advice, resources that you’d care to share, I’d be so grateful. How do you get yourself to a place where you can try to take control of your day? Is there a way to reframe your thoughts or your approach so Sundays don’t feel so terrible? We are without a doubt currently in the most stressful part of our lives and our relationship that we’ve ever experienced (my mom died in January and it’s basically ruined me, we don’t have family nearby and we’re on a strict budget so there isn’t much option for babysitting), I remind myself to cut us both some slack until we get through this year of hell. I just feel powerless to help him, and it’s taking a toll on me and I don’t know what to do.

Thanks for any input!"

264,Help! I don’t know how to get better,"So I (19W) have dealt with trauma, anxiety, depression, ED, all that “fun” stuff. And I’m much better than before, I can see that but there are three very very strong and annoying parts of me that I just don’t know how to improve. 

If you know how to improve it, or if you know the psychology behind it so I can understand better it would be highly appreciated ❤️

So 1, I am a very, very nervous person, part of me is afraid of absolutely everything even things I know and have done in the past, they make me so nervous that I get panic attacks and I can even shit myself out of panic. I have gone to psychologists but they always go around my trauma and then send me away but the nervousness has never left.

2. I have a hero complex, or however you would call it. I always tend to look out for others, be the mom of the group, be a healer all of that, but it drains me, a lot, and I help people that I barely know ignoring my own needs cause I can’t reject people in need. Idk why

3. I have major, major trust issues in relationships. I am a very sweet person, funny and chill, but whenever I like someone or they like me I get this mean bitchy attitude that lifts a wall, and I stop liking them after the minimum mistake and I just walk away. 

It’s good to have high standards but I am afraid that I’m doing a weird mix of holding the wrong people in my life, kicking people out to quickly out of fear and being scared of things that aren’t happening.

HELP"
265,how to make life a little less like hell," 

I'm a 27 y/o male that lives in the western world with ""free"" healthcare. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for the last couple of years. I've been trying to cope with living just by getting through one day at the time, but for years on end at this point. I have in the past, when desperately needing professional help, been using and abusing pain killers and other sedating drugs, just to get through the day. I never touch alcohol, as it severely impacts my mental health immediately after consumed, and after that for weeks, worsening and deepening my depression while spiking my anxiety. Recently i got myself into a bad habit with benzodiazepines, as regular doctors are unsure of what to do with me. The reason for this is that i have a heart condition that makes all modern anti anxiety medication a hassle for me to use, since i keep getting severe palpations when used, thus worsening my anxiety and stressing me out. I've used thousands of dollars on private clinic doctors, but they all remain in the standard area when it comes to medicine.

The point of my post would be, is there anyone out there, or someone that knows one, that has been in a similar position as i am in right now? Because i need some advice / guidance as to where i go from here. I'm open to find/try unusal medicines/ herbs that can give me some mental relief so i can function better, and make my life a little better. Any comments/help or advice would be appreciated.. i should note that i've been a very physical fit person for the most of my life, but recently have gained alot of weight due to my illness making me unable to workout on the level i used to."
266,How anxiety looks like. Today was the TV,"My TV in the bedroom kept turning itself off every couple of minutes.
The rational me: the remote is working well, must be the TV itself, let me Google how to solve this
The anxious me: there's someone hiding under the bed, turning off the TV to convince me to go to sleep, so can murder me and my fiance while we sleep.
I fixed the TV but now Im too anxious to sleep."
267,Is it possible to have long lasting trauma from a horror movie? (Please help! &amp; Serious answers only),"Apologies if this isn't the right thread for this. But this is something that's been on my mind for awhile  and plagued me for many years.  


Probably about 18 years or so ago, when I was about 5 I had gone into my bother's room for some reason I don't remember and he was watching  a horror movie. I believe it was called Terror Toons and I happened to walk in on a highly disturbing scene. I prefer not to go into detail, but the scene pictured a girl getting her spine ripped out by the villains of the movie, and still to this day, that scene has caused severe anxiety (and possible trauma???) Any time the memory of the movie surfaces in my mind, it often keeps me up at night and I have trouble sleeping. As I have for many years now. And even though I know realistically it's probably not going to happen,  I just keep imagining some monster is going to come into my room at night and do the same to me.  And I get a lot of anxiety at night if I accidentally roll onto my stomach.  


So basically, I want to know... is it possible that this movie could have caused some trauma and is there any way I can recover from this so that it won't plague me for the rest of my life? I already go to therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression but my next appointment is about a week or more away. And is this something I should bring my up to my therapist.    


Thanks in advance."
268,hello rant,"I often experience anger, self hate, sadness. I do not know what it feels like to be happy I don’t think I’ve been happy for a long time. I do not get happy to eat my favorite food or singing my favorite song. It’s just emptiness is what it feels similar to being on auto pilot much like a hollow shell of what was once myself being operated by a dying man grasping to the remnants of who he once was. I tried therapy all I got was bills and basic coping mechanisms I have already learned. I tried meds (prozac) which made me feel worse. Now after feeling better I find myself back in the hole I had just escaped with si becoming more common. I am on the path to loving others since I do not know how to love myself. When working I often come into conversation with people in bad situations I buy them food, give them books and when the weather is bad I let them stay in my truck until the weather settles down. I feel loved as a friend when I help them so I do it as often as I can it helps me a lot more than it helps them. If I cannot love myself I will love others continuously."
269,I want to get better but,"Every time I talk with a therapist, I find myself struggling to be honest. I can't communicate how I feel so I sweep it under the rug. I want to get better, but I don't want to be a nuisance to those around me. I want to get better but I don't know how."
270,Work more and put my mental health at risk or be patient with my sched,"I work as an online teacher. Since Xmas is approaching, I am planning to buy gifts for my family and friends and a tablet for myself. The thing is, I want to have a tablet asap but I do not have enough money to buy one. And I actually to buy one from a high-quality brand. I can adjust my work hours, but I am having a dilemma whether I should work full-time for 5 days a week or part-time for 6 days a week. I'm not sure but I might put my mental health at risk if I handle more classes but I need the money also. I can also be patient and stick to my schedule until I can buy myself a tablet and gift for others. What do you guys think?"

272,I'm tired of being put down whenever I have good news,"Today my tattoo artist messaged me to reschedule an appointment and to my surprise she was able to schedule it a lot earlier. This was great, since I've been trying to get this tattoo done since August.

Took this news to my parent, elated, hoping I would at least get a ""that's great!"". Instead I got no response, she just stared back with a straight face and said nothing while I kept trying to get a positive response from her.

In an instant I was drained of whatever positivity I had and went back to locking myself in my room. I cried and wondered why it's so hard for someone to be happy for me at least once.

I'm so tired of not having anyone to share good news with. Rarely any good ever happens to me and when it does and I want to share my excitement and happiness, I'm beaten down. I'm tired."
273,My mom is screaming for help and I don’t know how to,My mom (45) has casually brought up conversations with me about wanting to kill herself or be gone after my brothers pass away (they both have Duchenne muscular dystrophy).

Was wondering if anyone has any advice or input 

Thank you"
277,What influence does being kind to people have on mental health?,Why is this text needed?
278,Has anyone else had a therapist that is just okay?,"I feel terrible even using those words because my current therapist is very nice and sweet. It's just that I can't tell if I'm the problem or need someone else. I'm on my 5th therapist I believe and with the past four, I was too much and eventually refused to see anyone. With this one I feel that although she's helpful, our work doesn't reach me at my core. I've been told that talking to your therapist about what you need from them helps and needing a different therapist is not an issue, and I believe that. It's so strange that I had a certain set of words to get this point across a moment ago but I'm explaining as best as I can. She's not a bad therapist, I just feel that she isn't for me even though we get along well."
279,I can’t cry,"Hi guys, I’ve never been on this subreddit before but I was wondering if anyone has advice for me. For the past couple months, every time I feel like crying or even want to cry, I can’t. It feels like a mental block, like something inside of me is telling me I don’t have to. But crying is a big part of letting my own emotions out and feeling better, so this “block” is counterintuitive. Did something happen to me? It’s been a really hard couple of months and I’d just like to know if this is trauma related, or something I need to work through. Does anyone have advice or insight? Thank y’all."
280,I think I have anxiety but I don’t want to self-diagnose,"It’s the early hours of the morning and I have an exam tomorrow and I have a tendency to shy away from my things relating to my emotions so if I don’t return to this post or you find it deleted at a later date forgive me I appreciate anyone who responds but I need to get this off my chest

A friend recently sent me (18m) a post with a list of symptoms of anxiety that I have never heard of before, pretty much all of which struck a chord with me;
•unpredictable bouts of rage or irritability
•’nit-pickiness”/hypersensitivity to disarray, change, etc. 
•fast talking, stuttering, stumbling over words
•not talking at all
•seeming ‘zoned out’ - staring into space

I’ve been to cbt before but I’m not sure I was as open as I should’ve been. I also didn’t go off of the back of a diagnosis so I’m not sure if I have any problems. 

I suppose I should say that for a long time I’ve felt like there’s some sort of issue. I’ve always struggled in social scenarios and had low self esteem. Despite having a lot of friends I have always felt like something of an outsider. Since my last relationship ended badly any sort of affection, platonic or otherwise, makes me quite uncomfortable. My mum has always called me a ‘worrier’ from a young age and my friends tend to point out that I worry a lot about minor things and overthink. 

Recently I think I had an anxiety attack. I’m not exactly sure because I’ve heard they’re all different but I’ll describe it as best I can. 
It was around 11pm and I think I had some work due for the next day (self-isolating due to covid so all online) this is as well as exams coming up so I was pretty stressed. I think I was looking over what I had to do or something, I’m not sure if there was a specific trigger, but I got this massive sense of just fear of just pretty much everything. I’m not sure how else to describe it. I wasn’t struggling to breathe in the way that I felt like I was suffocating, but it felt like I couldn’t get enough air in, yet I was never worried that I would actually not be able to get enough air in, if that makes sense. I also felt the urge to move and do something. While it didn’t seem to help much, it did seem to feel better than sitting doing nothing. So I ended up kind of tapping my foot/shaking my leg. 

I should mention that I do drink and smoke. It’s the norm where I come from from about the age of 14. I don’t smoke a massive amount, maybe 1 or 2 a day. But anyway I went out for a walk at this point (shortly after 11, I’d say) and a cigarette, which usually calms me down, but it didn’t seem to work all that well. It wasn’t definitely better than when I left but I felt drained and the underlying fear still seemed present, just not at the forefront of my mind. 
Honestly I’m not sure what I want from this post, perhaps someone can give me their perspective, or maybe I just want to rant, either way it feels like I needed to get this off my chest. 

P.S. I forgot to mention I have developed something of an obsession with working out. I’m in good shape and I like to look in the mirror and like what I see but it feels like it’s becoming a problem. If I don’t work out it will hang over me all day and I won’t be able to get anything done and I’ll feel like shit. If I retain any sort of fat and my abs are even slightly less visible I start to freak out. Honestly I feel like a narcissistic prick writing this so I hope I don’t come across that way but I feel that’s important to what I’m trying to say. I’ve always been athletic and I’ve always worked out to some degree since I was 11. I was quite big for my age back then and I’ve sort of developed a reputation for being ‘that guy’. It’s become a major part of my identity and I don’t think I could ever leave it behind. I’m not sure I think that’s pretty much everything 

If anyone has any thoughts at all please let me know them I’m not sure where to go from here but this mindless fucking slog through life of just constantly never being able to relax is wearing me down at this point. It’s been going on for years now I suppose and idk what to do.

* I constantly have to pick at parts of my body. For example, my scalp and hair, my lips, my ears and my earrings, my acne, my eyes, my eyelashes, my nails, my teeth, my skin.. Sometimes I try to rip out the hair on my body, mainly my arms and legs with just my nails. There was a point a few years ago where I would also rip pieces of my skin off on my arms and legs until they were covered in red marks from all the places I had picked at my skin(sometimes I would even bleed). When my hands aren’t busy doing something I often get the urge to pick at a part of my body. Sometimes it’s something that isn’t a body part, like two years ago I realized my science workbook was covered in a thin layer of plastic so I’d spend my classes trying to peel it off and I realized that it was making a lot of noise and people were noticing but I just HAD to keep on doing it. Things like that, but I mostly do it with different parts of my body, especially my scalp and lips. Doing this brings me comfort and satisfaction.
* I get urges to do certain things repeatedly until I’m satisfied. For example I sometimes will be in the middle of doing something and I’ll just need to squeeze my hand or shrug my shoulder or something, and then do it again, and again until my mind decides I’ve done it enough times. Or I could tap my finger against something and sometimes I’d need to do it again a specific number of times.
* I often need to re-read things for no reason or I have to re-write things because it doesn’t look “neat enough” and I’ll just have to erase and rewrite it over and over again until it looks perfect, even though it looked fine from the beginning. At some point in elementary school whenever I’d write in pencil I had to go over it again and again until it was as dark as possible and you could see the trace of it on the other pages under. It was really extreme, to the point where my mom and teacher noticed and would be really disappointed in me since it partly caused me to be \*really\* slow when working so I was always very behind.
* Sometimes I count how many times/how long it takes to do something. For example, counting steps. Or I’ll just give myself a specific amount of time to do things for no reason. For example, I could tell myself “You need to be downstairs in 15 seconds” and that’s all I’d focus on and I’d just run out of my room and down the stairs and if I don’t make it it really bothers me. Another example of a similar thing is when I’m walking to my bus stop, I tend to focus on the size of my steps and make sure the distance between each step is equal.
* Often, when I do something with one side of my body, I need to do it with the other. Like, if I hit my left foot against something I need to do it with my right foot. But it’s more complicated than that; if, when I hit my right foot I did it too hard and it didn’t match the hit my left foot took, then I need to hit my right foot again so this time it matches the impact my left foot had, but I also need to hit my left foot again, as hard as I hit my right foot the first time. Then I’ve hit both of my feet twice, with equal levels of impact, so I’m satisfied.
* Whenever I think of something bad/extreme/embarrassing happening I always specifically have to say the word “nevermind” in my head after to make sure it doesn’t happen. Like, “What if I’m supposed to get my period today but I forgot so I’m not wearing a pad or tampon and everyone will see and I’ll be humiliated and I won’t ever get to show my face in public again? Hmm.. Wait, no. Nevermind.” “I’m going to get coronavirus today. No, nevermind.” “What if I get burned alive? … Nevermind.” It’s weird, I know these things probably won’t actually happen but my brain seems to subconsciously think that whatever I think of will happen in the future, unless I say the word “nevermind.”
* I don’t know if this matters but I’m generally very paranoid. I always think I’m being watched and that somebody is reading my mind.
* I hoard things A LOT. I often want to get rid of things but I’m like, “Nah, I’m sure I’ll need it later.” even if it’s very clearly useless. I tend to uselessly collect things I don’t really need or already have enough of such as flannels, books I know I won’t have time to read, old photos on my phone, crystals/rocks... And on the weirder side of things, I once kept a whole ass tower of used empty tissue boxes in my room I didn’t want to get rid of. Another time when I was younger I collected those little things on the top of soft drink cans that are used to open them. I have a strange obsession with collecting things; in a weird way it makes me feel more organized?
* I often need to touch or feel things. For example, I’ve stopped doing this since I’m being really careful not to catch unnecessary germs cause of covid, but whenever I’d walk into a store I just had to touch, pick up or sometimes just feel everything that I saw and looked remotely interesting to me.
* I’ve been doing all of the things I mentioned above for as long as I can remember, since I was little. And yeah, I sort of realized that repeated twitching and obsessively picking dandruff out of your scalp until you feel pain whenever you gently tug your hair was kind of weirdo behaviour, but other than that I pretty much thought I was acting normal until like two hours ago?

283,Writing,"I'm writing a story, and I would like to know how I could tackle the subjects of mental health and abuse in a way to spread awareness. How could I go about this in a way that would raise awareness, while also not touching any sensitive topics for those affected."
284,I feel like I have to exaggerate everything just to get someone to care,I'm so tired. I try looking for the right words to convey how I'm feeling and its like I'm not deep enough. My life is either too fucked up for people to understand to not fucked up enough. i'm tired. i don't know how people do this without breaking

286,I barely remember my childhood but it wasn’t traumatic?,"I’ve been looking around for an answer as to why I barely remember anything from my childhood. But, all I find are things relating to trauma and repressed memories. While I would say I grew up in a stressful environment (brother is non-verbally autistic) and I was verbally teased in elementary school I wouldn’t call any of it traumatic or anything.

For more context, I was diagnosed with AD(H)D at some time when I was around 6-to-10 yo. I did take medication then (don’t remember what) until 6th grade when I was taken out of public school to be homeschooled. I was also tested for autism and was just barely off the spectrum. Despite that, I do have some similarities with my brother (mainly rocking, niche interests, a distaste to being touched, and sound processing issues.) I would say I suffer from symptoms of anxiety and depression but I haven’t seen a professional to confirm if I have the conditions, if they’re side-problems from the ADHD, or if it’s just in my head.

Edit- just now because I forgot to add: I didn’t have any friends when I was younger and mainly played alone. Maybe my childhood was just so boring that I never really made memories?"
287,Hopeless (57),"I’m a divorced 57 yo woman. I need to vent. I lost my job due to Covid and have no idea what to do next. I’ve wasted months of spare time when I could’ve been learning a language or done some other self improvement. Both of my parents have advanced dementia, and my stepdad might have colon cancer. I’m recently estranged from my only sibling over disagreement over the care of our parent. My kids are spread out and I likely will not see them over the holidays for the first time ever. It’s all I’ve looked forward to this whole crappy year, but due to Covid, they’ll probably stay put. I see a counselor on occasion but will soon be losing my healthcare. I’ve always been physically active and fit which has always helped manage anxiety, but even that hasn’t been working and I’ve gained probably 15-20 lbs this year. I’ve never felt so bad about myself. 

I feel beyond stressed,hopeless, and lost. I have no one I can talk to. I guess I’m whining and feeling sorry for myself, I should be happy to be alive. Does anyone have any words of insight or advice?"
288,Please help,"Hello I am a 1st year college student and I just wanted to ask for a word of advice. I have anxiety and depression sometimes they get so bad that I go through episodes where I don't want to do anything. I don't want to eat, bathe, leave my bed, talk to people and worst of all I don't want to do my school work and attend my classes. Because of this I have fallen behind a few of my classes and have accumulated of a lot of missing assignments but I don't know how to my teachers that.

290,Feeling as if I’m about to lose it,"Hi all 

Do you ever feel like you are about to lose your mind? 

Sometimes I’m scared that I will lose it. It feels as if I just want to scream so loud! The anxiety takes over me and I ruminate and all the thoughts from past unpleasant situations come to my mind and I feel embarrassed. I feel helpless because I can’t focus on other things. 

How do you control such thoughts? What helps you?"
291,I'm sick of being told there is help.,"There is no help for anything, at least not in the US. Only people with money get help. I just want to kill myself because I can't get any help. I've asked for help and all I ever get are beaten up by cops and giant medical bills with no tangible help. Either help me or just let me die."
292,"My partner has OCD and Major Depressive Disorder. I want to break up, but I'm worried they may harm themselves.","I sincerely apologize for length.  This is a complicated issue.  I've highlighted the most important sentences in bold if it helps to just read those alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

**I (20M) have been drifting away from my boyfriend (19) for a few months now**. We’re both college students, and this semester has been very, very rough for me due to school being online. My boyfriend has had a much easier semester and is doing well academically, but I’m not. **It’s caused some mental health issues for me – including depression, burn out, and anxiety – that I haven’t had before** (I’m seeking treatment though, so please, no comments about that: I’ll be fine). We’ve been together for almost two years now, and **he’s very much in love with me** (and I was in love with him).

As a result of my mental health, I’ve been slowly drifting away from my relationship. We’ve been in a rough patch for a few months now, and it’s only increased as time has drawn on. I still very much care about my boyfriend – he’s a great person with an amazing personality that I’m very lucky to have had a relationship with – but I know that at the current phase of my life, I am not able to handle a relationship. Being the sweet, kind, amazing person that my boyfriend is, he very much has tried to help me through my metal and academic hardships this semester. 

But to provide a little more background, it’s necessary to understand that **my boyfriend has been diagnosed with OCD and Major Depressive Disorder** (anyone who has experience with either of these will know exactly how hard it is for someone who is afflicted). This is something that has really never gotten in the way of our relationship, and I’ve always been happy to provide support through the good days and the bad, as he has done for me. With my current mental state, I know that I can’t be the person to provide support for him anymore.  I realized it was time to break up when I saw myself no longer wanting his help for my problems and getting frustrated and angry with him when he’s done nothing wrong. My **relationship feels burdensome to me and like one of the thousands of other tasks I’ve been juggling this semester just to try and stay afloat.** When I noticed this, I also noticed that my boyfriend was not my go-to person for support anymore, and that **I’m not in love with him.** This is coupled also with lessened sexual attraction as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The Central Issue: 

Given his history of mental illness and my history of being supportive of him, **I’m worried that if I break up with him, he’ll have no one to turn to for support when his mental health inevitably hits one of its low points, and there’s a chance he could harm himself**. When I met him, he was much worse off than he is now, and while I’m not taking sole credit for his improvement (because he is a very strong and capable individual that has fought for his recovery), I know that I’ve been his cushion to fall back on when he needs help. 

As a result of his OCD, he has intrusive thoughts that manifest in various ways and cause extreme anxieties and low self-worth. As a result of his Major Depressive Disorder, he has bouts of depression, and both illnesses cause ideations of self-harm. He’s never harmed himself before, but he’s come close, and I’ve always been there to stop him or provide support; he also knew that the next time I saw him naked, he wouldn’t be able to hide any of the cuts. **But without our relationship, he has no obligation to me (or anyone) not to harm himself.** He has friends that can help, but they aren’t nearly as close as I am to him with these issues, and his parents (whom he still lives with) are causing several anxieties for him at the moment. He goes to therapy, but only about once a month for reasons that are irrelevant to this post.

***What advice do you have for someone in my situation?*** I want to breakup, but I’m very worried that he’ll end up hurting himself from the pain of the breakup. **He’s very much in love with me, and I’m not in love with him.** I still deeply care about him as a friend, though, and I don’t want to lose him from my life either. I still want to be there to support him, too, but as a friend and not a partner. I realize this may not be possible, ***but is there any advice for at least how to hand the break up?***"

294,My brother said I’m ‘stagnant’ because I’m working retail and didn’t finish college yet...,Granted I need to finish math but that’s always been my hardest subject.... he’s kind a condescending... how should I respond in the future? I just told him financials and all that crap aren’t really any of his business
295,I don't have a good title,"So... My great grandfather just passed today, when I woke up to see my dad's text, saying ""when you see this call me"", I knew that it had to do with my great grandpa, and I was right, I guessed exactly right. I knew the moment I saw that message that he had died, but I wasn't surprised or sad, I accepted it as life as I do with all deaths. I'm not sad at my great grandpa's death, he had a nice life and it was his time to go, but it the realization of many other things that really got me. I got hit with the strange feeling of wanting to be sad and not being able to at all... I was sad that I wasn't the right kind of sad, I was happy (not in a sadistic way) and that's all I've been feeling for a long while. I got out of a deep depression and stayed that way till I realized I wasn't happy with happy. I tried making myself sad by rewatching a show that is precious to me 'Clannad' and 'Clannad after story'. I haven't ended up even starting it again cause going into it I didn't feel right. I was afraid I would not be sad watching it again and it not having the magic it did when I first watched it. TL;DR I am not happy with being out of my depression because it feels so unnatural being happy, I'd be happier being able to feel sadness once again."
296,"Stressed, Anxious, and Confused","First time posting on here, mostly because I have no idea where else I could get some help from. 

To set the scene, I'm on the autism spectrum (used to be asperger's on the DSM4), I've been dealing with depression for years now, but the anxiety thing is pretty new to me (a little more than a year).

I'm currently working as a behavior therapist for children who are either on the spectrum or have a developmental delay, and although it's not my end goal, it's still a job where I can do what I like. 

That being said, my stress and anxiety have shot through the stratosphere. I've held down part time jobs with more hours for longer before, but for some reason I've already almost broke down crying while on shift, and it's only been a month. Breathing exercises didn't do Jack all for me and I had to leave for a minute. 

I have theories for a lot of this. My schedule makes it so I can't see my SO very often, the transition from college to work, my parents expectations for me to work a 40 hour week even though it takes me more than 2 days to ""reset"" after a work week, and of course the whole covid thing going on (I'm canadian btw)

Man, I'm really not wanting to post this now, but, I've got only my dignity and what little of my sanity I have left to lose. 

Could be a case of me not knowing how to handle stress, or something completely unrelated, I've got no clue. I'm hoping someone either has some advise or can link me to some resources that are free/cheap? I've got most of my money tied up in car insurance for the moment.

Thanks in advance to anyone who happens across this, and sorry if the formatting is weird, I'm on mobile doing this right before bed (cause this is when I get my last bit of motivation anyway)."

298,I haven’t s*lf-h*armed in almost four months now! :),"I censored just in case, and potential trigger warning!! 

I cut for over a year after a really difficult move. I was really depressed, my best friends still lived in the same place while I moved to a different time zone on the opposite side of the country completely alone (with my family). I didn’t have a choice as I’m a military brat. It was really rough and once I started cutting I got so scared and went to therapy almost immediately. My mom found out, and my parents reactions definitely weren’t the best, lets leave it at that. Concerned for my well being, but didn’t quite deal with it in the best way IMO.

But anyways I’ve made amazing new friends here, keep in touch with my old friends (one of which is now my gf!!) and feel so much better about myself. I’ve been working out, studying hard, got a job and started making money to get supplise for my new hobbies. And I haven’t cut in almost four months now!! I still get urges, but I combat them by doodling excessively over the place I want to cut, or going on a walk or distracting myself with a fun workout instead.

Noone knows I cut in the first place (except my parents) and I kinda dont have anywhere to express myself freely and be proud of myself, but figured I could post here. I still struggle with some mental health stuff, but things have gotten so much better for me and I want you guys to know it’ll get better for you too :)"
299,Depressed Mama seeking advice for anxious child,"TL:DR- 9 y/o daughter is showing signs of mental illness. Anyone here that started having problems young? What helped you? 

———

As the title says, I’m a mother with depression. I’ve been fortunate to have good medical care and a support system in place, and things are generally good.

Friday, my 12 year old expressed deep concern about her 9 year old sister. The 9 y/o (I’ll call her “A”) mentioned to her big sister that sometimes she wants to die and kill herself.  

So, yesterday, “A” and I went on a long walk and I carefully broached the subject. (I’ve taught teenagers for 15 years and have gotten really good at not asking leading questions) Thankfully her suicidal ideas are not specific and I don’t feel that there is any immediate danger. 

We had a great conversation about intrusive thoughts, how it’s normal for people to have these kinds of thoughts, and how there was nothing bad or wrong about it. I shared some of my experience with her and reassured her that her dad and I would always love and support her, and that she can come to us for help. She told me she felt relieved and that she was glad we talked. 

“A” struggles with ADHD, anxiety, and seemed to have some OCD tendencies with her thoughts. My husband and I are not against medication, but we don’t know that we want to start her so early.  “A” just turned 9 a few months ago. Husband and I knew that mental health concerns would probably impact our children, so it’s not a shock, but she’s just so young. 

Our primary care physician is fantastic and manages my medications. I am going to reach out to him this week because I think this needs to be on his radar.

My husband and I wonder how much her diet is impacting things- we notice that she tends to have more troubles when she eats too much sugar. 

So I guess my question is this... is there anyone here who began having mental health issues at a young age? How did you manage it? Was there anything that worked or didn’t work for you?"
300,How do you healthily cope with having so little time to enjoy life when working full-time?,"I worked FT before when I was in a bad place mentally, so I just drudged through until I had a mental breakdown. But nowadays I'm doing significantly better, and am working FT again.

&amp;nbsp;

But I'm finding that I just don't. have. time. Something so simple as playing through a video game suddenly takes months, bc 90% of my time is either working, sleeping, eating, cooking, cleaning, running errands, or carving out a precious couple hours a week to see my family.

&amp;nbsp;

It's like anything and everything I want to do, no matter how insignificant, now takes ten times as long. I actually counted out my daily time aside from the aforementioned required bits. It's about 3 hours. A day.

&amp;nbsp;

Every time I think about that I almost have a panic attack. My work itself is pretty alright, but it's the toll it takes on my life as a whole. I cry in bed every Sunday night, as I'm just writing this, my throat feels like it's closing in and I'm resisting the urge to pull at my shirt as if it's restricting my breath. Some days I think ""wow im doing so good"" and days like today it feels like im literally about to combust."
301,I can't handle my household anymore,"So lately my attitude towards my mother has even through the roof; I seriously can't take her shit anymore. She always has to make these little comments here and there, she never fucking listens whenever I present a problem to her, she's a fucking liar. I remember last year in November I had an emotional breakdown and holy fuck did she scold me about it, it didn't even sound like she was concerned about it but more more just not wanting to deal with something serious like that. Whenever we have an argument and I try to tell her some truth she just fucking threatens me to be quiet or she'll slap me if I don't, she always has to say everything in such an aggressive tone and than gets pissed when I respond back with anger, she reminds me of those high school girls that's gotta talk shit about everything and when you get into an argument with her it's not civil it always has to be taken the next level with her. I'm always in fear that I'm not doing anything right when I'm doing something, I fear that she'll yell at me or get annoyed and continue to yell at me. Whenever I argue with her she always brings up the point ""oh we give you everything you want and this is the thanks we get"" WHAT THE FUCK AM I NOT ALLOWED TO BEING UPSET OR ANGRY OR SAD, IS THAT JUST NOT ALLOWED AT ALL THE FUCK, ITS A HUMAN THING. I fucking hate her, I fucking hate this house, I fucking hate myself."

Obviously, they don't want to have people over this year. Everyone is having Thanksgiving alone. That means I don't get to see anyone in my family but my husband and kids for the first time in my life. 

I thought it wouldn't be a big deal but it is all of the sudden. I was excited but now I feel like I am missing out on time with them. I know I have it way better than so many people. I feel guilty for getting upset. So, I'm feel bad for being so weapy."

309,Just wanted to share this...,"It's my birthday and for the last few days I felt actually pretty good for no good reason and wanted to share.
First I'll say that I was always quiet/shy I never really know what to say to people I don't know well enough, that was a reason for my feelings you'll read about later here.
Since last year I was completely away from any social life, had no friends or partner (never had one but that's another story) there was a reason for this but in retrospect wasn't a good enough reason, at least before covid.
Then this summer I got to the army and the first two months were almost the lowest point of my life, that's what it felt like, I wanted to die every day, wasn't even happy no matter what happened.
But then last week, after I got my post in the army and was there working for a week, something tragic happened in my family and they had to go out of town, so I was alone at home this week, and also in my birthday, and for some reason I feel great.
First day I was home in these circumstances I really felt like everything is going according to plan, I'll have friends and partner, I'll pass this and that thing, like inner peace in movies. I started working out! Even if only a bit.
Now I'm going back to the base, hope I'll still be this positive and to not let this momentum of well-being stop.

All I had to say for now, so I hope we all will feel better soon."

313,Today was a good day!,I’ve had a really rough year and the last week has been especially bad but it felt like something just switched today. I felt clear headed and my anxiety was much better than it has been for a while. It might not seem like a lot but days like this are what keep me going. I know that there will be hard days ahead but at least I know that there will be days like today as well. I spend way too much time thinking about the negative things in my life so I thought I would share something positive.
314,I don't see the point in anything,"I am constantly skipping online class because the teachers call out students randomly, asking them to explain stuff and that makes me incredibly anxious so I just leave the meeting. I love the topics we're learning about, but this one part makes me leave class and I hate it. Besides I keep thinking about what the point is of all this.

I'm not necessarily passionate about anything. I'm not good at anything. With what I have, I can't survive here. I'm sorta good at art and cooking. But it's more helpful if you're good at math or science. I can't present anything in front of a crowd. But half of my grades depend on that...

It just feels like I'm not anything society wants me to be. What am I working hard for? Lets be real, I'm not even working hard anymore. I'm average. I do the bare minimum and my results are average. I'm barely getting by. I just can't find the motivation to do anything. 

What is the point of someone like me? If I can't be good at anything, if I can't find a reason to stay motivated, if I can't survive in this world, why am I even trying?

Yesterday I was wondering why I'm even doing the smallest of things anymore. Like waking up, showering, watching tv etc. I was wondering why I hadn't given up on life considering I feel like I'm not meant to fit in this world. I found out its because I'm shit scared of death itself, I don't want the money my parents spent on me to go to waste, I don't want to traumatize my family members and because even if I do leave this earth, wherever I go, I won't be able to be with my pet dog and cats.

I realized I'm not living for myself but for others. If I'm only alive to satisfy others, where am I supposed to get the motivation for myself? I have a goal in life not because it's real but because I'm 18 and I'm supposed to have a goal. I'm not passionate about anything. I don't love or want to work hard for anything. With all this, what do I do. 

It's hard because i don't want to be here. But i have to. I'm forced to do these things and I'm always this close to ending it all but I never do because I'm afraid of what'll happen after I leave... it all just feels pointless that I'm existing for someone else and am forced to do shhit and feel like shit everyday just for these few reasons and none of them being, for myself."

316,Did I let it happen?,"I’ve been sexually assaulted by my “best friend” multiple times, and I forgave him everytime.

I was a serious full on addict, he was my supplier and he used my addiction against me to hold power over me. He also systematically abused me mentally for years and years into a very toxic friendship where he relied on me emotionally and for affection, it started off slow and platonic, just like kind of leaning against me while watching a movie or putting a leg over mine, but somehow turned into “harmless” cuddling, I let him cuddle me because I didn’t want to be abandoned by my “best friend”

The worst instance though, I wasn’t like completely out of it, I was aware, so I feel like I should’ve been strong enough to stop it from happening to me, I was AWARE of his hands all over me and I hated every second of it. We were alone in a hotel room on a holiday when it happened. He asked to give me a massage, I didn’t want it, but I felt like if I said no, he would get angry and I was stuck alone with him in a hotel room, so I said okay (that was the only thing I said okay too) but then he started taking off my clothes and complimenting my body and by this point I was (too) gently telling him to stop please, but he wasn’t listening, I told him I do not want to have sex with him, and he kept trying to “convince me”, by continuing to put his hands on my body, I didn’t know how to make it stop and then he penetrated me with his finger and my insides shattered but outwardly I was too afraid to express it. I hate myself so much for this but I actually *pretended* to enjoy it for a second in the hopes that he would stop, I thought if he thought he had made me cum he would finally stop trying maybe? I don’t know why 😞 He put my hand on his dick, and my limp arm just laid there. At some point I got up, went into the bathroom and collapsed and cried in the shower, after about an hour I came out, still crying and asked him never to touch me again and he guilted me into feeling sorry for HIM by saying all this really self-depreciating stuff, how he loved me but he was too ugly for me, he literally made me feel bad that I didn’t want to have sex with him. 

This happened about 4 years ago, he’s no longer in my life, i wish I could say that was when our “friendship” ended, I FORGAVE him and blamed myself for letting it happen and then completely blocked out the memory until it hit me like a tonne of bricks the other night in bed, I could remember it all, his hands all over my body and inside me and how much I hated it and how scared and trapped I felt in that hotel room. 

The thing is, there’s a part of me telling me that I did let it happen. I put myself in a vulnerable situation, and I let him give me a back massage. Why didn’t I throw him off of me? Why didn’t I scream bloody murder and run? Why did I just disassociate and well, let it happen"
317,Can’t stop obsessing,"Hi I’m new here so not sure what to expect.. 
Long story short I have dealt with mental health issues since I was a kid (now 23) and have never sought out help just have always toughed it out. Thing is, I went through something traumatic just over a month ago and have developed an unhealthy obsession to try and suppress some feelings. I think about it first thing in the morning last thing before bed.. and all throughout the day. What makes it worse is it’s something that’s pretty much a one in a million chance but I feel in my soul that it’s going to happen I feel like I’ve literally seen in the future and it’s real. How do I stop obsessing over this?! It’s taken over my life.. I argue with myself all day telling myself it’s impossible then convincing myself I see signs that it’s real! My jaw hurts from clenching my teeth are sore from the grinding I either sleep for 13 hours or only get a couple hours I cannot stop thinking about it! I need help"
318,Just a little help. What do I do now?,"I just want to be happy again. This is my first time on the sub so I'm sorry if I used the wrong flair

I know this may seem edgy but I wish stuff wasn't this hard. Life sucks right now and it's making me depressed. School used to be so fun and playing the Violin was so joyful to do. But the passion just kinda burned out.

My Asian parents have such high expectations for me because of my 2 older brothers that I feel so worthless compared to them. I'm expected to get at least a 3.9-4.0 (An A+) in all of my classes and it just gets harder and harder every day. I make the smallest mistakes and both my brothers and parents start nagging at me for it. My parents aren't abusive nor are my brothers, but I don't know how to even say hi to them without feeling awkward. Our relationship has been blocked by both a language barrier and culture that it's nearly impossible for me to bond with them in a positive way. I know a decent amount of Korean, but I can only do small talk.

My friends seem smarter than me in nearly every subject, AP classes are just building up in homework and stress, and I have no idea how to be relaxed anymore. Everyone has cool hobbies while I'm playing my instrument once a month. Friends are doing sports, languages, and arts, that it's hard to ever feel relevant when I'm with them as well.

The funny thing is, is that I feel like I have it so much easier compared to other people as well, I feel lucky that I'm even able to stand here and stuff like that, but on the flip side, I feel weak for thinking this stuff is hard. I'm just sad now, I feel I will never meet my parents and my own expectations, and I'll just be dwarfing in my Bedroom all day playing videogames. I need advice please before I lose my mind..."
319,I’ve felt stupid and made to feel stupid/shamed about feeling the way I do about my introduction to sex at a young age,"This is something I’ve been extremely ashamed of for as long as I can remember, probably since it first happened. I’ve only told one person about it and could barely say it. 

I honestly can’t remember the first time this happened, but my parents would either get rid or me like tell me to go get something or to ask my sister a question to be able to have sex in the mean time. I’ve caught them every time when I came back. I can’t even count how many times they’ve done it, and I remember a specific time I was so scared of them doing it again that I was on the verge of tears to not go ask my sister a stupid question that just gave them time; I was yelled at and forced to do it, I cried and went to ask her, I remember being shaky. I went back to my parents and caught them again. 

It graduated to them having sex in bed with me. While I was sleeping I would wake up and see them both naked having sex right in front of me. They would have sex under the blankets when I was awake right next to them playing a video game, when I was awake in the room on the computer and could hear them. 

I was only 4-6 years old at the time I can remember it starting. 

I caught them once when they forced my sister and I to wash our cat for their own *needs*. I came out and saw it all on display, yet again, and began crying and they didn’t stop. My sister had to pull me away into the bathroom again and distract me. 

My mom refuses to admit or believe it affected me at all. I think otherwise. It wasn’t until a couple years ago I began thinking about it again, and I feel like it had a lot to do with my sexuality at a young age. My first sexual experience was at 7/8, and before that I was doing other things on my own, which I don’t think is normal(?). 

I also feel like it led me to believe being in bed with my uncle while he was either naked or in just underwear while he talked to me telling me certain things was normal. I feel like something bad happened during those times in bed with him and I don’t know if anyone knew about it. 

I think it’s affected me terribly. I’m ashamed of it. I thought I was being over dramatic about everything with my parents, but I learned having sex in front of your children is considered sexual abuse. I don’t know what to do about this. I’ve repressed it for so long, I’ve tried talking to my mom about it and she brushes it off. 

I think this is the root to the rest of my life (I’m 20 years old) becoming so sexually focused. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is it normal for someone who has gone through what I have to feel this way?"
320,I'm running out of hope right now and I really need some.,"Please read: I'm sure I'm likely the millionth person to say this by now but Covid is making life very difficult for me and I see no out of it right now, Only that it will get worse for everyone. Currently, everyone in my family is unemployed. Our main income source lost his job a few months back because his employer wasn't willing to compromise on virus safety and we cannot get another job, as very few people in my area are taking the safety precautions seriously. Many of my family members are very high risk of death and we just aren't willing to risk that for as long as possible. Secondly is that being stuck at home with my family is becoming an emotional nightmare. My brother is incredibly needy and it's not easy for us to get along. So I either stay in my room most of the day, or spend too much time every day hanging out with a family I feel I cannot easily connect with. Being alone or in a fight with a sibling for 8 months has been slowly ruining my mental state and I cant take it anymore. If someone has hope please tell me. I hear the vaccines will change little unless everyone has them which will obviously not happen. And even if it does, it could take a whole other year to distribute them! America is getting millions of new cases each week, our economy is in shambles and my families finances, nor my mental health can last another year. Even if they do, with this many cases... we're probably bound to get the damn virus eventually anyway. I really hope it's not this hopeless but it really seems to be."

I have heard that anger is a sign of other problems and I am overall very lonely, can't relate to others much and live with my parents. Im not a bad person and am usually very nice to everyone. But as soon as I get angry its like my personality changes and I destroy things. I have destroyed school textbooks, broken computers, and destroyed many things I actually care about.

326,I put a bullet in my head so I could help others with there pain .,"I had just gotten out of the hospital and taken my first dose of ""kepra"" since being home . The seizures had stopped. Life was ""good"" for the first time in weeks . 
It was around 7pm, I know because sundown had just passed. I cant remember what was on the tv , but I know it was just another ""normal"" night , dinner was in the oven (or a pizza box on the counter let's be honest ) I was home with my girlfriend and we were getting ready to sit down with our dogs and wind down. We got into some kind of argument which led me to spiral into negative thoughts and the typical ""stream of bipolar schitzoassociative"" thoughts continued . Except this time it wasnt a stream . It was a floodgate  Under the influence of drugs I was not in the slightest warned about attributing to poor mental health otherwise I may have rejected this form of treatment . My mind was swarming with 1000 thoughts/ second and I didnt even have the cognizance to process one. 
My throat felt dry like I needed to drink a 5 gallon jug of water or I might combust or crack like fragile porcelain. I couldn't articulate what was going on , because I didnt know what was going on . The severity of my panic and the acceleration of ""I dont want to watch this movie "" turning to "" I dont understand my purpose "" continued . My girlfriend left to go get the mail. She said we can talk in one minute when she gets back. The lack of purpose quickly turned to lack of will to continue . I've never self harmed , I've never attempted to hurt myself , but the moment she left I sprinted and grabbed a glock 19 without hesitation . I pulled it back and put it to my head , I didnt say any goodbyes , I didnt stop and think about what I could accomplish if I continued perceviering through lifes temporary struggles , I didnt think about anything other than following through with what I started when I cocked it back five seconds ago. *Click* *I did it*......""What happened !?!?!?"" ""I'm still here"" The gun jammed. I looked down , I smacked the side of it in anger . *Boom* I shot a hole in the wall , dropped to my knees and the loop of negativity was gone. My ears are ringing , my body is trembling , and I'm processing what happened ,questioning how I got to that point . My girlfriend walked back from getting the mail . ""What'd you break "" ... ""myself "" . ""I'm sorry"" . 




Please use this story from 2018 that I am sharing with you now as a reminder . 

Gun safety is important . 

Stop and breathe before you act, often times your emotions shape your reality. 

Please seek advice on drug safety and awareness of any and all possible side effects . 

 If you ever need to talk and are struggling with mental health please, reach out. And if you do not have the courage to message me personally there are resources. Ultimately none of this wouldve helped me in that situation , and the only thing that would have pulled me from a toxicity fueled drug induced hypnotic state of existential dread would have been meditation and regular practice of self control in order to be better equipt for such an unexpected feeling. 

I love you , no matter who you are reading this. Thank you for being a part of my life. Your existence is Devine,  and you are a valued piece of the whole of creation.🖤🥀🕶"
327,What Am I Feeling,"I am a sexual assault victim. Whenever I’ve been intimate with a boyfriend or even touched/poked by a family member, it sends me into a panic attack. I don’t have any sort of out of body experiences. What I do feel though is that I’m disconnected and trapped in my head. Like I can’t get out. I’m aware of everything that’s happening but I’m completely out of control of my body. I’m stuck in my head and I can’t leave it or gain any sort of control for several minutes. Part of what I’m doing to help me recover from my trauma is being able to name and identify what I’m feeling when I’m triggered. Kind of like putting a name to the face. It helps me accept it as real. Does anyone have any sort of idea what to call this?

The best way I could possibly describe it is that one Dr Who episode where Oswin is in the Dalek. Idk why that comes in my head because I saw it so many years ago but it’s the closest thing I can compare it to. There doesn’t seem to be a word I can attach to that feeling"
328,"Struggling in general, especially in relationships","Before I (m27) begin, I am already seeking professional help. However, due to the pandemic and it being the end of the year, there is currently no room at any of the psychologists in my area.

I have had a rough year. In August 2019 I kicked my girlfriend whom I lived together with out of my house due to cheating, which had previously also happened and which I forgave, in hindsight that was dumb and I have always felt that the trust was never going to fully recover. So I spent 3 years together walking on my toes. But I digress.

Not long after I met a new amazing girl, but as I was still recovering from the previous breakup I kept a bit of distance. We dated a bit, but ultimately I said I needed more time which she understood. I would not want to confess this, but I think it was a truly classic rebound situation.

I think in January this year we got together again and actually started dating, however I was still not done with the whole ex-situation and could not fully commit to her. My ex still had a large portion of mindshare, and I did believe that maybe we could stay in friendly contact. If you ask me now, I have no clue why I would have even wanted that. Imagine the lack of self-respect by somehow wanting to be friends with the person that truly betrayed you multiple times.

So, I ruined things from the get-go with a truly amazing person, as I could not take away her doubts because I did not fully mentally commit until months later. I was worried other people (friends, family) would judge me for moving into another relationship so quickly, I wanted friendship at the time with my ex, etcetera.  
 In the meantime, Covid popped up, I called in sick with a burnout in March (fully recovered work-hours wise in July), and I am struggling heavily with the empty house, empty evenings and not having people around to at least be able to take my mind off of things.

In the end, intimacy became less because I committed too late, I became frustrated and frightened because the same things happened with my previous relationship and I became possessive, jealous and unhappy. I wanted things to work out so badly, but a dynamic had began to exist between us that I felt jealous when she told me she was having a good time with friends, and instead of being happy for her I would become agitated that I could not offer that level of carefreeness. Especially once she said that it felt like we had been a couple for years, and that we had too many discussions instead of having fun conversation.

She was a great mirror as she did show me many sides I like to work on. I want to not feel jealous for other people having a good time, and I’m not sure if this is a remnant of what happened with my cheating ex, or if this something inherent. But also things like being the devil’s advocate a lot (or as I used to call it, empathizing with/seeing it from the other side), which only exaggerates the feeling of having lots of discussions.

In short, I feel like a gigantic mess, and I want to become a better person who is able to just choose for myself and not care at all about those who clearly expressed that they don’t care about me. To just shrug off hypothetical social fears.

Specifically for this relationship, I am not sure if there is a chance of salvaging it. Is there any way to get out of such a toxic dynamic? Do we just need time to “reset”? Or are there things I can do to change my less-than-ideal characteristics, even if I have only a broad feeling of what they are?

I think that this is not something I can begin to understand or treat with the basic cognitive behavioral therapy, as I feel that things have happened in my upbringing that can explain this behavior."

335,The face of my rapists keeps coming back to haunt me,"Back in 2018 a ""friend"" of mine raped me while we were drunk. For a variety of reasons, mostly because my mental health was shit, instead of reporting him or telling him to fuck right off, I developed a very toxic friendship with him. At the moment I thought I was in love with him but after getting better I realized that it was more of a sick obsession than actual love. 

FF to 2019, I finally find the guts to admit this relationship is unhealthy and in a moment of lucidity I am able to tell the guy I'm never going to hear from him again. I thought taking my distance would make me forget about him but it only made me hate him even more. And after one year and a half I'm still thinking about him. I have nightmares where I see him and they just feel so real that they cause me to have breakdowns and panic attacks.

I don't know what to do, I really need to get rid of him but I don't know what else to do. I don't use my socials anymore so I don't risk seeing pictures of him posted by our friends, I moved back to my hometown to stop seeing him around town, I avoid most topics that remind me of what happened, but it still keeps coming back. Can anyone help me figure it out?

Edit: thank you for all you kind responses. Many of you mentioned therapy, that's something I already do for a variety of other reasons. While it has helped me overcome many issues, and mitigating the aftermath of what happened, it's unfortunately not being very effective against these nightmares. That's why I'm looking for a piece of advice that is a little less ""sterile"" than what I usually get from a doctor."

342,Do I tell my doctor about my mood swings,"Hi, I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question or if this becomes too long. But I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor and I am at a lost. 

So back in June I was prescribed some antidepressants due to me being severely depressed. It had gotten to the point where I cried everyday and I was living in paranoia. I always had a feeling i was depressed but i was I never taken seriously. So after finally convincing my mom to take to me the doctor I get medicine. Great right? Well after a few months I was prescribed a higher dosage of medicine. since my depression had gotten worse. and that is where I started noticing some issues. I was having way too much energy and laughing fits. Along with having trouble sleeping and even talking a bit faster than normal. So I go and tell my doctor all about these issues and he asks me if anyone in my family suffers from maniac episodes or if anyone is bipolar. Which I reply that I don’t. So he makes get off of caffeine since he himself doesn’t know the exact problem as to why I have been feeling this way for more than two weeks. Along with lowering my dosage. Then Things starting going a bit back to normal for me. Kinda. After a week of taking lower the dosage I began to feel depressed and sorta Suicidal. It sorta also came from nowhere too, and I still feel the same. Now here is where the problem is and why I am asking my question. 

I was talking to some friends about how my visit had went and things like that. So as I was talking to my closest friend that I have know for a very long time, she tells me that she had always noticed a pattern with me and my moods. That throughout the years she had noticed that I tend to be on the extreme ends with my emotions. She said that I am either extremely happy or extremely sad, and that there wasn’t an between. So this surprises me because for a long time I have noticed that I was like this, but I just assumed I was a very emotional person. I ask some more friends and they all tell me the same thing. all of them saying that it’s like a switch that happens in me. Even my mom told me she has noticed it before. They all tell me that they all noticed this for a long time before I even got diagnosed with depression. 

So should I tell my doctor about my mood swings? Is this completely normal? I don’t want to assume anything yet, but does anyone have an idea why this might been happening? Could it just be the medicine affecting me or something else?"
343,Sexual harassment,"Sexual harassment

I am a 16 year old girl realizing so much experiences that was traumatic for me. When I was 14 years old that was the first time of my life that I ever felt attractive by boys. I would dress up and do my makeup and look cute everyday. One day me and my family were moving our boxes to a truck we borrowed since we were moving apartments at that time. Me and my family were carrying and moving boxes until I hear one construction working man start to whistle at me and holler at me. I ignored it because I didn’t think he was hollering at me. After minutes later when I came out with boxes to move to my truck, a group of construction working men sat down across me facing me. I just thought they must be resting, but they continued whistling and hollering at me for 4 hours straight across from me and facing towards me while I was moving boxes. I was wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top. I told my family that the construction men keep staring at me, my brother tells me it’s because what I’m wearing, he simply says that I am asking for it. At that time I was 14 and I got so mad at him saying what does it have to do with what I’m wearing. He keeps telling me that I’m begging for attention to the construction workers. My mom and sister simply said that what my brother said was wrong and that some men are like that in reality. They never said anything to my brother. I was so raged and angry at that time questioning why he said that to me. I’ve had multiple situations of catcalling and sexual harassment, multiple guy friends sexually harrassing me and insulting me and commenting on my body throughout the years. I am 16 now, and I realize how much I’ve been dominated and controlled by men like that in my life and I feel so bad for myself in the past thinking why didn’t I do this and that. So I just wanted to tell you guys who ever reads this that ur strong and it’s not ur fault. Simply means they are uneducated about women. Do not ever let a someone take control over you emotionally, physically, and mentally. You deserve to be loved. Sometimes you wouldn’t know what ur dealing with in the situation, but if you truly know ur worth u will. Growth takes time and patience."
344,Confused,"Hi everyone,

Basically, for years I’ve struggled with mental health but recently I’ve noticed a pattern in how I’m feeling and I’ll go through it;

I fluctuate a lot, I go from extremely sad to very happy in the space of a day, at my lowest I think I’m the worst thing ever and at my happiest I get the feeling that I am amazing

Sometimes I’m in a sort of ‘meh’ mood where I feel neither happy or sad which is really dull so I usually end up buying something (whether that be a new phone, laptop, whatever I feel like at the time)

When it comes to anger, it’s usually very sudden. It’s a full on 0-100 situation and when I get angry I tend to lash out and throw things, hit things, etc and as soon as I’ve calmed down from that anger I’ll be very upset at myself and end up hating myself for letting myself get angry.

This one is very hard to admit. But I when my partner used to go out drinking with his mates (Covid-19 put an end to that for now!) I had this massive fear that they would find someone else while they were in the club and leave me so I used to say to him that I’m feeling very sad and upset and then he would usually end up saying that he won’t stay out too late and he would meet up with me afterwards to make sure I was okay. Ouch, I hate the fact that I do that, but I honestly do not want to lose him!

And I honestly have no idea who I am, I’ll buy new clothes so I can change how I look quite often and I usually take on characteristics from people I watch on YouTube and TV. But I’m not sure what I like in terms of hobbies, or what I want to do for a job or just simply I don’t know who I am in terms of personality. 

Does anyone have any idea if this is just part of life or if I should talk to my doctor about this because I don’t want to overreact to something that’s normal! Thank you!"

I don't know how to ask for help or tell my parents because mental health isn't really considered important where I'm from (Italy).

347,Stick and poke tattoos as a coping mechanism,"I was really upset tonight and impulsively gave myself two stick and poke tattoos (I used non-toxic ink and sanitized everything as much as possible) since I don’t have access to hair dye and I’m trying to recover from my cutting streak. My opinion is that it is a healthier outlet as it is technically an art form, and stick and poke tattoos are fine as long as you do it as safely as possible. But I am a minor and I can’t get tattoos done by a professional. I want to know if y’all think this is also self destructive or if it’s a safer way to cope."

349,"I feel alone in this, I need to know if someone can relate","I'm sorry if I won't make much sense, I'll try and be as clear as possible (also English is not my first language). Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.

I have memories going back to as early as elementary school where I would feel blocked and unable to fully express myself out of fear of doing something wrong probably. It's almost a physical feeling, no matter how hard I try for example I just can't speak up or the idea of dancing or laughing freely in front of other people is unthinkable, I just get anxious even thinking about it. Some things used to help when I was little, for example singing or acting were doable things, even if I was scared, but as I've gotten older (I'm 20) even those are out of the picture. The few times where I do manage to let myself go I am hit by a wave of anxiety immediately after or a few hours later as I overthink about every little thing I do every day to the point where I memorize entire conversations just by thinking about them too much.

I see a therapist regularly (not now due to Covid, but otherwise I do) and though therapy has helped me a lot with other (more important) problems, this problem is never really adressed as long as I can function normally (and I can I guess). I'm not diagnosed with anxiety and I don't think I suffer from it, when I read about experiences of people who do suffer from it, there's always something that doesn't really sound like me moreover I've never had a panick attack or felt overwhelmed by anxiety, it just blocks me.

I'm used to living like this and I'm sure there are people going through much worse, but I can't help but feel hopeless sometimes because of I am. I block and analyse so much everything I do and feel that I can never feel truly happy. I'm not sad all the time either, but I don't enjoy life. Things have changed a bit lately as I've gotten together with my boyfriend. He somehow got me to slowly open up and I am truly happy when I'm with him even though I still block myself sometimes. But the moment there are other people involved I go back to being anxious and blocked. I feel unable to function socially in a way that makes me happy, I am good at helping others because all I do is listen in silence and I always come off as the shy, polite girl (which I am I guess) when I could be so much more if I let myself be.

I'm sure there are much bigger problems in life, but I'm not happy (boyfriend aside, and I can't spend every waking moment alone with him) and I have never met someone who understands or feels the same way and not having a diagnosis makes it hard to find the right support groups among the mental health community. I just need to know if there is a way to get out of this and if anyone can relate.

I probably wasn't clear at all, but I already wrote too much. If anyone has questions I'll answer them. Thank you to anyone who read this far."
350,I need help,"
[M17] I call it “rollercoaster effect”. It’s not easy to accept it, but i got to deal with it, as I still got to deal with my looks too. It’s like being on a rollercoaster: sometimes I feel good, and very optimistic about my future, and other times I feel very bad. It’s normal to have good and bad periods, normally, but I have ups and down every day.  Just like today… I started sleeping more, studying more, reading more this morning ( I want to have better habits ), but I suddenly felt very bad ( psychologically ) and stared crying and started having suicidal thoughts.

I’m used to this sudden switches… but I’m done with this today and decided to tell someone else too.

To sum it up, I got very bad social problems, linked to my low self esteem. I never talk to people, because I’m afraid I’ll annoy them, or that I’m not worth their time, also because I stutter often. I feel inadequate most of the times, and that’s because of my looks too. I look awful.

My psychotherapist is actually my only friend. I consider her a friend ( secretly ), but that’s just because I can talk to her and feel heeded. She’s actually helping me with my insecurities, but ofc she can’t do anything about how I see myself at the mirror/pictures.  The sad part is that, considering she’s a psychotherapist, she’s paid to listen to me and spend 1 hour of her time with me each week.

I deleted socials, i hated to compare myself with other people. I know it’s a fake reality, but i just hate it

Having this said, (thank you if you’re still reading) this rollercoaster doesn’t bring me anywhere: even if I feel good and want to socialize, as I go out for  walk, my confidence fades away, and I’m not the guy I’d like to be anymore. At least, when I feel good, I can go out and walk as a normal person. But, when I’m sad, I can’t do that neither.

I noticed that, when I go out, I often avoid watching couples of lovers, because it makes me feel very bad. Once, I started crying and feeling goosebumps in the middle of the street, as I saw an happy couple ( they both were 17 like me ). 

I’m just looking for a way to deal with loneliness, but i can’t. I’d just like to be an insensitive person, so i won’t have all of these problems related to girls and couples. I want to say i don’t think it’s girls’ fault, because i’ve seen different not handsome guys with stunning girls. I’m the problem and i feel guilty for it"
351,Am I a bad person?,I’ve noticed that over the years I’ve developed a really nasty habit. Whenever I’m laughing and talking with someone I smile as expected but right as they’re out of eye sight my smile immediately drops. I feel guilty about it every time but it’s not something I’m doing consciously. I worry about someone seeing me do that and feeling hurt. Does this make me a bad person or psycho?
352,I don't know what I am doing,"I can't sleep just laying here in bed feeling sad and very lonely. I am tired of getting the same advice from those who know me. ""it will get better"" ""stop thinking so much"" ""it will be okay"" I know I should get therapy or something but the one time I tried it it didn't help much and now covid so I can't find a new one. I don't know what I am doing but felt like typing"
353,Holidays are coming up..how is everyone doing?,"Holidays can be a hard time of year for many..and luckily, can be a great time for some as well. How is everyone doing?"
354,I'm getting too much anxiety because of an horror game and I am feeling like a failure,"I have been dealing with my mental health for quite a while now and although I am not perfect, I do consider that I have a decent control over my life when it comes to dealing with my anxiety. But because of an horror game all this have changed and I feel like the worse idiot there is. 

I've always known I was a wuss and I accept it and the judgement that comes with it, but I dont want to be this way. I dont want to be super courageous and have run-into-fire kind of nerves, but being able to watch a scary movie of finish an horror game without regressing to the mental state of a 5 year old would be great. 

Everytime I see a trailer for an horror movie/game I always want to know more, I want to know what's the story, what will happen to the characters, but just the trailer is enough to get me running to switch the lights on. I know most good horror games there is, I know how they play, and some of them I checked the story because I dont have the console to play them (like Silent Hill 1 and 2). And I had to go READ the plot online because I couldn't even bring myself to watch a let's play. 

I feel so ridiculous for being such a wuss... So I tried forcing myself to do more horror stuff. And I am not getting dissensitized. I read all the tricks to not be scared. Dont play alone, don't play at night, dont play in the dark, play with no sounds. The thing is, my ""friends"" wont let me use those tricks. Insisting that I will get a better experience at night in the dark. Some even give me ultimatums like ""I will only be with you if you play at night in the dark, you wont need me if you play during the day""

Recently I tried playing Until Dawn. I've heard a lot of good thing about this game, and its actually my boyfriend's favorite game. I'm gonna be honest, I was spoiled a lot of the story. And I thought it would,make it easier. In one day I could only bring myself to do two chapters... And I did the first chapter in the morning... I just can't do it. I know,that 90% of the bad feelings I am feeling,is due to,anticipation (the joys of anxiety), but I can't control it. I hate jumpscares. I despises them. I dont think they are ""cheap scares"" I just can't handle adrenalin. 

""Fight flight or freeze"", I know for a fact that I freeze. Due to some motherly abuse, I mentally freeze under the influence of fear, especially loud noises. Any loud noises. Droped a pan and it was loud? Give my brain 5 seconds to restart. 5 seconds doesn't soumd that bad until you watch 5 seconds go by on a real clock, chronometers shows milliseconds, and psychologically when you see the millisecond it makes the seconds feel less long that they actually are. Then imagine this 5 second freeze in,the midle of an horror interactive movie like Until Dawn. Yay me. 

Not only am I bad at the game, but the extreme thoughts and fear I feel after and before playing is ridiculous. I get flashes of scary images in my mind everytime I hear a sound in my house. The thought imediately goes away as I know monsters aren't real, but my mind is basically jumpscaring me. Great. just. Great. 

I really want to finish this game as it is an,important game,for,my boyfriend, it's something,I want to do, but I dont,think I can. I'm just too much of a wuss... And,it makes me feel like an horrible person. I feel stupid, I feel ridiculous, and I feel this way on top of being scared out of my mind. If I didn't have any dignity, I would curl up in a ball and cry until the bad feelings goes away. 

Funnily enough, I can handle hauted houses pretty well. Me and my best friend went to a few of them and even made one and I have a blast every time. I scream, but I enjoy it. I am not scared of dead. I scream because of the jumpscare and not because I am terrified. I am nervous because I know somewhere somehow someone is going to jump at me, and still I want to go in and I have fun. I am not afraid of death in general. I have accepted the fact I could die at anytime (Memento Mori basically), so real physical threat dont scare me, plus I also know no one will hurt me. But somehow I cant bring myself to play a game I actually want to play...

I guess I just wanted to rant, there is not much tricks I haven't tried already, but I also... I need support for this anxiety... It's so intense every trick I know and usually give to people,on this sub wont work... Its 6 AM where I live and I have been wanting,to,pee for a couple,hours now and I cant bring myself out of bed in sheer terror and its been like 12 hours since I last played. Fear is still as raw as if I still had the controller in hand... I am so ashamed of myself..."
355,Abusive household,Not sure how people without an income leave abusive households but a feel like if I don't do it now I will take my own life..
356,Well this is it I think,"My mental health has hit a new low and I can’t take it anymore, I’m sad to say this but i may be ending my life tonight."
357,Thinking of ditching a social event because I feel so negatively about it,"TW: physical abuse

This is a very minuscule problem as opposed to the other ones that are discussed here but I’d though I’d just shoot my shot and post. (This is also my first time here and sorry if I do something wrong.)

I don’t have any mental health issues btw but if anything I begun feeling a lot of anxiousness and feelings of being overwhelmed since the beginning of last year. 

 I’ve found myself very far away from the person I want to be. I’m in my last year of high school and early this year I was physically abused by a family member and I feel as though that’s where I went downhill. I know I didn’t do the proper healing from that and it affected me not to mention the pandemic since I don’t even know where to start and have been avoiding it. So all this year I’ve felt like like a broken vase held together with tape. I haven’t confided to anyone about what happened also. 

With that being said in my country we’re allowed to go to social events and my school is having a formal (kind of like a prom for the seniors) and I didn’t really want to go in the first place but since another school trip got cancelled because of COVID I thought I might go to it and especially because my friends were really excited for it, which made me a little excited.

Well lately my mental health I fell has been declining rather fast and I really don’t want to go except that I don’t want to disappoint and let down my friends and my teachers who have been such amazing people to me this year without even knowing it. I’ve also already paid ~$80 for a dress with my own money and had my family pay ~$75 for a ticket to the event. I haven’t paid for hair or shoes or nails which would probably be ~$100 more. I really really don’t want to disappoint my friend and teacher who really wanted me to be there but when I think of going and then spending all that money I get so upset.  
There are also other factors contributing in my want to not go but this post is already long enough.

Should I go so I won’t regret it and is this just overthinking or should I not go and do something else with a couple other family members who I like.  Also the event is in 2 days on the 18th."
358,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I am currently in online school, which I thought I would be able to handle, but I’m struggling. The work load is something I could normally handle, but I just can’t seem to get myself to do anything unless it’s last minute. I’ll try and start, but get sidetracked within a couple minutes. Either that or I’ll tell myself I’ll do it in x amount of time them keep pushing that further and further back. Now I have a whole essay, three economics assignments, and an Econ exam due by midnight and i’m panicking. I already don’t know anything in this economics class because the teacher doesn’t actually teach and we just read out of a book. I don’t why I keep doing this to myself, but I just can’t seem to keep myself focused. I wish I could go back to in-school learning, but my mom is immunocompromised and I don’t trust anyone at my school. I wish i hadn’t chosen to do dual-credit classes during online school either, but it’s far too late to do anything about that. I wish I could talk to my teachers and tell them that I don’t understand a single thing, but they’d just get angry at me. I want to fix myself but I just don’t know how."
359,Whats the worst pain you’ve felt?,"We’ve all had pain. Physical and emotional. It helps make us who we are.

For pure physical pain, I think of the time I broke my leg falling through a faulty set of bleachers at an event, which was itself very painful, and then in the first aid area I went to some volunteer staff there tried to force me to bend the leg while I screamed in agony for them to stop

I also have panic disorder and the panic attacks can be quite painful. People do mistake them for heart attacks for that reason.

For emotional pain, I think of the time early in my current depression episode when I was so painfully sad and lonely I felt like I could die if I didn’t talk to someone. It was 2am and I was so desperate I called the suicide hotline. 

What pain have you all felt that affects you to this day?"

363,Checked ex's Instagram last night on her birthday and saw lots of happy birthday messages in her stories. Feeling down about my own lack of friends.,"Sounds like a pathetic thing to get down about, I know. But it's even more pathetic when you consider we've been broken up for 8 years. 

The thing is I don't even feel like I miss her, but my brain is harking back to the only reference point it has for when I last felt happy in my life, which was when I got with this ex 12 years ago. 

I am 30 years old now and most of my 20s were spent in a state of depression and social anxiety and loneliness. I've tried treating my neuroticism but nothing works. 

On my 30th birthday, I got a total of 5 happy birthday messages; 2 from my parents, 1 from my partner and 2 from my only 2 friends. 

I was feeling down last night and for some reason, I looked at this ex's Instagram (we haven't talked in years but I have this self-sabotaging habit of viewing her Insta page every few months).

Her page was filled with stories showing happy birthday messages from friends; there must have been 8 or 9 different messages. Stuff like ""best friend"", ""love this girl"", ""let's party in a few weeks"". Her neighbors even bought her some tequila. 

I guess it just reinforced how much of a sad loner I am and what a waste my youth was. It was her 29th birthday so it wasn't even a big birthday like my 30th (for which I did nothing because I don't have enough friends).  

Am I reading too much into these stories? What they conveyed to me on the face of it is someone with lots of friends who care enough to send happy birthday posts on social media. Someone who dumped me by text message after 3 years together yet she coasts through life being happy while I seem to go through continuous suffering. 

Thanks for any advice."
364,Help? Feeling bad,"It's my birthday and for the last few days I felt actually pretty good for no good reason and wanted to share.
First I'll say that I was always quiet/shy I never really know what to say to people I don't know well enough, that was a reason for my feelings you'll read about later here.
Since last year I was completely away from any social life, had no friends or partner (never had one but that's another story) there was a reason for this but in retrospect wasn't a good enough reason, at least before covid.
Then this summer I got to the army and the first two months were almost the lowest point of my life, that's what it felt like, I wanted to die every day, wasn't even happy no matter what happened.
But then last week, after I got my post in the army and was there working for a week, something tragic happened in my family and they had to go out of town, so I was alone at home this week, and also in my birthday, and for some reason I feel great.
First day I was home in these circumstances I really felt like everything is going according to plan, I'll have friends and partner, I'll pass this and that thing, like inner peace in movies. I started working out! Even if only a bit.
Now I'm going back to the base, hope I'll still be this positive and to not let this momentum of well-being stop.

All I had to say for now, so I hope we all will feel better soon

Edit: from the moment I arrived to the base I feel really bad, can't really describe it with words, it's like all the hope and motivation I had stayed home and left me in darkness.
I feel completely alone though I have some friends even though they're not close friends but that comes in time. 
Hope it'll get better, if you have any idea of how to feel better right now please help.
And don't say stay with people cause I try but I just can't stay with people I still don't know, it gives me so much anxiety."
365,Chronic pain/migraines and mental illness,"Hello everyone! Does anyone have good tips to help with chronic body pain linked to mental illness, especially migraines?
I have PTSD, Depression, anxiety and heavy chronic migraines. Generally the usual symptoms that comes with these diagnoses, fatigue, back and neck pain, nausea, loss of appetite, dizzyness etc.. 

Currently on 20mg escitalopram (antidepressant) and 50mg metropolol (for chronic migraines, prescribed by a shitty neurologist that didn't tell me this was going to worsen my depression and basically made me sicker than before). Slowly decreasing metropolol. 
Taking triptanes for migraines and ibuprofen/aspirin. 

Have been to a clinic this year (didn't really help) and will be going another psychiatric hospital soon but maybe someone here has some special advice from personal experience. 
Please keep in mind I have a heavy depression so while I appreciate tips regarding sport, pretty impossible to do for me right now.
I've been to a physiotherapist and currently visiting a ""healer"", I'm very sceptical about her but kinda desperate, she's been recommended by friends. She has been really good so far, but now wants to treat me with some ""sneak venom enzymes"". If anyone has ever heard anything about that let me know.

Any tips regarding medication, supplements, types of therapy, etc that help with chronic pain would be appreciated!"
366,"The methaporic ""Shot me in the head""","Disclaimer: I don´t recommed reading this if you are feeling suicidal

So. I got a very visualised thought processing. I often portray my thoughts in a visual in my head. Like a scene in a movie or something. In my head i transformed all my dark thoughts, anxiety and depression into a ""evil"" me. Like the worst version of myself. The person i never want to become. Every time i get into a situation, that is awkward for me, uncomfortable or embarrassing, i want to be removed immediatly from this situation/feeling. Just cut out of it. So in my head the ""evil me"" comes up to me and just shots me in the head or sometimes he would beat me down to the ground with a baseball bat. I also often find myself inside a heavy storm which i cant get out of. I think this all started when i had a dream about some person in a dark coat coming up to me and stabbing me like 30 times and i couldn´t do anything about it, because i was laying down on the ground and couldn´t move for some reason. After that the person revealed its face to me. It was another me. He looked right at me and just started laughing like the some insane psycho. Then i saw myself from 3rd person. It was so disturbing seeing myself with 30 knives burried into my lifeless body.

368,I finally believe my partner when he tells me he loves me,"We haven’t been together for very long but I always struggled to believe that he loved me, not because he didn’t show or express it, it was just me thinking no one can REALLY love me for who I am.

The anxiety that I could push him away with my mental illnesses is still there along with other stupid brain issues. I still think I’m not good enough for him, BUT I believe that he does love me, my personality. I also can trust that he loves me when I’m down and will care for me when I feel alone.

I’m super happy about this, fingers crossed it lasts."

370,"Why do I randomly get nervous that there’s something behind me, even when I know there isn’t?","For whatever reason, I’ve always had this thing where I’ll randomly get scared something is behind me.

For example, I’ll be driving alone, and think to myself “what if there’s someone behind me in my car” I know it isn’t true, but it’ll still freak me out. The same thing happens to me when swimming sometimes.

Any ideas of what this could be?"
371,I don’t know how to deal with every day life.,"The last couple years have been awful. I’m 23 now. My dad left 2-3 years ago. Had his issues, we told him get clean or go. He went. So that was an adjustment. 

Then September of last year, my grandma needed her 3rd heart surgery and we didn’t expect it to go well. She had it in November of 2019, stayed with us until end of January and went home. She’s fine now but that was a lot. 

During that time, in November 2019, I took my dog for his check up and told he had lymphoma and would die in a month. So I worked tirelessly to make extra money and took him for a second opinion and spending hundreds on his meds. Suddenly in January, he was perfectly fine and nobody knows what happened. But he’s here and healthy. 

August of 2020, my father had a heart aneurysm and passed at 46. It’s hard. I never got to talk with him and make things right. It’s just so hard to deal with. My mom was very depressed from it but she’s doing better. My brother is sad but okay. Neither one of them want to talk about him tho, when THATS all I want to do. Remember the good times. 

I started my first full time job in July of this year. Doing what I love. It’s a great job. They let me have 2 weeks off for my dad. They’re honestly a great place. But I can’t get myself to go all the time. I call off once, maybe twice a month. I’m just so tired. Even if I slept. Or I want to cry. I can’t handle this. I feel like I’m using my dad as an excuse. Sometimes that’s why but sometimes I just can’t go to work. I called off at previous jobs too sometimes just because. 

My family judges me anytime I call off. I hate it. They don’t understand just getting up is an accomplishment for me. I just feel lost. And tired. So so tired. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t think it will ever get better. I’m on medications which definitely helped and improved my life but I think this is the best it’ll ever get."
372,Unable to shake this feeling of loneliness,"Since the past few weeks, work has been extremely over-demanding and I have lost myself in it. I live in India and everyone is in the holiday spirit getting out with their friends and having the best times.
And here I am, studying for an upcoming test and at the same time dreading having to work again at the end of week.  

Working from home has really become unbearable for me right now. I cannot imagine being home all the time anymore  as I am completely exhausted with this environment (family at home don't exactly create a positive environment either). I don't like my work rn, which is completely opposite to what I had expected, as initially I was quite happy with it. But I am unable to quit it as I need to support my family financially. 

I feel like I'm in a big mess and there's just no hope left and it's drowning me. I can't seem to stay afloat anymore and I have no idea what to do. I cried for straight 3 hours last night and woke up with swollen eyes feeling pathetic as ever.
At regular intervals, I keep having these phases where I lose the purpose of living or the will to keep going.

I have literally no one to talk to who understands this. I wish I had more friends to hang out with and often meet, to maybe gain a different perspective or just clear my head. This has led me to believe that I am lonely and I have noone with whom I can go out and talk to. 

Anybody else going through something similar or just a word of advice?"
373,Magical thinking/self referential thinking,"
So I keep reading or watching things and seeing coincidences with my own life. It’s driving my OCD mad. I know this is the case of being too self-referential when reading or watching anything and I know it’s common to find similarities in books and tv series but I just need some advice on how to stop this. 

Anything is greatly appreciated."
374,PTSD Treatment?,"For those who’ve gotten diagnosed with PTSD, how were you treated/helped? I haven’t ever gone to the doctor for mental health before, but I have an appointment in a week and the doctor did tell me over our zoom consultation that his screening will be more geared towards depression and PTSD for me (based off of what I’ve told him).

I’m so scared that, if I’m diagnosed with anything, it’ll be PTSD from my trauma and they’ll give me something like pills. Addiction runs in my family and pills have done some nasty stuff to my parents.

Is PTSD something therapy can fix? Is therapy expensive?

I’m sorry if this post is ignorant; I’ve never done this before."
375,I'm driving myself insane by being sensitive and overthinking,"I don't know where else to post this so I'll just ask here. I hope it's not off topic.

I'm extremely sensitive when it comes to opinions. My interests and views are often dictated by what other people think and I don't know what is causing this. In the past I used to be pretty thick skinned and It was easy for me to ignore other people's opinions but now whenever someone challenges my views, I instantly crumble and retreat back into my shell where I start questioning myself. It's driving my fucking insane and I don't know how to stop it.

Here's a simple example. I recently discovered a popular youtuber and I've started to like them (both them and their content). But I see a lot of people hating on this person and criticizing them (for no reason; they haven't done anything wrong). Each comment I read makes me wonder if I'm stupid for liking this creator. It's dumb, right? i know it is, but it's seriously ruining my days. I keep thinking things like what if those people are objectively right and I'm just wasting my time supporting someone who's nothing special (and creates nothing special)? I keep trying to justify my interest with solid arguments, so basically I'm arguing with myself. This is just one example. I feel this need to justify and validate my opinions and explain why I enjoy what I enjoy, or why I think the way I do about certain things. Sometimes I come up with logical and sensible explanations to end my inner arguments and then my mind goes  ""Yeah but what if you're actually wrong and you're just lying to yourself to calm yourself down? what if everyone else is right?"" I hate that I'm so fragile and sensitive but I can't help it. Whenever someone opposes my opinions I become paranoid and start thinking that I'm deluding myself and everyone else who disagrees with me is right. In order to justify my beliefs I keep trying to find an objective measurement by comparing everything. It's giving me headache. It's ruining my mood and it makes me feel super shitty. How do I stop caring about what people think? How do I stop giving a fuck about ""objectivity""? I want to enjoy things without worrying about the quality of what I'm enjoying. 

Sorry this is long. I hope it makes sense."
376,How do I feel accepted by others?,"So, growing up I was always the outcast. I had  serious diagnosed OCD in 4th grade which resulted in me being bullied and such. The problem was extremely severe and led to multiple confrontations with the police, professional help, multiple suicide attempts, and medication. I don't want to regale you with details but it was bad. This experience really messed me up. I knew I was different and abnormal compared to everyone else. My schoolmates certainly treated me better after I solved the issue, but I always knew I was second tier. If someone had to leave the lunch table it was always me. As a result of feeling like an outcast I never really got involved in a lot of stuff other kids did. So, my best friend dated the girl I had a crush on and I was fine with that cause I didn't intend to date. This sorta mentality embedded itself in me. It resulted in me being reclusive in high school. As a result I never did a lot of stuff other kids did. For reference, my high school famously had a drug problem yet I was never even offered anything. Lots of kids hooked up, but I never did. I'm 19 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss. I googled it. You know how many college freshman have lost virginity? 70%. You know when most people have their first kiss? 13-15. I'm in the minority in both of those figures. I am once again abnormal. How can I be interesting to people when everyone else has done more interesting stuff with their lives? Why would anyone want to talk to me when they can talk to someone who has interesting stories about how the cops busted their alcohol infused high school party or whatever. I'm just fundamentally less interesting. 

Now, you may say: ""this is easy, if you feel too innocent compared to everyone, just go be not innocent"". Well here's the thing. Last night a bunch of my friends got together. I didn't find out until later was only get to hang with them for like an hour. They were together for several hours. I never get invited to shit I have to go over to their side of the dorm floor and invite myself. I constantly feel like a burden. I feel u welcome. This isn't a one time thing, it's happened a lot where I miss out on stuff. I can't do non innocent stuff alone, that's just sad. But if those people don't want me what do I do? Franky, what I want most in the world rn is to feel accepted by those people, but I just don't feel it. IDK how much this is self hate, ocd, or real. I want to sit down and talk to one of them and get them to be real with me and tell me what fears are justified and what ones aren't but frankly that seems wimpy and weak right?

I also have a very strong tendency to beat myself up over the slighest mistake. I beat myself up because I haven't done drugs but it i did do them I'd beat myself up cause I funded cartel violence. If I ask out a girl I'll beat myself cause I'll accuse myself of just doing it cause you felt like you should've done it by age 19 and don't actually want to be in a relationship. If I don't do it I beat myself up because I haven't done it by age 19. Then add onto thks the convene that a lot of what I'm insecure about reads like an incel wrote it so I'm worried that I'm misogynistic and bigoted at my core. This goes against all my values and so on top of all of this I'm worried I'm secretly a terrible person. There's no winning. I feel abnormal, different, and weird compared to everyone else and honestly I really hate myself for it. I haven't talked about these problems with people close to me because I would look weird and that's not what I want. At the same time, I worry that by not talking about it I am being unhealthy. And of course, all this worrying makes me anxious that I'm being too sensitive and not manly. Hell I beat myself up for a week cause I listened to a taylor swift song. I know that's stupid, but I still did it. So I came to you all. How do I stop hating myself and how do I stop being so insecure?


I basically get all of my self worth from what other people think of me so I'm kinda in the dumps"

378,When should I get help for suicidal thoughts?,"I'm 19 years old and I'm really struggling with my mental health I'm in this constant state of sadness and no matter how hard I try I can't seem to get out of it and I don't have any motivation to do anything, I wake up on mornings and the first thing I want to do is go back to sleep. I started having these suicidal thoughts about 9 months ago and I think that my life is meaningless and that if I were to die it probably wouldn't matter. I guess I'm having more passive thoughts thank active thoughts because I keep thinking about ending my life and I think about what I would do if I was gonna kill myself and what would be the easiest way to do it but I'm sure that I won't actually attempt anything and I'm too scared to actually do that. My life isn't that bad so I don't know why I'm having these thoughts and I just wanna know if I should reach out for help or not. sometimes I think that I should get help but then i think that i don't need it because it's not that serious and even if I was going to reach out for help I wouldn't know who to reach out to or who to tell because no one knows that I'm having these thoughts."
379,I need advice on depression,"I have been depressed for a good while, when it seems to be going well it suddenly gets really bad again. Im in one of those really bad times after being good for some time. I really wish to get better so I can be helpful and not a burden to others. When I reflect on why I havent gotten better despite wanting to so bad, I think maybe I dont want it enough, dont believe I am deserving, or I am just not dedicated/motivated to. Because of this I have been suicidal lately


I need some advice on how to stop being negative and self deprecating, or some spiritual advice and things like that. When I see people that do fitness, eat healthy, get good grades and maintain good relationships it seems so draining and exhausting. Shouldn't all that come together by itself when you're healthy mentally?   


My question is basically how do I become stronger mentally, and emotionally stable?  
Thank you"

381,Is there a name for getting angry by just thinking of made up public arguments with strangers?,"I've tried to google 2 scenarios, but cannot find anything close to what goes on in my mind.

Occasionally when alone, my brain will make up social scenarios about being falsely told off by strangers, and being accused of things that never happened, such as pushing in line, planning to rob someone,  or other social etiquette. My brain starts to get angry, even though they didn't happen and it's all made up by my my own head.  Sometimes I wonder if it is boredom, or I on the dark side of reddit too much ""ie. /publicfreakouts - that place makes my blood boil, and i can't block it!""

I have another similar thing, especially when going to bed, thinking about being physically attacked by someone, and bearing the emotional trauma, which kinda scares me more the the physical trauma. this one was triggered when it almost happened to me by a stranger unprovoked.  

If I can get rid of these two things, i think my brain can have a rest, but as i know these are irrational thoughts, telling myself to stop doesn't work.  

If I knew there was a name for this kind of thinking it would be a start to learn how to stop it."

385,I've probably been scammed by an attention-seeking person?,"Hi all! So I recently offered to be a friend to high school students who struggle with their mental health! I got messaged by a user whose name I won't reveal. I was originally very sympathetic to her. This is what she told me and what I pieced together from our messages and her previous Reddit posts.

**TW: Abandonment, sexual abuse**

\- She's 10 years old, and she used to live in Mexico City.

\- She was kicked out by her adoptive parents today because she came out as a lesbian.

\- She said that she is disabled because she was in a car crash when she was 5. (however, when I asked her, the date changed to when she was 4.) She uses a wheelchair, but it's broken and she said she is currently dragging herself on the side of the road.

\- Her biological parents died in that car crash, and her adoptive parents were sexually and emotionally abusive towards her

\- She is suicidal, has depression, but her adoptive parents deny her the medication.

I originally was very sympathetic, because that sounds terrible. Nobody deserves to be in that situation. I asked her for some more info.

\- She said that she was outside by a highway, and she was near a frozen pond.

Now this made me suspicious. I searched up the weather near Mexico City, and it's currently 51 degrees Fahrenheit, nowhere near freezing. Furthermore, the weather is projected to get up to 71 degrees Fahrenheit.

\- She said that she was abandoned by her parents on the highway. The police found her and asked for her parent's address. The police then left her on the side of the highway and returned to the city to arrest her parents.

This is highly suspicious to me. I've never been to Mexico, but I'm pretty sure it's illegal to leave an abandoned 10-year old by herself on the highway. I confirmed that the law protects children. I also found it suspicious that her parents were arrested for abusing her, but she wasn't taken in by protective services.

\- She said that she was using her phone to use Reddit, and she had a solar charger with her.

This also made me suspicious. I found it unlikely that a 10-year-old child who was abused by her parents would have her own phone and a solar charger. Heck, even my brother who is 13 and lives happily doesn't have a phone.

\- I gave her the child support services number for Mexico city, but she said it was blocked. Then I gave her the suicide hotline number, but she said that that was also blocked.

Also suspicious.

\- I asked her to call 911 and explain her situation. She said that she had called 911 before, but the police didn't care. They had left her. I then asked her to call the police again and explain her situation. Less than 20 seconds after I asked this, she said that she had called the police and explained, but the police thought she was a scammer and hung up.

I don't know about you, but I can't fit all of that into a 20-second phone call. (However when questioned, she said that she had been ""calling the police for a while now"")

\- I asked her what phone she was using, she said an old iphone she had gotten in 2007. I asked her what model, and she said it was iPhone 4.

Now I googled the release date of iPhone 4, and it's in 2010. Furthermore, this person somehow forgot that she is supposed to be 10 years old. She wasn't alive in 2007. Also, iPhones are expensive. Why would her abusive parents buy her such an expensive device at 10 years old?

\- She also said that she was around and ""hour's walk away from the border.""

This sounds ridiculous. From Mexico City to the closest point in the U.S, it's almost 1000 kilometers. There is no way she could have ""dragged"" herself almost 1000 kilometers in this short period of time.

\- I asked her what the time was where she is. She says her parents ""drove her across a timezone and her phone didn't update"".

Suspicious, since her phone obviously has wifi to access Reddit, but it didn't change the time somehow.

\- Then she mentioned that she was born with no legs as a result of a birth defect, but in one of her earlier Reddit posts, she said that she had lost her legs during the car crash. When asked about this, she claimed that she had lost her prosthetics in the car crash.

There were many inconsistencies like this, and I'm reasonably sure that she is trying to trick me. I might add that all this information was obtained by lots of questioning. She would only reveal tiny bits and pieces about herself at a time. Furthermore, she is supposed to be 10. Her grammar and texting skills don't sound like a 10-year-old. They sound like a teenager or an adult pretending to be a teen.

So in the end, I'm don't think this is real. If this is true, then I'm disgusted. I was eager to help her because mental health is so important. She played the ""I'm suicidal"" card to trick me. Seh repeatedly said, ""we'll then I'll just kill myself"". Not I'm not saying that she isn't suicidal, but she is obviously fabricating her life to gain attention. If you're reading this, then you know who you are. Don't do this. It doesn't help anybody, least of all yourself. If you need anything, please just let people know truthfully. You don't have to make up tragic circumstances to make yourself seem better. I hope you'll be okay!"
386,I am afraid of asking from my dad to make a dentist appointment.,"I have big anxiety and I always feel I am being judged for dumbest things. If I ask I feel like they are saying ""he has so bad dental hygiene"" and stuff like that. I rather be in pain than ask for my dad to make an appointment. Is there something I can do to stop feeling that everyone is judging me and how can I get better at asking for help?"
387,tell me what is it i'm feeling,"I deactivated all my social media accounts to breathe. I feel suffocated when some of my family members guard all my actions, asking me every now and then when will i graduate. Tbh, I am not really okay this past few months, I always feel down. I start neglecting my study even though this is my last semester before i graduate. I feel pressured to people's expectations of me. It has this voice at the back of my head saying that I will only disappoint the people who believe in me. And today, I got scolded by my research groupmate because of my poor academic performance. I am so upset to myself for being so dumb and someone made me feel that way."
388,I don’t understand myself and what I’m feeling,"I don’t understand what’s happening with me lately. All of a sudden, there’s this big feeling of emptiness within me. It’s an overwhelming feeling of emptiness mixed with doubt, anxiousness, and uncertainty. It might be a pandemic-related anxiety, but I know I’ve had this feeling before, but more pronounced and it’s rendering me unable to move and get on with life. 

I must admit that during the first part of the year I was in deep anxiety of my future due to cancelled plans for the year. It was a bad anxiety period for me, but I was able to pick myself up along the way somehow and realigned my plans and goals for the future. Now, I can’t seem to see the point of moving forward. Even with goals and ambitions that I have for myself and promised to work on them, one day I woke up feeling abnormally lighter (in burden) and ready to let go of this living absurdity. I don’t see the future anymore. Most of the time, I feel empty. Even with the stimulus I have around me (work and school), my brain wants me not to function anymore. And I would find myself spacing out often and not feel anything. It would take a whole lot of energy to get myself back on the daily track, but I still find myself falling into the void of just feeling empty. 

And all of a sudden, intense emotions would come in and they can get very overwhelming. These episodes would last for a good 30 minutes or longer especially when there’s a trigger (for example, being reminded of a one-sided feeling I have for someone). Having the emotions would make me feel sick from the torso up to the head. I would describe them as painful (not physically, I can’t seem to describe them well), sad and there’s always a tight feeling on my chest. On bad days, especially when they’re too intense, my body would suddenly act and I would slam my arms against the wall to keep myself from lingering on those thoughts and emotions. After that, I feel empty again.

I don’t understand myself. I don’t understand what I’m feeling. I’ve been drowning myself with cigarettes and alcohol to numb down intense emotions or sometimes even to just feel something. I really don’t understand what’s happening."
389,Do you ever get a drunk-like but dysphoric feeling with depression?,"Does anyone else with depression get this kind of out of it feeling with brain fog and sleepiness that's almost like being drunk but it's a very unpleasant feeling? Like I'll slur my speech, lack coordination, trip on things, feel physically numb, a little disoriented. It's just like when your brain slows down when you're drunk."
390,How depressed do you need to be to be prescribed antidepressants,"Haven't been to therapy or seen a counsellor or anything like that, but was wondering how seriou my condition must be in order to get doctors to prescribe me antidepressants."
391,Feeling lost. Anxiety and just sad about everything.,"So life hasn’t been the best the last couple years. Was engaged. She broke it off. Lost my job which I hated but at the same time was sad about. Then this year with coronavirus things have me in this funk. I am working but don’t feel motivated. And I wake up everyday full of anxiety. Some days I get hit hard with sadness and just want to go somewhere and cry. 

Any time I think about opening up to someone I instantly tear up. I just feel so lost like my life isn’t going anywhere. I keep myself busy but it’s during those moments of down time when it hits me. I even wake up crazy early shaking and full of anxiety. I hope this is ok to post. I just need to get my feelings out there. They always say time heals but am I supposed to magically feel happy? 

Thank you for hearing me out."

I feel like I’m going to die alone and that no one cares about me. Feelings of overwhelming anxiety come over me daily and break me down, it scares the shit out of me. I don’t know how much longer I can live with these thoughts."
397,What’s wrong with me?,"I sometimes wonder if I’m a sociopath or something I really don’t care about much as much as I would like to and this is what I struggle with the most. To put things in perspective I believe I have COVID but my symptoms are mild and I found myself wishing I had a more extreme case just to have the experience and was thinking how the mild case is pretty boring. Another example would be when one of my family members had an electric bug zapper and I shocked myself with it just to see what it would feel like. People tend to comment on how much I sound like I don’t care even when I’m trying to put emotion in my voice, so I think I might just have a flat affect or something. I think I care about things to a certain extent obviously or I wouldn’t have wrote this, but I feel like there’s a point where I just stop caring and it doesn’t take long for me to get there."
398,Depression and anxiety should not be the only mental health issues that are spoken about in the public view.,"People find absolutely hilarious that Kanye west clearly had a psychotic breakdown in the media and was off his bi-polar medication. Yes, depression is a serious mental illness and if left un treated it will more than likely end in suicide or an attempt. However, other mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bi-polar that are not talked about. There is such as stigma around mental illnesses because people automatically assume that the individuals involved are violent and aggressive when in actual fact that is not the case at all. All people who suffer from any form of mental illness have that risk of committing suicide not just depression. For the individuals to get the the point that they feel like suicide is the only option, they feel that the world will be better off around them even if they have family, friends etc around them. Shouting a people who feel this way and judging them will not help them at all in fact it will probably make things worse. But because no one can see the many different mental illnesses, people don’t accept it. People see the effects mental health has but the ignorance is still there and the individuals are judged based on it. People are so quick to judge someone for their actions but never bother to get the facts of why they behave in the way that they do. 
I work daily with people who have personally disorders and various forms or schizophrenia and they are all absolutely lovely. A young girl, who I work with, told me that she doesn’t tell many people that suffers from paranoid schizophrenia because people in the past have judged her heavily and assume she’s violent because of the stigma shown throughout the media and television. This lady in particular is the friendliest, bubbly person I have had the pleasure of supporting. When she told me this, my heart sank because she’s right but in the 21st century this shouldn’t be acceptable!

400,Unexpected Genuinely (35),"Expectations. We All Have Them. For ourself, from others. Why? How? What? When?

I have begun to learn that expectations that I create for myself and from others usually end up with feeling anxious, vulnerable, stressed and in a state of being and mind that isn't who I am meant to be. Its needed though for the time being.

Its allowing me to learn that as long as I am feeling good about whatever I am pursuing then thats all that matters. If I do something without receiving it back from someone else and feel stressed from that, than what I was doing initially was with a subconscious expectation in the future which is not a genuine action. I am Human. I am Learning. I am Healing.

The Best that can be done each day is simply that. These times we have been inside has been realigning, filled with many ups, many downs and everything in between. I am grateful.  
I learned the other day that God, Higher Power, The Universe wants us to Shine but doesn't care about the struggle we have to go through to get there, which to me........is so powerful and eye opening. The Shine and the Blooming has to have to many, many moments of struggles because it is preparing me for whats to come by living in the present, in the Now. Embrace. It. All. Its all Divine. Its all Valid. Its all Meant to Be. For Myself and for You. For Us.

Continue to do your best today. Continue to Hold Faith. Continue to Trust. God and the Universe isn't finished with us sister. Everyones time comes, usually which exceeds our own expectations that we set out to accomplish.

Everything is ok. Everything is happening for the Best.

I love you.

401,Anxiety through the roof lately because of porn.,"Okay so, I'm a 22 year old guy, since the age of 13 I've watched quite a lot of porn and been masturbating since then too. About 5 months ago I started seeing this girl, we've since been dating and I am so crazy about her. I love her so much, she truly means the world to me, we're open about everything she's gorgeous and she cares about me, she is my first lover, I want to feel like I do now with her, forever.

Since starting dating her my porn intake has gone down massively. But recently I find myself looking at girls in public and thinking ""oh she has a nice ass"" or ""oh she's pretty"" etc. This in combination with the couple of times I've looked at stuff online, has PLAGUED me with guilt and anxiety. My gf has never even said to me that I need to stop watching it or it's over if I don't stop. (Not anything like that, she's not like that) I'm very open to her and tell her everything. She sees that I'm doing my best to watch less porn (it's mostly just girls with big tits, softcore type shit or like those overly provocative instagram pages) and loves me so much for it. She sees I'm trying to change, not even for her but for us and for me myself.

My question is, has anyone else gone through something like this, this gorgeous, beuatiful and kind caring, understanding girl has made me think differently about porn and about how I  view ""sexiness"" in general. I want her to be my only means by which I get off (for the most part she has been). But I feel like shit when I slip up and look up some sexy girl, and then I tell her and she gets so confused. I beat myself up for having passing, fleeting moments of finding someone else attractive, either in real life or online. She doesn't even ever ask me if I'm looking at her, or if I think she's hot etc.... I just over analyse it and it rips me apart

I just love her so much and I get super anxious anytime porn (which was a very very common part of my life before I met her and at times during our relationship too) enters my mind or anything.

Please help a confused boy out many thanks in advance."
402,I need some motivation,"I'm in my second year of college right now, and while I've had a constant dread of the future for a while now, it's really starting to crush me.

It just seems like adult life has no actual redeeming qualities? or at least not in my case.

Art, specifically illustration and character art, is what I love. (see my profile picture) 

But of course, illustration is not an easy job, and you're constantly going to be faced with people who are better than you, who'll do it for less. And if I were to become, say, a comic artist... my god, I can't even imagine the stress. 

So instead, I'm majoring in graphic design. Lots of the skills transfer, and it comes fairly easily to me (for the most part). But it isn't nearly as enjoyable, and trying to get projects done is an uphill battle against my focus.

So unless I got stupidly lucky, I wouldn't get a job I actually wanted. Granted, it would still be something I'm good at, but I can't imagine myself looking forward to it.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm aro/ace, and DEFINITELY not interested in having a family, so that's something else I don't have to look forward to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an introvert with social anxiety, and a very tiny circle of (nerdy) friends, so other than d&amp;d night, I'm not exactly going to many parties, or even getting out all that often.

&amp;#x200B;

And I also have a ludicrous list of health problems (ADD, scoliosis, and my liver is just ITCHING to fail, just to name a few) which I have to take 16 or so pills a day for, which I loathe with every fiber of my being, and am not looking forward to a life full of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The only good thing I can think of about adult life is I get to live by myself, but even then, I would have to deal with rent, and it's mostly ""good"" in the sense that I can finally just.... destroy myself in peace.

To be clear, I don't mean suicide. I don't necessarily *want* to die, and I definitely wouldn't have the balls to do it myself. I suppose, to put it in perspective, if I was going to be hit by a car, I'd try to get out of the way, but if it hit me anyway, I'd be SPRINTING to the light.

What I mean by destroying myself though, is I literally do not care enough to take care of myself. I'll brush my teeth, and take a shower when my hair itches, but I have a habit of accidentally skipping meals, not eating when I'm hungry (eating feels like a chore), and my sleep schedule is beyond fucked, even when we aren't in a lockdown. I skip almost all of my pills if I can get away with it (though I never miss my ADD meds) because a lot of them feel unnecessary 

&amp;#x200B;

But can anybody tell me what there is to look forward to? And not just vague things like ""oh it gets better"". it seems like pretty much nothing but stress and monotony."
403,If anybody wants to play some video games and vent. I can play/talk with you.,"I play on Xbox. Gamertag is SpectralAce314. I know that with Covid there are a lot of y’all that are socially isolated. I have awful social anxiety and gaming is my only social outlet so I get it. If anybody wants to play Apex Legends or Minecraft I’m down, or dm me and ask about a certain game to see if I have it. My life is in shambles, but I’d love to help y’all out however i can."
404,I’ve been slipping at work because of my mental health and now I’m worried I’ll get fired. I just want to ignore my thoughts and get it together again...,"I’m probably just over reacting but I keep getting angry at myself for letting my depression control me this much. 
Half the time I keep thinking I’m faking it so I can have an excuse to be lazy. And the other half I don’t even think I deserve to get it together because I’m worthless failing anyway.

With therapy I know this is my depression talking but I don’t want to tell my boss that depression is the reason why I haven’t been productive the past few weeks. I feel like it’s just going to make them think I’m unstable and that I’m not worth keeping around.."
405,Can’t get myself out of bed. Nothing motivates me anymore. Why won’t I die?,Just wish I would die.
406,Mental Funk,"The heading I gave this is my best description for how I feel. I just do not feel right. I cannot pinpoint exactly when this started, I can only realize that it has gotten worse over time. My first experience with this feeling occurred my freshman year of college. I remember being rather drunk and becoming very agitated with something my gf at the time had done and just felt this overwhelming feeling of sadness, not wanting to hurt myself, but just not wanting to be alive. 

I am 22 years old now and every so often I go through phases of these ""funks"". I feel like I am not doing what I am supposed to be doing and that my life will ultimately amount to nothing. Other times I feel like an absolute king. My confidence will be high and I will be extremely motivated and other times I do not even want to get out of bed. I am in one of those funks currently and rather than tell my life story (which is not trauma filled or bad in any way) I will try and convey exactly how I am feeling in this present moment. 

I feel like life is pointless. I feel like everything happening around me is pointless. I cannot figure out if I am being dramatic, nihilistic, or I am completely right and there is literally no point to any of this because less than 100 years from now no one will remember who I am because I am not a genius, I am not going to be the president, and I am not sure that there is anything I will do for that sort of notoriety. I cant figure out if my expectations for myself are too high or if I think that everyone around me has high expectations that I cannot meet. I am so young but I cannot shake this feeling that I am doing something wrong with my life and I am a failure.

Now, I am not approaching this without really trying to understand why I may be feeling this way because I tend to come from a place of logic. So, right now, I think I have too much on my plate. I am the busiest I have ever been in my life and I think I need to give some things up right now so I can focus my attention on one thing at a time while incorporating some healthy habits into my life. I used to workout 5 days a week and now I have worked out twice in two months because I absolutely do not have the time. I work all day everyday 8AM to 12AM. Furthermore, I do not think I am mentally built to drink alcohol. It brings this feeling on far more intensely and I think that this would not continue if I gave up drinking. Lastly, I am newly single and have become so used to always having a gf that it is very hard for me to spend time with myself. I get extremely lonely and these feelings all compound on top of that which makes it even more difficult. 

This is really just me wanting to vent and get these things off my chest and into words. If you can relate please share your experience and some healthy habits of yours. Maybe Ill keep up with this post and share whatever transformation I experience in coming months as I take some things off my plate and get back to my healthy habits"
407,"Why do I feel so bad? (Long, but all details are necessary)","Ive wanted to get into acting since reception, but no one thought I liked it. i was A,ways outshone by two other kids in my year (One of them is now with an agency). I’ve decided this year (age 13) to get my life together and apply for an agency. I’m going to send in my application the day before my birthday (because that would mean I send it in on a Sunday). I felt quite good about myself for the first time in about a year.

in dance at school today, we had to be in groups of four, I was with my girlfriend (one if the kids that always outshone me), my school friend, and my ‘acquaintance’ as she puts it. We had to make a dance that represents 5 Emotions, including expressive faces. Me and my girlfriend were happy about this, because of our love of acting. We tried really hard to make our parts work, and she was anger And I was fear. She fake punched me, and I rolled away. That was the start of the dance.

after we practiced, the class had to sit down and put our hands up if we wanted to perform to the class. My gf out her hand up, and my ‘acquaintance‘ (who I swear hates me btw, she annoyed me in computer science, then said it was ‘deliberate and for affection’) got cross and made her out her hand down. Then when it came to being asked again, I asked why my gf didn’t put her hand up, and she said she didn’t want to Perform. I jokingly said ‘why!? You spend hakf your life performing’. My ‘acquaintance’ said ‘well! I’ve been performing my whole life’ and my gf said ‘ye, me too. I act a lot’. Then my ‘acquaintance’ said ‘hah! I’m signed with an agency!’ I said that I was applying, then asked which one she was with, and she giggled, put in a sassy look, looked down at me (she’s tall) and said ‘can’t tell you.’

I spent the rest of the day feeling rubbish and I don’t know why. Any ideas?"
408,I just got triggered by a picture of plates and have to tell someone.,"I'll try to keep it short.

When I was 18 I started a relationship with a guy that later turned out to be emotionally abusive. That was nine years ago and we split up after two years. I'm pretty much over that and thought I had processed it quite well. I can talk to people about him and recently even saw a picture of him without any emotional reaction.  

The thing is that not only was he kinda toxic, his mother was as well. She was often two-faced (nice to me but complaining about me to her son all the time) and demanding. To give an example: my ex was on a buisness trip for six weeks out of the country and when he came back and I visited him, the first thing he said was how disappointed his parents were that I didn't visit them once in those six weeks. I have to say that in those six weeks I moved to another city, began college, even was homeless for a week and rarely saw my own parents.

Now to the trigger:

One day I was at his place (he still lived with his parents) and during cooking I broke a plate. It wasn't fine china or anything overly expensive, just something from Villeroy and Boch that isn't being produced any more. His mother first told me that's okay and mistakes happen, but a day later he told me his mum was furious and demanded I buy her a new plate or give her the money to do so. I didn't and she acted all passive aggressive for a few days before switching back to overly nice. I forgot about that until today.  

Today while browsing our country's version of craigslist I saw such a plate and it almost caused me to have a panic attack. I couldn't breathe normally any more, started crying and my heart was racing. 

Now that I wrote it down I feel better, so thank you, reddit, for letting me vent."
409,Peer Pressure and competition,"I'm a 22 year old college grad, I stumbled upon a person who happens to be the same age and he's a content creator, educator, counselor and motivational speaker, a millionaire, and he's bought 8 houses.

Now, for the life of me I cannot help but constantly compare myself with him, only to see that my achievements are only a fraction of what he has achieved, here i am trying to figure out what I want to do in life and this guy has his life sort out. I'm conscious that I'm sabotaging myself and I only pave the way to anxiety, depression, questioning my self worth.

Is the way I feel valid or am I paranoid? And if you think I'm the latter, what should I do not to think this way?"
410,Quitting Instagram for my Mental Health,"
“By shaping the menus we pick from, technology hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones. But the closer we pay attention to the options we’re given, the more we’ll notice when they don’t actually align with our true needs”. Tristan Harris

I just made my first subreddit called  r/QuittingInstagram

This subreddit is dedicated to the open discussion about both the negative and positive impacts of social media. I think that it is no surprise, especially after watching the Social Dilemma, that social media is ironically destroying the social fabric of society, and that polarization is running ramped. I am currently 15 days “sober” from Instagram and I 100% feel better as a result of being separated from this polarized culture."
411,I Think I Might Have OCD,"I do not have OCD but fear I might have it. It started a few years ago and I didn’t think it was that big of a deal so I just brushed it off. But lately, much more intensely than in the past, If I say something out loud I have to count the exact amount of words on my fingers. Or if I’m simply hearing someone speak, I have to count what THEY said on my fingers. I feel immensely satisfied if the sentence ends on seven or ten words. Also, while watching movies or series if a character says something in particular, I HAVE to repeat what they’ve said out loud more than once until it feels right and restart the scene afterwards (counting the words in their dialogue on my fingers as well). 

It’s worrying me because it’s become quite exhausting but I feel intensely anxious if I haven’t done it. Has anyone had this sort of experience with OCD or am I just overthinking? I do have panic/anxiety disorder so maybe it’s just a symptom of that?"
412,Insurance cost for inpatient care?,"New to this so....


So my sister with mental illness in Northern Virginia will probably be divorced by her husband soon.  He was active duty, but tricare will cover for 1 year post divorce.  

She will lower income by US standards but not be low enough for Medicaid; she will prob receive about $2500/month from his pension.  

She’s been admitted about 10x for inpatient based on emergencies she’s been picked up for. 

Anyway, I would like to understand how I can plan for her to be covered for inpatient care that is inevitable for her to need.  

I do not want the cops picking her up again and dropping her off at a mental health facility and the insurance coverage beancounters at the mental health facility kicking her to the curb prematurely bc she doesn’t have coverage.

I also don’t want to play the oh-so-American health care “Let’s guess your out of pocket expenses with a huge bill later!” game, either. 

What is the best option?  Who?  Any idea of what monthly premiums and deductibles for good coverage?  Ballpark.  I know it depends.  But ballpark."

415,I watched a dog die last night and was helpless to save it,"There were two dogs, two small dogs, running in the road. We were maybe 3 minutes into a 3 hour long drive. We barely made it down the road. They were running in the road, they looked well cared for, and they definitely didn't understand that roads were dangerous. I think they got out of a loving home, escaped by accident. Only one had a collar, the other probably slipped out. They looked bonded, practically attached at the hip. I skidded to a stop just before hitting one, it was dark and the dog was black. We were on a hill, I saw lights coming over the hill and everything went in slow motion. The one dog ran into the other lane, the other ran back to safety off the road.  I honked my horn and flashed my lights but it was no use, the car was going too fast. I watched the dog get hit, no one else in the car saw. I saw it die instantly, frozen stiff from brain damage.I cant get the image of its face, the light leaving its eyes, out of my head. I saw it bounce off the road before landing flat, dead. I panicked, I thought maybe I could save it, I wanted to believe. I whipped into the driveway but forgot my car is stick and I didnt have the brake up. The car rolled back into traffic and I barely made it back to it before it hit another car.  I feel terrible for endangering my passengers like that. I should have known better. I pulled the car back into that driveway, pulled up the brake, but saw the other dog running into the road again. I chased that dog instead, trying to catch it because it had the collar, but it ran too fast and wouldnt come when I stopped and crouched down. It kept trying to run back to the dead dog. Eventually that dog disappeared. I had to run back to the car and my boyfriend helped me get a towel from the back. I got the dead dog off the road and wrapped it up. I can still feel the weight in my arms and hear the blood dripping on the ground and onto my feet. The owners of the house we pulled into wanted us out of the driveway so we pulled into a church across the road, there wasnt anywhere else to go. I just wanted to get the body to the owners, to give the dog a peaceful death and the owners some peace of mind that they at least knew what happened. I called the non-emergency line for the police but they said there wasnt much they could do. I had to be somewhere and I was already late and they wouldn't be able to get the body until the morning, and I know they wouldn't have found the owner, probably couldn't have, there were so many houses and the other dog didn't run to any specific one. So they told me to leave the body by the road. I had to leave it for the animals and flies to eat it. I had nothing else I could do. So I left it somewhere it wouldn't be seen by children and somewhere that it hopefully wouldn't be disturbed by animals and I told the operator exactly where I put it. I doubt they'll go get it. I feel sick just thinking about it. I can't hold my own dog, shes around the same size. The picture just keepa getting stuck in my head, I can't unsee it. I feel both sick and sad and horrible but I also feel nothing at all. Seeing that was the breaking point to an already bad day and now I don't know if I can forget how helpless I was to save it and how I couldn't even give it a peaceful feath, I couldn't do anything. That dog was someones dog and they will never know what happened. I feel so sick"
416,"Symptoms of my Bipolar are getting worse, but if I go back to my psychologist he will just tell me to go back on meds which I don't want to do.",I was diagnosed with Bipolar five years ago when I was 13. I stopped taking medication when I was 16 because I was on 6 different medications and felt awful all the time. Since then I have tried random mood stabilizers here and there but they always had bad side effects. My symptoms haven't been terrible in a while so I thought I was managing but recently they have been getting bad. I can't seem to care about anything no matter how hard I try. I can't turn in any assignments and I don't care that my grades are tanking even though I know I should. I can't stop spending money and everything is just getting bad.

417,How to Build my Tolerance of People,"I have a low tolerance for people and I want this to stop. Lately, I think this low tolerance comes from my technology-based habits of surfing the web, playing video games, reading up on stuff, etc., which has made my already extreme introversion more addicting. Growing up, I was always an extremely shy and introverted kid who hated interacting with people. Because of this, I become easily irritated when I have to engage in small talk or attend social gatherings with anyone other than my closest friends. Even among my friends, I get tired around them after an hour or so unless we do something mentally stimulating, usually creating or playing games.

I'm the type of person who's usually deep in thought all of the time, usually about abstract concepts, and I noticed that I get easily distracted (and thus irritated) when there is too much stimuli around me. It's the reason why even my clothing style is very plain and simple, I hate visual and audio clutter since it makes me feel suffocated or hostage. Unfortunately, being around people (especially those who are rambunctious) causes this same feeling of clutter.

Any advice on how I can get over this?"
418,It only took 4 hours back at work to ruin a weeks vacation,"I want to set the stage a little, I'll try to be brief.  I live in the US - 31y/o, and I've lost contact with most of my friends over the past year.  The few I have left live abroad or are otherwise unavailable.  I have no family.  I've been in therapy for a couple years now and it was a good ride except the last 2 months haven't done much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I just took my first vacation of the year (yes, I know I should probably do it more often) and had the whole week to myself.  9 consecutive days.  Whether or not that much alone time is good for someone like me is hard to say.  I think I like it, but I have that bitter self loathing personality that just loves to bask in my misery.

The first 3 days went how vacations usually go - I'm ""on vacation"" but I'm still preoccupied with work.  Days 4-5 were lovely though.  Truly liberating.  I was proud of myself.  Optimistic about some schoolwork I've been doing on the side, and for those couple days I could even imagine having a future.  I was excited to finish classes and get into a new career.  I finally had the energy to get my schoolwork caught up.

Days 6-9 were not as good.  I started having panic attacks, I wasn't getting as much done as I had hoped and now I'm not sure I'll pass my classes.  And that's not doom saying.  I've been procrastinating and put off 4 months of work to get them done in the next 2 weeks.  That realization coupled with that it's the only ticket I see out of my current job makes me feel like shit.  More than anything I've let myself down.  I've failed on something I owe entirely to myself.  And I'm so mad.  There's nothing and no one I can blame or hide my failure from.  No one else will know, but that's not the point. It feels like I've finally sealed my casket. 

On Sunday evening I chatted with a friend briefly.  He's a very encouraging and supportive friend and I don't think I'd be here without him.  He believes in me (granted I lie to everyone about how classes are going because I can't face my own shame.  The fact I can't get anything done) .  But by the end of it I've calmed down a bit and feel as ready as I can be to go back to work.

It's noon now and I feel worse and more burnt out than I did before I went on vacation.  All I got from my vacation was the perspective of my failure.  I'm sure many would say I'm young (enough) to still put it all together.  But I'm a fan of statistics.  And if I saw my numbers on this loser getting it together I wouldn't put a dollar down even on 1:10000 returns if I succeed.

I don't know.  I'm new here.  I don't know what the usual response to venting is.  I'd be happy to hear someone change my mind, but I think I came here just to convince myself that the jig is up.  Maybe I just need to accept mediocrity and disappointment.  I've gotten good at living alone and just showing up for work and going home and sleeping.  At least my dreams are getting more interesting."
419,Life after depression,Is it better to continue your life after recovering from depression (from the point depression started) or to start all over again with your new self after this experience?
420,I can’t tell what real anymore,"I was driving home by myself and there was a car behind me that was taking every turn I took. Every time I put my blinker on he would too. When I turned on to the last road to my house I floored it. I was running about 90mph on a back road and this guy was still right behind me. I passed my house because I didn’t want him to know where I lived. Eventually I made a sharp/ illegal U-turn and I lost him. 

So here’s the problem, I have really bad paranoia so I’m not sure if it was all in my head. Also I know if I tell my dad he won’t believe me and he’ll will think my mental health is getting worse.

An example of this is my music that I like I'm really not into pop music like he is which is totally fine in my point of view because everyone has different likes but when i bring up music that I like he'll be like ""why do you listen to depressing shit like that?"" and ""your music is weird"" but when he introduces me to his type of music I'm always like ""oh okay period this song is okay"" another example was today and why I'm writing this I told him that I'm taking a witchcraft and healing class at my college next semester because I've been so interested in healing and witchcraft these days and when i told him he said "" in school?...it's gonna be a watered down white people shit"" and i told him ""tell that to my native teacher, Also it’s learning about witchcraft and healing in all religions lmao, can’t hate on it if u don’t know about it"" then he had told me ""don't care it sucks"" and i had told him This is why i can't tell you anything without you putting your two-sense into stuff that i enjoy"" and he totally disregarded what i said and said something about how his two-sense is important and oh that rhymed!, I'm just really tired of him always putting me down on stuff that i enjoy and me always rooting on for the stuff that he enjoys. I know i shouldn't care but when a friend for like 4 years tells you something like this all the time it gets to you."

426,Advice pls!,I don't know if anyone can relate to this but it's a really big problem for me and im scared to tell my therapist because I feel like she might think I'm crazy lol but I have this issue with when im getting to know somebody after they know me to a certain extent I think well I've gotten as far as I can get because I have this idea where if they get to know me any better they won't like me so then the defense mechanism I have of being in my head and using it as a safe space involuntarily kicks in around them and I basically become a very boring not super responsive person for a unknown amount of time until i eventually realize they aren't going anywhere and I start being myself again I have a couple close friends who have endured this process but obviously this makes it very hard to form relationships. Has anyone ever experienced this before? Or have any advice for staying out of my head?

I got it back in 2018 with the highest mark in my school/district. It was a something I worked really hard on to achieve. Over last 2 years to keep myself active in the language I would listen to french music, tutor french immersion elementary students. So I decided to take a step forward in my job as and apply for the French position. I got word back today that I failed the interview and they think I need to take another course in french or get a tutor myself. I feel like my 5 years of study disappeared and was wasted. This made me feel absolutely awful about myself and my abilities in the language. I also feel guilty for not taking any courses despite needing to take courses relating to my degree/not having the time. 

TLDR: had many years of french language. Had my language certificate. Took 2 yrs off studying to pursue career courses. Failed interview for French position, was told I need to back to a course. Feeling depressed about loosing my ability."
428,Who else has a mental disorder and also has a severely sarcastic family?,"You know - everyone laughing and patting your shoulder as they go around and mock your style, body, hair, lifestyle etc. Jokingly though, so it’s all good. 

Pointing out you don’t like the jokes, then being bashed on for being too sensitive. 

Hitting a really low point (or high point) with depression, anxiety, etc. then being criticized for being “pouty” or “mad at the world” or “only being concerned about yourself”. 

Best bit of advice or “life lesson” being offered is “you have so many good things, there is no reason to be like this” or better “just pray about it and it will work itself out”

Anyone else?
If so, what are your coping mechanisms?"

Job got fucked too as an ex con i am just falling and i dont know how deep is this hole"
431,For our friends and families,"First off, let me say thank you for loving a person with mental illness.  Thank you for trying your hardest to support them through their tough times.  Before I get into what I feel must be said, please, if you're just starting this journey, google ""how best to support a person with mental illness.""  That is not what this post is about, but I know how much it helps.  

And now on to what I feel is an important topic for all of us.  I say the following as a mother with a severe mental illness, with an adult child with a fairly severe mental illness,  and over twenty years worth of intensive study about mental illnesses.  So please don't think I'm coming from either a place that lacks compassion, understanding, or education.  

I come across endless posts where there is a family dynamic where a person's behavior is excused due to mental illnesses.  The others in the family are required to make apologies for making the mentally ill person upset.  And those others are then left both feeling like they have no choice but to walk on eggshells and as though they are being held captive by the person's mental illness.

HOLD PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

Regardless of our illnesses, we have to deal with the outside world.  We have to learn that there are acceptable behaviors in society and those that are unacceptable.  Allowing people with mental illnesses to have consistently uncontrolled behavior doesn't give them the chance to learn the rules necessary for adulthood.  It enables them to continue to be more dependent and out of control as an adult. 

When my child was young, they would ask me why they had rules and chores and that when they were an adult, they wouldn't have to do anything.  I explained, many times over, that the rules for kids were to help them learn how to live with rules.  And that adults have countless rules and breaking them comes with much harsher consequences.  Like job loss.  Home loss.  Prison time.  Custody loss.  I'm not saying they were a perfect kid that never broke the rules or that they're now a perfect adult.  Neither am I.  But I am saying that adults have rules and standards of behavior.  And that doesn't change if you have a mental illness or not.  

The rest of your family shouldn't be held hostage because one person has out of control behavior.  

Yes, mental illnesses can make it harder to control your behavior.  Absolutely.  But harder doesn't mean impossible.  It's a skill that everyone needs to learn to varying degrees.  And just like any other kid, people with mental illnesses can learn it too.  Does it take work?  Yes.  Does it take time?  Yes.  Does it take practice?  Yes.  But everything good in life comes from hard work.  This is one of them.

There are certain rules that I live by, both as a means of controlling my illness, and as a means of controlling how it affects others.  

1) Having a mental illness doesn't give me a right to treat others like shit.  Nothing gives me that right.

2) Every action and every word that comes from my body is my responsibility.  Regardless of my illness.  No one comes over and physically picks up my leg and makes it go through a kicking motion towards another.  No one comes over and takes over my brain, my mouth, and my lungs to say terrible things.  

3)  There is a difference between behavior and thought.  I can think terrible things about the driver that just cut me off.  But I cannot justify actually doing anything about it.  I vent the thought in my car and move on.

4) It is my responsibility to maintain emotional awareness and do what is necessary and appropriate to cope with it.  It's not the responsibility of others to guess what's going on in my head.  

I see so many kids on reddit who are trying to figure out if they are wrong or bad for being upset that their sibling with a mental illness is out of control and hurting them (either physically, emotionally, or both).  Take mental illness out of the equation.  Is a sibling wrong for being upset that their sibling is hurting them?  No.  Not in the least.  And those poor kids are being failed by the parents.  Both of the kids.  The parents aren't protecting one from abusive behavior, and enabling the other to not learn the tools necessary to control their behavior.

But the failure to the person with mental illness is even deeper.  The family, no matter how well meaning, is seeing an illness before a person.  Can't do punishments because they're sick, they're fragile, they might get upset, and on and on.  The person with a mental illness is still, fundamentally a person.  And every person has to eventually learn the rules and standards for how to behave in society.  Or else all those potential consequences for breaking the adult rules become their lives."
432,My relationship recently fell apart because of me and all the progress I’ve made towards becoming mentally healthy is crumbling away,[deleted]
433,Hoping for some advice,"I (20M) am currently going through some stuff and wanted to reach out anonymously to see if anyone has any advice. 

This year has obviously been tough on everyone and I am personally struggling with doing the most basic things. I hate university being online (obviously understand it’s necessary during the pandemic just struggle with seeing a lot less people than normal) and have very little motivation to do anything with my days at all. 

I don’t necessarily feel sad as per say, just sort of numb most days. Sort of existing rather than living. I don’t want to be dramatic and throw around words such as depression because they’re serious things and I am in no way feeling suicidal. I know many folk are worse off than myself I just can’t seem to shift a sort of weight off myself. I’d love to blame the pandemic and brush it off but i honestly can’t remember when I was last simply content. 

Not sure exactly what advice I’m looking for, maybe just someone to tell me it’s all normal given the current global situation and not to think about it more.  Anyway, thank you for bothering to read this."
434,I don't know how much more I can take,"My partner of 20 years has said she no longer wants to be with me, we have children together and she's now gone to her parents and won't even return our oldest son's calls. She has schizophrenia and recently had a episode she went in hospital and came out and decided she no longer loves me.

Her family have decided I'm some sort of monster, based on rumours and lies 15 years ago and keep digging into me, reminding me she doesn't love me and that she doesn't want to be anywhere near me. Even though, my children's mother said she would come home for Christmas to be with her children, she's now decided she won't, she's still not answering our sons calls or mine, she's blocked me on Facebook so I can't even let our 3 year old daughter facetime her mommy.

Everyday brings something new with them finding ways to hurt me, I'm dreading Christmas, I've not eaten in 5 days and I honestly just want to throw myself under a train, if she takes our children I'll have nothing to live for. They want to make me into something I'm not, I've been polite and courteous every step af the way, even though she won't speak to her children, they see me hurting and she gets her aunt to tell me she wants them  for the weekend, she wants them for Christmas. I don't know how much more I can give.

I've tried to be understanding, even though she wont speak to me so I can find the reason she doesn't love me and wants to cause me so much pain, she was my best friend and I was there for her when no one else was. I just don't see the point in going on, if I'm dead they win and right now that's okay with me, it hurts too much.

Sorry if I sound like I'm attention seeking, I have no one to talk to and I just want to kill myself. If she takes our children I'll have nothing left to live for."
435,Conversion disorder,"So I was diagnosed with conversion disorder, and some other fun stuff, about five years ago. Basically I suffer from non epileptic seizures, uncontrollable movements and paralysis of my body. It's still hard to believe that all of that is a mental disorder. All those five years I tried to find people who suffered from similar stuff but have never found anyone who can relate. It is also hard to find information about it. 
All I was told is that I have to go to therapy but even then I felt like no one could really understand what's going on.
I guess I'm writing it to maybe find someone who can understand me."
436,Mental health,I've felt bad for years and I was recently going to call up the gp to go and see about getting something done about my mental health but I havent felt bad in 3 days so now feel like I dont need to go? Could I have a mental health disorder if I can go 3 days feeling fine? I'm asking this as this is the longest I've gone feeling fine with nothing being able to bring my mood spiraling n making me feel like I'm going to be abandoned
437,I’m 7 days sober today,"I’m 7 days sober today and while I’m proud I really just want to drink I had a crappy day and I’m depressed and just want to take the edge off...

I don’t have a full problem but I was definitely drinking too much my next drink will be in the 1st of December for my birthday 

I just feel like crap right now and I know alcohol will help...

I guess this is just a rant but if anyone has advice it would be appreciated"
438,Intrusive suicidal thoughts but not suicidal?,"Hello, 

Background: bi-polar 2 w/ a hint of OCD (intrusive thoughts). Medicated (Lamictal &amp; fluvox) and self-aware. 

Looking to see if anyone else has experienced this. 

I have always struggled with intrusive thoughts (15ish years) ranging from social interactions, to shame (""You bitch"" and other similar things, to just random anxiety based. However, I am now experiencing ""Kill yourself"". It's a random intrusive thought, I am NOT hearing another voice. It comes and goes, some days I don't think it at all, some days it won't go away. I don't feel suicidal, I don't have any plans or anything like that and I'm a little depressed but overall pretty good. In the past for intrusive thoughts, I use the technique of ""just let them pass"" or I stop and think no, that's not true...so on and so forth. But this is new, continuous, and I am not comfortable with it. I lost my insurance recently and make too much to get on Medicaid but too little to afford insurance so therapy isn't an option right now (though I am a lifer, have a lot of experience with therapy/psychiatrists, and plan on getting back when I can access insurance). My anxiety is incredibly high right now due to \*gestures at everything\*, and I am in the middle of a big life adjustment as well. I have about every stressor possible happening except a family death. I'm using every coping mechanism and tool in my kit but definitely need to be getting more physical activity in. I think it's likely tied to my turbo charged anxiety but just want to check in to see if anyone else has experienced this?"
439,My depressive thoughts spiraled out of control today,"It all began when I decided to read the Metamorphosis manga, cuz' I've been hearing a lot about it. I thought that it would go ""haha, what a sad hentai"", but no, after I read it, I felt really fucking sad for the main character. I then started to imagine myself in her place, then I just started to imagine myself in different kinds of depressive situations and then it spiraled out of control. I've started to think about different kinds of depressive shit. Like how unfair this world is, how many people suffered and that some of that suffering was caused by me, about my biggest fear of all: being lonely for the rest of my life. So yeah, that fucking manga made this day feel like a nightmare. Some nice advice or support is welcome."
440,"I HATE literally any amount of work. Dread it, except for when highly motivated. It's embarrassing. Is this just me? Any solutions?","Even if I desperately want *simple* and *important* tasks done (such washing my dishes, doing my laundry, even just picking up and tidying the room), I literally will stand up to start the task and then just stop, feeling like I can't even tolerate any amount of work for a single second. As if lifting a finger for *anything* feels dreadful. Then I feel like every single second of the task will be in slow motion, drawn out. I can't just mindlessly get to work. I can't just *do* a task I really dislike and get it out of the way. I feel so physically aversed to work.

Then of course I stress about it, so the stress + the act of even thinking about the task makes me feel so tired that I need a nap.

I know it sounds like a simple low or depressed mood, but I just feel so embarrassed that I get so... lazy? Like I hate even the idea of work even if I want to do the task? Is such an extreme and specific reaction typical for anyone else?

^(There are occasional moods or days where I feel randomly motivated and can get things done without this issue, I feel like I have the energy and ability. Which is sort of self explanatory up-and-down mood issues)"
441,Does therapy actually work?,"Hi, I have tried going to psychologist a few years ago and I didn't get much help from it. I feel depressed, I am constantly feeling low, zero confidence, zero self worth, anxiety and anger issues. I tried going to therapy when I was studying for Master's, our university had free therapy sessions. But that didn't help. I feel like I know what's wrong with me, the things that upset me and the things I should let go. I am a over thinker too. So most of the suggestions/help I got from therapy is something I have already either thought or done. 
I have a loving and caring husband but I still feel sad and lonely and I don't know why most of the times. 
I guess my question is does therapy actually work for people like me?"
442,Does anyone else feel like the Universities are failing to protect and later help the victims of sexual assault?,"Bein raped by a fellow student at a university I believe that universities are not doing enough to protect and help victims of sexual assault.

1. 1 in 5 women (20%) will be sexually assaulted while at college while only 4% of college men will be sexually assaulted. You can make a difference: take photos to share resources with sexual assault survivors. Sign up for Support for Survivors.\[1\]
2. Most college victims are assaulted by someone they know.\[2\]
3. 42% of college women who are raped tell no one about the assault.\[3\]
4. It is estimated that only 5% of sexual assaults on college campuses are reported, making sexual assault the most underreported crime.\[4\]

443,I’ve been feeling that my life is hopeless lately,"  I’m 41 years old.  I work as a senior software engineer.  I’ve had an amazing career and have been successful.  I’ve made a good amount of money and I’ve achieved much.   As a matter of fact most of my adult life has been committed to  career.   Almost the the point where it was literally a first class priority in my life.  

   Relationship wise it’s been a mixed bag.  But historically I’ve had a hard to creating attachments.  Occasionally I’ll have a relationship here or there but then I realize that I should be focusing on my career, and it ends naturally.

  Since COVID depression has really been coming over me.  I’ve felt isolated and lonely.  I’m surrounded constantly by my work, and it has been stressing me out.


  I recently met a woman online and it was a fantastic relationship.  I felt a deep connection I’ve never felt for another person. I really feel I’ve fell in love with her.   She even moved in with me and things were good.

   Since we are both overweight she has helped me learn to cook and we have lost weight.  We were a fantastic team.  But then she started to tell me she wanted to see other people and asked me if it was ok if she brought men into my place.    I was against it.

  Keep in mind we’re physical with each other.  She pattered told me she says what she says because she is afraid I may hurt her.  Anyway in a rash decision we had an argument and I decided to leave for a month.

  Since I left she processed her love for me.  But lately she has been distant and barely communicating.  Things got so bad that yesterday she said some brutal and nasty things to me.  Things that really signaled to me that, not only is it over, but she is probably using me in the process.

  I feel a level of devastation I’ve never felt before.  Like for the last 6 months my life has revolved around her and hers around me.  And to feel like it has to end is something I’m having a hard time dealing with.   I’ve been heart broken before, but I feel I’ve lost all meaning in my life.

  I’m just sad and as much as I’m trying to cope it’s just so overwhelming.   Money, other women, nothing cheers me up.  I know it feels childish but there is a level of dread within me that I can’t shake.

  And I know things between us will never be functional.  Anxiety has really really consumed me.  Even working out has not been able to help.  I just don’t know what to do.  Please help"

446,Is it possible to get in person appointments?,
447,How do I stop obsessing over someone?,"I've met this guy that I'll call G years ago, and from day one I was completely obsessed with him. Not even in a romantic kind of way, I just found him the perfect person for me to have around. We became friends and started hanging out and for me he was always on a pedestal. I'd text G more than I text most of my friends, always seek for his approval and all those things. For the whole period, since before I met him to the present day, I have been with an amazing boyfriend which I love and would not want to leave for him.

At some point I thought I was in love with G, which made me feel extremely guilty towards my boyfriend. Through the years, G did a bunch of stupid things and ended up hurting me, but I kept justifying him cause he was just so perfect. I am pretty sure I was acting quite crazy towards him, not really in a ""you're all mine"" fashion, but more doing anything for his attention. 

After a while I cut all contacts because I realized how toxic I was being and I didn't want to be that person. That was more than one year ago. Even after this long, I keep thinking about him, about texting him again ""just to see how he's doing"", about what he would think of me or say if he was still around. I'm not gonna act upon those thoughts, I know I don't need him and I'm a much better person without him, but I am still very bothered by these thoughts. They ruin my mood and make me panic quite a bit when they happen. 

I've been to therapy for other reasons and this came up multiple times in my sessions, but talking about him with my therapist ended up being just another way to obsess over him so she decided to just teach me mindfulness (all the ""think about something else"" stuff) and avoid the topic as much as we could. Well, I'm still here and I'm still obsessed, so I figured I'd post here to see if anyone had a similar experience and how they dealt with it."
448,Mental Health and Self Awareness,"Today I heard the phrase “you’re not crazy if you know you’re crazy”.
I know this phrase is more of a joke saying than anything but I got to thinking: is there a strong link between self awareness and mental health?
Mental health issues vary I know that and I’m not well versed in the science of it but I was just curious.
So two scenarios here:

1. Someone is learning about a simple issue (this as far as I know isn’t actually a diagnosable mental health problem but please correct me if I’m wrong) like a Messiah complex and thinks “that describes me, I should be more careful on how I view/conduct myself “.

2. The same as before but with an issue like an identity disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar.

How can self awareness affect the person suffering from these disorders, can it help or make it worse? And could the mentioned saying stop people from getting the help they need?"
449,Ever just don’t want to be here anymore?,"I’ve done outpatient therapy for around 2.5 years now and nothing seems to help. I have my own personal pharmacy of medication but none of it seems to work. 

I’m always tired. I’m never happy. I’m so overwhelmed by life and trying to function. I feel like a total disappointment and I cant seem to get a handle of anything. 

I used to have so much energy and drive. I wish mania would hurry up and hit me but the depression just seems to get worst. 

I’m not suicidal, I just don’t want to exist. Existing is exhausting. 

I’m so, so tired of being mentally ill."
450,My ex saw my scars and she kissed them,"(To clarify the situation. She is an ex because we want different things in life but we still care about each other and we are doing very good as friends)

She knew i cut myself and asked me to show her the cuts and after some mental preparation i did and she took my arm and caressed and kissed the cuts and scars.
After that and she gave me a kiss on the cheek and because I hadn't felt that nice for a long time i started crying and she made me promise to try and get better for my sake.
As a start i think that is difficult but she actually made me want to stop cutting because i now know that my actions can have consequences on her as well. It may be a small start but it's a start. Baby steps"

455,FML I don't think I can do this anymore.,"I've typed out and deleted this 4 times already and I still don't know where I am going with this. I'm such a fucking mess and I'm all over the place. I have Bipolar Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Intrusive thoughts and anger/emotional issues. My support system is shit, my friends and family all know what I'm going through but I don't wanna bug them anymore with my shit. I feel like I fucked up my whole life. For the past 20 years I emasculated myself, I put myself down and treated myself like trash, I completely obliterated my self confidence. I'm 38 now and I haven't dated anyone since I was 19. I felt like I would never be a good boyfriend or husband to anyone so I just belittled myself and didn't try anything with any girls. I honestly probably won't do bad with girls, I'm just too slow and dense to pick up on hints. I fantasize about relationships with girls that I'm into but I don't ever befriend them at all. I'll do the whole thing in my head, dating, engagement, marriage, the girl cheating on me and divorce, only to go back to sadness like a fucking creep, better this than to get hurt in RL. I once fantasized like this about a co-worker for a year. I didn't even know that she was into me until two coworkers mentioned it but she already moved on. So FML. I didn't do anything with her because she had a boyfriend. I choke up when speaking to women if I am even remotely interested in them. I have a ton more issues but I don't wanna bore anyone reading this. I'm not suicidal even though I've tried twice in the past. But I can feel myself going into that mindset once again. Last night I was pretty close to hanging myself. I feel like everyone in my life just moved on and left me, I was sick for 10 years so I was stuck at home for the majority of my 20s, so I never got to experience alot of social things, I feel like a caveman. I grew up in an abusive home, my mom was doing drugs when she was pregnant with me, she's also fucking psycho and beat us every fucking day. Sorry if this sounds whinny. I don't fucking know what to do anymore. I don't even know if anyone is gonna read this. I have two days off after today, I might sort things out and maybe jump off a bridge or something when I'm finished. I'm fucking tired and done. Nothing good has ever happened in my life. Everything is a never ending spiral into despair. Fuck life."
456,Depression has settled in and have started drinking more. My wife has been distant lately and I don’t know what to do?,I lost my job back in March due to COVID and I struggling to find work. I find myself falling into a deep depression and I drink to cope with my emotions. My wife has been very distant lately and when I express my feelings she really dose not say much. Need some advice
457,Im not depressed but someone I love is,"Hi all this is my first post here.

Somebody I love so so much is going through such a hard time right now.  They just want to be happy, thats it, but just cant.  This person is just so tired of feeling this way and has suicidal ideations.  They also recently got out of a very toxic relationship and growing up they felt worthless.

We're both minors and our parents dont think mental illness is serious so they are of no help.  I would take them to seek professional help but I cant right now but I will be able to drive soon(hopefully) so I will try to convince them to go with me.

So right now, we vent to each other, we share how we feel and we share our secrets.  I try to make them feel better by saying things like, Im glad you exist, thank you for being alive, I love you, Im always here for you, I appreciate you, things will get better, etc.

I was also depressed once so I know what not to say.  This person sometimes expresses deep gratitude to what I say and sometimes its just a short response like okay thank you.

When its the short responses, I feel like nothing I said actually touched them or helped, it feels like it just bounced right off.  I will keep saying these but I cant help but just feel so frustrated and bad that I cant help them with my words.

Am I not doing enough?  Am I really helping?  Im so worried and feel so much pain for them.  I guess this is all.  Thank you all in advance"
458,why i am like i sm,"Why I am who I am

 (this whole text is pulled from google trandlate but it is 100%my own story)

Hello i'm a 15 yo male from sweden, we might have diffrent age grade system but were i live you start first grade at 7 yo and after every summer a new grade starts.

Ever since I was little I have become the forgotten one in the family, of course I got a few years when I was very small but as soon as my brother came I was like forgotten because my brother has always been in focus after he has ADHD and  need a lot more attention and then I get none and I kind of never got that.  My parents want me to be like my sister who is a child who spends all her free time studying but what they do not understand is that I can not, as well as literally can not focus on what I want.  They want me to be perfect but they are not willing to help me.  They always compare with my sister even though I already know that I will never be like her but it does not make them.  I have felt lonely for a long time but it is not without reason, while I went in the 1-3th grade I had almost no friends but I had a friend (Liam).  Liam was the only one I had to talk to, we were best friends but he never wanted to be with me at school because he was ashamed to be friends with me.  This made me go and feel bad daily and cry almost every night I came home.  The first thing I did when I got home was literally go to bed and cry, this went on for several years every day.  I never had anyone to talk to about it because my parents just said either that it was nothing special because everyone had their periods where they felt bad or told them that it was just my fault and that I would blame myself for what I did.  did.  But the thing was that I had not done anything, I have now in retrospect talked to some from my old class who were sometimes kind to me behind closed doors and asked them why, the only answers I got was that they chose me to  I had glasses at the time and they had noticed that I was already feeling bad and that they thought it was fun when I got angry.  Between the 4-6th grade I felt even worse, it was even then at the beginning of the 4th that my ""friend"" abandoned me.  It was because it turned out that he was friends with me that he did not want to be with me because he knew he would become popular if he continued to be with me.  Time kept going and everything just got worse and worse, now it was not only at home that I felt bad, now it was also at school that I could lock myself in the toilet and skip whole lessons just to sit there and think about mine  life and if it was worth living at all because I already knew then that it would not be anything of me, I felt then that it was not worth living anymore, it was then that I decided to escape from home, I  packed a bag full of clothes and food and money.  I opened my window and was ready to jump out and escape but then my mother had heard my window open and then she went up to check what I was doing.  Then she found my bag that I had packed and then they put a child lock on my window and gave me a curfew for several months.  They just wanted to punish me, they refused to try to get help even though they had noticed that I never had any friends or talked to anyone and they knew I was very lonely.  When I had had enough of always being alone and not being able to talk to anyone, I went to my teacher and talked to her in a group room.  She immediately realized the seriousness of my situation and she understood why I felt the way I did and she actually wanted to help me.  She said that I would rather do an investigation for mental illness but that my parents would need to fix it.  I went to my parents and told them that I was feeling bad and that I had no friends and that I wanted an investigation but they just said that it was not needed and that it was just my fault and that it was just a period.  In that situation, I had no friends, I felt shit every day and I had no real will to live.  It was then that I decided for the first time to try to take my own life.  I told my parents that I was going out with a friend but really I went to school and climbed to the roof, where I sat for several hours and just looked down, I knew it was not very high but I thought I would still  die if I jumped.  So that's what I did, I jumped but I managed with only one sprained foot.  Nothing changed in a few months before my parents found me crying in my bed in the middle of the night, I told them how I had no friends and that I was bullied so I wanted to change schools.  For once, they believed in me and we applied to the only other school in hearing that was an alternative but it was full so nothing happened.  A few months later, two new boys started in the class (Sefti and Elias), they would be my best and only friends I had during that time, they managed to change me so that I did not want to die anymore, anyway for that moment.  I was friends with them until the end of the 6th grade when I changed school to ks because they did not have high school there.

 But when I started in high school and made new friends and a new start I became happier, and when I became happier I started eating more and then I got fat, this only made me start to feel bad about myself again and then it stopped  I eat for shorter periods and develop anorexia.  My anorexia lasted for almost the entire 7th grade when I felt that it was absolutely not good to starve myself as much as I did and finally managed to get rid of it before the summer holidays between the 7th and the 8th.  During the summer holidays I started to feel fat again and then I started to get anorexia back and I still have it today, I still feel bad about how my old class treated me and how my parents did not care, I still have a hard time  talking about my feelings and talking to people at all due to not having any friends for so long made me “socially awkward” and I do not know how to deal with certain situations.  I just want to be loved, I just want to experience everything I have missed out on.....

It is now today and i just got home from training and i instantly started crying again, it has bel like this the last 2 weeks now and i'm not thinking of comitting suecide again ."
459,"I’m a 20 years old men ,I’m depress like I never been and have an alcohol addiction","( First of all, I just want to say sorry for my bad English some part of this text will be translate by Google translate) 
So like I said I’ve been really depress lately cause I’m 20 years old, I don’t have a ""real"" job, one of my best friend pass away last week, I failed my class I get kick out of the school ( but I’m happy about it cause I really hate what I was studying for) and with the pandemic right now everything is closed in Canada so there nothing to do. I can’t see my friend too because in The province of Quebec meeting with friends at your house is prohibited because of the pandemic. So for a few months my mental health just go down. The only thing that make me feel better is the alcohol cause when I drink I just feel so good everything that make me stress or sad just disappears. But When the morning come and I’m hangover I really feel like a piece of shit all I do about my day is laying in my bed and when the night come I drink, I’ve been doing this for three months and I’m really tired of this kind of live. I’m really rude with my family and I feel really bad about it because they just want me to feel better and I’m just acting like a jerk. I really want to feel better because this is not a life... So I plan quitting alcohol because i think it’s the first step to help me feel better. It’s been 3 days that I don’t drink alcohol but now every night I’m just craving for a beer but I try to not drink cause I just want to be happy again loving life again and maybe find somethings to study for that I will really enjoy. 
So now the night come I really want to drink does somebody have advices for me to help me not drinking. Cause I’ve been doing this for like 3 month every day so it’s really not easy to do pass the night without drinking. 
Thank you for reading!"
460,I think too much about things and it ruins all of my relationships.,I’m not sure what I am looking for here. I lost my love of three years. Someone I obviously care deeply about. I am very judgmental and think to much into stuff. I take the smallest things and blow them into these huge deals. I have horrible anxiety and horrible trust issues. I wish sometimes I could just turn my damn brain off. I haven’t slept in probably two months and I hardly eat. I have a close friend who I may lose because I am leaning on them too much with this breakup. Luckily for me my friend has patients with me and somewhat understands. I don’t know what I’m looking for here I just needed to vent I guess. I don’t want this to continue to ruin my life the way it does.
461,Distress,"So a little ago my parents were thinking of getting a divorce, they sorted it out but im still in major distress, i heard my dad crying really badly and it was very distressing to hear, now every few days i think about it and it really upsets me i dont know what to do about it as it is very distressing"
462,What the heck am I doing,"Okay so, I usually use jodel for these kind of posts, but earlier I actually downloaded an app that blocks jodel because I spend so much time on it and there is nothing I can do right now to get on the app. So I made a reddit user of course.

I just need to write to someone what is going on.

To set the atmosphere, I am abroad at the moment, studying. I don't speak the language and they don't really know English either. 

Anyways, a week ago or so, I had gotten myself a nice UTI, and I had two tablets left from a packet from an earlier antibiotics treatment, so last night I thought, even though I have heard that you should not do this and I will regret it for the rest of my life, that I should just take the two and see if it would get any better. So I took one of them and I couldn't really swallow it. It got stuck in my throat. I spent the entire night, until 4 am trying to get it down, by eating bread, drinking tons of water, drinking hot water, hot water with baking soda, eating peanutbutter, you name it. Nothing worked. 

So today I still had the feeling that it was in my throat. I freaked out a little bit and I went to the emergency room. When I got there, I was too embarassed by the fact that I thought I had a pill in my throat, because I am known to be a hypochondriac, so I only told them that I had a UTI. I got antibiotics for the UTI and went home.

I still had the feeling of the pill in my throat when I went to bed and I started googling and I got more freaked out and just decided to go to the emergency room AGAIN at like 9.30 pm. This time they asked why the f I didn't tell them about the throat pill thing earlier today and I just answered that I didn't think it was that serious then, but now I did. So, very annoyed, they took my temperature, which was too high, and concluded that because of throat discomfort (that I explained several times was because of the pill I took) and fever, I had to go get tested for covid. I was directed to another emergency room, they also took my temperature. It was too low, but they tested me for covid anyway. So now I am sitting in a covid emergency room waiting for the covid results, and I am still freaking out about the antibiotic pill stuck in my throat. I don't even know what to do at this point. Just go home after I get the negative results and wait to die from a perforated esophagus or somethint. I am so fucking dumb, I amaze myself every day."

464,I dont know what to do.,"I (16M) a couple years ago was attacked while walking home and attacked, a couple people who I think are couple years older than me attacked me with fists and knives, I got slashed on my arm, I broke one of their arms when I fight I go insane I dont know what im doing ill just destroy everything in sight. Ever since then I've tried to supress my thoughts, now more then ever sometimes its all I think about and I'm struggling whenever I see a knife I'll panic and drop my heart rate goes really high I have to lay down to calm myself or I'll smash something or end up even hurting someone else. And sometimes even when nothings happening I can see them and ill start shaking.So far I've managed to keep it hidden from my friends they dont know but I always make sure im covered, no one knows at my 6th form. Theres just days where im so sad aswell I just want to be happy, I feel so disengaged from people aswell like I have to stay away because they'll get hurt. I just dont know what to do anymore. (Posting for anykind of support, anything would be nice.)"
465,"Not sure if this belongs here, but I can’t find anything on my issue.","M26. Recently I’ve had issues with what I would call strong thought-associations. Essentially, I associate a certain task with something that is unrelated. Sometimes that association is harmless, other times it causes me a lot of anxiety.

A couple examples— every time I use a hair dryer, I think of a particular friend my brother once had; completely unrelated and harmless, but I can’t control the recurring thought-association. Every time I stretch, I think of a meme my friend made of me that was offensive.

I want to move past these associations, but I don’t feel like I have control over the patterns."

I do talk to her about how she’s doing but I want to know how to better my own understanding of what he’s going through and hopefully make a positive affect on her mental health.

467,I start a new job in a few weeks and I’m so worried that I’ll feel so much pressure And relapse.,"I usually find distracting myself is a good way to not think about things, but since lockdown I’ve been relapsing a lot lately. I’m so worried that my mental health will get in the way of my new job and I’ll make so many mistakes. 
I’ve had several jobs in the past and my mental health has flared up so much I’ve had to quit because it was too much for me.. 
Can someone help me with how to overcome this fear?? It’s a job that will lead me into my dream career so I wanna do my absolute best:(("
468,I'm a peice of sh*t,I'm a fucking idiot just realised what I did I was at school and like just was mad at myself and I was crying but like there was no water coming out of my eyes wasn't thinking and my fucking shitty brain thought that I should hate my hand cause I half to I don't know why it hurts so much like I'm a dumb ass wtf is wrong with me
469,Can someone maybe tell me why?,"So I have and always had this thing where I made up fake people and made it seem super real to other people. Like, just a fake example but: *me making a new account on social media as uhh- 'Linda' and just pretend to be Linda and make myself interact with Linda and make Linda seem so real, people will believe its a real friend of mine and interact with Linda too*

My head just wants to start over again, over and over again. 

Can someone please maybe tell me why I'm doing this, or maybe diagnose me or whatever? Thanks xx!"
470,I'm moving into my own apartment in a few days time. I think it's going to be the fresh start I need.,"I'm living in rented accommodation and although the owner is nice enough being there hasn't helped my mental health. I'm not eating enough and felt constantly on edge.

I think moving into my own place will be the start to make myself better."
471,I hurt my husband and need advice,"Let me just start off by saying that I have been struggling with extreme anxiety and depression for most of my life, but am just now getting comfortable with the idea of it. Comfortable saying I have it, just started therapy to get it under control... etc. It has caused some issues between me and my new husband - we just got married a few months ago and it hasn’t been easy and I blame myself for that. Now, I’ve really fucked up and need advice on what to do. I am so ashamed of myself and it hurts me to even talk about this, but I am at a loss. 

A few of weeks ago, we decided to go have some drinks and have a good time, but I made the mistake of drinking way too much. I should have known better to do that with the state of mind I have been in. We had a great time while we were out, but as soon as we got home, I don’t remember a single thing. (I am telling the rest of this story by HIS memory of it.) We hadn’t really gotten into an argument, but he was sitting on the edge of the bed with his hands together and I was trying to pry them apart and ended up bending his fingers back too far on accident. He pushes me off of him and I lost it. I punched him in the head over, and over again. Walked out, came back in for more, and threw a glass of water on him as well. He couldn’t move or defend himself. I finally left the room to go downstairs, he came downstairs 10 minutes later and he says it was like I had no idea what I had done to him. He said he needed to go to the hospital, and I said that he didn’t and he was fine... I acted like he was over reacting. The only thing I had to prove I had done this was a bruised hand and a traumatized husband the next day. I feel like a monster, I am a monster. I did not know I was capable of doing something like that. 

We have had our good-ish and bad days over the last few weeks, but there is still that elephant in the room. I have apologized over and over again, talked about how I am willing to do whatever it takes to make it up to him. He says all he needs me to do is get better, but on the other hand, says I haven’t done enough to make it right. I honestly thought I was, but our ideas of what “making it right” is are slightly different. He corrected me, and I did more things to make him feel special on top of what I had been doing. 

As I have mentioned earlier, I struggle with depression and anxiety, and have been really bad for a while. This situation has left me feeling even worse, but am trying by best to be mindful and take care of myself because that is how I will get better. 

The pressure that is being put on me to be that new person is beginning to weigh heavy on my shoulders. I can’t make a mistake, say the wrong thing, or have a bad day because he will not want to be around me. I am beginning to feel that I cannot do anything right. My anxiety is giving me anxiety, my thoughts are snowballing. My fear that he is going to leave me is growing stronger, even though he says he won’t. 

I am aware that I need to have patience and that it is going to take however long it is going to take for him to heal. He is going to go through phases of acceptance, anger, resentment and anything else that comes to mind. 

What more do I need to do? I am beginning to feel that I am putting his oxygen mask on before mine. I put us in this situation, so I am not thinking “woe is me” at all. I am just struggling with how to go about this from here. I need to be  better in order to make it right, but how do I do both?"
472,Am I psychotic? Or should I go to a neurologist?,"     Is it normal to have panic attacks with confusion, anger, crying, sometimes laughing, and visual disturbances? I get extreme paranoia and electrical feelings all over my body and I'm extremely confused. Sometimes I have weird thoughts like panda bears are going to Mars. Lol. But usually when this happens I have a normal heart rate and a stomach ache. And my visuals are weird amd I can see things stretch and swirl and go from 2D to 3D. It makes me feel ill. And coming out of it I feel very disoriented and I take time to recover. I have to do repetitive motions or  I just feel overall drained of energy and still quite confused. Sometimes I have mild confusions and my eyes get lazy and feel weird.
       Sometimes it effects my sleep. I can wake up or fall asleep hearing things and I feel delusional and psychotic. I get afraid of the dark and nothing seems to calm me down. I hate having sleep paralysis for 3 hours. Does it usually last that long? I don't know haha. But usally when I'm sleeping or waking up. Because my body feels like its on fire I want to call 911. Its scary. Ive had worse convulsions with my eyes rolling back in my head and fluttering and things jumping in my vision. Random blinking and tics and full body shaking where I'm aware. 
       Ive heard voices and smelled weird things before. It scares me but I know the voices aren't real. Amd when I hallucination scary things its usually when I close my eyes. I'm just tired. I have had Esptien Barr and weird Migrane vertigo auras or whatever they might be for the past few months. I ended up being reffered to a psychiatric doc rather than a Nuerologist which I'm annoyed about. I just hate people saying I'm going insane or psychotic or a hypochondriac because of all the weird things happening. But if you think so, I'd love your input."
473,I feel like I can only be happy around my boyfriend,[removed]
474,Is it risky seeing a psychiatrist who sees another family member of mine?,"I’m not even a minor, and I know about confidentiality laws (United States) but I’m kind of worried he might talk about me to the family member.

The reason I’m considering it is because the family member brought my medications up to him, and he said it does a lot of bad things, while my current doctor refuses to believe in even COMMON side effects.

I’m kind of hoping this doctor knows about PSSD, as I’m concerned about getting it when or if I get off of my meds. One is an SSRI, and I don’t even know how the other one interacts with it.

I’ve taken high doses for 9 years, so I’m very doubtful that I WON’T experience long-term issues. People report not just loss of libido, genital numbness, loss of pleasure from orgasm, inability to orgasm, also inability to experience any kind of pleasure whatsoever. I’ve experienced degrees of these things while on the meds, who the hell knows what being on them for so long has done to me or will do to me from withdrawal.

Wellbutrin apparently (first causing extreme dysfunction when temporarily doubled) eventually allowed me to, for the first time in my life, orgasm so strongly I actually felt it as MINDBLOWING. I definitely want to share that experience with a girlfriend one day..... I want to be able to experience romantic AND sexual feelings, even if the relationship only lasts a short time (sea full of fish, right?).

The fact that he is more knowledge about one medicine, implies that he might be about more. Maybe he even knows about PSSD and other Post-SSRI side effects.

Reading on the PSSD subreddit, it sounds like even when these loss of feelings and functions are long-term, they’re not actually the result of permanent damage. As many people claim trying different things and experiencing windows of pleasure.

It gets worse, some people report losing the ability TO ENJOY MUSIC!!!!!!!! NO!!!"

479,Experiencing extreme insomnia after a depressive episode.,"Hi! Thanks for clicking.


I had a very rough few weeks - working lots of overtime, a death in the family, a girl tried to get my boyfriend to cheat, etc.

During these weeks I felt nothing, I focused on staying functional so I could do my job well.

Then I had a 1 week vacation. During 3 nights, I cried like I haven't cried in years. On the last night, things got so bad that I was essentially paralyzed.

I was laying next to my boyfriend who was trying to talk to me and calm me down. Although I wanted to, I could not say a single word. I was completely unable to move. Whenever he moved my head or arms, they would stay put exactly as he positioned them.

I was in this state for 1.5 hours. I don't remember most of what he said. I had no thoughts. I just completely disconnected from the world. After a while, I managed to move the fingertips on my left hand. And 30 minutes later, I was able to stand up (after he literally moved my body to helped me sit).

The next day, we woke up at 10.30. And from then on, I stayed awake. 

Until 23.30 the next day. I literally didn't sleep for 37 hours. I didn't even feel tired. 

I felt ... elated. It's as if something that had been making me tired for weeks, has suddenly been lifted off my shoulders, and it provided me with an extra boost of energy. Like, the usual exhaustion was gone, and with nothing to exhaust me, I just stayed awake.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?
Are there any terms that could describe what I went through?

First time posting here btw."

481,"I dont know which doctor to believe , and idk whats going on with me.","I know this isnt the place and that i wont get a definitive  answer but anyway.

februrary 2019 i went to the hospital because i couldnt sleep and was having intrusive thoughts (eyes being slashed by razors and this kinda of thing) and i also was angry all the time, and have thoughts of inflicting violence upon other people, i always had these desires but they were generally directed at people that reminded me of people that hurt me, when i began my treatment the doctor said i might be schizophrenic  and gave me prozac for my depression and  respridone  (antipsychotic), one year later it seems that this medic didnt care about me or something, all he did was prescribe more meds that he didnt know if they were working or not, so i tried getting into a place here in my  town, there i would get better appointments  and acess to meds, but the doctor there said i wasnt ""fit"" to be there since they deal with more dire cases there, anyway i was off meds again (treating the ones i loved like crap) and wanting to kill people but this time it didnt matter that they didnt resemble the ones that hurt me, like  fantasizing about mass shooting or putting bombs in places (dont worry i dont have access to any firearm nor do i know how to make bombs) but the desire was there, i told the doctor all this for 10 minutes and she just said i was impulsive but i had it under control, the problem is that i didnt care about these people that i wanted  to hurt, there was no empathy, to be honest  i kinda lost  sympathy for most people ( i still love some members of my family and 1 friend)

i just dont know what to make of these things, when you talk to me irl im just a regular a guy on the outside (save sometimes i go back and forth because when i went forward i had a bad thought so i have to go back to ""nullify"" the thought) apart from what i mentioned i pass a normal person even tho i have these violent thoughts.

sorry for the wall of text and bad english."
482,Other people being real scares me?,"I don't really understand what is happening to me, but maybe someone can relate?

For a while now, I've been noticing that I tend to forget that other people are real. I talk to them, I interact with them and they exist. But then suddenly I remember that they also exist while I'm not around and it scares me. Or if I don't talk to someone for a while, I kinda forget they exist.

The thought that everyone else around me is as real as I am, experiencing life just as I am, scares me so much. Whenever it comes up, I have to push it away and ignore it to continue functioning.

I don't use people, I don't view them as objects. But it terrifies me that they are real and I almost can't really grasp what that even means because it scares me so much.

Does anyone else experience this? Any advice on how to deal with this fear?"
483,Covid 19 mental health help!!,"(Kinda serious) Covid 19 mentalHey people of Reddit, recently with the U.K. we have all gone into this lockdown and before this lockdown i finally became well disciplined and was making a lot of progress with the gym and learning to drive which have been my main goals and I was a lot happier, which I struggled with a lot previously as to put it bluntly I’ve had a really difficult year this year (failing 3 driving tests, losing family members, relationships falling apart, losing money and hours at my job, got out of shape etc.). but finally as I start to pull myself together and plow through it and find that sense of achievement I’ve needed to keep me busy it’s kind of all just been thrown back at my face like a massive ‘fuck you!!’ With this new lockdown situation happening.  Now I just feel everything slipping again and all my progress going to waist and it almost feels inevitable, I even struggle with more basic stuff now and lack motivation heavily as I was quite disciplined before hand and a lot more happier and to be honest cared about myself quite a bit more but now I just kind of have the fuck it attitude and really struggle to find the effort to care anymore this also really affects my self esteem as I can be quite confident, charismatic and well put together and that’s who I want to be but it just feels like I’m constantly being set back by shit that isn’t in my control and I really don’t know what to do with it anymore. Working out at the gym was the main thing that gave me a clear goal and something I could put my mind to and really focus on but now I really don’t know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated! health"

485,Fragments of memory and severe nausea at seemingly random times.,"Multiple times today, I have had my mind flooded with several random memories of events/images. I have no recollection of most of these, but they are all so mundane and seem fitting enough. For about thirty seconds, I'll have a very distinct recollection of several events at once, accompanied by increasing nausea. Then, when the event has ended, the nausea stops abruptly, and I can't remember what exactly the contents of those ""memories"" were, just that the event had happened, and the feeling that those memories were eerily familiar, but still not recognizable, like waking up and trying to remember a dream. Is there any cause to this? Someone I can at least talk to about it?"
486,"For those of you who’ve been to a mental hospital, what’s it like? I’m not sure if I should go. Mild TW: suicide","I'm a 16 year old high school senior in the US. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for over 2 years, but my mental health has gotten to its lowest point lately.

I had a suicide attempt about a week ago. These past few months I've barely been eating, showering, or taking basic care of myself. If I'm not in class, I probably spend all my time online or gaming to distract myself from everything. I have at least 2 small mental breakdowns a day.

I'm usually a very good student but for the first time in my life I've been missing classes due to oversleeping, not handing in assignments, doing badly on tests, etc. It's affected my college application process. 

I am so burnt out and so defeated. Every waking moment is hard no matter how much I try to adopt a positive mindset. 

But I can still get out of bed in the morning and if I really push myself I can hand in assignments or concentrate for short periods of time, like how I am writing this post. It feels really dramatic and selfish of me to want to go to the hospital because in certain moments it feels like I am alright or like it’s not that bad.

Most of the teens who share their experience there say it was horrible and that they were treated like animals. Also, my parents aren't supportive and I know they will take it the wrong way or see me in a different light if I go. Not to mention, I would miss several school days and be even more behind. 

Could you guys please share what it's like in the mental hospital or any tips/advice?"
487,"Loneliness, depression, lack of feeling","posted this in a mental health discord a little while ago, figured i might as well put it here too.

im just so tired all the time. i dont really feel anything of particular substance, mild interests in vapid topics, distractions in the form of music, movies or videogames, thats all it ever really is. i dont have anyone, i did once, a long time ago, but not anymore. much of the time if i let my thoughts alone they wander back to when things felt like they mattered a little more, just because i thought i had someone to share it all with. now i pay people to talk about my problems, take pills that smell like paint, pursue a career i dont care about, and move on like everything is fine. all those sessions and programs i got put through to help with my mental state gave me skills to keep me stable, but i dont want to just be stable, i want to be happy. is that too much to ask? the good times pass just as quickly as the bad, it all feels so pointless, like trying to get a grip on running water. i just wish the people that mattered would stay, just so i could feel like i was living life again, instead of whatever this is. i keep waiting for it to get better, talking to people to maybe find someone else, it all just feels like running from the truth. like im moving towards an outcome i cant avoid, and no matter what i do i cant pull myself out of the riptide, i always just rebound back into it. i fucking hate it, i fucking hate being so tired, i fucking hate forcing myself to move. it never goes away, you can only distract from it. i hope this is coherent, does anyone else feel similarly? would be nice to feel less alone for a minute."
488,Awful Guilt over something that I can't control,"I often feel extremely guilty over what other people may consider small mistakes, heck some might not even think of them as mistake. I guess I just give myself this moral ideology that I have to live up to. However it seems like I have never been able to balance Morals, the Law, Relationships, and my health all at the same time. If I want one to be satisfied, another must be neglected. I even have this real important feeling that I must 100% obey the law and never make a mistake. I mean, at a point in my life I would literally tear myself up over Jaywalking. So This guilt I feel is somehow all tied to my morals, which I guess includes the law, because I guess I just feel it is important. So not to get into detail, but Years ago something happened that I feel bad about surrounding the law. However I was 10 years old, and it wasn't even my fault, it was my dads. I guess I feel guilt just because he did it with me in mind. I might be more open to explaining details but that is the basis of it. I feel unless I am perfect and I make sure I have done everything perfectly and exceptionally and morally...I have failed and I am awful. Even when it comes down to things that are not 100% in my control or 100% my fault. I find it impossible sometimes to accept a mistake, or let it go. It is likely what sends me into depressive states because I feel like the only acceptable solution is to go back and do it right, which obviously is not possible."

492,How to deal with a mentally ill family member that refuses help.,"I’m located in Virginia, US, and I live with my girlfriend and her dad. Her father (77) has been mentally degrading for years now, before I got here last August 2019, and especially since I’ve been here he’s gotten worse. He doesn’t own the home and he’s living off of veterans disability assistance (not mentally related). He has an authority complex where he feels like the head of household and that anything that happens has to go through him first, and that his opinion matters most. He literally only talks about politics and occasionally, maybe 5 percent of the time, he’ll talk about football. 

He’s a bulldozer in conversation and, like everything else, his opinion comes first. He doesn’t work, he gets social security and the veterans assistance, he has no friends, he leaves the house maybe 1-2 times a week for groceries. He refuses to fix the broken dryer, sink, and he just broke one of our toilets this morning. My girlfriend and I cannot afford to fix these ourselves, but we do pay him rent every month. There is no lease from him so we can’t force him to fix anything and we can leave whenever we want we just live in a really high cost of living area, but we are working on it. 

He gets really angry and yells at my girlfriend (his daughter) repeatedly, he tries to walk over her all the time. When she sticks up for herself he gets even angrier and a few weeks ago he threw a wet/dirty sponge at her face and it hit her in the eye. He never apologizes and he won’t change. We’ve already tried talking to him but he doesn’t care. He’s a pathological liar and he will lie about anything from taking us out to dinner tomorrow to actually fixing the dryer. He lies constantly and is insufferable. 

My girlfriend cares about him and doesn’t want him to whither away alone whenever we leave. He’s extremely full of himself so I doubt he’d ever leave to a nursing home or assisted living facility. Are there any options to fix this situation? I will elaborate on anything in the comments if I wasn’t clear about anything. Thanks."

496,Do I have Anxiety?,"I never thought I had anxiety, but over the past year or so, mainly during quarantine I’ve been feeling very different. First of all, I can’t fall asleep until about 4 in the morning every night for no reason. I’m constantly looking for something to do but never satisfied with anything I end up doing. I constantly get this feeling similar to nervousness, like butterflies in my stomach when literally nothing is going on. This has caused me to have some stomach problems where I shit extremely often (sorry for TMI). Lastly, I worry a lot about my health, and I keep developing suspicions that I have certain diseases or sicknesses when I really dont. Overall, my mind is basically never at rest it feels like. I’m not very educated on what anxiety is, but based on my internet research I think I have at least mild anxiety. Can someone who is knowledgable on this topic give me a “diagnosis”?

497,What medicine can I talk to my doctor about that has few side effects? What I take doesn't work at all it seems.,"I was taking 20mg Lexapro for anxiety and depression for over 6 months.

Libido is basically fine but it just doesn't seem like the fluoxetine is working much anymore. I just can't relax my mind. I also take ativan on rough days but I keep myself away from taking it daily. 

I just feel so insanely overwhelmed mentally. I can't handle mental stimulation. I go in full panic mode. My depression is terrible for me. I used to be so relaxed and would shrug everything off. Now I just have no zest for life at all. It's the kind of depression that you can't put a finger on as to why. 

I would like to try something else but don't know what I can try that is safe as compared to Lexapro and fluoxetine. Can anyone give me some suggestions that I can research and talk to my doctor about?"

I have so much trouble trying to connect with people, but part of me likes the cold loneliness. The list goes on but they are all like that. My feelings contradict. I have problems but I don’t like the solutions as much as I don’t like the problem. The stress and anxiety of trying to connect with people hurts me just as much as being alone hurts. Not that it would matter. I hate myself too much to be in any real relationship. I use people as escapes. Often the only thing that keeps me going is pent up anger and that can make me very nasty. The advice I get is “change” and “find meaning in life.” I don’t want to change. I hate practically everything about me. So what I just stop being me? I put on some act?

I told her that was manipulative and she needs to stop and she said she's sorry but this kept happening so I went off about how my mental health is shit and how my anxiety and depression are severe and the only things preventing me from seriously contemplating suicide are my family, pets, and boyfriend along with my fear of death and how she needs to stop apologizing and just learn. Not just for my sake but for her own and for her future relationships and I'm so worried I came off as a douche even though I know I tried establishing boundaries repeatedly and she didn't listen and my anxiety is worse after sending it.

503,I feel like I don't have the privilege (?) to be validly depressed and anxious,"HUGE VENT COMING UP I'M SO SORRY

I've (F, 22) been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for about 5 years. I'm what you could describe as a high functioning mentally ill person. Throughout my years, though there's always been some good times that make me forget how I could ever be so sad sometimes everything just gets too much. I always try to work full time, or as much as I can when I have uni because I don't do too well in the latter due to my laziness (depression? Lazy? Idk), anxiety facing assignments, and inability to focus. This is so I can at least say while I'm doing fuck all at uni I am still being useful and raking in some money. 

I tend to villainise myself and downplay or invalidate all my feelings, some of my friends have been telling me for ages but I refuse to believe I should be nicer bc I think: if I can work why can't I study? And its a constant turmoil between telling myself to stop whinging, suck it up and get along you're just not trying OR aww you poor thing you need mental days off, you're doing so well boo boo. 

Ironically this constant back and forth impedes any sort of progress I make with my mental health bc the minute I try to suck it up, after a while it gets all too much and I can't handle it (whether cos I've been so coddled I can't handle the normal pressures and obstacles everyone faces in life). Or the flip side if I coddle myself and let myself rest I worry so hard about money. My job is very unforgiving, if you take days off you don't get work (I work in a factory) bc everyone else is fighting for shifts anyway. I know I can find another job but as long as you work full time without fail here you will usually always be able to get regular work so I get scared to leave in case I don't find a good stable job and can't go back. 

I've deferred uni this year amidst this bullshit pandemic and plan to stop work altogether to focus on study next year anyway so no point looking for a new job really at this point. I'm going to then mooch off my poor mum and my savings while I study and the thought of being completely reliant on my PENSIONER mother really fucks me up. She doesn't understand depression and anxiety (if I have it???? God idk) so won't be happy to hear I'm having days off or ""time to heal"". So that is another external pressure on top of all the mixed feelings in my head.

Does anyone feel the same way? They don't have the time, resources, or money to allow themselves rest and to recharge in between working, getting enough sleep, buying and doing things you need to maintain your household, chores, seeing friends, etc? 

I just feel so tired and hopeless even though I feel like I do fuck all, I just work, sleep, sometimes cook and do yoga when I can, clean the house, and try to make time to see friends, talk to my counsellors regularly, and sesrch for a good, affordable psychologist (which is bloodly hard yards where I live haha). I constantly wonder if I'm even depressed and anxious or if it's just all in my head.

But when life throws us in a spin, we can lose the use of our happiness muscle. When that happens, we need to work on building our happiness muscle."
506,Way to deal with Weight gain and depression ?,"F(29) Over the years I’ve gained some weight but I’ve always been pretty skinny with a decent body. It’s one thing I actually liked about myself. When my depression got too much to handle alone I decided to get therapy and they put me on medication. I gained 50lb in only a few month and that made my depression sooo much worse. I could feel the medication working somewhat but the weight gain made me want to kill myself because I don’t recognize myself anymore and I no longer had the one thing to hold on too. I stopped taking the medication and decided to just deal with being sad all the time and try to lose the weight. Now, it’s a year later, I can’t lose the weight and I still want to die. Does anyone have any thoughts on more natural ways to help depression OR a decent way to lose weight outside of the diet and exercise that doesn’t seem to help at all. If I can’t fix (or at least start to fix) one of these things I don’t see myself lasting till Christmas."

508,Is this anxiety?,Hello I’ve always wondered if these things were anxiety. Thankfully I have gotten better but I’ve never gotten professional help or diagnosed before. For a month I was having what I think was panic attacks every night. I would start to feel dizzy and nauseous and I would feel as though my life was in extreme danger so basically I was just terrified. I couldn’t stand and if I did I would fall because of fatigue. My thoughts were racing and I would usually shake. My muscles would tense and I would kick my legs. I would also grasp at my hair. I never pulled my hair out but I would pull at it and grasp my scalp. This would last for 20-40 minutes. Each time it happened I never knew why it happened since I would be doing whatever and it would then just come out of the blue. I haven’t had a panic attack like this for quite some time now and the last time I did was for a proper reason that was understandable. What is this?
509,"I’ve ignored my diagnosis of PTSD for a while now. I want to start managing it, what helps the flashbacks go and stay away?","Posting this here as well as another subreddit as I would like as much advice as I can get really. 

My flashbacks are triggered when I’m trying to sleep, there’s nothing going on now the day is over and I’m too tired to keep myself busy, there’s silence in the room and then all of a sudden a flood of traumatic memories come flooding in. I feel my body tense as it did when the event happened, I feel intense emotional pain as if it’s just happened all over again. I cringe, flinch and sometimes I notice I have a facial expression as if I’m hurting/cringing, it’s all stiffened up and when I notice it I go back to my neutral facial expression, it’s weird. 

I’ve not read a lot on PTSD because as I mentioned in the title, ever since my psychiatrist diagnosed me, I’ve full on pushed it away, I don’t know why. 

Any advice and information would be massively appreciated."

516,Nightmares every other night,"Hello

I have very bad mental health. I took approach of a scientist or observant just to keep myself going. I have nightmares for a very long time, they all about inducing fear. But recently I got some real nasty stuff going.

&gt;!This was second time I have dreamed about killing my own mother. And I stuffed her in backpack that I walked around with. Before I can find side to bury her or burn the body. !&lt;

I am completely aware of how insane this is. I got this problem with rage, it's not even rage but rather going full berserk. I did a lot of training to assert control, but no success. And then of course when I calm down, I have huge regrets of my actions. And fear of consequences. I had to essentially isolate myself from society completely, in order to avoid risk.

And I dream about people and things that happening 15-20 years ago, when I was a kid at school. Majority of time, the characters in my dreams are my school friends from 13 years old age. At some point it made me realize, how back then my own mental health and sort of dominant character influenced everyone around me in a bad way, as if making them weaker and lose potential. But it is still very strange to me to dream about that old memories.

I thought about talking to someone, maybe to get a little better. But then, I already know I am sociopath. Which makes you have no empathy or care for other people. And it sucks you know, I wish I knew what it's like to care, but there is nothing, just empty, 404-not found. Sometime I am almost amazed how human brain can work."
517,How to find/pick a mental health clinician (Psychiatrist vs psychologist vs therapist),"I have had problems with depression and anxiety for well over 10 years at this point. I thought I fixed it myself.... but my quick rebound into depression has tipped me off that maybe this time I should seek some professional health

I just don't know how to do this. I do not know where to start other than looking through what my insurance will cover - but Psychiatrist vs psychologist vs nurse practitioner vs clinician vs therapist vs licensed counselor.... My head is just swimming. I don't really understand the difference aside from Psychiatrists look at it from more of a medical perspective and can treat with medicine...

How do I pick one? Do I start with a primary care? I don't even have one of those...

It doesn't help that I know I have hormonal imbalances (PCOS - which brings on a host of issues for people with ovaries), but I am so... so.... very afraid... of essentially being told ""Hey you got depression take this pill you will feel better."" My mother is so heavily reliant on medication and I would prefer to not resort to it... but my medical history says maybe I start with a psychiatrist?... but typically psychiatrists don't actually do much talk therapy and work with you on the core of the problem, right?

I am just really confused and overwhelmed and I do not know where to start. I have been looking through websites and my insurance for hours and I feel so overwhelmed by just not really understanding what I am looking for.

At least I have made it past the first step - which is deciding that it is time to seek help  


Edit to add: Something like better help is not really a viable option. I have a good paying job so I do not qualify for financial aid on better help... but I cant afford $80 a week due to student loan debt and ridiculous living costs where I live. My only option for professional help is somewhere that takes my insurance. "

I read horrible things, how he ate people, and drugged them. He soaked bones in acid and bleach (for those who don't know Bleach destroys bones, it's a similar affect that rust has on metal, but it ""whitens"" the bone). 

I can't unread and unsee, I'm crying right now, it's super nasty, and horrible. Are the things he did real? Please?! That's horrible, for anybody to do. r/Eyebleach only works to a certain point, not when you read about cannibalistic, serial killers."

I hope you have a nice day if you decide not to share."
521,Suicide plan ideas feel comforting. Suicidal or not?,Not sure if I’ll do it or not. Got myself a bunch of plans to fantasize about and do if I want. Figured out how to die with less pain too so I wouldn’t try to back out. Comforting stuff
522,"""Mental Health Companions""","Hey there,

I've suffered depression and fatigue most of my life, and in the last 3 years this has turned physical, with food intolerances, gut symptoms, cognitive symptoms, chemical intolerances, etc.

Suffice to say that as far as track records go, I have been sick for a long time.

I found myself thinking last night, man, I wish someone would just ask how I am.Nobody has even asked how I am for a long time. Even though they (family, etc) all know I am unwell and am going through difficult treatment programs.

The issue is they get de-sensitised to it, and it becomes 'normal' to them that you are unwell - so in that vein nothing is really wrong - everything is as usual.

So anyway, I digress, I thought, wouldn't it be great if you had a buddy with skin in the game, that understood, that could just check in on you from time to time.Perhaps you could do the same with them.

Alcoholics have this - sober companions.

Why is this not a thing for mental health!  
Someone who could help you when you are falling off the depression wagon and not taking care of yourself. Someone who you could do the same for."
523,Bursts of confidence that crash hard.,I get these bursts of confidence and feel like ‘you know life is going to be ok’. But then the crash from that high comes down hard and I’m back to feeling like there is no hope. I went for a walk earlier tonight and felt great. But now that I’m home I’m just sitting here with nothing to occupy my mind. Idk just needed to vent. Maybe there are others that experience similar feelings.
524,Seeking advice and input. If you have time in your day please contribute to the discussion as I would appreciate it greatly ❤️,"One of my friends I care about deeply is in the hospital again after another attempted suicide. It's probably over her 10th time in the past 2 years... I went through the exact same situation for very long, suffering from extreme depressive disorder, anxiety, SRD (seratonin deficiency), depressive bipolar disorder, and a few others. Somehow I found a way to cope with everything and even though I'm not happy, I'm not sad which in extremely grateful for. I spent the majority of my past 2 years in and out of hospitals and mental hospitals. I care about her a great deal, at one point in time we were going to start a relationship, her and I were very happy at the thought of finally meeting someone meant for us. Sadly I was working so much we couldn't even find time to set up dates or align our schedules. She ended up telling me she didn't want another relationship after thinking it over because her ex's left her after her suicidal ideation and depression got so bad they couldn't continue the relationship, because of this she believes she is a burden on her family, friends, and any romantic partners so she prefers to suffer in silence, alone, instead of having to burden anybody else again. I want to visit her in the mental hospital when she gets transferred, and I want to write her a very sentimental meaningful letter so she can keep with her while she's there and hold onto. I know exactly what she's feeling but unfortunately I'm not the best with words and don't know how to compose the letter or what exactly to say. The advice I'm looking for here is what do I say? What would you guys appreciate and hold dear to you deep down if someone were to write you a letter when you're at your lowest point in life? I hope to prove to her I care about her and would never see her as a burden and hope to one day in the near future start a relationship with her and hopefully help her overcome what she's going through or at least be the person by her side that would never leave her. She really means the world to me... Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated, I love you all ❤️"
525,I wish people were more understanding,"I tried to reconnect with a good friend I became out of touch with due to my mental health this year. This has been one of the hardest years of my life. I tried explaining what happened and why I dropped off the face of the earth. all I got in response on Friday was “K” and I just lost it. I didn’t do it intentionally, and I wasn’t trying to disrespect her or be a bad friend. Time had passed and got to the point where when I would want to text her, I would get anxious and scared. 
And then more time passed and I just didn’t know what to do. I wish people were more understanding that mental health issues are hard to overcome."
526,Mental illness making it impossible to work,"Long story short, I really truly feel too mentally ill to work or hold a job. While working retail in a store I really liked, I went in to every shift suicidal, on the verge of tears, and psychically+mentally drained 

That wasn’t going to work longterm for me, so my partner got a better job to support us and I was able to quit, and switch to freelance work at home. I was able to get away from all work stressors, yet I still have this overwhelming feeling at all times that I just can’t keep going. I really enjoy working from home, but it just feels like way too much. 

Just thinking about having to work causes me to spiral into suicidal thoughts, and I spend the majority of my day wishing I didn’t exist so I didn’t have to worry about money. It is a constant pressure that I cannot escape, and I honestly just wish I was dead."
527,Does anxiety count as a disability in travelling?,"Hi folks! 

I'm an American hoping to travel internationally. I have a formal diagnosis for generalised anxiety disorder and OCD. I know that, when boarding planes, those with disabilities are invited to board first, but I can't find information on how the disability might be required to inhibit someone trying to do so. Should I call ahead to make arrangements, or will I be welcome to travel disabled regardless? 

Thank you so much!"
528,So much grief and guilt.,One of my closest friends took his life last night. He was the one that you’d “never expect to do it”. I on the other has tried to. My close group of friends for the past 20 years has been very informed of and a willful participant in my for lack of a better word recovery. He is gone now. So suddenly gone. He’s talked me off that ledge before. After leaving the hospital after an attempt he told me how illogical suicide is. How much it will kill my wife and son. He left his wife and son behind. I’m not really looking for anything here. I just need to get my thoughts out until I see my therapist tomorrow. I’m sad. I’m drinking. I’m ashamed I’ve almost done this to my family.

533,SO is needing some kind of help. Bad parents and stressed out,"My wife is going through some issues right now that are worse than they've been. We've been together for 20 years and she doesn't open up very often, and then only in little pieces.

Her parents are divorced and have been since she was a little girl.

She had an amazing stepdad that passed about 15 years ago. Stepdad was quite wealthy and left everything to her mom

Her dad doesn't want anything to do with her. When his 1st grandkid was born I called him and his response was ""oh""

They haven't spoken in about 14 years because he's not that interested.

Her mom remarried a guy 20 years older than her and kinda odd

Wife and her mom have never had a great relationship. Wife was the black sheep.

Her brother could do no wrong. And mom bailed him out of trouble time after time. Instances from insurance fraud to stealing horses, she'd always write the check

He married a woman. We'll call her Tina.

They were together for 5 years or so, the entire time he had cancer. He also cheated on her every chance he got. Real piece of shit.

He died about 5 or 6 years ago

Tina has stuck around because mom loves her and treats her like her own daughter, while pretty much ignoring her actual daughter.

Whatever, wife is pretty tough and ignores it

Mom owns several large pieces of land. Before the stepdad passed he told the wife and I that we should fence off 10 or 15 acres and he'd help us build a house on the land.

After he passed, we both talked to mom about it and started the work. About 8 days in she backed out and told us she didn't want anyone living there until after she's gone

This morning mom tells wife that she ""sold"" part of the land that we were supposed to build on to Tina and her new husband. No relation to anyone in the family

I looked it up and they did this 9 months ago and just now decided to tell anyone.

That pretty much put the wife over the edge. She's been in tears on and off all day. Thinking that she's not good enough to be her mom's daughter and that all she wants is for her mom to be proud of her and be a mom.

Her mom's a piece of shit that was never really a mom. She didn't know that for a year in elementary my wife was essentially deaf. Stepdad noticed it and got her cochlear implants.

Wife fucked up at 17, spent 2 weeks and jail, she's pushing 40 now, pretty sure that debts been paid.

But the family still treats her, and us, as outcast pieces of white trash. Nevermind the fact that we'll both retire from pretty decent jobs in less than 10 years and we own almost everything we have outright.

There's not another swinging dick in her family that can say that they're, virtually, debt free 

Getting off the subject at hand. What csn I do or what kind of Dr does she need to talk to so she can get help with her anxiety and possible depression?

She describes like she trapped in a box and screaming and no one can hear her
.
I love this woman with every fiber of my being and I want her to be happy and good

Edit to add that we're in the east TX area, near Athens and Tyler"
534,A very objective review of my feelings,"So let me introduce myself, yes this will be a long one, it's more for myself than the sake of this post, I just need to write stuff down and feel stupid doing it in a piece of paper that I'm going to throw away, hope you understand. 

Also for the people that are going to read this, if there are any, this is not a sob story about how bad my life is and I'm not looking for comforting words, it's the mf's that point out what I'm doing wrong that I respect. Also I'm sorry for my english, I'm obviously not a native speaker.

I'm almost 19, university student, I feel like I almost fucked my life up and barely patched things up just lately, although not everything. The problems started 6+ years ago when my home life started getting pretty dark and misserable due to some problems with my parents. (No substances or violence) 

&amp;#x200B;

I always was a good student up that point, but it was mostly because the teachers liked me, not because I was trying that hard, I was good, but not perfect score good. That set a dangerous precident with my parents, now they've seen something in me and they're expecting something out of me. At the same time my ADHD was getting way worse, I still haven't decided weather I'm just dumb or suffering from an illness... 

&amp;#x200B;

So grades start to drop and I start doing drugs and shit from an innapropriate age, parents brake up, I lose friends and I start to get innapropriate thoughts, it's not like I tried to kill myself or anything that extreme, but I also wasn't that worried about the long term damage I'm doing, let's just leave it at that. It was in this period that I really saw some shit, including death, it's different from up close, I don't know how to explain it...

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of high school I started powerlifting and working harder, I was also prescribed pretty strong ADHD meds which I obviously abused for a couple months cause I'm a retard like that, you know standard stuff. I studied hard maybe for 3 months and I was accepted in one of the best universities in my country (EU). Didn't derive any pleasure from it cause I didn't deserve it. Like I'm not looking for someone to say otherwise to comfort me, I just really didn't, someone that tried much harder should have taken my place.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in the first months of uni. Stuff is hard but def not unmanagable, life seems meaningless without a huge event to wait for, but then again even the stuff that I used to like are not that exciting, and no I'm not depressed, I'm at my dream uni, taking legal drugs, hanging around my mates (fucking family by now if you think about it, we're talking about the guys that never left) and smoking weed, no reason to be depressed, I just feel a little hollow, maybe its the huge change that took place recently (schools i mean).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel happy cause nobody feels happy all the time for no reason, I'm not that sad, other that some specific stuff.. I don't get excited often, I don't panic... I just don't , I don't feel much, most of the times it takes some serious shit to shock me. Im I just like this? Is everyone like this and also in denial?  What I'm I doing wrong?"
535,How can I convince myself I’m not having a heart attack?,"Hi friends, I’m gonna lay down some facts here we go! I’m currently 22 and in decent shape, but high cholesterol runs in my family and just recently my uncle died of a heart attack. Here’s where my problem happens, I have anxiety like pretty moderate? It’s mostly manageable but like, occasionally will get to me. I also suffer from IBS and acid reflux. After eating sometimes I’ll get symptoms which can be similar to those of a heart attack, and my silly little brain will start to dwell and my chest will feel heavy but it’s definitely anxiety heavy. So for like 30 minutes I’ll just be so anxious because i think I’m having a heart attack... are there any ways to quell my anxiety should I get certain tests done or something to ease my mind ??? Or anyway I can differentiate being anxious and actually having a heart attack ?? Thank you kindly 😔"
536,"I left my old company to start my own. Now I don't know what to do, everyday I'm led somewhere else but still haven't gotten anything started.","I had a successful business with a partner but I left to go out on my own. Now I am on my own and can't get my act together. Every day another idea or opportunity comes my way. Some days the different options sound like good potential opportunities. I go after them but never seem to follow through all the way. Is this a bipolar thing that has me all over the place? Or it my personality?Do I need to just do some soul searching to figure out who I am and what I want to do? I've come to realize if I am not passionate about what I am doing, I become miserable and quit, regardless of how successful I am. But I want to extremely wealthy and be passionate about what it is I am doing. The problem is that I spend most of time helping people and unfortunately in the world we live in that is usually not the best way to make money. I'm confused AF please advise and support it's needed especially during Covid when everything is upside down."

I’ll be there for around 10 weeks. I’ve never been away from home longer than 3 weeks and I get home sick very easily. I’m so so worried. I need some comforting words, maybe some success stories?

540,I’m spiraling,"This weekend i got super fixated on doing something that would, to any rational person, have a bad outcome, but there was no way i could reason with myself not to go through with it. Like an itch I need to scratch. I literally got into a delusional state just out of nowhere and i dont have any idea what the trigger was. It was pertaining to a situation that happened months ago and i hadnt even cared about for a while. now all of a sudden im having these intrusive thoughts and fixating on it throughout the day. whats going on? is this processing trauma ?? everything is so catastrophic in my mind i dont even know what can be considered trauma anymore"

542,I am breaking down.,"6 months ago I had everything. I was studying 5 hrs a day. I was working out and pushed myself hard even though the gyms were closed with whatever equipment I had. I was eating a good diet. (Due to low carbs I did suffer sometimes with hunger but I enjoyed it. It was a lifestyle). I had a girlfriend. I was trying to learn meditating.
But then I realised my gf was not the best person for me as she doesn't had the same drive as me to grow in life and our interests were also different and that's why we had very less to talk about things which were common for both of us. It was becoming boring. So I broke up with her 3 months ago after a lot of thinking.

Now, I didn't knew burnout existed. After working so much one day, the desire to work went away. Its like my brain does not want me to work. I hate the things I used to love. I cannot make myself to study again. I am lazy. I still workout as its the love of my life but not with the same intensity. I eat a lot of shit things now. And because I am so free now as I only surf the Web, I sometimes keep remembering her. It was a 2 year old relationship. I feel down most of the time. Then I pick myself up but the desire is not there to sit down again and learn something new every day. Help.

How can I get over this burnout."
543,Panic attack,"TW: Short breath. 

Some background info; I gave birth 4 months ago. Love my life. Have diagnosed anxiety since I was very young, around 11. Have bad panic attacks, but not this bad. I am pregnant again, very happy with the news and have great support from hubs and family. 

I was sitting in my recliner browsing amazon and all of a sudden feel like I can’t breathe. Like I really, really can’t breathe. I got up, walked around, took a drink of ginger ale, just could not catch my breath. Of course this is a huge trigger of mine for anxiety, so I started going into panic mode. At the time, I couldn’t distinguish that I was having an anxiety attack, so I thought I really couldn’t  breathe. I walked down to my mom’s apartment because I really just needed my mom in that moment. I took a nice bubble bath at my mom’s house, she talked me through everything and I felt better.
It’s been hours and while I was able to catch my breath, I feel off. Not like myself. Just pretty mentally exhausted. Is this normal after a bad panic attack? Hours later?"

548,Worst week of my life,"This past week has been one of the hardest weeks of my life. My sweet, amazing dog passed away. He died in my arms and i had to watch him gasp for his last breath. I buried his cold lifeless body and cried so hard that i choked. I got him on my 6th birthday, i grew up with him. I’m devastated. The next day, i lost my job to due the governor of my state shutting down my place of work indefinitely. The cherry on top, my boyfriend texted me telling me that his mom won’t let me come over to their house anymore due to covid and she won’t let him come over to my house either. We won’t really be able to see each other now. I already struggle with bipolar disorder so this entire year has been the most difficult I’ve had to endure yet. I’ve been battling suicidal thoughts and self harm the entire time and I’m feeling completely empty. I have nobody to see or talk to and i feel so alone. I desperately need some kind words."
549,How to prepare for a death,"So basically my grandma has been dealing with Alzheimer’s at the age of 82, we didn’t expect her to even be alive for this Christmas.

She’s been a big part of my family especially for my mom who visits her almost everyday."
550,Avoidant attachment style,"Hi to everyone, I hope you guys are doing great. I just realized and know that I have an avoidant attachment style and we all know that it developed during infancy years, I am really devastated to know that my parents before are emotionally unavailable and ignoring me when I was a baby. I grew up suppressing all my emotions, until today I hide to them what I truly feels, I hide whenever I cry. and I was blaming myself because I am like this. And then after knowing that I became like this because of my parents, I kind of feel mad, and blaming them why I became like this and I feel so helpless. before I envy people who are close to their parents or have a stable relationship with others, I envy how they can hug, kiss or even say I love you to those people. Before I don't know why I hate intimacy, I hate people who wants to get close to me, emotionally or physically, I feel so awkward. I never had a boyfriend because I don't know why, and now it all makes sense to me. I just want to vent out. but if you guys have any suggestion or encouraging experiences to share please I really need it. I was told to go for psychotherapy or have a stable and long lasting relationship with someone who has secure base attachment style."
551,"I wrote a poem about my self harm. This may be triggering to some, so read with caution.","Don't ask about the marks, the scars on my skin.

It is a path of pain with a start and an end.
Unsightly to see, i know my friend.
For now i realise the damage is done.
The marks will not fade but pain has not won.
A permanent feature, a reminder as such. 
I promise things will get better if you don't give up. 


Not a badge of honour, you don't wear them with pride. 
An ugly reminder of more difficult times. 
Self harm can be expressed in many ways, a cut or a wine or not eating for days. 
Anything that masks the pain. 


A gentle reminder you're doing okay. 
Take it easy on yourself each day.

Your scars and your marks done define your worth.

552,I don’t know,"I’m young, not graduated yet and I think reality is hitting me. For more detail over the years I’ve become more and more introverted, don’t live with my parents anymore, kinda like to keep my issues to myself and not get serious about anything. I have some friends, a lot less than what I use to have but kinda did that on my own. I find myself to be lame tbh, my friends think I’m funny but behind that I don’t like to do anything anymore because nothing interests me and I have no one to vent to (well I’m really close to one of my family member but I wouldn’t want to vent issues to her it’s not something I would do) but recently I’ve been stripping away the facade I put on myself which is I’m fine with being alone and boring because I enjoy it but I don’t think I do anymore. I’m a insecure person, boring, and shy to everyone. Im not emotional either, and feel as if I’m a robot. I recently got a job but when I’m at home I just feel dread, I really want to get out I hate laying in bed all day and playing Xbox. (Ah also ever since I started working I haven’t been eating/haven’t been h*rny I know that is really weird to say but I’ve just been feeling so different)

(Sorry if this all sounds dumb I’ve just been kinda having an identity crisis I guess, which is why I’m making this post) 

The last couple weeks at night I can’t sleep I just think what will I do after HS, am I gonna date someone (this is pretty childish lol but when a girl likes me I never have the effort or care enough to try and get closer with them, the only reason I’m adding this is because people around me always talk about females and shit and ask when will I get a girlfriend, etc). Ya know just things about life and I really don’t know what I will do. 

Conclusion: just came here to say some of my problems at a surface level can’t really put what I feel into words so if you read this thanks sorry if it’s cringe"

554,"My story, I am a psycho","*Trigger warning: domestic violence, and references to sexual abuse

I just wanted to say, I already know, I am not a good person, but I want help. I do think I am going to be told I have anti-social personality disorder, but I do not think that is all that is wrong with me. I have already been diagnised with severe OCD, and mild depression. I recently had another assesment, and I think the lady just thinks I was looking for excuses for my behaviour, rather than generally asking for help. I told her, I am worried about what I will be like, once my OCD goes down, because I have been this way for ten years. She has every right to be angry, and just think I am a bad person, but I know there is more to it. I am a bad person, but I am also an unstable person, who needs help, at times. I am going to tell you about my story, to see if you think I am just evil, or evil and unstable. I also know that everything anyone has done to me, I have either done, or done worse. It will also be nice to know, what people think I should do now. Should I stop talking to my family? What should I do to become a better person, or to make up, for what I have done? Some, of this, is also definitly just because I am an evil arsewhole. I have done more bad things than I can count. Some, of this is also probably just normal behaviour. I will also probably get a lot of hate, for this.
I just wondered if I just sound evil, or also like I have a disorder. Everything I have done, is so much worse than anyone has done to me. I did not even end up killing myself. I am still alive. I have, or had friends, and family members, who have been through so much more. It could even be all of them. Some of them have had to live with me too, and yet I am the one who turns out evil, and unstable. I am bad. I know, how many people I have hurt, because I feel the guilt. It has caused me to sleep walk, a couple of times, and wake up in the middle of the night, saying 'I am sorry', and 'what have you done'"

556,how can i stop or lessen my overthinking,Hi everyone! I am a really bad overthinker. I always have been and it’s starting to eat me alive more than ever. what makes me overthink the most is the person i love and other girls ruining it. today for example a girl from our high school (we’ve graduated for a few years now) randomly dmed him and said she had a dream about him. he told me this but he wouldn’t tell me who it was out of fear id confront them and get really mad. this caused me to overthink and think she wants him. does anyone have suggestions on how to stop overthinking with this situation or any that may come up? thank you (also i trust him just not other girls)

I spent the entire day feeling like someone was pressing my chest, it felt like there was a giant boot stepping on me.

I'm scared, anxious, nervous, I don't know what to do or say, I'm so tired.

My boyfriend probably has covid, and if he has it then so do I and so does my family.
Tomorrow he's getting the results on the covid test and we're both extremely anxious about it.
He isn't sleeping and just sent me an audio crying saying how scared he was, he sounded so upset and I can't do anything to help.
I feel like it's all slowly falling apart, I'm scared and I feel on the edge all the time, like I'm about to collapse.
This situation is just getting worse and I don't know if I can keep on like this.

I'm so scared, I can't put it into words but I'm so helpless rn, I'm lost.

I wish I could be strong for both of us so that he doesn't have to feel alone on this but I'm a fucking chicken and just hearing his voice break made me cry.

I want this to stop, I wanna go back to normal and just live my life

I'm just 17, this year was supposed to be the best for me, I had everything planned, studying then working, this summer was supposed to be full of friends and dumbness but instead we are all locked up in our houses crying.

I was sent to the hospital in 2018 and they gave me to much medication for my body to handle which caused a buuunch of fucked up problems that are still going on, and I think they got my diagnosis wrong or didn’t listen to me enough or I didn’t explain myself enough. I don’t know how to explain myself enough. They diagnosed me with major depression disorder, severe anxiety, ptsd, and insomnia. The only diagnosis I feel is wrong is the major depression disorder because I have more bipolar symptoms then ever even though they’re similar as fuck. With all the medication they prescribed me I stopped taking them but I didn’t tell my doctor because I was genuinely scared but I don’t know if I should be scared to tell the nurses or not. Kpins is the only thing I take because it’s the only medication I’ve noticed a difference in completely. They fucked me up by giving me to high of a dosage and I’m scared what the doctor in the er is going to say tomorrow when I tell them I’ve only been taking my clonazepam but I want something to help me with my bipolar and sleep. Ptsd is managed with the help of my dog and my boyfriend but everything else isn’t."
561,advice for someone who has never been on medication but considering it?,"i have struggled with my mental health on and off since i was in middle school and i am 21 years old now and in college. Anxiety and depression are what I struggle with the most, i’ve dealt with an ED in the past but have been okay for a while. Lots of my mental health issues stem from trauma, childhood trauma etc. and just genetics. the past few months i’ve gotten really bad, completely lost my motivation, developed acne which i have never had so that shot my confidence and just have fallen into a depression that i can’t get out of. it feels like i don’t care about anything. i seriously feel like i can’t move, like i am stuck. ive been considering medication heavily for the past few weeks and am just nervous about side effects and things because i don’t really like taking prescriptions but i truly don’t know what else to do. i can’t bring myself to do anything and i am having concerning thoughts. basically im just looking for any insight on medications, anything would be great. sorry for rambling, thank you!"
562,Tactile hallucinations might make me into an otherkin,"I experience hallucinations. I take meds but it’s not a complete cure. Lately I’ve been feeling sensations of what I can best describe as having body parts that don’t match with my physical self. 

At first it was something that felt like I had a tail that was swaying around and wagging. I didn’t think much of it at first. Probably just like a weird tingle or something idk. But it happened again and again with no warning. One day it got bad and I nearly broke down crying when my right leg did not in fact have an extra joint somewhere  for me to bend. 

I do not like these feelings. I’ve seen the otherkin community and I do not trust them at all. A lot of them seem like enablers and discourage people to seek professional help about feeling like a deer trapped in a human body. I don’t want to end up slipping down the rabbit hole and ending up surrounding myself with people that probably won’t encourage healthy practices. 

I feel strange and confused about this. I won’t be able to see any sort of professional til mid January and I just want to pull through until then."
563,I think i may have BPD,"I'm 12, i just kinda released today that i have all but 2 of the symptoms. I've had a really horrible childhood, well young childhood. I won't get into it, i just need advice on how i'm supposed to tell my therapist this. I know i need to get some sort of help or at least see if i have it, but i don't know how to trust anyone at all. I want to trust her and tell her but i don't know how, does anyone know how i would tell her and try to trust her?"
564,My mental health experience,"Hi,

I use to go to therapy for a long time but I had stopped going because I felt like it was manipulating me in weird ways. Like the sessions I had were my therapist telling me what to do with my life but in a very commanding way. I have serious depression issues and low self esteem issues. Like I am supper duper ugly (my face is uglier than dog sh*t and yes ppl have told me im ugly.) and I am a huge loser but I feel like these are problems dont have a cure similar to cancer. I was born being ugly and having a worthless life and thats part and something I need to accept.

I would love to hear your thoughts!"
565,Death anxiety attacks,"I’m 15 years old and I’m a guy, Ever since I was a young kid I’ve never been okay with the concept of death and and I still can’t accept it it comes and goes but once or twice a month thoughts in my head about death start coming in in random moments and the thought that I won’t be able to be alive forever horrifies me and I can’t accept it it’s getting too much for me to the point where as soon as I start thinking about it I have to stand up walk around and talk to someone to get it out of my head but I simply just can’t, my breathing gets really fast paced and my heart starts racing my palms start sweating and I get this weird feeling of heat as if I’m wrapped around a hundred blankets and it just messes with my brain and I would like to know what could help me get rid of this"
566,"Poem about self acceptance, disassociation and mental health","We all have skeletons in our closets,
Spooky ghouls with hollowed out eyes and slacked jaws,
Ready to spill our secrets like ants to a picnic.

My skeleton is different,
He talks to me at night,
In the dark when I'm scared of what others would say,
He's there to comfort me, with spooky whispers of jokes,
Back chat with the monster under my bed,
Always making me laugh.
But he does all this from the closet, I'm not ready to let him out yet.

When I get home from school, I can't ignore him.
I hope nobody finds out, 
But it's getting easier to speak to him now.
His hollow eyes aren't so bad, and he's beginning to look very familiar.

When the sandman arrives, he's not very pleased,
To see me still awake, talking to my skeleton, no dreams in sight.

He tells me funny stories of his times with Medusa,
Drabbles about Mary, how he talked to her through a mirror,
Before he got taken here.

He always gets quiet when he talks about here,
As he slowly slides the door of the closet closed, 
Mumbling an excuse of time and school the next morning.

I concentrate less in my classes lately,
I feel bad for the skeleton in my closet.
He used to talk fondly of his time with the mummies, how he was fond of vampires and laughed with werewolves.
Now he walks slowly, quietly, sad.
He misses them, I can tell, but I just can't let him go.

What will everyone say when they find out?
His wrists look thinned, his jaw seems tighter.
He looks oh so familiar, why can't I place him?

My mum says she's worried, 
that I'm eating less, looking pale. 
I pay no attention, I just go to my room.
My skeleton is waiting for me.
Always waiting.

I don't really go outside much now, just stay between my sheets,
Imagining it's my coffin, my door the the world the skeleton described,
Where everyone was who they were meant to be,
Nobody cared.
I wish nobody cared here.

I try to ignore my skeleton, but it's impossible.
I can hear his bones rattling as I lay awake at night,
Imaging what it would be like in the underworld,
If I would be a ghost, a demon maybe. 
I wonder if demons are as kind as my skeleton.
I hope so.

My skeleton makes me feel safe,
Feel myself.
I wish I could have my skeleton with me at school.
To make me laugh, give me confidence.
But I can't let him out.
He's my biggest secret.

My dad would say ""we need to talk"" and I'd panic.
What if he found my skeleton? How would he know?
Nobody was supposed to know.
He tells me I need at stop, 
Start going out,
Stop skipping meals.
He says I look too thin. 
He says he can see my bones.
If only he knew what he'd really see if my skin was so transparent.
He said I look like a skeleton.
And deep down I know he's right.


We all have skeletons in our closets.
Gentle creatures with sharp teeth, 
Who could ruin us at any moment.
But my skeleton is different.
My skeleton is me.
And it's time I set him free."
567,"If you guys have not already come across this musical genius, please check out the group Twenty One Pilots!!","*With the music of Twenty One Pilots, their daring, progressive stylistic choices and soul binding lyrics, comes a sense of positivity and hope to all who struggle with daily problems. It becomes so easy to relate, because frontman Tyler Joseph has been fighting with bipolar disorder for years. He’s one of our own, and all the millions of young adults dealing with similar issues rally behind him, as the band represents an image of perseverance and overcoming one’s inner demons. Although while Tyler just so happens to struggle with bipolar disorder, his true genius shows through when you realize that his thoughts, his opinions and his music appeal to all of us.""

https://www.theodysseyonline.com/twenty-one-pilots-music-and-mental-illness

""From a more secular perspective, their words center on depression and anxiety, with habitual direct reference to self-harm.""

""Joseph explains that he never intended to be a rapper, and simply finds the art form of rap the most effective way of trying to say something with his music.[186] He realized how little the amount of lyrics are in a full song, because they're sung and words are drawn out by melodies.[186] When attempting to write poetry he had written for the lyrics of a song, Joseph found there were way too many words to fit.[186] He soon found himself just saying the poetry in tempo and realizing that he was rapping""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots

My favorite songs by them are: Ride. Migraine. Fairly local. Neon grave stones. Message man. Nico and the niners. Car radio. Smithereens. Bandito. Chlorine. The hype. Cut my lip. Lane boy. Pet cheetah. Isles of flightless birds. Jumpsuit. Heathens. 

These 17 songs are part of the total 65 songs that this band has released. I still have not explored all of their songs yet, but I am sure this list will grow.

I cannot express my opinion enough on how I think these artists are geniuses!! Through their lyrics, I have been able to find the words for my emotions. I definitely do not express the creativity that this band has, and that's okay because they have given me the ability to properly describe my emotions in therapy.

Going to try to make this short as possible, but here are some of the lyrics I used during therapy.

""Ride""

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true

I've been thinking too much (Help me)

""Migrain""

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I'm alone

I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts

I am not as fine as I seem
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that hold's back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone

""Neon Gravestones""

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?""
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king

Don't get me wrong
The rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion
In spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And, could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them""
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that ""it"" does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated

""Message Man""

And who I am today
Is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future
Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion
When you're messing with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone
Only few understand

So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment but you would not know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we'll lose this, remember the future
Remember that morning is when night is dead

""Car Radio""

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire my time today
I have these thoughts, so often I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence
Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking

""Bandito""

In city, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered
It's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

""The Hype""

Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

""Isle of Flightless Birds""

If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set us free

And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

Edit: ""Fairly Local""

I'm evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional
What I wanna save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday's dance

I'm not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional
What I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday's dance"

569,"Any advice on mood swings, sleeping problems, boredom ?","I experience some things since 3 years and they get worse every day so I'm writing this to get some advice.


First there are extreme mood swings. Every day I wake up I feel like a different person. Throughout the day my mood changes betweem happy and confident to bored and pessimistic. 

It's a problem because I'm either very impulsive or completely negative.  It's draining to seem stable at work for example. 


Then there are sleeping problems. Waking up 3 times a night is a normality but pills are not a healthy solution. 


I also experience extreme boredom when I'm not doing things like buying expensive stuff et cetera. And that boredom makes me do stupid things. I get in trouble solely because I don't want to feel bored.


Most of the time I'm also alone since I can't have real, meaningful connections with people. I get bored of daily small talk and impulsively say something stupid just to make the conversation more interesting. 


In the end what worries me the most is that some day I'll lose control or feel completely lonely when my family is gone.

TlDr: mood swings, sleeping problems, boredom getting worse every day"
570,How can i not feel suicidle anymore?,"Hi. It’s me again. I’m sorry. 

I’m still feeling suicidle. I just want it to stop. I tried to kill myself again yesterday evening. I stopped myself like i did the other times i tried. All i feel is guilt and i hate myself. 
Last night was kinda bad again. I was crying for ages. This morning i just feel down and i don’t have the motivation to do anything. I wish i could have a day off from school or something, school is too hard and it’s bad for mental health. They say they can help but they can’t. All they do is contact your parents or the police. 

I just really hate feeling like this. I just want it to stop. I’m sick of feeling like i want to kill myself everyday.

I just drag everyone down and i’m a complete burden to everyone. People are starting to notice at school that i’m truly suicidle, because apparently i’m showing all of the signs. I can’t give life anymore chances.

My friend yesterday said he wanted to kill himself and i care about him alot because he is basically my only friend. He said it’s only mood swings but i’m not sure. I’m scared. 
I kinda hurt myself last night after 12 days of not doing it. I don’t want to tell anyone because that would make me worse.
I feel like shit and i feel really really guilty about everything. I just feel like the world would be a better place without me. I mean, i do get told to kill myself anyways. 

I’m sorry. For everything."
571,I think I need help.,"I'm a 16 year old female. Recently I've not been feeling happy anymore. I break down for absolutely no reason because of sudden pangs of sadness. My grandmother and grandfather stayed at my house for sometime and they have a habit of criticizing every single thing about me. I usually never let their words get to me but this time, when they said that I was starting to get fatter and fatter, I kept quiet and kept doing my work. My mom sensed that something was wrong and she called me to her room and asked me what was wrong. I immediately started bawling my eyes out and I didn't even realize how much their words hurt me. Everytime someone says something to me, I end up crying when I'm left alone. Sometimes I choke up when I'm with them. I don't have any friends to talk to. I have too many secrets that I wish I could share with someone but I can't. My friends moved out of the city or they started going to a different school. I just want to have friends that I can fun with and I can share everything with. I've been socially awkward ever since I was in 4th grade and I never really had any friends. I'm like the stereotypical need except im not even smart. I consistently prove myself to be a disappointment. I don't what to do."

574,Sleep Procrastination,"I considered posting this to r/sleep but decided against it since this is a mental issue and not a physical one. I am not a part of either subs though so I apologize if this was the wrong one to post in.

Now that that’s out of the way: I’ve noticed for a while now that I go to sleep much later than I need to. It got better for a couple of months (going to sleep 10:00-11:00 pm most nights) but my mental health has recently taken a turn for the worse and my sleep habits have gone with it. 

For the past week, I’ve gone to bed anytime from 3:00-6:30 am, and never any earlier. When I was younger I might have stayed up doing homework or possibly watching TV, but I haven’t been doing a lot of my homework and am not very interested in most things I used to like anymore. So I’ve been getting around 5 hours of sleep a night (I’m a teenager so I should be getting around 9) for no reason other than I don’t want to go to bed. I know this negatively impacts my mood and performance in school, but I don’t seem to care.

I have no issue actually sleeping once I’m in bed. If I want to sleep, I will within minutes. But I never actually want to. I have no idea why I refuse to go to bed until it’s almost light out. 

Anyway, the point of this post was to ask if this is an actual issue that people struggle with, or if it’s just something annoying that I’m subjecting myself to. I sort of just remembered that I cut myself (I forgot before I guess?). Is it possible that this is a self-harming behavior as well??"
575,How to help,"My really close friend lost his brother about 4 years ago, we haven't been friends for a long period of time but we are pretty close, we talked about his brother for the first time today, I personally dont have any experience with grief, any tips on how I should talk to him about it, what I should and shouldn't do/say? How can I be helpful and supportive in a healthy way?"
576,You know how as a child you absorb everything around you? That never stops.,"You will continue to be shaped by your environment as you get older until you die.  That is why parents begin to speak the 'cool"" language of their teenage children."
577,Should I stay or should I go?,"I am currently receiving treatment for my mental health issues at a psychiatric ward. I am really fond of the treatment program they use at this ward, but I do not enjoy living amongst other patients whatsoever. this is were I get conflicted. I want to continue with the treatment program, but I also don’t want to live with this many people. the only place I can be alone is at my room, and it is tiny.  I think there are approximately 30+ others here, and that only goes for the number of patients. What should I do? I really like those who work here, at least most of them. And as I’ve mentioned many times previously, I am very happy with the treatment program in it self. What would you do in this situation? (I struggle socially because of ASD and social anxiety)"
578,Does this count?,"Hi, so I am always thinking about murder, and every little thing I would do before, during and after so that I could get away with it. I do this for every person I meet. It is always going through my head. I think about every violent act. How do I stop? I truly think that my fathers side is full of psychopaths based on the fact that many acknowledge that they have no guilt over anything that they do, only guilt over being found out. I also think I might have a mental problem, I always see things that aren't there, like the time I thought that my shadow was strangling me, the time the bus filled with blood, or the times that 'people' slink around in the dark. No one believes me. To all I am such a nice kid. A bit weird, but 'couldn't hurt a fly'. I am scared of where my mind will bring me.  What do I do? How do I stop my mind?"

586,Finally realised that talking behind someones back is childish and immature,"For most of my life it was normal that people were talking behind each others back. People of every age. But recently my therapist told me that it isn´t or it shouldn´t be that way. People are just offended so fast these days. I am a very sensitive person myself but i rather have someone telling me when something is wrong than getting this weird feeling. Many people around me are just scared to tell someone face to face when something is wrong. I personally have rarely talked about someone behind their back because i experienced that first hand and don´t want another person to feel that way. So in the future i will focus less on how i behaive around different people and try to be myself more often. Have you experienced things like that?

Let me know your thoughts and opinions about that topic in the comments :)"
587,Phobia of garden gnomes and those ‘scenes/displays’ in some shops and theme parks,"So I have a fear of gnomes and those displays with those garden gnome like figures/ or fantasy figures. You can find them in some shops like garden centres, theme parks etc. I’m not afraid of dolls or clowns, just those figures from old children’s books or something. It’s not even that I’m scared I just become VERY uneasy, agitated, and I just think it’s so SO cringey that I just have to leave. Especially when it’s a larger display with like little houses etc. I’ve always just avoided it but my bf is into theme parks/ Disney/ going to garden centres when the X-mas displays are on, so he took me with him and I had a big freak out. Wtf is wrong with me? He was really upset after because he is supportive of a lot of things I like and joins me in them even if he doesn’t like it, but I couldn’t do this for him. I needed to get out ASAP, and almost had a panic attack. They were all over the place, up, down, with little displays everywhere. It makes me sick. 

Does anyone else deal with this, or something like it? And how did you get help, if any? Or do you just avoid it? I know it’s not normal."
588,Breaking up with a suicidal partner whilst in a mental health crisis (Ireland),"I've lurked on this subreddit for years now and have found it very inspiring and thought to turn to it in my own time of crisis.

I've been on/off dating a person for around a year now and being totally honest it hasn't been great. They are a deeply kind and extremely attractive and intelligent person and we are absolutely crazy about each other which is something I haven't experienced much before, but I am in an extremely unstable and unhappy time in my life, just graduated from college but jobless and friendless. I was diagnosed with depression and have been medicated/attending therapy for around 6/7 years now and have found in the past that it severely limited my ability to be in serious relationships/friendships (Lack of energy, constant low mood, inability to concentrate when around people) and am also a genuine introvert so don't mind being alone that much. I have also spent time as an inpatient during times of extreme suicidiality.

However this person has also suffered from a number of severe mental illnesses, ED, PTSD, depression and suicidal ideation as well. I feel terrible talking about their problems as I feel it's a breach of trust but they have expressed how I have exacerbated their problems due to my lacklustre relationship skills. Our relationship has become more frayed since becoming long distance due to lockdown in Ireland. 

They pinpointed how I often would back out of plans to hang out which is something I am entirely guilty of and fully understand how it could totally crush someone's feelings. I am completely at fault for worsening their symptoms and have expressed before how I think it would be best for us to stop seeing each other so they can be free to meet someone less burdened by mental illness, however everytime I've done so the person has doubled down on threats of suicide, going so far as to write their suicide note which illustrates why they're going to kill themselves (i.e. I never saw them, therefor I think they're ugly, therefor no one will ever love them)((which is of course not true but I see entirely how I am the source of the problem)) 

Due to the lockdown and a lack of mental health services where I live in Ireland I am not currently seeing a therapist, however after months of encouragement and support the person in question is now in a support program and has a crisis nurse and a suicide action plan, however they are extremely non-compliant with it, refusing to take medication, not attending meetings etc. Their only solution is that we continue to see each other which I am happy to do so despite my wanting to not see each other (I am willing to continue in an unhappy relationship if it saves someone's life) however at present we are arguing every minute of the day for about 3 months now and I am scared that the person in serious danger to themselves. 

What should I do Reddit? I've attempted to contact their doctor to forward them on her suicide note so as they can take the threat seriously but unfortunately technically cannot due to GDPR as the person in question has not given me consent to do so and refuses to show the crisis team her note. I'm extremely frightened and guilty and honestly once again contemplating suicide myself. I've tried to call Pieta and other online services for help but unfortunately haven't received much. My next step is to call them an ambulance but they've assured me if I call an ambulance, they will take life immediately. 

Please help! I'm incredibly scared and don't know what to do. Apologies for the length of the post but I'm at wits end and don't know where else to turn to"
589,i hate emotional people.,"Emotional people are plagues to me. i accept emotion when it is appropriate but these days i feel like the only sane person alive. Everyone uses their emotions and black/white thinking, no one uses critical thinking anymore. i am super analytical and i like to hear full stories about people as well as make careful assessments, but these days everyone devalues each other so much and has so much mental problems. It feels like an insult to my existence, the fact people can freely just feel so emotional and be irrational, it makes me feel ashamed that i am alive because i feel inclined to only be exposed to rational people.

Scrolling through the mental health sub makes me sick, seeing all the people complaining and showing their weaknesses, giving up and having little to no resilience, being extremely useless. The only beneficiary is that i can hopefully lovebomb them and try to get them to praise me."
590,How do you get over difficult relationship heartbreaks,"Hey ho boys,

I'm asking you guys about the topic of getting over a break up, not just a normal break up but a break up from a verbal abusive relationship. The whole story is that I do have some mental issues and I'm already trying to get therapy for my depression. I have a long history with my mother who used to abuse me, that's why I was and still am Insecure about my feelings and do not how to really comprehend or know how to live with really emotional states. I overthink too much to the point of suicidal thoughts.

My ex was one of the few people who got me but time slowly showed that, she herself had some toxic sides and was already verbal towards me, even tho she tried to help me on the other side. It was always weird because on the other side she was verbal but then helping again. Me, as the idiot  I was, tried my very best to save something in this relationship. It gave me feelings and things I never got in my childhood (love, care). I was blind and did not see, that it actually broke me down, how bad it went. I loved her and was not willing to give up. 

I broke up 4 months ago, as everything was getting too much for me. My mental health and the things with my mom were getting too serious. With school and my family constantly making it difficult for me, I'm now in one of my biggest mental low points again and I really need advice how to get over this relationship. I know that the relationship with my ex was not good for me, but I can't get her out of my head. Can someone help me here?"
591,Work advice needed,"I am currently off work due to exacerbation of anxiety and depression (for which I take medication, and have increased due to this). It is a relatively new job, which has become increasingly stressful due to COVID, and I was consequently working several hours of overtime per week because of this.

I enjoyed the job, but in addition to studying for a part time postgrad degree, the commute and other commitments, the balance became an issue. I am currently dreading the prospect of going back. I noticed an immediate improvement to my health when I came away from the situation. However, i am concerned about a relapse if I return. 

My question is; do I resign? Will the gap look bad on my CV if i am continuing to study? I know these are not the top priorities, but I cannot help but worry about my future employability, particularly in this climate."
592,How do you keep a coping skill from becoming an obsession?,"I have Schizoaffective Disorder.  One thing that I do when I get really depressed or when I am hearing my voices bad is reading comics or playing video games.

But the problem is that I tend to do this too much.  Like one day I read 70 issues of comics while another day I played 10 hours of Pokemon.

Does anyone else tend to do this with the hobbies they use to cope?

How do I keep a coping skill from becoming an obsession?  I want to have a healthy balance of hobbies and look for a way to cope with my symptoms in a healthy way."
593,Am I depressed?,"I haven't been feeling well lately.  I wake up every morning feeling like I don't want to do anything.  When I wake up in the morning, I'm still in bed for 3 hours. You probably think I'm thinking about something, but it's not like that, I have an emptiness in my head.  I had to go to the toilet once but I didn't go.  I was lying in pain, I already thought I'd pee myself.  My friend told me it was the beginning of depression and I don't know what to do. I've never been depressed or anything like that."
594,I'm happy,"Hi! This is my first reddit post. I just wanna say I used to be messed up. I used to be friends with a lot of toxic people who just kept pushing me down. They used to say insensitive things about my body, my interests, literally anything and acted like it was okay. And at one point I started believing them and I developed a lot of insecurities. At that time, I didn't want to alone so I put up with it. Being with them was so self destructive that I forgot who I was and who I wanted to be. Even then they didn't stop and started mocking the things I was self-conscious about. My grades went down, I drowned myself in self-doubt, I cried myself to sleep every night and I just didn't know what to do. Then one day I realised that I have to stand up for myself and that I should be strong and powerful and what mattered more than anything else was my mental health and my happiness.

Back to present day, I cut those people off from my life and now I'm surrounded by my best friends in the whole world who love and cherish me for who I truly am and I've never been happier. I'm still working on overcoming my insecurities one step at a time and it hasn't been easy. But I'm happy that I'm making progress. I'm doing great.

To anybody who's seeing this, I hope you have a very good day and a good life. It always gets better, you just need to give it some time and get some perspective."
595,Coming to terms with my disability,"Hi everyone,
I come asking for help. I (26F) have been in treatment for my depression and anxiety since I was 13. Treatment was on and off during my teen years including 2 hospitalizations at 18y/o but it’s been consistent as hell the last 3 or so years. I’ve been to my therapist every week, my psychiatrist every other month and I take a fistful of meds twice a day. 

Things were going really well for me for once. I was killing it professionally, carefully curated the people in my life so my any trace of my former abuser was long gone, and was doing my best to support my wonderfully supportive partner through a tough time in her life. 

Then I had a set back at work. I have a very traumatic job and what happened was unspeakably traumatic even in my realm. It didn’t happen directly to me but to one of my staff members but I was the first on the scene (looking back I think this broke me). 

When the staff member came back to work our relationship was off and it was hard to navigate but I did my best to support them in appropriate ways while I talked through my trauma with my supervisor and my therapist.  

Well that worked for a hot minute and then the panic started creeping back and within a few weeks I was lucky to sleep in a 3 hour block. But also hella depressed and tired and stuck. So I spoke to my therapist and my employer and I’m out on short term disability for my depression. We started with 3 months and I’m halfway through and not feeling any better. I’m trying so hard to work through my shit every day but how do you work through trauma when you don’t even have the energy to shower?

So I’ve had a lot of time to think and to try to come to terms with my depression/anxiety/ptsd as a disability. I’m struggling a lot because of internalized ableism. So much of my identity is wrapped around my independence it’s kind of sending me into a tizzy. Like I know that someone can be both disabled and independent, but can I? What scares me is I don’t know... 

So I ask you, Reddit, any advice on coming to terms with mental illness as a disability? Any more specific online communities for this? I follow a lot of disabled folks of Twitter but none disabled with mental illness."
596,"""Just suck it up"" - has this advice ever worked for anyone? What happens when you ""just suck it up?""","This is the most common piece of ""advice"" given by people who like to run away from their problems. ""Just suck it up"" can be said in many different ways. For instance, ""you're just ovethinking things"" or ""stop making such a big deal about it"". My question is has this advice ever actually done anything positive in the history of mankind? Personally, I don't think so (you probably deduced that from the way I wrote this post). I believe that the only way to overcome your problems is to face them. A lot of people look down on therapy but I can't think of any better way to face your problems than to just sit down and talk about them or meditate on them to to try and understand them. It seems like ""just sucking it up"" only postpones the inescapable reality that you're going to deal with your problems whether you like it or not.

Thoughts? Have you ever run away from a problem and benefited from it? When is the right time to finally face your demons? Is there a wrong time?"
597,Small gesture from random guy during a panic attack,"for some context: Yesterday I was having a really difficult time managing my mental health. To try and get away from it all I was sitting on a quite part of my school with a friend and one of their mutuals. My friend accidentally did something that triggered a flashback and the next thing I knew, I was in full panic. I couldn’t move or talk and they ended up ditching my and leaving me with this random guy I’ve talked to maybe 3 times? 

I think he was pretty unsure of the situation and didn’t know how to react so he asked me if I wanted to listen to ‘calming’ music. It was a sweet gesture in itself what the music he chose was a donkey themed lofi remix. Something about the absurdity of the situation helped me calm down. He made sure I was ok and was really sweet about the whole thing, even tho he seemed a little in over he’s head.

So yeah, if you’re ever having a panic attack and your friend ditches you, just get a random guy to play weird lofi remixes."
598,Can't stop dreaming about my ex,"I'm 20, she is 23
We broke up 2 months ago. After 4 years of relationship and living together.

I can't take it anymore, I've been struggling so hard, I feel so Lonley and miserable, everything made worse by covid and quarantine.

I started taking making heavy use of light drugs ever since we broke up, even tho I've never used drugs before in my life. After so many years of struggling with depression anxiety and stress I gave in.

I'm high everyday for the last 4 months, I can't remember a day where I fall asleep normally.i always collapse from being high. I have problems with my memory due to this use of drugs, my once really good memory is absolutely going to shit because of drugs, but it's the only thing that gives me a hint of relief.


It really helps me to not think when I'm high, time goes faster and I don't feel as bad. But it's sick, I can't keep this up.


I keep. Dreaming about her every day, I promise you, EVERY DAY! It's the same dreams, she cheats on me, she treats me bad, she hurts me, she leaves me, and I wake up and start crying like a miserable rat, I'm so. Disappointed in myself and ashamed I've allowed a person to ruin my life this way.
 Even during our relationship she was always very abusive mentally. And I often had those dreams, but now it's every single day



I keep dreaming about this because I cannot accept that such bad person such as her already found a boyfriend  1 or 2 weeks after we broke up, I just can't accept it. Why bad people get everything their way? Why doesn't karma work on these people?

I get absolutely sick to my stomach when I think about it, how can you say you've loved someone, and find a boyfriend a week after breaking up? It's madness.

I normally don't seek for help like this or help in general, but I'm absolutely broken down, I'm crying as I write this.

I just feel like i cant keep being strong, I can't keep living my life on will power alone, it's not enough. I've already given in to light drugs, even tho I hated drugs before. I don't want to do more stupid shit to ruin my future...

One of the things that helps me cope when I feel bad is driving, I love going for long drives and enjoy being outside, however it's very dangerous as I've been in 2 accidents before due to driving after something bad happen in my relationship, and I ended up crashing due to distracting, I'm scared to end up in another accident.

Before telling me to seek therapy, I can't afford to do so. Even tho I live in the EU, mental health isn't taken seriously here, and you have to pay for, even tho health care is supposed to be free... Besides a psychologist will do nothing to help me, I've seen plenty during my life time. Only person that can help me is me, but I don't have the will power anymore...."

611,Helping a friend,One of my close friends is going through something because he’s doing drive a lot more than he was and he’s high nearly all day which isn’t like him. I know that he’s been going through stuff since we’ve been at uni but it seems to have gotten worse because he’s doing self destructive things. I’m fairly certain it’s a cry for help and he used to open up to me about how he was feeling but the last few days he’s hardly spoken to me. I really want to just meet him 1 on 1 and ask what’s going on but I’m not sure how to address it. I want to talk to him soon and I was just wondering if anyone has any advice because I know he’s going through something but it takes a lot for him to open up. Any help would be so so so appreciated
612,How do I support my friend who's struggling mentally?,"I have a close friend who has been struggling mentally with university. She has learning disabilities (dyslexia and dysphraxia) and depression. We both study literature and we've been friends for over a year and we've been each other's emotional support for a while. She has difficulty meeting the deadlines of her assessments and struggles with impostor syndrome, intrusive thoughts and other things. She also struggles with health issues which make it even more difficult for her to have a consistent schedule. When we talk about that, I always listen to her and support her (for example, when she says she's a failure, I say that it's not true and explain why that it). But she has been spiralling for a while now and I don't know if I'm actually helping in some way. My question is: are there other ways to support her because I want her to know she isn't alone? As far as I know, she isn't in therapy right now, but it's possible that she doesn't feel comfortable talking about that and she hasn't told me. I know that people with depression don't always think rationally and fall back spiralling, but I just wonder if there's something I can do to help her alleviate her struggles."
613,Concentration Problems - Any Help?,"It's common for teenagers to not be able to concentrate for long. I (15F) too have a very short attention span; however it has become an unusually frequent problem of mine this school year.

Since September, I can't focus my attention to anything. I can't focus at school, I can't focus on a conversation and I forget what I want to say.

**School**

I try to listen to the teacher and understand what they say. I focus on the words. I recognize them, but I don't understand them. 

I may look the teacher in the eyes: They think I know what they're saying, I have made myself think I do, and when they ask something, I have no idea what we were talking about.

It's an illusion of understanding which I experience all the time. The words just don't make sense.

It has greatly impacted my performance at school since I don't understand anything of what we learn and I can find no way to change it.

Even if I focus during a lesson once, I think of something related to the lesson and until I'm done thinking about it the teacher has started talking about a completely new topic.

**Conversation and Thoughts**

Apart from the fact that I sometimes zone out while someone is talking to me, I also have trouble saying things.

I don't know what I'm saying or what I want to say and I can't remember it. The idea of a sentence comes and disappears right away. It's as if someone asks you to imagine your house: an image of your house pops up in your mind, just like the idea of something to say. When it pops up and I'm about to talk, it fades away. 

That's the worst of all. I want to say something very important but I forget it; I want to tell my teacher the answer in math and it goes away; I want to give a logical reason to someone and it fades. 

I can't really explain it to people and they notice it, so they come up with many false conclusions. 

I would discuss it with my psychologist, but there are other priorities I want to fix first. If you know what this is, why it happens or how to overcome it please tell me. Any information is appreciated."
614,Help please.,I’m Riley (undiagnosed). As of late I’ve felt as if I have two personalities kinda. I’m dead cold and serious sometimes and others I’m a chaotic naive rat (that’s verbatim from my friends). My mental illness is undiagnosed but I have strong symptoms of ADHD and OCD. Is this normal?
615,My mom broke up with me for Donald Trump,"About a week ago, my mom told me she wasn't interested in corresponding any further after Trump lost. I'm a gay trans person so I obviously voted Biden.

It really sucks that my mom has abandoned me for a cult.


EDIT: Thank you to all the kind and supportive people. This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.

To the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. 

I have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.

I really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object."" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans. Especially if you live in a city, take a look outside the concrete jungle and it's not hard to see why rural folks initially get sucked into this shit."

618,Constant thoughts of death made me unable to enjoy life.,"So, I have been diagnosed with mixed anxiety depressive disorder about four years ago, I have tried many different medications but pills either stop working after some time or don't work at all. In the beginning of autumn I started feeling like my depression is returning and now it has fully returned BUT there is a symptom that I've never encountered before. I for some reason  became incredibly aware of the fact that everyone has to die. First it will be my parents who are the only people that I trust, then I'm going to die. I really just can't deal with the fact that I won't be able to experience anything, I am literally about to cry while writing this. My life and everyone else's lives are completely insignificant we will be forgotten in no time. I get all of these thoughts a lot of times a day and they make me literally feel physically hurt, seriously.
I really just can't keep on living like this, when something good happens I remember about death and I become extremely depressed. I am getting admitted to youth psychiatric ward this week and I hope they will help me, it's just so hard. I wonder how people ignore the fact that they are just a grain of sand in a desert. If you have coping ideas please let me know."
619,Is anger all I have left?,"(26M diagnosed wit GAD/MDD, Czech republic) Anger is the only motivator I have left. I dont feel satisfaction or pleasure from doing anything. All of my hobbies are just an escape from reality that I abandon the moment they require effort. The only way for me to feel motivated to do anything is through anger and spite. How? How I live when everything is meaningless or not worth the effort required. How do I live when I only feel emptiness with occasional sparks of wrath."
620,I've this irrational need to be appreciated (23F),"Since childhood I have always wanted to be constantly appreciated for any work I do and I guess I have carried this need to adulthood and it's messing up my mind. Over the years as the compliments have dried up, I crave them even more. The minute someone appreciates me even a little, I get immensely happy and feel confident but if I am not overly complimented for my work I get depressed. Two days ago, I did a presentation and the response I got was ""fine, let's move ahead"", not even a ""good"" and since then I have been depressed, crying and obsessing over it. It wasn't even anything important but I still feel like I am just not good enough anymore. I want to be the best but the reality says that I am not. I have even started getting jealous when my peers are appreciated even though it is totally unrelated to me.  I know that what I am feeling is wrong but I can't seem to control it. Any advice?"

I have these waves of intense productivity where I learn rapidly, socialise, workout and I achieve great results. But then comes the lows where I just lie on the bed for days, watch YouTube and do absolutely nothing. And eventually I either quit the things I was doing or pick up things half heartedly.

How  are you all coping with the current WFH environment ?.... i have moved  to my parents place due to this .... but it turns out its harder than  expected ...work pressure is more plus no social interaction with anyone  .... due to covid i dont move much as well ... many of the times i am  getting negative thoughts about life and i am pulling on thinking that  this will pass... but my mental health is going for a toss... i am  constantly feeling a lot of emotional stress due to the thoughts (like  something bad is going to happen soon) . I feel like abusing a lot more  these days ... to my company (thankfully) ... also i get a feeling that i  am in a jail of sorts were everything is restricted... most of my  friends have started moving out frequently to deal with this but i being  a cautious person am not able to do so(mostly because i dont want to  bring the infection to my aged parents).

Hope some of you can suggest ways to deal with this situation."
623,Bad day,It's been an overwhelming moring. My stress is making me want to explode. I am currently sick with bronchitis but have to help my youngest with virtual learning as my husband works. We got bad news that my uncle isn't going to make it. I just want to go to bed and cry. I'm just really tired of anxiety and depression. I haven't woken up this bad in a while.
624,It’s not that I want to die,"It’s just that I don’t want to be alive right now. I don’t actually want to die by suicide, I don’t want to die in an awful car accident, or have a catastrophic heart attack, I just want everything to stop being painful. I want to be able to put my make up on in the morning and not cry it off before I leave for work, I want to be financially secure enough that I’m not panicking about paying bills, I want my husband to actually talk to me instead of doing this hot and cold bullshit, and I just want the constant self doubt and self hate to just stop. 
The problem is that I can’t see how to make it all stop without making my life stop. I won’t actually try to die by suicide, I’ve already lost my brother to suicide and I don’t want to do that to my family again, but I am really tired of life just being so painful."

* Highly aggressive and irritable
* Deceitfulness
* Lack of empathy or remorse

626,Hate myself,"Stay at home mom, with 2 beautiful children, a common law partner and his sister all living under one roof. Lost my only source of income due to partner and he refuses to admit its his fault, outright lies about it and gets angry when its brought up. Seems like anytime i bring a problem up to him he turns the conversation back on me and makes me feel bad. Iv always struggled with depression and have a lot of mental health issues so his actions make me question a lot of stuff and are makeing the depression issues and the intrusive thoughts much worse. At this point i can say part of me hates him (and the children) and everyone else involved in our lives atleast to an extent. As far as the kids go iv done everything since day one almost exclusively by myself. I rarely even have time to have personal hygiene. My teeth are full of cavities and theres no way to afford to fix any of them. I have tried again and again to talk to him but it always goes no where, im super exhausted by everything and cant stand myself anymore then i can anyone else, i dont see friends ( and in my own head i think they all hate me and are better off without me)  my family never has time for me and the kids or lives to far away and other then his siblings im too awkeard to speak with the rest of his family about help with the kids. (Honestly not sure if im just rambling anymore or if i have a point or a question) I feel ostrasized from everything. I hate myself most of all for not being able to being able to understand or control my emotions and thoughts. Im at a loss as to what i need to do to make things better. Leaving isnt an option as theres no where to go, and i have no income, but im also scared that staying is the wrong thing to do to. Suicide is not an answer i would go for, 3 failed attemps in the past have drove that message home hard."
627,Be Yourself?,"So I always been told to ""be myself"" and ""do what you want.""  But it is so frustrating on what someone mean cause like damn, people don't know so this is me, personally me, saying what I believe by ""be yourself"":

\-Self-awareness: you can look on the inside and see what's been going on, what should be done,and if you can't do it alone peeps, I highly advice therapy and a little break for yourself if you can

\-Self-acceptance: I feel this should come first before self-love because love is a hard emotion to have for yourself especially and so if you can at least accept yourself for who you are right now, that is such a good start and a good place to be in. Now, I am not saying you shouldn't change something you don't want on your body. Like weight for example, if you want to lose weight, be my guess, but I suggest you do it for you and not for someone or for society, do it because you want to. And this can go for these future points I bout to bring up.

\-Self-respect: This can go for a lot of things but  it is important to respect yourself. That can mean you tell your boundaries to someone or you know your worth in this world. You are valuable and you are valid.

\-Self-confidence: This one is a little tricky cause it can mean different  things for people  but in basic terms I say that self confidence is you coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses.But that's me personally

\-Self-Love: This one will come eventually, love is a weird thing you know, like its horomones and chemicals in your brain to some people, but  love have a lot more to it. Love can only last so long, but love with yourself will eventually last with you til your last breath drawn

\-Self-Control: This can go for health and external situations however emotions can be a powerful thing and so it is imperitive to control them and rationalize and step back for a second, and come back into a situation. This can eventually help you let your emotions out in the right time, if that make sense.

\-Indentity:  You can learn about what you want, what you need, what you want to do, what is your hobbies, your lifestyle, anything pretty much to find yourself.

Compromise your mind and heart: This maybe a stupid one to some people but to me specifically, I can say  my mind and heart fight a lot and it ends up to where I go all for mind or go all for heart in some situations, dealt me a lot of pain. This i not to say it should be 50/50 for everything, this is me saying that everyone has their own balance for their mind and heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I have bonus 3 if you want to hear it or not

\-Self validation

\-Self-care

\-Self reflect: see how far you have come

The first 2 is self explanitory in a way. AND that's it, that's what I follow pretty much, if anything, people will not like this.

**DISCLAIMER**: This is my personal life or the way I go about it. This does not work for everyone but this is something for someone who is lost in the world. Go to therapy or counseling to figure this out for yourself but this is how I can ""Be yourself"" lmao. Have a good day people!"
628,Dealing with a partner’s mental issues,"First time posting here and I could use advice. I have been dating someone with some pretty serious mental health issues due to childhood abuse for four years. I would say he is the love of my life. He was not doing great when we met but made enormous strides since then: gained weight, had a chronic physical condition go into remission, and managed to wean himself off most of the medication he was taking under a doctors supervision (he was on a lot of high doses of heavy stuff and this was entirely his decision, he still takes what he needs), holding down a job and even getting a better one.

He stopped therapy about a year ago right before we moved in together. I was concerned at the time because he never really addressed his past and I worried it might bring up issues down the line but he said constantly that everything was great and he was very happy with his life. 

Now it seems like that’s exactly what has happened. Beginning with quarantine, he started to change noticeably and exhibit concerning behaviors. At my request, he had a few more visits with a therapist but it was a new person due to his new insurance and he never disclosed anything about his past. The issues have continued to the point where I’ve been overwhelmed by it. (Some of the behavior: drinking every day—he denies he has a problem even though his mother is an alcoholic—OCD tendencies flaring up, missing rent payments and never even discussing it with me, avoiding conversations about adult responsibilities when I initiate them and resenting me for it). 

At our last talk I told him if I don’t see him making actual progress on the issues we discussed, most importantly getting therapy regularly, we would have to discuss him moving out. A few weeks went by and he still hasn’t gone to a single therapy session. He says he’s working on it through his EAP and that takes time, but I don’t see any evidence that he’s followed up on correcting any of the other issues we discussed either. When I brought this up to him, his attitude was shocking to me and nothing like the person I have known. He was very defensive and acted very entitled and actually raised his voice, something I never thought he would do (we both hate shouting and fighting and had never had a single fight before this year). 

I am completely lost. Everyone I know tells me I have to look out for myself first and break up with him. And I guess that’s true, but I’m really struggling with the feeling that I’m abandoning a person I care about so much. I believe he is a good person. He doesn’t have a lot of options and will most likely have to move back in with his father/abuser. Their relationship has improved slightly but I believe this will only accelerate his downward spiral. I would give anything to see him get help and would be there to support him as long as he is making an effort but I know I cannot make him do that. 

I guess I am just looking for any advice or support that I’m doing the right thing. Thank you."
629,I get triggered by words like “anxiety” “depression” and “panic attacks”,"I don’t know if anyone can relate. Whenever I hear anyone using these words I just want to cry. I have no idea why.  Just wanted to share, because I started to hyperventilate today when I heard someone use the term “anxiety”."
630,Anyone?,"I'm fourteen.
I'm usually a 'shy' person (I guess, since I've been described that way hundreds of times) and I don't really like being around people.
Stick-to-home life isn't really that new for me, but I've noticed that I've become drastically reclusive during the pandemic and the start of homeschooling (I've dropped out of middle school a few months ago and I'll be applying to a high school next month).
It's really weird. I'm sort of scared to go out when it's light because I keep feeling like someone's looking at me and it's REALLY uncomfortable. I'm usually better at night, though I still don't like going out because I feel somewhat exposed. 
It's not like I can't interact with others, since I go to academies a few times a week for 3-5 hours. However, I keep getting really nervous when I have to TALK to someone; I'm not sure whether to maintain eye contact, nod or shake my head, etc. It gets really bad with cashiers and delivery staff and I try to get myself out of situations where I have to meet with these people (I usually ask my parents to answer the door) but I don't think my parents believe or understand me so I'm not sure how this can continue.
Any ideas on why I'm feeling like this or help to improve would be appreciated 😁"
631,i want to help my mother,"My mother recently broke down a few days ago, she called my father over to her room lying on her bed and started crying and yelling at him
My father and mother never had a great relationship and only stayed together for me and my brother and since my mother never completed her education due to my father finding a job overseas, she doesn't have much educational backgrounds to help her find a proper job for her to settle down once me and my brother grows up
She's been on pills from shady websites that i dont think helps her at all and she has a short temper and always yells at my father
she 's looking for a job a right now but i think the minimum requirements for most minimum wage jobs requires a proper education and it doesn't help her mental stage at all seeing as she probably can't find a proper paying job
shes been really quite and always sleep at 9pm to 12pm and i dont know what to do, im only 14 and my brother 16 and i really dont want her to do anything bad
my father also tries to help but behind doors he always yells at me and my brother for 'never taking good care of her'
please suggests some ways that distract her or at least help her through this
thank you"
632,Why do I feel like throwing up with people and super anxious?,"21 Male

1: I recently returned home from Afghanistan and I constantly have nightmares about it.

2: 2 months ago I just bought my house and I have a mortgage for the first time (stressful)

3: 2 months ago I got into a really bad car accident that totated my car and I almost lost my life (I also had to throw all of my remaining money down the drain)

4:2 months ago Me and my wife split up and now she's with a guy already and ""loves him"" I can't stop hurting over this

5: I've been so stressed I haven't been able to work properly (business sales) and I was fired from my job

6: I'm renting put half of my house just to get by and the slightest thing would cost me to lose my home.

7. I had smoke Marijuanna almost everyday from January until mid October and completely stopped. (It made me think about the split up and stressed me out even more... anxious)


Everytime I talk with someone in person I have a panic attack and feel like throwing up. Even when my mom had me over for lasagna I felt like throwing up. Its to the point where I won't get into a friend's car and I keep canceling all of my plans.... why is this?? I'm a very logical person so I tell myself ""you're fine"" and I breathe but nothing works except being alone. Suicide has been on my mind since I returned from Afghanistan and since the split up with my wife and her being with another man Suicide has been on my mind everyday followed by nightmares at night. I'm NOT going to kill myself but I just want this bullsh!t to stop."
633,Everyday is a big challenge to face other people.,"I've recently become aware that I put a lot of energy into gathering up courage before heading out to work or opening my bedroom door to say hi to my roommate. 

People scare me and I guess that got to do with my childhood, but mostly I think it's related to a few LSD and mushroom trips in college. 3 of them went bad and I've never felt the same since, and that was 6 years ago. 

It's hard to just put myself out there. To let people see the messy sides of my life. Sometimes my room isn't clean, sometimes I stand around like a punk and not a professional. Sometimes I get drunk. And most of the time I wear beat up clothes because I think they look cool.

Most people are NOT judging me. But for some reason my mind is filled with their voices saying things about me. Obviously, this is just my own mind speaking it's judgements onto itself.

I guess I just realized how much effort I have been exercising just to get up and put out an image to the world that I've got it all together, that I'm a professional with nice clothes and nice things, that I am strong and in shape, and don't ever do anything that would make anyone uncomfortable like smoke pipes or drink beer or read harry potter. 

Thanks for reading, if you did. For some reason writing this is giving me more courage to not worry about letting myself be seen. Bye for now Reddit :)"
634,Maybe I’m losing my mind...,"To whom it may concern, 
I have been battling a Depressive Episode and I really thought I had a good handle on it. But this past year has caused me to swan dive into a downward spiral and I don’t recognize myself anymore. It takes me forever to just get out of bed in the morning; that’s if I even get up and I’m always disappointed to be awake. All of the things that used to make me feel happy don’t make me feel anything anymore. I go out with friends and smile on cue but inside I’m literally a million miles away and I feel like I’m suffocating. I barely spend time with family and friends, and find myself making excuses as to why I didn’t answer my phone or text. I have crying spells everyday and feel like I want to punch my fist straight through something. It has gotten so bad that I have literally given up on everything that I thought I wanted or thought I would loved. Its like the world is so grey even though the sun is out. I don’t know what to do. I’m so lost and everything just feels so hopeless. A bit of backstory: Last year I went through a pretty rough break up and I lost my house. Was forced to move in with an older male friend with my two kids. After that happened I was rear ended at a stop sign, in a school zone; my car was totaled. After that; not even a month later before I had received my first bill from my first ever car payment I was hiking to lose some weight for my health thinking it would help my depression and I broke my leg in 3 places. I was in a cast, couldn’t work for months, I get my cast off and start back up work and boom 💥 I lost my job due to COVID-19. I have been unemployed since. I lost my child care I am behind with all of my bills on the verge of eviction. I am just completely giving up on everything right now. Icing on the cake: We had to put my cat down recently after having Lucky for 23 years. It has felt like one thing after another, I’m literally looking over my shoulder everywhere I go waiting for something bad to happen. I’ve become so paranoid that I’m pretty sure I’ve developed social anhedonia. It’s affecting my relationship with my boyfriend/family/friends. I went out for the first time in almost a year for Halloween and I literally felt like I was 1,000,000 miles away. I didn’t feel present. Any advice on medications that work? Or techniques to distract my negative thoughts? I could really use some sound advice/support right now.

635,What to do when you want to stab someone with a really sharp spoon?,"I am not being facetious I really need to direct this energy and feeling somewhere. I tried carving a melon but that is not helping and I don't know what to do. 

I asked google and it turned dark on me but did have a number of curious image suggestions for wood carving hook knives which I fear could do actual harm. 

For the last seemingly 18 months my boss has been picking away at my trust and there is nothing left there. Most recently she revealed confidential information to a colleague and when I took it up with her, her response was that she assumed I would have told said colleague. I brought this up again in mediation and our HR director who suggested that next time I contract with my boss as to what we mean by confidentiality. Its confidentiality! Why do I need to spell that out?

Today I told her that, ""I am not okay"" and she said, ""Noted. I don't have time for that."" 

I know I should get a new job but that is tough and right now I am pretty much broken so I ask you, what can I do when I want to stab someone with a really sharp spoon?"
636,I’m not sure of myself,Is there a sign that of depression?or I’m just sad idk.

1. I’m only eating half to under half on dinner and thats it for the whole day
2. I can’t sleep
3. I haven’t slept for almost 3 days I think
4. I feel like a burden on everyone 
5. Whenever I apologise I feel like I’ve done it too much as I have been called out for doing so since childhood 
6. I feel like I was neglected as a child (which my parents laughed at) which may be why I require a lot of attention hate those kind of people and my oversharing 
7. I feel like I’m stationary and time goes on without me
8. I don’t feel like a person
9. I have no concept of time of day and what day it is unless told
10. I have a terrible memory as I can’t remember big things in my childhood to what I had for dinner yesterday 
11. Going to school and the hospital makes me feel like I’m going to throw up my guts
12. I feel like all my friends hate me and don’t care to hide it
13. I feel like I have a gun to my head all the time and all I need to do is pull the trigger 
14. I can’t do school work as all that’s in my head is thinking of killing myself
15. I don’t feel like a real person
16. I get waves of extreme suicidal thoughts over my mind numbing ones
17. I can’t be still for very long
18. I have heard people say my name in public and by myself when no one is talking to me (not a common name, it’s Jackson) since I was a child
19. I 100% have heard the radio talking about me in the other room but goes quiet when I enter the room, only at night time so I can’t ask anyone else to confirm 
20. Waves of physical cold sensation runs over me
21. Therapy does not help

23. I am the jumpiest person I know, even jumping when I saw the person coming behind me and saying boo
24. Nothing is enjoyable anymore 
25. I have immense difficulty crying and showing anger
26. I have always bottled up my anger as I was taught not to slam doors or show my anger from a very young age
27. Gender Identity issues?? 
28. Fear of disappointing my farther 
29. Will do whatever my farther tells me to do, but will do nothing when asked by my mother
30. I hate my mother
31. Everything she does annoys me 
32. Idk what else but I can guarantee theres more that I forgot"
639,i feel so worthless right now,"Anybody else feel like they had so much potential but then wasted that shit on things like addictions and failed relationships? I feel like a complete fuck up.

I'm closer to 30 than 20 now and haven't really accomplished anything. Still live at home in this small town that i call the pit. My walls are slowly closing in and i'm losing hope tbh

The longer i'm here the harder it gets to find reason to keep going. I always saw myself as a relatively smart person, despite my poor choices. But i guess reality is catching up and i'm losing ground.

I just want to cease existing but i don't want to kill myself because no one deserves to endure the sight of my disgusting lifeless body hanging from a tree. That would be very selfish of me and could scar the person who finds me for life.

But maybe i'll care less in a couple months.

Sorry if this is too real i just felt like writing something down and throwing it out there"
640,I really don't want to live anymore,"The only thing keeping me is my faith. I don't feel alive or happy or anything that would keep me going. It's just mindless and empty days going by and I don't want it anymore. I don't know how long I'm supposed to be going through this. Everyone says it gets better but it's not. It's only getting worse and worse and I don't know how to take it anymore. It hurts so much to do anything. I feel so exhausted. I feel like I'm faking it all and I'm just being paranoid or stupid. I can't kill myself cause I'm so scared my little sisters would see or become influenced. But I don't feel anything or have anything to live for anymore. I know others are going through so much more pain and I shouldn't do this to myself. But I can't anymore. I don't know what I'm meant to do now. I need it all to just stop. To leave me alone but if I let go, then I let go of my faith. I can't do that. It's the only thing keeping me together by a string. If I don't have it, I don't have anything after dying. I probably sound like a religious freak but I'm not. I'm not the most religious but it keeps me going and I keep trying but even religion is slowly becoming harder to focus on. Everything's fading so quickly. I'm just tired."
641,I feel useless,"I haven't worked in a few months, and I thought that my mental health was getting better so I thought it could be good for me to have a job ( it's not stressful at all, it's in a grocery store). But I've been here 2h and I'm already having a panic attack. I hate myself. Why can't I work without having a panic attack... I feel so useless and worthless, seriously"
642,I can’t find the courage to talk,"I’m looking for help. I’ve been going through a lot of on and off undiagnosed depression and it’s really wearing on me. To be blunt, the community around me is on first impressions very ignorant and unaccepting of real depression at least to the point that I have it. Everyone in my wife’s immediate and extended family (I don’t really talk to my family now) are very religious and traditional to put it simply. Anyways my wife knows a little bit that I go through these hard times but even to her I can’t find the courage or the words to tell her the full scope of my struggles. There’s definitely no one else around me that I feel comfortable talking to because really I’m embarrassed. It’s gotten to the point that I was inches away from attempting suicide and I can’t muster up anything to tell anyone how real my struggles are. But I want help. But I don’t know how."
643,The hardest battle we fight in healing trauma is against ourselves.," I was driving 80mph across I-70 West, heading from Indiana, a place that I had called home for so long that I didn’t know anything else and I was terrified. Through the great plains, I saw incredible showcases of nature’s power in the form of lightning storms and, at one point, just within the boundaries of Idaho,  a tornado that was so wide it could probably eat a city. The road West was long and lonely but gave me time to reflect on what exactly it was that was happening- I was finally putting myself first. I could feel the warmth of the tears drip down my cheeks and fall until my hands; I  hadn’t cried in so long that I had forgotten the salty taste. But these weren’t tears of sadness. They were tears of accomplishment because I  was finally taking care of myself first.

Coming from a home of vicious childhood trauma, I often found myself not leaning into the parts of me that felt real. My wants, needs, and interests were never validated, and more often than not, they were used against me. The idea of being the person that I am was a death sentence in most cases. Our home was status quo for children are better to be seen and not heard, though existing alone could be the catalyst for a  trip to the executioner’s block. I spent so much time hiding from who I  was that I had no choice but to step into the unknown. The only thing on my mind as I drove those thousands of miles away from everything I had known was that I was doing this for me and me alone. *Heal or die* is the only thing that held me together during that week.

I  always had an excuse for not doing the things that I said I was going to do. I could find a reason that other people or other things were more important than me. I could drink, smoke, screw away the sadness of feeling incomplete, and that left me nowhere. And the funny thing about not taking care of yourself is that it works until it doesn’t, and when that happens, sometimes you have to rip the bandage off and do the unthinkable-you have to put yourself first.

The idea that self-care is tied into our daily lives is fair, but what if your everyday life isn’t on your terms, to begin with? Are you taking care of yourself? You can do all the yoga, journal writing, and meditation in the world, but it doesn’t mean shit if you are still not in a place of healing. My definition of a healing place is one that I  feel safe to express myself, to be loved as I am, to be able to say and do what I feel true for me. Too many trauma survivors are in a place that just happens to be **good enough** but let’s be honest, that is a copout. Of course, there are circumstances in which we have to accept that, but I challenge you to think about the narrative of accepting that as only a short term agreement.

We get so tied up in what we believe to be obligations that they rule our lives. We work jobs we hate, have unfulfilling relationships with partners who take advantage of us, indulge in friendships that don’t bring us value, and spend time distracting ourselves from the truth that we are not living on our terms. Ask yourself this question, **what am I willing to do to have the life that I want?**  In that question lies not only the truth of what you already know, your gut instinct is always right, but it also gives you space to be to step into your personal boundaries and identify on your terms your wants,  needs, and interests.

I  don’t know that everyone needs to uproot their lives, pack a rental car, and drive across the country in pursuit of healing, but maybe you do. We are scared of the unknown because we have historical data that supports our hypothesis that if we try something that we need, then we will face ramifications. We have done this research study time and again. But I would challenge you to take inventory of your environment and determine if you are in a position to take the risk of moving towards who you want to be.

Out there somewhere is a thunderstorm on the side of the highway waiting for you to pull over and indulge in it, but you will never know if you keep waiting for the right time. Now, is the right now.

Until next time my friend…

Hi i’m 15 and i’m a girl and i have Severe ADHD and i have Autism. 
I just have attempted to kill myself. I’m scared, i’m bleeding from my legs kinda bad from cutting myself and i have just basically overdosed on Vyvanese and Melatonin so i might go to sleep kinda quick soon. 
I did this because i am suicidle and i hate my life and myself. My parents are cool but it’s me that makes everything hard for them. ADHD messes me up so much and i’m hard work for everybody and i hate it. I hate myself so much. Autism ontop of severe ADHD is even more horrible because apparently (coming from my parents) i have trouble processing everything in my head. I am not good at communicating or speaking to others. I don’t really have much friends. I am getting bad marks on my work at school. 
Idk what i should do. I’m feeling kinda sleepy now and idk what to do and my stomach is hurting and my legs hurt like crazy and are bleeding a bit. Help??????"
646,"I feel like ""You should seek therapy"" is not always good mental health advice.",I've been feeling very down lately due to a lot of personal and career-related problems but whenever I talk about it generally to someone they always say this to me. I know that it's the right advice but finding a good therapist + budgeting it + opening up to a new therapist + telling ppl ur in therapy + trusting ur therapist + taking time out from work/uni for it + making excuses @ home 2 go to therapy is too much work. What do you people think could be an alternative response to this? I've been thinking and I feel I would say the same to someone struggling but I don't know if it would be genuinely helpful advice to them.

Been a minute 😅 
Took some time to share my experiences with my mental health as well as the things I did to improve it. Including a couple of reasons why I hadn’t been showing up in my channel 💕 Do show your support by commenting, sharing and liking my video 💁🏽‍♀️"
650,What’s the point of therapy?,"First I’d like to say that it’s a “therapy is useless” post. Not all. 

What I’d like to know is, how does it really help? I mean, if I talk to someone, then what? That person would tell me what my problem is, fine I already know what’s wrong. What I could do to try to fix that? Well I already have a good idea, I just can’t. So really, when you know what’s wrong and what could be a solution, what would be the point?"
651,Sad and waiting for treatments and help,"Hi all, I'm having a bad day again. I just want to get help and go back to being able to sleep better and to be happy again.. but I'm always having to wait. I don't know what to do to feel better, all of the help I am waiting for is taking so long.

I know I should just be glad that I'm getting help and that I know its on its way but I'm just so sad again today and its been building up worse than 'normal' for days again..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lucky, I have a roof over my head and I'm warm and I have food and water... but its still so hard and I don't want to cry and cry and cry.

even when I feel 'normal' for me its still hard but then when everything gets worse and worse its so much harder and I just don't want to be upset and sad, I just want my treatments and help to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope all of you are having a better few days and weeks."
652,Mental health and a new relationship,"I met a guy through mutual friends. We went out on 5 dates over 3 weeks and it was moving to something more serious, with questions such as ""What are we"" from him. He told our mutual friend we were seeing each other and I was really looking forward to eventually being with him. Every date we'd spend all afternoon together and we were quite comfortable with each other and extremely attracted to each other.

One very late night a topic came up. I mentioned I had a difficult summer and problems with serious depression, but that this was in the past and I am close to recovering. I made it clear I was not clinically depressed. He asked me a few questions and seemed caring. The next day, he asked to see me, painting it like he wants to spend time together. Instead, he tells me that he can't be with me because of the fact that I was depressed this summer and he doesn't want to lead me on.

I was dumbfounded as just a day before we were having an amazing time and I had to force us to go home because otherwise we wouldn't have until the morning.

Part of me can't shake the feeling that I shouldn't have shared my past, but part of me wants to believe I didn't do anything wrong and that everyone has problems. I really fell for him, and I feel like I will never meet someone again. I do not like this vulnerable feeling and I would just like some advice on how to process this and get over it. Do you think I overshared? For context, I am a 20 year old female university student."
653,I now have no friends,"A few weeks ago my best friend of 3 years betrayed me by telling me he was only my friend so he could get close with my ex. It was a pretty fucked up situation, not only that but because I was upset at them they told the teachers at my school that I was racist, homophobic and more. I felt like my world was falling apart, I barely kept my self together. I then went and hanged out with some people I thought I was friends with, a group of 7 guys, they kept on stealing my stuff for fun and not giving it back, I wasnt thinking straight and carried on hanging out with them, yesterday I asked if they could give my stuff back on Instagram, they said no and stuff like ""can you piss off, we aren't your friends, we never liked you in the first place"" they then proceeded to mock me, making fun of trauma, my family, and everything they could. I'm sick of this shit, I went to school today, All I heard was negative things from people around me. I feel like I'm useless and disposable, why has this happened to me? I strive my hardest to be the best person I can, I always try to help people and be nice, but life doesn't care, it just kicks me down every time I try to stand up, I never feel happy any more, whenever I'm at school I put a facade on to cover my real emotions. I can't deal with all this pressure. I'm 16 for anyone wondering"
654,I'm Going to a Mental Hospital Soon and I'm Worried About Academics,"So yeah pretty much what the title says. I'm gonna be admitted on Thursday, so I'm gonna miss like a whole semester of school. Does anyone know how that works? Will I do school at the facility? Will I have to retake all my classes next year? I'm really worried that this could affect my life in the long run if my grades get bad enough. Do y'all have any information or advice on this type of thing? Anything is appreciated."
655,TW just a random stupid vent! I’m not in immediate danger don’t worry!," when I was a baby my mum use to tell me how after dealing with my twin brother crying all the time it would calm her down when she’d come and see me, cos I never rlly cried, like instantly she would calm me down, she told me looking after me as a child was like a blessing, I was her chill pill, being around me made her happier, and when I was around 5-9 years old (about when my trauma was ending) the adults around me would be happy and sometimes I’d hear them whispering to my mum saying “I wish I could see this girl only everyday the other kids stress me out” my sweet kind but shy and empathetic personality rlly made others so happy. However puberty hit me hard and so did the traumatic memories and omg did it make me so depressed, I want to make others happy by trying be that old self by it starts to make other patronising, and I feel so shit and I have such shitty thoughts and it feels like such a drastic change from an outside perspective, like where tf did that come from but Ik it had be hidden in my subconscious for years, like some people thought when I was little that I was so low IQ and so out of touch with reality that I couldn’t be upset about what was going on, however that wasn’t true, it was me acting pretending cos my brain knew the harder emotions were too much to deal with. Now everyone around me is kinda getting sick of me, while my heads getting sicker. And more and more I just want to die so I can’t finally leave everything so they can get a new more peaceful life. I lost some friends a few days ago due to my over the top behaviour, taking things too far and reacting way to emotional for something that’s so small. I hear my family arguing about me now, about how  my sister I don’t deserve new shoes because I’m lazy however my mother thinks i don’t have any other shoes to go out with other than some ragged old vans and my school shoes and even tho the shoes I want r kind of expensive I should get them because I don’t really get nice things a lot.  I don’t rlly care if I get the shoes tbh, it’s always nice to have shoes u like but I won’t get mad if I don’t get them. This rant isn’t about shoes, I hate how they see me as this sluggish stinky lazy slob. I’m disgusting. I should have showered weeks ago, I’m hoping I’ll get the motivation to shower today. This is what I meant by being a burden, I don’t even have anything to live for. I’m just scared of death. I don’t think I’m gonna be friend with my friends again, they haven’t texted me in days, I’m kind of glad as much as I’ll have no friends to have adventures with or the fact I’ll miss them what I won’t miss is my feelings being invalidated again and again, like one of my friends told me “ I’d never get the guts to kill myself” after making a quite creative suicide joke, which was a JOKE. And I kept thinking about it more and more they where my safe space, they where my reason for living however now I don’t have anything. I wanna rot into my room however I’m afraid of my family knowing of everyone knowing, it’ll only make things worse. I have one last hope, confiding into a teacher, however if that fails I might just kill myself or just wait until I feel actively suicidal and then kill myself. I don’t see much to my life, my interests aren’t interesting. I’m just waiting for the days to end, that isn’t rlly living. I’ll show my friend once I kill myself and he will see that my problems where real that what I said wasn’t dramatised. Cos no one rlly cares."

657,Undiagnosed anxiety in adults,"Hello!

I hope you're all well, I'm currently a journalism student and am looking to talk to male adults aged 30+ who were only diagnosed with anxiety later in life. My piece focuses on how we have more language to discuss anxiety as a mental health issue now, whereas if you were growing up in the 90s or beforehand, the awareness or language may not have been in place. I'm from the UK so it would be great to talk to someone based here, but I'm open to anyone!

If you could let me know your thoughts or message me I'd love to hear from you!"
658,Sunlight Tense (36),"5 Hours. Start Again. Crush. Crushing It. Out of No where, Now I feel This Way. Interesting.

A New Day. Did You get Enough Sleep? Yes? No? Wake Up Sis. Its time to Go HARDER Today. We Can Sleep Tonight. We Will NOT Sleep on This Opportunity. WAKE UP.

Being there for myself has been a constant struggle and battle my whole life. Putting other peoples needs before mine has been something that I have always been so quick to do. Awakening. Why do we do this? I am Healing. From my insecurities, my trauma, my identity, my Being. The only thing I can do today is My Best &amp; so, I will do Just That. I hope you do too.

With the change from fall to winter, less sun, more grey, its time to go into a hermit turtle mode with the inner guidance of a Lion. Its time to really wake up and go on offence against the darkness, the evils that are TRYING &amp; let me tell you, REALLY TRYING to Consume My Being, Mind, Body &amp; Spirit. We are Stronger. Its Greater than Right Here, Right Now, Living though, through this present moment.

Healing Takes Time. Practice day to day will lead to minor growth that by the end of the day, week, month, year Is a SnowBall Uphill.

Look back at where you were a year ago? Progress? Growth? Still in the same place? This is your moment and sign to Change if you are unhappy with being stuck. It starts with trying something differently. Focusing on daily routines and habits but realizing that those have been set in stone by myself and no one else, I can change them if I want. Its about the systems that influence the change I want to make, rather than the change in itself.

I am Healing, I am Broken, I am Growing, I am Strong. I know you are Too. Start Today.  
Do something Differently, it will start the journey that is intended, slowly but with correct pace.

I love you.

659,"Not Blind to the Good, But Feeling Pummeled by the Bad","I have a lot of things to be grateful for right now, with all that's happened this year.  I make enough money to get by, and was just offered a new job that will really increase my income to a point I've rarely seen before.  I have a place to live.  I have food.  I've been without all this before.  I know not to ignore these blessings.

But I don't have friends or family, I live in a foreign country without a support network that has just entered its second lockdown.  My flatmates do not speak English, I do not speak Portuguese.  You can start to imagine how isolating this can be.  I am one to enjoy alone time, but it's a special sort of isolation when there are people around but you cannot even communicate with them.   That aside, it's really that my anxiety and depression have found a lot to thrive on living in an apartment where the previous tenant was DISGUSTING (I mean picking plastic out of the sink, spending 10 minutes pulling her hair out of the shower and still needing chemicals to get it to drain, stains on pillows that look like something I won't even mention), and Portuguese people can be really quite rude and inconsiderate (not looking to get into that with anyone - I've lived all over the world, this is clearly a generalization, I certainly don't wish to spread hatred through this post, but my experiences here have not made things any easier).  

I guess I just wish... I mean, I NEED a support network.  I've had what loose acquaintances I've made online recently already tell me they've had enough of my venting, so ....  I got a message back from one of the few English-speaking therapists around here that treats my ailments, and she does not have room for new clients.  Basically, I've tried, but I just cannot find support.

If anyone would like to be a shoulder... it's not that I want to focus on difficult things, I don't want a 'misery loves company' pal, not at all.  But I would like to maybe meet someone, or get some nice wishes, from people who don't mind that I will need to vent at times, and not just tell me to take it elsewhere (I get that others are hurting, too, so I think it's tough for people to be really supportive of others right now).  I guess I'm just hoping for someone to say I matter enough to keep at it, and maybe have a slice of joy to share regularly.  I hate coming to reddit for this stuff, because it seems like the darkest corner of the web a lot of days, but it does seem this sub has some nice posts, so I hope maybe this will be a more receptive place for me.

Thank you!"

661,Feeling really lonely,"To start of with, I met my best friends about 3 years ago. They are my most best friends. I have their backs and I know they have mine. But about 2 years ago I moved to another state, and then a year later a different one, and just a couple days I moved again. (I have moved many many times so it's nothing new)

I really miss them a lot and I always feel really left out whenever they hang together. Last night one of them told me he went to party and was fooling around with a girl (we are 15 FYI) and I sat there and realized, I'm missing out on a lot of experiences because I have moved so much. I'm missing out on the high school experiences with your friends. messing around, holding hands and crap. I just want to have those with them. And since they always hang out together, I don't think they miss me as much as I miss them. (granted I know they all miss me but it still feels different). 

Moving here will let me visit them more often, and I found out someone I like, likes me back :) I'm super grateful for them all and I love them a lot. I guess that's why I miss them so much isn't it?

Thanks for listening lol and sorry if anything doesn't make sense. I'm new to this."
662,I'm angry at my friends and I really don't know what to do.,"Hi all

Lately I've just been very angry at my friends. I feel really drained around them as well. From what i've thought I feel like this is because I don't feel like i'm getting enough attention/respect from them. And that they would rather be around each other then me. Idk if it's true though so

Any1 have any thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."
663,Anyone else feel like they have a repeating cycle where they feel mentally good and bad?,"I'm thinking of seeing a psychologist cause this has been going on for the last 2.5 years now. I consider myself a happy and joyful person, who loves certain passions and interest that I have in life. But this feeling of happiness normally doesn't last longer then 1 or 2 weeks. Then I start feeling content for a bit, then I'll feel dull and before I know it I feel mentally super bad, I stop doing work and going to school for a few days, have suicidal thoughts, and then I slowly start picking stuff up and will feel happy eventually. 

The sad part is that I know the happiness will only last for 1 or 2 weeks and the coming months I'll feel mehh till the point I just wanna end my life. Does anyone else have this? Is there maybe a sienctifical explenation for this? It's starting to ruin my life."
664,Low libido from meds - advice needed!,"My husband (42 yrs) is currently in a mix of endep (high dose) and Valdoxan.
He’s been on many different meds since I’ve known him, but this combination seems to work well for him as he finally sleeps quite well on them.
The down side is the meds have greatly impacted his libido (think the endep more than the Valdoxan) - which is negatively affecting our marriage.
Does anyone have any advice on how to stay on meds which lower libido but get back a bit of their mojo? Any advice on natural supplements or another approach maybe?
Thanks peeps 🤗"

666,Coping Mechanisms,my depression/anxiety/OCD symptoms have gotten worse since the pandemic. I'm experiencing an increasing apathy (anhedonia?) to such a point that my body has become weak and sore from disuse. what are some things you have done to reduce your symptoms during this year? TIA.

668,How do you be affectionate,"Showing affection has always been a problem for me. If someone tries to hug me or say “I love you” - family or friend alike, I freeze up and I don’t know what to do and feel like crawling in a hole. I want to learn how to be more affectionate but I don’t know how without feeling like I’m wearing a mask or feel like I’m dying inside. Is there something wrong with me? I don’t know what to do or what steps to take to do this. I want to give them a genuine smile and tell them that I love them without being an awkward fuck riddled with anxiety making it obvious as fuck that I’m forcing a smile or the words out. I don’t want to end up becoming a parent who only knows how to say “I love you” to their kid by giving them a plate of fruit. I hope this makes sense, I don’t know I’m just so lost and I just want to show my friends and family that I love them in the way that speaks to their love language (physical touch, words of affirmation)."
669,"White systemic supremacy, &amp; it's Mental health affects on the many black populaces in America.","A couple of things I wan't to delineate when discussing this topic is that, through the privileges of capitalism, some of us have been able to scoot by and make suburban families, while still facing mental crises, and trauma related non inclusive spaces, The too white for the black kids but to white for the blacks phenomena ( Middle of the road theory), and troubles understanding how we're supposed to go about within society based off an education system that never really tells it's students about one, the need for gender role neutrality and lack of pressure to force law abiding citizens how to act, two, sexual neutrality, three complex backgrounds of black peoples around the world, i.e. history, of kingdoms, tribes, civilizations, wars, etc. etc.all the good and bad etc.  and four management of mental health symptoms related to the various communities we grow up around and how we all don't have the same solutions because of that. For example: 

Black trans people exist, Hi!

Black people that have no income is common

There are also a lot of us who grew up to families that got money lucky but still get second hand treatment from parents who think it's ok to beat their children cause they learned that from their bad environments. Or who think its ok to pressure gender, and race stereotypes and stay to ""tradition"" in reality these things have been at the beginnings of slavery and implied after so

Black gay people also exist, 

There are also Black people with disabilities,

Some of us got college lucky and escaped our circumstances and still deal with trauma. 

Some of us have immigrated from equatorial islands, or other foreign countries and still get second hand oppression here.

Some of us grew up in isolated subcultures which have changed our personal perception of ourselves but to the outside world, we're still seen as and only as our skin, and because of that, inviting all people together to break us free from this is  important.

Some of us have been conditioned to portray violence, make others feel less than, rob, murder, sexualize or brutalize women/ lgbtq+ peeps, abuse each other, even our own children.  From some extent you have individuals that have experienced all of these things in many phases of their lives. 

From my family's own general consensus they all have ptsd from stories, or even seeing the life the hood/ post hood/ suburban racism has brought forward. 

but it's not all our fault. 

It's the systemic racism, and the profit motive for survival, and believe that on average we have lacked the material conditions to do that effectively. It's common to hear black folk refuse therapy, or financial help because hope has been diminished for many of us. We were denied loans, education, food, water, jobs, banking, investments. These things are still called ""white people things"".  It's the conditioning of White systemic supremacy, that really needs small effort now a days because the major execution of this happened over 400 years ago, and we just now in the 60's had our rights established in america. Think about the recovery time, and the multi generational effects this has had on many of us.

This is why many people get confused that I'm like a cartoon head, college educated, trans, and privileged more than my cousin who's been arrested, didn't have the same level of education as me until now, but grew up very hyper masc, and aggressive. What they don't see is we still share a lot  of experiences, trauma, and feeling less adequate than many. Feelings that people will hate us if we express our emotions. I also was forced to be hyper masc growing up(cause of where my father came)  but i educated myself and refused that by having monetary access to research on these societal pressures. It still has major impacts on my mental health because I fear that's how other's see me cause of my skin, and my assigned gender at birth aligned with that stereotype.

These are the things i think about when talking about my own mental health. You would need to search and sift through historical backgrounds for just about anybody to finds solutions but i thought i'd bring this up because i rarely see this thought about in a black context cause it's been indirectly suppressed.  If it's not talked about in that sample size of people, it wont be discussed, but it's been conditioned to be that way, and there's a lot of repair that needs to be done."
670,I feel as if I am the most stupid person who always overthinks things... Am I?,"I don’t really know how to explain my situation. I always have thoughts at the age of 14 like: “what is the point in living my life if im just gonna go through bad situations” and every single time I will just push it away with the thought and the knowledge that it is all my mentality and it’ll show up again and I’ll do the same goddamn thing.
Whenever I can’t be better at something than someone I’ll always call myself a failure and get super angry and want to end myself and yet I can’t get the motivation to do anything about it. I’ll always compare myself to my family, how i’m always the worse looking one, the stupid one, the one who can’t actually put any effort into anything and just plays it off as a pity story of “they just don’t understand me” like i’m not some kind of stupid and lazy person who simply can’t get his head straight.
And of all the times I have a “mental breakdown”, more just crying and me putting myself down for something stupid, it was because of minecraft. Because I couldn’t join a game and nobody really cared and only one person who is my best friend actually cared and someone else said “why is he so triggered” and I am still asking myself this question now because I felt so angry that I couldn’t play a game with other people, or maybe I felt that they didn’t want to play with me ( something else I’m an idiot about since I’m always saying I’m an introvert and don’t like being the one who gets attention but most of the time when I want to speak and people play it off or ignore me and I do it a lot I get really annoyed) at this point I don’t really know. But I pretend I Have to go and just get angry and feel that I need to do something about myself before I end up ruining any chances I have in life but again play it off as a useless side thought and I won’t do anything anyway because I just can’t get motivated A.K.A I’m a lazy nothing. The worst thing is that nobody pays attention to it and if they do, no matter how much i wanna say anything, I just keep my mouth shut because I don’t want to put them through the hassle of dealing with it. 

This has really lowered my self confidence and i pretty much never really try in school and can get away with it pretty well but I never try at sports and will never get out of my comfort zone at the fear of being embarrassed, a waste of space or getting hurt which shouldn’t even be a problem. I’m always known as the guy that kind of just accepts it as it is, which I don’t in fact I get very angry over things I cannot control and my lack of patience doesn’t much help with that. I just want to be the person who people don’t listen to yet people want me to listen to them most of the time ( or maybe I’m just stupid and thinking of it the wrong way?) and I want to be known as the person who people don’t make fun of and expect nothing back and people don’t abuse my naive nature into their own advantage because it gets incredibly tiring. I do have a great few people whom i’m friends with and when I am with some of them I don’t tend to hate myself so much, only when I do something stupid or get something obvious wrong. 

My procrastination is one of my greatest issues, maybe that is a lack of motivation but i’ll say i’ll get certain things done on time and yet i’ll continue to leave it until the last minute probably still not to get it done and then I’ll be left with a bunch of anxiety of my parents finding out how bad I’ve been doing and If I have any homework i’m not aware of.

This is only a very small amount of my feelings but i don’t want to look like i’m fishing for those get therapy comments because my situation I don’t think is that bad and I probably won’t get therapy anyway because that is just too scary for me since I don’t want anyone else to get involved in it. I may post more and this vent has helped me express my feelings in my own way a little more I just hope I can find someplace that can find a way to change my perspective on life and just how useless I am to exist in it. The idea being that if I ended my own life, what would it really matter. Time wouldnt stop. Only my heart and what is that to anyone. 
Just a positive thought to leave myself and others on Lol. 
If you did somehow put up with this then thank you for reading despite the fact i’m not sure why you did Lol. Have a great day because you don’t need to be hopeless and a waste of potential like myself. Think good things because you matter more than anyone else!"
671,I’ve hit rock bottom,"I’ve lost everything more than a handful of times. Was used as a pawn in custody battles. i was forced to take antidepressants for about 7 years even though it was situational depression. 

Ive bounced around the foster system for a few years. Then I ended up in a residential facility for 8 months because my dcs worker lied to the court.  In there my first roommate tried to kill his entire family. Bro ive car hopped so like wtaf

I’ve scorched bridges i wish i could come back from. Im in a toxic environment. My mental health only gets worse day after day. 

I would rather die than work in another restaurant but i have no marketable skills to get any other kind of job. 

Ive been sleeping on floors and couches for a while so my back is beyond warehouse work. 

I cant join the military due to a psychiatric history 

I didn’t have a good enough gpa for college. 

I’ve looked into web development but i dont have 2 years to dedicate to learning it. 

Im stuck in this depression that brings ideations but it’s annoying because i know i wont do it. 

Fear of failure stops me from even trying most things and i get overwhelmed way too easy. 
I have no patience. 

Im a wreck idk where to even begin to put my life back on track

I just deleted all of my social media cutting ties with people who would’ve helped me but all i do is sabotage my future 

I guess what im asking is how do i stop hating myself and get past my past so i can actually do something besides just existing in my narcissistic world of self pity?

I am not a licensed therapist or counsellor.."
674,I don't know where to start on getting my life back together,"Life is hard and lonely right now. I've (F21) been navigating depression for two years now. The good news is that I have some will to change things, I want to feel happy - I want to feel good and in connection with myself. The main issue is, I don't know where to start and that's why I wanted to spread my troubles and thoughts on here, see if anyone has any advice.

In the following I'll state what I think my issues are and the general picture so you guys get the context (if you feel it would be too negative please scroll away):  
Basically, I graduated in early summer and moved back to my home country where I barely have any friends (cut off contact with many due to toxic relationships). A few months later my grandma, my closest caretaker passed away and I decided to move out from my mum's and move in with my grandfather to support him. I haven't had sexual contact or a romantic relationship since early Spring, and I barely see friends now in my home country. Maybe 1 or 2 meets per month. I gained around 15 kilos  (\~30 pounds) in the past year and kind of developed a binge eating disorder, it's not severe but it surely is not healthy. I don't feel good in my body, I am not close to my usual weight and all my clothes don't fit - I basically wear my mum's or my grandma's old clothes (which surprisingly look kinda good, although baggy, but that's not my point here lol). I try to lose weight but I can only do one day of planned eating. I also have no structure in my day, I am supposed to be applying for masters and looking for jobs before uni again but I've only managed to look for job so far.   


So, to conclude my main issues are:  
\- I don't feel good in my body and I am 15kg away from my regular healthy weight, which has an effect on my self confidence  
\- I barely have any social life, including romantic interests (has been going on for a long time, I feel like my youth has been sucked away from me)  
\-  I don't have structure in my day at all, sleep schedule is not stable

\- I don't have peace of mind and my thoughts easily disperse and lead to me to self-sabotage and binge/compare myself to others (deeply irrational I know but it is what it is)  


I don't know where to start, do I make a workout plan? a meal plan? do I spend extra time on finding people to socialize with? do I work on finding a job for the time being or do I dedicate more time to finding a masters? do I learn how to meditate? do I read more? yoga?  


 I'm worried that if I start working on improving all these issues then I'll just give up again. How can I make a sustainable plan to heal and better myself based on what you've read so far? Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I want to overcome this period, I really do. I just don't know where to start."
675,Anyone have time to chat?,"Need someone middle age

Last person who responded was 22 years younger and still living with their parents

Anyone college educated and not offended by someone who is also educated?"
676,Why do I suddenly cry multiple times throughout the day?,"Idk what to call this since I haven't had an official diagnosis yet but I've been spiraling into loneliness for a few weeks now and my mind is filled with so many negative thoughts despite me doing my best to live healthy. I meditate, eat healthy, have enough sleep, and exercise, and yet it doesn't seem to fix my condition. It must be something deeper than physical problems."
677,A message to my mother - burning bridges,[removed]
678,I need to talk to someone but I’m scared,"Being vulnerable is not easy for me and it never has been. I build up walls that take people years to break down. I have dealt with a lot in my life from being in a terribly abusive relationship to dealing with the fact that I have to live my life everyday knowing that someone touched my body without my permission. My mental health is taking a toll to the point where me and my fiancé even had to take a break. I drink to deal with my problems that and then I just end up curled up into a ball crying the next day because I acted like a crazy person. I am filled with other anxiety, I struggle to even look someone in the eyes and have a normal conversation sometimes. If anyone has any advice on how to open yourself up too a counselor or someone who may be able to help, please feel free to share it with me. I need to do this and any help would be appreciated.

679,Every get those times where depression kicks your ass,"I'm on a down, Im strong enough to admit it I guess, well, to online people, the people in my life don't even know I have depression yet around 4 months ago I tried to kill myself and at this point I can't cope"
680,my dad abandoned me because i stayed with my aunt for a day,I got all my stuff from his house just now because my aunt offered to let me stay here. Now I have to find a way to support myself so I’m not a burden on my aunt.
681,When is it time to see a therapist?,"I’m struggling with my mental health recently. Since one month I don’t really feel any joy, even from things that I love doing. I hardly find any motivation to do things like school, hobbies etc. I broke up with my boyfriend recently, partially because I’m feeling like this and don’t want to hurt him with my mood swings/ taking it out on him, but this made me even sadder. I’ve never felt this way before and usually enjoy life, but I don’t have any idea how to get back on track..."
682,Wish I could go back... is this normal?,"Hey guys. I hope you’re all doing well. 


I keep thinking about my time in the psych ward in the hospital (late April of this year) and every little detail. The people I met, the way my room was, the card games we would play in between groups and a meal, the outside time flipping through music stations on a radio, the pancakes I always ordered in the morning, the strawberry-kiwi water, the styrofoam plates... all of it. 

I can’t stop thinking about it. I kind of want to go back and live in those moments. People my age, going through similar things, no outside crap like school or family issues, we didn’t have to wear masks, free meals... I just wish it was forever. 


Is that wrong of me??




I also got a girls email my age and was planning just keeping up with her via email after our discharges. I’m trying to gain a lot of trust and respect with my parents so I told them about it before I did or sent anything. I even showed them a draft of the email I was hoping to send. No addresses or personal info... just hoping to have someone to talk to and support each other on our journeys in life. 

My mom said no... she said she’s older than you and she’s probably been through a lot so hold off on contacting her to give her time to heal... it’s too soon... 

As much as I get that, she said that in late April and it’s mid November and I haven’t brought it up until last night... she still said no. Even after I tried to prove myself by saying I still hadn’t sent the email,  I’m trustworthy let me do this please. In all honesty, I could send the email right now if I wanted... It really sucks though because if I do they will never let it go and they will be so disappointed in me.

And what really sucks is when that girl was getting discharged, she said email me when you get home. She probably thinks I’m some white a-hole. It’s been so long and I don’t even know what to say anymore... I just know I need to reach out. What if she attempted again because I never sent that email? What if it’s all my fault. I have the choice, I’ve *had* the choice, since i left the hospital. 


Idk what to think or feel and I keep thinking about the hospital and the girl and I miss it and her and I really wish I could go back."
683,I think i need help,"Im 22, i should have my whole life ahead of me but in reality i can't even see myself making it through the week. I left my sons dad after 6 years because i was unhappy and in turn made everyone else unhappy. I feel like ive fucked everything up, ive fucked my sons life up, ive fucked my ex's life up. Down to 1 income so my son cant continue the privileged life he's used to. Im struggling so fucking bad, all i wanted was to be happy and now i have no one. At all. No one knows im feeling like this because ive already made everyone so unhappy i don't want to burden them. Im drinking way too much, i have recovering alcoholic parents and im seeing them in myself right now and i hate myself for it. I dont know the point of this post, i just feel like im drowning and need an easy way out. My son and his dad would be better without me."
684,Any counseling suggestion for BPD during Covid?,"I am trapped inside my head, home, guilt, depression, and addiction. 
I check all the boxes for BPD.  I just need to begin seeing someone to diagnose my behavior so I can seek treatment to stop for good.  

I have already posted a confession on my profile.    
I have a love/sex addiction."
685,What’s wrong with me?,"TW: suicide (?) 

Every few months or so I get so overwhelmingly sad to the point that I sometimes contemplate killing myself, the only thing stopping me being the repercussions concerning family etc. But after a few weeks it passes? 
Now I get through it as I know within 2-3 weeks I’ll feel totally fine again but that period really really sucks and tiny things set me off on a self destructive spiral. I cry constantly, unintentionally cause fights with friends and end up feeling really alone. I also end up incredibly overwhelmed with uni work as I have no motivation, and let the bathroom, bedroom get ridiculously messy as I can’t bring myself to clean.  

Any ideas what this is or what causes it"
686,Dealing with rejection (kind of),"Wasn’t really sure how to word this or the flair but honestly just sort of hoping someone’s words will knock sense into me.

Long story short I matched with a girl on tinder and things went well for first few weeks, we met and it was fine, but then lockdown hit (in the UK) and she seemed so distant for the past two weeks, to the point where I spent most day worrying I wasn’t good enough, deep down I knew it was going nowhere but I guess I wanted to just feel love from someone so pretended she was just busy or whatnot. 

Last night we had a chat and decided we wouldn’t really be that compatible if we tried to go further, which I agreed with since lockdown really affected our ability to connect.

Now I know it’s over and the last 3 weeks of worrying that she doesn’t care is over and I should be able to be free but it’s really affecting me and I don’t really know how to get over something that didn’t exist.

Sorry if that rambled on a bit but if anyone’s gone through similar how long was it until you felt normal again and accepted that it wasn’t meant to be anyway/how do I make myself understand that my mental health was trash even when we were trying to make it work"
687,I feel guilty for normal therapy not working,"I don’t know. When I think of therapy i think of actually talking about your issues and working through them.

But I have bipolar disorder and GAD with symptoms of psychosis and disassociation. It turns out talking though my issues didn’t work and wasn’t going too. 

I still do normal therapy where I talk about my issues, but rarely.

I also take meds. 

But recently my therapy has been “training.” I have to practice things like talking to people. I’m also practicing cleaning by being exposed to messes for a long period of time (without being able to change it) and then cleaning them and recording how i did it. There are other times when I have to just do things in mess, like read with dirty laundry everywhere.

(Messes make me really anxious but they are hard to clean because I get almost paralyzed which just makes the mess worse. There are times I have slept in hotels because my apartment was messy and I was too anxious to clean it)

And then there are times when I have to make up scenarios and figure out how to respond. Like maybe the scenario is that I missed a deadline and my boss is mad at me. 

Another thing i have to do is create a daily schedule. Its going slow but I have to say I’ll do things like wake up and brush my teeth then report how difficult my anxiety made it. The goal is to have a daily routine that doesn’t give me anxiety.

These all take a long time and they are frustrating. I’m in therapy almost every other day.  I just wish I could just talk about my childhood or something and have that maje everything better"
688,Burnt Out,"I have made my shear of mistakes.    Like everyone has.    This includes betraying the people close to me.   Something that has been years in the making.     Finally events started to unfold right in front of me for the better.   To be honest there is no way I deserved all that good. 
However I let be &amp; enjoyed it for a little bit of time.   Like most 2020 has been hard.   Had a kid &amp; thought I found love.   She was toxic so I knew it wasn’t going to work.   Yet all I did was seek this love from her.    Then it got bad had to go there was no way around it.    It’s been close to 7 months now.   I have problems with going out or even talking to someone new.   Used to be able to talk to a lady hell I used to have confidence.    After what she did to me I can’t even smile.    I stop doing my stand up comedy along with laughing it’s been a long time now.   She use my child as a weapon to hurt me.  She refuses to let me be in this kids life because I don’t love her.  The thing is I love her but not the way she wants.   This child we shear is so beautiful nothing I say or do can show my love for her.   I struggled with depression for 10 years a few of them with thoughts of suicide.   Even though she is keeping my daughter away I chose to fight back these feelings &amp; thoughts.   Forcing myself to stay positive at times There is this shadow creeping on me.   I named my daughter Rain because she is pure &amp; she washed away every doubt of unhappiness &amp; fear she was my redemption.   A reason to live be better &amp; try harder.  Two months ago while at the store my trailer burned down.   I didn’t leave anything on my neighbors were having a cookout &amp; I guess something got out of hand.   I do not blame them stuff happens.    I lost so much my pictures, clothe, &amp; little things to remind me of people I lost &amp; people I love.   My laptop, Nintendo Switch, &amp; tv.  It was just stuff but it was mine had reason to have it.    Enjoyed it not to mention keeping my self busy was a welcomed distraction.    Guess it was just a distraction from my own thoughts &amp; mistakes.   With the way this year has gone my income has been hit hard no work or anything.   I moved in with my mother &amp; father.   They know what has been going on.   It was a easy move I have nothing.    They have been supporting.    Just I can’t go to them in tell them how I been feeling.  Today has been different I woke up &amp; it’s been just awful thoughts &amp; pain all day.  The worst part is I am so drained &amp; it’s okay.   I have pushed so many people away this year.    There is nobody left to shear with.    So sorry about the long post needed this lifted up a little bit because it’s been getting hard to breathe."
689,writing a title was stressing me out so this is it,"Hi, I’m 20f and am diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety and OCD and I am feeling so lost. 

The pandemic has not been good for my mental health. I’ve been out of a job for most of it and for the little bit of it I was working was extremely stressful due to a shitty boss. Between the never ending doom of 2020, financial stress and getting my meds right it has been a super stressful time. 

But recently life’s been so good. All the things that caused me stress have resolved themselves, I’m no longer in school studying for a degree I didn’t want, I don’t live with my sketchy roommates anymore but with an adoring boyfriend and 2 very cuddly cats, I’m doing better financially than I’ve ever been, I live in a cute apartment, I have time to do the things I love like drawing and reading, the restrictions have lifted so I can see my friends again... everything is good. Except I feel like I’m spiralling. 

I’m feeling the same way I’ve felt before every big breakdown I’ve had. You could ask me why I’m stressed and I honestly couldn’t tell you. I have nothing to be anxious about, I don’t understand why I feel as though my life is falling apart when this is the most put together it’s ever been. 

I talk to my boyfriend about this, and my friend, and my therapist. 3 whole people and I feel like I want to talk to more, that those 3 people aren’t enough but I don’t have anybody else to vent to. 

I’m sure I’ll regret posting this. 
Thank you for reading."
690,"My unusual distractions aren't working and intrusive thoughts are crowding in - I'm confused, scared and slightly numb. Kinda need advice and to know its not just me here (24 M Wales)","I've been trying to keep it together throughout this year. I've had low points before but I'm reaching a very low point now where my distractions aren't working and my intrusive thoughts have an action connected with them which hasn't happened in ages. It scares me cos I don't want to do anything but I also kinda do wanna know the feel of the cold steel of my kitchen knives on my wrists. 

I've been relying on crappy youtube, repeating the same audiobooks (Harry Potter - which I feel guilty about due to the TERF author), and porn. The last of which is not great long term. Even cooking has lost its fun for me. I'm just so done with the sleep badly, work at home, eat, repeat cycle and my instrive thoughts won't butt out.

Any advice or general 'I hear you' might help me now. I'm sorry for asking for attention but I don't know how to do it irl

Peace"
691,"I can't help thinking that my mental issues are actually justifications, and that I'm just a plain, weak person.","Can anyone relate to this ? 

I just feel like I have no reason to suffer. I procrastinate, I cry for no reason, I started to have panick attacks (really minor ones, but still), but I can't accept that this is not my fault. I feel like I JUST have to actually do things, but I can't. And I feel pretty much like a s\*\*t."
692,I trink i might have burnout syndrome but I’m too ashamed to seek help,"Hey redditors! 

The title kinda gives it away- I need help. 
I’m an essential worker and this is all just too much for me. 
I’m working as a team supervisor/ coordinator/ caretaker with disabled people. 
This year was a bummer. Before COVID happened, we took care of a dying client. This was rough. Realtively soon after that first death another client died unexpectedly. 
We couldn’t give a proper goodbye bc of the lockdown and my other clients were locked up for about 4 month. They couldn’t meet anybody except the team of caretakers. This was super hard for all of them. 

Anyway soon after the first lockdown my boss left (she was a gem!) and now I got a new and super useless boss. She’s new to the whole field and just hasn’t a clue (not her fault though!) 

Right now Covid is hitting the team hard and I feel just so overwhelmed with everything. I don’t have a boss to rely on and I feel like I have to handle everything on my own. 

Currently I’m working circa 40h a week but sometimes up to 60. 

Idk I can’t do this anymore. I’m having anxiety and thoughts of self h*rm. 
I cry everyday at work. 

On the other hand I feel like I’m being whiny about this and should just get my shit together. And I’m afraid that I won’t be taken seriously when i ask for help as I’m 20 something and really should just get my shit together :("
693,I could end it tomorrow,"I'm just feeling so lost.

I work 2 jobs, 7 days a week. My next day off will be Xmas day. I need to leave one job; I've been there for 10 years and I can't gain anything else from it. I hate it, hate the way it's going, hate how I'm treated as disposable and I'm having panic attacks before every single shift.

I love my other job, it's my dream job and right now I wouldn't change it for the world. Yesterday I had a breakdown in front of everyone there.

I'm in my head about money. I have poor finances due to my flat flooding, having to pay for my car to be fixed etc. But this job is killing me. I also need to move flat as my landlord has decided he wants to renovate the place and kick everyone out. My mum needs heart surgery, has a brain tumour (no surgery dates for either) and bad mental health. My Dad is physically disabled and I can't go and see them due to Covid. I live on my own and, although I love my own company, I've never felt so alone in my life.

I have bad mental health anyways, I've struggled with manic depression and borderline personality disorder my whole life. Until last month I was self harm free for a couple of years and now I'm doing it frequently. I keep thinking about ending it all and how easy it would be. I've tried talking to a couple of friends, one just completely ignored me and straight up changed the conversation, another just kept sending me inspiration quotes. I keep getting told to look after my mental health, but when I try, I then get asked ""is that the right decision"" and I fall back into depression for the sake of comfort and to stay away from the fear of the unknown. I could keep going on but I don't want to seem like I'm moaning at you all. I know everyone has issues right now and I'm sorry I'm putting my own on you.

I work so damn hard every day and I still can't seem to make ends meet. I'm honestly reaching the end of... Well everything. It just looks so bleak right now. I actually couldn't care less if I ended it tomorrow. I didn't expect to make it past 27. I'm now 28 and honestly wondering what the future holds for me, if anything. I just don't want to ""be"" anymore."
694,How do you remember to take your meds?,"Ive been spiralling in and out of being okay.
I suck at remembering to take my meds, ive tried leaving them next to silverware so I see  them and take them before I eat and another pack besides the xbox, in the snack cupboard. I always seem to  forget i place them where i know ill see them but nothing"
695,I’m planning on quitting my job and I declined a job offer because of my mental health. Are these good decisions?,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old girl straight out of high school. I only gave myself a 2 month break after high school before i started working as an office assistant answering phones and dealing with customers and let me say i HATE my job. The company is going out of business due to poor management and the customers give me hell everyday which makes me want to break down and it’s deteriorating my mental health. My boss told me i have until December to work here before he closes the business. So I started looking for jobs at daycares because i received my CDA in high school and today my old childcare teacher texted me offering me a job that was hiring right away so i declined it because i had already decided to quit my current job to take a month of working on myself and my mental health because for years i’ve had depression and anxiety and it’s gotten worse since i started working here. But i feel guilty and like a failure for the decision i just made of quitting and declining the job offer. I know I’m only 18 and i shouldn’t feel like i have my life figured out but my dad expects me to have a job or go right away to college knowing what i want to do with my life but i don’t. Did i make a bad decision or should i take a month to better myself?"

697,How In the world do you deal with people with mental health issues?,"I have 2 brothers with suicidal tendencies. Both of them have tried to commit suicide once or twice so obviously their mental health is not great. As a 16 year old, I want to know how to deal with that without making myself absolutely stress out (like I have been).

Thank you."
698,Help (nothing to serios dont worry),"Hey I've been struggling to actually accept that I am not ok and i keep telling myself that I am just faking my problems and that i just want attention... I am not really sure how can i do it. I am trying to go to a psiholog but i dont think i woud actually be able to speak wiht one.

699,I need to hide some stuff,"How do I hide depression and forget about ptsd, the ptsd is severe enough to cause flashbacks and mental breakdowns sometimes."
700,(19/M) Quarantine depression/procrastination,"[Repost from another sub] 

So I just started uni this year and we are having online classes. At first it was fine, but then 6 weeks into it, I started to fall into a rut. It doesn't help that when I'm in a rut I watch p*rn (another battle I have trying to fight for years). Now I'm just ""depressed"", I just feel no energy. I can't make myself consistent in attending classes or doing assignments. 

I have tried to counter this. I try to go and have a walk outside for 20-30 minutes. I started a youtube channel, started a website. But my problem is that I just feel lazy and kinda worthless. I try to connect with friends online and play games every other day but it's the human connection that I really need. My friends are usually working or have their own stuff. But idk, I just kinda lost it today. It was mix of feelings of frustration/anger and powerlessness. I just keep spending my day on my phone when I dont have an online class. When I put my phone down, I start daydreaming or start listening to music on my computer when I'm meant to start an assignment.

I just wish I could be in uni, in a class, in that environment. It would be much easier but that's out of my control :(( , any advice?"
701,I need help.,"Recently I’ve been feeling quite sad and not like myself. I find that I’m very unmotivated and don’t find joy in activities that once made me feel better. Everything in my life seems pointless to be around for. 
I feel so drained and tired all the time, I feel like I constantly have a heavy weight on me and I just don’t know how to get rid of the feeling. 
On top of that, I’ve been incredibly anxious all the time. It doesn’t seem like there’s a reason behind any of this which is why it doesn’t make sense to me but my heart rate randomly shoots up and feels like my chest gets really tight and it’s hard to breathe, I also experience nauseousness. My thoughts as well take over and I’ve been having frequent thoughts of suicide. I’ve come to the point where I think I need professional help but I don’t know where to start. Any advice?"
702,I’m honestly just done with life and don’t know what to do.,"I don’t even know where to begin. This is probably going to be a very messy kind of rant, so sorry.   


Every day just seems like a waste honestly. Its just one day closer to death, one day closer to my exams and one day more of absolutely hating myself. I really really hate myself. I feel like I’m failing at every single subject in school, and even when I get a good grade someone else has done better so why can’t I do as good as them? I try really hard at school and revise so much but I still never seem to do as well and all my grades have begun to drop because I just can’t keep working at the pace I was working. Every day I want to cry, I want to cut, and just stay in bed all day doing absolutely nothing. I feel like my friends all hate me, like everyone hates me. I hate me. Why can’t I be good enough instead of being one giant failure? I have panic attacks and self harm all the time and my parents don’t even seem to notice or care. No one seems to notice anymore. And there’s so much to do for school and so little time to do it in, and I just can’t do it anymore I really can’t. Some days I think about killing myself and I would do it but I’m just not strong enough to do that. It’s like every time I think about one bad thing in my life, everything else bad just piles on top and it’s just suffocating me and I can’t breathe anymore and I’m stuck inside it. I don’t want to do anything at all, but then I feel so guilty for not doing anything and it’s obviously my fault that I’m failing at everything but then at the same time I’m trying my absolute hardest. I think I have undiagnosed OCD and it just feels like everything is just falling apart. I spend every day doing the exact same worthless, useless stuff what is the point anymore, I’m basically just living to die  it wouldn’t make any difference when I did. Im just so stuck don’t know what to do."
703,I finally decided to go and talk to my doctor about my mental health the day after tomorrow.,"This message is going to be a little bit all over the place, I can't think straight and my heart is beating like crazy, I'm so sorry. It's going to affect my English skills as well. oh well.. 

I have been gradually feeling worse again over the past few weeks and today I had a low like I hadn't one in a long time.
I'm struggling with my mental health since I was 16, so nearly 8 years now, and while I tried finding help with therapy I never succeeded at that (couldn't find a therapist willing to take me in, but my health insurance company was being a dick when it came to covering the costs anyway).
But after thinking long and hard about it today I, for the very first time, had the thought that my ""normal"" doctor (the one you go to for anything non-specific) could help me too!

My work place is struggling with their employees because a lot of people quit or are sick with mental health issues as well (makes one wonder about the company, really), so I'm still going to work tomorrow (I'm the only one there tomorrow, if I don't show up, we won't be able to open). I plan on texting my boss midway through that I don't feel great and might stay at home the next day so I can go to the doctor and discuss everything. This way, my boss can think about what measures we could take for covering my shift, and I won't feel sooo bad for not showing up the next few days.
The problem is that it's my boss' sisters' birthday tomorrow and I don't want to ruin boss' mood with it. Like, I don't want her to be mad at me for giving her the bad news that I probably will miss for at least a few days. 
Another thing is I finally finished my apprenticeship (is this the right word? ) this year, so I really just started working there for real, and I'm afraid to cause troubles already. We have people in the company who missed for a full year because of mental health and I can not afford to be gone for so long. I'm really scared of the consequences this will cause me. I mean, I'm not super valuable for the company. like I said, I just started. I haven't earned my place yet.

AND THE LAST THING (I promise) is that I know myself well enough to know that I'm right to be scared of not finding the courage to actually tell my doctor what's up. I very well might just tell her I have troubles with my digestive system or something to be able to stay at home for a few days. I know I should be truthful, but what if she doesn't understand me? I don't know. I'm just so damn nervous. I also really don't know what to tell her, to be honest. I mean, do I just say ""hey um Yea I've been a mess since I've been a teenager and I can't take the sadness anymore""? this sounds like something she could think me crazy for.
I want to talk about everything, but I'm afraid she might think I overreact. maybe I do. I don't know.

Did you talk to your doctor about that kind of thing? What did you say, and how?
I'm scared, I guess..

Thanks for listening/reading. Sorry for making this unnecessarily long."
704,"Hai, this is kinda venting, but also kinda asking for some kind words, thanks soooo much to whoever responds","Hai, im Rémi, and, I need some help trying to block out thoughts. My dysphoria recently has been shocking, and I find that it always stems from me fantasizing about getting christmas presents etc, from my parents (getting a skirt-which I really want), accepting me. I'm still in secondary school (high school if you're american) and so I cant live as myself, cant wear the clothing I want have to be dead named, and so on. So, I would like to know how I can go about stopping myself from getting these intrusive thoughts. I do suffer from OCD which has not been diagnosed officially yet, but after meeting with a teacher at my school who knows about mental health issues, they said it was fairly obvious that I do have OCD. Due to no official diagnosis, I cannot receive medication for it. Wasnt sure wether to post this on r/genderfuid or here, so I did both.

708,Can ‘’normal’’ people have manic like episodes?,"Hello! Please don’t misunderstand my question, I don’t believe in the term normal or do i call out bipolar people i simply didn’t know how to put it since English isn’t my first language.

I’m a 21f that suffer from health anxiety, depression, narsistic, histrionic and anti social personalit disorder. I’m kinda stable rn (kinda, u know how it goes) :-)

Sometimes tho, like once a month i feel overly happy like i can conquer the world and never want to give up on life, it bothers me so much it leads to extreme restlessness, i will clean the house, do the dishes run around, where normally i sit in front of my pc most of the time. This gets so annoying that it tickles all over in my body, and my eyes feel wide awake and big, I really don’t know what to do with myself..

Is this something i should bring up, or is it normal for everyone to feel like this once in a while?

712,How to find a psychiatrist/therapist in Massachusetts,"I am new to this. I've never had therapy before, but I feel like I really need someone that can help me challenges I have in my relationship with my wife. I'm not looking for couples therapy. I'm really looking for someone around metrowest Massachusetts that can help me do better dealing with my own emotions, needs and desires. 

I don't know if Im asking the question the right way. But, hoping someone can offer some recomendations"
713,Keep having the urge to run away,"I don't know why.

I've thought baout running away before but not for a specific reason. My home is quite nice and I get on with my parents but recently theres just been a part of me that just wants to run and keep running.

It got me in trouble before because I ran away from the hospital once after a suicide attempt 3 weeks ago and then I tried again the next week when I was in hospital from another attempt.

I don't know why I just want to run. And often the urge comes on suddenly."
714,Is it normal for someone to never stop talking?,"Yea I know..... ""women have the right to talk"".... and all that but I'm asking about a person who simply never stops talking. The only time words aren't coming out her mouth is when she quickly inhales to get the next cacophony out. Its not a conversation, its not even a subject. Its random stuff half of which I wonder if even true. Im a bit worried. 

Can't get a word in. If I do manage a syllable I'm cut off immediately.  And talk about time to leave..... have to be downright rude and walk away because saying ""I have to go"" 20 times yields no result. They just keep talking. The worst part is they are talking at me as if I have any idea what the hell they're yapping about. It never stops. Literally never stops babbling thing after thing after thing...... 

Is this a symptom of mental health failure?"

Even though it's just someone said it and there is no guarantee that it would come true. We don't know? How to stop obsessing about?,"I have read and heard things that were provocative. I started to make up scenarios based on a post I had seen online from someone. I started to imagine things that I started to sound like it's ""instinct"" which is not true. It's just something that I heard and no one knows the future yet. There is a 50% chance for each outcome. How do I strongly build on my own thoughts than obsess and fill on the gap something that I had only seen and heard from outside?

Thank you"

717,"I'm starting sexual assault therapy on Saturday and I'm absolutely terrified, can anyone give me support/advice/a hug please xx","*content warnings sexual assaults, child sexual assaults, rape?, suicide attempts, depression

I (F28) was sexually abused as a pre teen /teenager by an adult. It went on for multiple years and I repressed it for a long time, when it finally flooded back I called the police but they couldn't do anything.

At 14 I dated a 16 year old guy who pinned me to a  couch and ripped my clothes telling me ""I don't care if you're not ready, you're my girlfriend and this is what couples do"" thankfully I ran out of there to a freinds house nearby and she leant me some clothes.

At 15 I dated another guy who i had been doing sexual acts with but I told him I didn't want to have full on sex. One night he told me he wanted to tie me up and tease me. I liked the idea until he had me tied and told me ""this is my chance to f**k you whether you like it or not"". He pulled off my underwear and grabbed a condom from a drawer. I started screaming and his dad ran up the stairs. He stalked me for a few years after that and had a female friend try to intimidate me and engage me in a fight. Thankfully I had many friends to protect me.


I lost my virginity at 16 (with consent at first) to a 23 year old guy who liked to do things rough, but didn't warn me before hand, even though he knew it was my first time, I asked him to slow down and stop but he wouldn't. I ended up bleeding for a week afterwards. (He also turned out to be a murderer and was cheating on me with my 13 year old cousin)

I was sexually assaulted in university by my freinds flatmate who dragged me into his room and assaulted me with his hands, he tried to pin me to the bed but thankfully I wriggled free, ran out the door and got myself home. I called the police but he was released the same night without charges.

And more recently (last year) I worked as an escort due to my physical disabilities making it impossible to find employment and two of my clients refused to stop or slow down when I was in severe pain, one of them left me bleeding for a few days. Thankfully my now husband took on my bills so I didn't need to endanger myself anymore.

This has all affected me psychologically for a long time, I became hypersexual from a young age, I've had hundreds of sexual partners (not even including my escort work), I had slept with over 100 men and 50 women by the time I was 20 and attempted suicide twice due to my severe lack of self worth, depression and anxiety. I had some counseling as a teen but never mentioned any of the assaults, because due to being a minor the counselor told my parents everything I disclosed. 

I start therapy for this on Saturday and I'm terrified, I've never trusted mental health professionals due to watching a family member get sectioned for 18 months against their will, (after going in volunterily) due to lies told by other family members. And after my suicide attempt my mum tried to have me sectioned, so I lied and said my attempt was unplanned. And finally the last time I tried to get help I lost custody of my youngest son for a year and was only allowed supervised visitation. So yeah I'm scared out of my wits!

 Please give me some advice to get through this, every time I try to talk about my issues to a professional it brings everything to the forefront of my mind and I become increasingly depressed and suicidal and I'm so scared. Xx

P.s please be kind and don't share this anywhere"

719,My boyfriend’s depression is getting really bad,"He’s had depression his whole life, and it’s gotten really bad here recently. My darling and I are both in high school, and neither of us can drive. Due to COVID, we don’t see each other. (He’s doing school in person, I’m online)

I noticed a few weeks ago that he stopped telling me goodnight, and was just generally talking less. I asked him about it and he said that his depression was acting up, but that was all. I didn’t want to press too hard so I let it go.

He kept talking to me less and less, so I asked him again tonight. I didn’t know it had gotten that bad. He’s normally very social, but he said that he’s just been hiding in his bedroom recently, that he’s struggling with school (not grade wise, but being around people like that). He’s turned off notifications on his phone so that he doesn’t feel pressured to talk to anyone. He said that he’s even stopped playing his Nintendo Switch because he doesn’t want people to see that he’s online and try to talk to him. He does have a therapist that he sees bi-weekly, and he says that he thinks it’s helping.

I told him that I just want him to feel okay. I told him to just tell me if he feels like he can’t talk, because I want to respect that he feels drained a lot. I asked if there was anything he could think of that I could do, but he said he can’t think of anything I could do to help.

I just want to know if any of you have any ideas as to how to help him. I’ve been depressed before, but it’s not a lifelong thing for me, like it is for him. I also want to know how I cope with this and better be there for him. I have anxiety, and this has really made it flair up.

How do I help him, and how do I help myself?"
720,Why do I feel worthless so easily?,"I've been playing games with my dearest friend, it was all good but I started making mistakes and we kept dying pretty often, he started getting mad and I understood that but at the same time I was feeling that I got hurt by just the change of the attitude and I was trying hard to help us both. At one place he told me to stay away and not involve, I didn't say anything but felt really bad, so I just stood there in a safe place. He was also mad that I allegedly didn't help him whenever he was fighting with a guy who attacked him first, even though I was running after them and sometimes got stuck by the monsters.

As you can see these are so simple things, people could say irrelevant but it just made me so sad and empty. I feel really bad right now, it just helps me realise how bad I am and how I suck everywhere I go, and even if I try and do my best it comes out terribly. And I can't do anything about it but I hate it and myself too. Sorry, maybe it's not even a question but I just needed someone to talk to, I'm kinda tired of botting such emotions up haha"
721,"First time posting, but i need a little help.","So i'm considering if i should see a doctor.

I have for the last couple of years been struggeling, my dads death anxiety from abusive work collegues.
I have on and off for the last year been experiencing ""brain fog"" and have been feeling down.

I'm going over and over in my head what feeling happy really feels like, and if me not feeling emotions is just the new ""normal""

I just can't fiqure out by myself if i should seek help.

723,What to expect seeing a therapist for the first time,"Hey everyone,
I’m going to be seeing a therapist for the first time, and for some reason I’m just kind of nervous and not sure what to expect. I’m 28, already been seeing a psychiatrist for about a year, and am diagnosed with depression. I’m taking currently Zoloft and abilify, and she thinks I may also have BPD or bipolar. Anyone else with similar issues have any input on how well therapy worked for you, what kind of therapy it was, how long you went, what to expect, etc?"

726,"I‘ve finally reached my breaking point, and this is my last attempt in finding some support.","I’m just going to get straight to the point. I’m a 29-year-old female who has dealt with depression my entire life. I’ve had my fair share of trauma, heartbreak, and everything in between. The main problem I seem to find myself in is that I cannot seem to keep a good support system around me. I need friends.  I need people that I can talk to to help work out the situation that I have found myself in. I’ve been spiraling out of control for a while now. I have thought of suicide often throughout my lifetime, but over the last couple of weeks, has finally hit my breaking point to the point where it’s all I can think about. Every moment that I am alone I think about ways that I could do it that would be less less traumatic to people in my life. If I wasn’t such a coward, I would’ve already done it by now. I just can’t take all of the pain anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t know how to fix it. I’ve struggled to find a therapist And I just don’t know what else to do anymore. I don’t know if I can even make it through the week.. so, if anyone is interested in reaching out, send me a message.."

Unfortunately to some people it looks like I’m on drugs half the time or just in a daze, and yes while I should work to stay present, it’s not my natural go to haha. 

Anyone else like this? I know I’m smart, but when people underestimate you and think you’re stupid because you’re spacing out all the time it hurts your self esteem."
729,My depression and eating disorder are coming back,"I used to be very depressed and suicidal. I also suffered from body dismorphia and eating disorders. I hated mirrors and thought I was hideously fat and starved my self. I have been better for a few years now. I'm 16. And female. I forgot to mention sry. Anyways. I've gained a bit of the wieght that I lost back and that's ok. All bodies are beautiful and so is mine. I'm 5'4"" and abt 145. Normal. Avg. I felt confident. But then I started feeling depressed really bad again. With all of the lack of sleep and motivation that comes with it. And now I don't want to eat. Just the thought of eating a meal makes my jaw lock up I get nauseous. Idk what to do. I won't attempt again tho. No matter how bad it gets. But I feel as if I'm fat and should loose weight. Even tho I know I don't. I know I'm fine the way I am. I know I should eat. But I don't feel any of those things. Ya know? Anyways. I just thoughtid say something. Even if its just to the one person that will see this in New."
730,i feel so empty and alone lately,"i dont think ive talked to an actual person outside of my household in months. reaching out for help is so hard but noone ever messages me anymore and i cant exactly go to someone i havent said a word to in months and start talking about everything on my mind. i keep wanting to try and make some new friends but its all so hard when you dont have energy for anything, conversations fizzle out and evrrything just ends up quiet again. i dont like being alone but i cant get myself out of this im so tired"
731,I feel like I don't try my best because I'm afraid to fail.,"*Not sure MentalHealth is the best r/ for this*
I feel like I can't let myself do my best or use my full potential at many things. I hold myself back, avoiding things that are more my level of challenge and opting for ones below it. It's like it's bottled up inside, I want to let it out, I can feel it in there but it's too scary to let it out for some reason, like maybe I'm afraid to ""fail"" or perform less than what I thought I'd do, and that it'd be too much for me to bare so I'd give up. Honestly I think those are the biggest reasons I have this problem. I know that if I don't do as well or don't achieve what I'd hoped for, I can learn, improve, try again, etc. But I often can't get myself to anyways, or don't realize how well I'm doing to get closer to my goal. So often I just don't try at all in the first place. Maybe it's like a low self-esteem thing or something like that. I have been working against this lately, using drawing. I'm very talented at it, been told so my entire life, but for the reasons above, along with other reasons linked to mental health issues, I almost stopped drawing completely for years (it got harder and harder since I was a kid, and hit it's hardest when I reached the end of high school, where I almost totally stopped). I love drawing, it hurt me immensely when I it became too difficult (I remember I dropped my head onto my desk crying). Now I'm trying again, trying to practice things I was afraid to practice, afraid to draw, and trying to push back against the things in my head that drag me down when I try to."
732,In a rut,"I moved away from home about 4 months ago for college, and well I love it here, but I have been battling pretty bad swings of depression and anxiety, it makes me criticize everything about myself and it’s exhausting. I thought it was getting better since I left my home town but I just feel drained and tired and done. I get everything done that I need too, and I’m just completely done with the day by 6pm I just want to shut down and not be near anyone. I’m in therapy and have been for a year now, but I just thought I’d reach out and see if anyone had any coping mechanisms. I’m an artist in art school so I already do a lot of creative stuff. But any support or anything would be nice, I just feel really alone and tired"
733,Need help recovering memories.,"Ok, I've been having weird flashbacks for years about something I don't consciously recall happening with that person, but they still keep coming and with the therapy process they've become more frequent. When I get them, I feel terrible, I feel desperate to get out of there, I can feel him on top of me and I get tons of images and sensations that make me feel really uneasy, sometimes I can kind of like hear the way he breathes, I feel like I even freeze for a while when I get them (more often than not). I must say, I had a few really uncomfortable moments that I do remember clearly with that person, and well, he clearly sexually assaulted me once, I even posted about it here on Reddit and well, I was a bit confused about it being actual sexual assault and it was for sure. But I fear there's a lot more to it than what I can clearly remember, and I feel like I need and want to know what truly happened there, I think it'll help me keep on processing and working and understanding my trauma and my responses, but I'm scared... I don't want to harm or mess up in any way my healing process, but I feel like I need my memories to really be able to process my trauma and fully heal one day, otherwise I think those images and sensations are gonna keep on haunting me forever because I don't really understand why I'm getting them and where they're coming from, if they're part of that event I remember when he sexually assaulted me or if he did that multiple times or if he raped me and I can't  remember, I don't know, I hope I don't sound crazy, this is just really blurry, overwhelming and confusing.

Can someone please give me some advice on things I can do to retrieve memories in a healthy way?"
734,I’m terrible at talking,"So I’ve been having a problem recently where I can talk well, it’s not the usual inability to think of something to say, I just forget what I’m talking about, don’t hear things a lot of the time, and I have a really hard time staying focused and making realizations through connecting certain key points in conversation"

Talked to my therapist about that dissociative episode, she recommended I get a psychological evaluation. I'm not against it whatsoever, but I don't know much about it. Anyone who knows anything about psychological evaluations, what are they like?"
736,Does anyone else experience a “shift in perception” in their life regularly?,"So about every 1 or 2 months, I have episodes where my perception of my life shifts. I feel like I have just “woken up” and I finally start to see how my life and how I am in reality. I see myself as the ugly person I am, i see my relationships as not as great as I thought they were etc. I almost start noticing myself from a third person perspective, noticing all the things about myself that I dislike. I wish I could explain more but it’s so hard to pinpoint the feelings. And then after a couple of days, I feel okay again and I don’t focus too much on it. and then the cycle repeats itself."
737,Book or YouTube video recommendations?,"Hey guys!
Wondering if anyone has book or video recommendations relating to mental health- like educational psychology books/videos that help to understand the brain, tackling depression, figuring out you passions, borderline personality disorder, or just anything that’s helped you with depression/bipolar/BPD or just finding your purpose in life. My psychiatrist recommended Mind Over Mood so I’m starting with that. I’m also interested in journals/workbooks if you have one you’ve enjoyed. I’m definitely looking to learn. Thanks in advance."
738,I had a weird episode and I can’t figure out why.,"About a year ago, my mate introduced me to two boys. One she had a crush on, and one she was intent on setting me up with. Me and this guy dated for about 8 months before I ended it as I just didn’t like him, although he was a decent guy (Not really relevant, but hey).

I’m generally kind of an awkward person. I don’t really know how to social but I’m getting better at it, and I don’t consider myself to have social anxiety anymore. But this day, a year ago, it was really weird.

From the moment I met these boys, something weird kicked in. I started acting weird (as in super weird- like climbing trees unprompted and saying things I couldn’t control (nothing rude)) and I knew it but I couldn’t stop it. At the end of the day, my mate and I were walking home and she said it was like I was an entirely different person. 

My boyfriend later commented on this day and said (I was asking for advice) that I should tone it down with people I meet. (He didn’t mean this in a mean way at all, just to clarify).

Idk if it was a dissociative state, but I certainly couldn’t control myself. It isn’t a matter of self esteem either. For a short while, I wondered if it was ADHD, but I’m not a doctor (obviously aha) and I don’t really think I relate to any of the common symptoms.

Anyone had this sort of episode and know what it was? tysm!"
739,Help with Aripiprazole,"I'm currently taking Aripiprazole for mi OCD since 9 days and it makes me sleepy all day. I'm really frustrated because although it's bearable, it is very annoying and really prevents me from carrying out my daily routine. Will it eventually get better? Any advice?"
740,My OCD is causing more problems for others than it is to me,"Hey all, first time posting here.

About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, and the (tics? I don’t know what the proper term is) are the typical ones that include germophobia, extreme hand washing, not touching the ground, repetitive checking and stuff like that. It’s become such a normal thing for me that washing my hands 10 times a day plus sanitising is considered normal in my world.

However this is not the case with my family and to an extent my friends. My mother believes the reasons I don’t like touching her or her belongings is because of her; absolutely not the case. The stupid beliefs I have in my head are something like “her handbag touched the ground, and then she touched it and she hasn’t washed her hands, so it will affect me”. The typical ridiculous logic that to everyone else isn’t a problem. She can get quite upset because she believes that I don’t want to hug her or anything like that. Not true at all. 

I’ve been on medication for 4 years and see a therapist every 5 months but it doesn’t seem to do anything to help. I feel like I’m a nuisance to others when I have to hang back to check my locker is closed at school or my laptop is fully shut down at night. 

Sorry for the rant, just needed somewhere to vent."

742,I'm so tired of everything,"I honestly don't even know what I'm doing anymore. Everyday seems so pointless. I know what's expected of me to do but at this point I couldn't care less if what's expected of me. I just want run away from it all and never look back. To be honest the only thing that's stopping me from doing that is the fear of what happens after I leave, but I feel like soon I'm going to get to the point of just doing it because of how much I hate everything around me. I hate all the lies, all the broken promises, and how everyone so caught up with them selves that they can't see what's going on around them. I hate how I'm supposed to be this amazing person that's always happy and always knows everything. I hate how they just gloss over me like they think I know how to fix myself, that I'm responsible enough to trust myself. I hate how they always ""forget"" that I'm not as strong as they think I am. I hate how it's so easy for them to not care. I just want to know what's wrong with me. Why can't I just be like everyone else? Why can't I be happy like them, instead of hating everything about myself wishing I could change it all. Why did it have to be like this?

744,I've lost interest in Everything.,"Hello there,

I'm a 26 year old male and I'm writing this because I've lost interest in everything. I'd like to clarify I'm not suicidal.

This whole COVID shindig has given me pause to think.

What has happened to over the years? I used to have passion and fire. Since I've turned 24 I hate going to work, I hate getting out of bed I hate doing ANYTHING.

Even the things I once enjoyed like playing video games bore me. I'm content to listen to Spotify and stare blindly at my phone hoping something will happen to make life better.

I cant concentrate for more than 10 minutes anymore I lose interest so quickly. I feel so unfulfilled.

I just feel like I'm existing for the sake of it... aimless, purposeless and directionless content to let the winds of life and fate steer me wherever.

Is there anyone else out there like this? What did you do to get better? What is wrong with me?"
745,"Ghosted on by my friends, in college (22, F)","So, I'm in college. I have about one more semester until I'm done. I'm in a super intense and stressful major. Tons of work and studying, my brain is over it.

I'm a bit introverted.

I used to have a really cool group of friends at the start of school, and we did everything together! We studied and bonded and had many good times together. I loved having them as friends.

Over time though, things began to become weird and I felt strange around my friends. Sometimes my minor efforts would be ignored, things I said didn't make any difference sometimes... It just seemed like they were much closer with each other than with me.

At times I just felt invisible to them.

Despite all that, I kept hanging out with them because I genuinely wanted the friendship and I truly did care for my friends. I can't lie, it always felt forced, but I still tried.

I'd show up to every study session, drive far to meet them at places, stay out late with them (even when I wanted to be home or do something else), and tried my best to converse with them. At the end of the day, these were the only people in the program who knew me and I felt comfortable speaking to.

THEN, they pretty much just stopped talking to me altogether after COVID came. We only speak when we are assigned on group assignments but that's it. I study TONS of material that we all used to split up all on my own now, and my stress levels are much higher because of that as well.

I know they have a separate group chat, they hang out with each other, do everything we all used to do, minus me.

It sucks and it hurts and most of all, I feel absolutely ALONE in the program we're in. Being that I'm more of an introvert, those were the only friends I had. Now I feel as if I have no one. It affects me so much to the point that I cry during exams or whenever I see them (my mask covers my tears)

I've also noticed that due to my loss of friends, I've gotten a bit more reckless in my dating habits and have been jumping from man to man a lot, and I feel like its in an effort to get over my friends.. is that strange? (I recently met someone really nice and stable though)

I also found a job recently that helps me feel better and distracts me, and I have a loving family, but still.

I only really have one more semester until school is done, so that is my light at the end of the tunnel. but honestly the situation just sucks and I don't know how to get myself out of this dump. My mental health is shit, my self esteem is very low, and I am so so so sad.

How do I cope better? Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR; After the pandemic, I was ghosted on by a solid group of friends in my program. We were quite close in the beginning of the program. Now we barely talk unless we need to. Takes a toll on me a lot."

I can’t really help it and it usually happens when I’m listening to music or watching a show and it helps me imagine things that aren’t always related to something I’m doing but it’s always really exciting and relieving to do, even if I feel tired after I’ll still do it whenever I get the urge (run on sentence :( ). It’s almost exactly like [this person described](https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/i-have-an-urge-to-jump-and-run-around.108445/).  I also get really annoyed at little things when I can’t jump for whatever reason, and I snap at people unfortunately.

753,Confused brain,Last night I was watching a video and I was thinking about what they were talking about in my head and instead of forming a full sentence in my brain it felt like it shut off for about a minute and the only words that I could hear we’re brain no work. I felt very confused after I began to have more thoughts come into my brain because I have never experienced something to the point where my brain literally shut down and could not find words to say. It had nothing to do with my interest in the video it was as if I all of a sudden just couldn’t make words in my head. And it keeps happening ever since last night. I hope this makes sense to someone and they can explain what this means
754,Is it time to seek professional help?,"Hi, I’ve been feeling a bit off lately, not myself. I’ve never been a super energized person and usually I’m laid back and collected, but I feel as though it’s been taken to a whole other extreme lately. A few months back I started having stomach issues and haven’t been able to resolve them, and I believe them to be connected to some sort of anxiety I’m having about basically everything. I started dating a girl that I had been waiting to date for about a year around the same time the stomach issues started - there were a lot of different things that got in the way of us starting to date since we met - and I just thought that I was having a bit of diet issues, though that notion soon left from my head. You see, the girl I started dating has some mental problems of her own and I thought that because of them, in some roundabout way, they would end up stopping us from being able to be together, because they had before. This became a regular occurrence, me being full of the impending doom of our relationship, which led me to stress over it and give the whole situation way too much attention, leading me to have incredibly bad relationship anxiety. About a month ago I broke it off with her because I had come to a point where I was going into a depression and I believe that I began self-sabotaging because of it. I also haven’t had much experience in relationships, with this being the only one that I’ve ever truly wanted to be in and cared that much about, with all my others being quick flings. Now that she’s not in my life anymore I find myself missing her time to time and regretting what I did, and now I’m in even more of a hole than before because I can’t find a way out of the maze that is in my head. I’ve talked to her about it a little bit, trying to explain what I’m going through, but obviously I don’t want to hurt her anymore than I already have by continuing to communicate instead of letting her deal with it on her own, though she’s been very understanding because we’ve been in similar situations before with the roles reversed. At this point I’m trying to decide if I should go back to her or spare her from myself, because I know that when my head is at a good place and I’m happy I really would like to be with her, but lately my head usually isn’t at that good place and I’m usually drained of energy and can’t find anything pleasurable, especially other people. 


Another part of this is that I remember times when I’ve felt similar to this throughout my life, this is just the worst it’s been. I’ve always worried about things, especially with other people, to the point of my stomach not feeling good and me coming to be sick. I’m thinking that I may have some type of undiagnosed anxiety disorder, but obviously it isn’t easy to admit to yourself that you need help sometimes, especially since I have never needed it before. I’m hoping that someone can give some type of insight on what I should do, because I really don’t know at this point. 

Also I just want to add this, I don’t plan on hurting myself, I never had that intention and I never will. I’m hoping that I can find some type of light at the end of the tunnel because I know what happiness feels like, and this definitely ain’t it. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope that someone can offer some advice."
755,I got a semicolon tattoo 2.5 years ago to celebrate three years of not self harming. I relapsed this month and now I want it gone.,"A couple years ago I was in a good place emotionally. I got a tattoo to celebrate three years clean from self harm. I used to love it. I got it on my wrist, it's the classic butterfly semicolon.

I've been going through some super heavy stuff in my long term (5 years) relationship and in a recent argument some very hurtful things were said, and I finally broke.

It's been a hard yesr. I'm embarrassed, ashamed, and disgusted with myself. Seeing this tattoo makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like a fake. I want it gone so badly.

My partner keeps trying to talk me out of getting it removed. He has good intentions, but I don't think he understands the weight of what he said that night, and how badly it hurts to have this still knowing that it's nothing more than an empty promise to myself now.

I don't know what to do. Somebody please say something to make me love myself again. I have so much self-hatred right now it's ridiculous."
756,Anxiety TW : s**cide,"I have bad social anxiety. It’s mostly related to body image, but being embarrassed in any way is my absolute biggest fear. If something is said to make me embarrassed/insecure, I will physically cringe and my brain is filled with “I’m gonna kill myself I’m gonna kill myself I’m gonna kill myself l’m gonna kill myself” to the point it’s interfering with day to day activities. I’ll also think about embarrassing things from the past and think terrible, self depreciating thoughts. My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to think medication will help. Does anybody have tips or tricks to alleviate this? How to turn my brain of when I’m anxious. I will be seeing a therapist eventually, but I need something to help me until then.

TLDR : Social anxiety, how to stop self depreciating thoughts?"
757,I just got back my results from my psychological testing... Results indicate that I may have borderline personality disorder - unsure of what to do with this information,"So I am 23 years old and have always struggled with my mental health in some capacity. My mother has never been supportive of me getting help, unless she suggested it. And now to this day, is not very supportive. At 18, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression and have been medicated for both since. 

I requested to be tested for Adult ADHD earlier this month. My mother said, ""What if they say you don't have it, and just say you're f\*cking crazy instead? What will you do?"" Well, I thought that was going to happen. I went through my entire undergrad struggling and I'm now in grad school and feel overwhelmed with my coursework. I had always suspected it, so it was nice to know that my suspicions were confirmed. While I was assessed for ADHD, the psychologist ran other assessments. I have been diagnosed Adult ADHD, Dysthymia, and an Anxiety Disorder. However, some of my results also indicated that it was very likely that I also have borderline personality disorder as well.

This is also something that I have suspected in myself for a long, long time. As a psychology major, of course I always wonder if something I am studying applies to me. I am also known to be a hypochondriac (but is it hypochondria when I am right 9 times out of 10...?). 

I am unsure of what to do with this information. The psychologist made no mention of it. I talked to my mother about it, since she works in the medical field. She said it made sense. But, ""back in my day that was just called being an asshole. Now everything is a personality disorder."" I am medicated for depression and I really do not find therapy is beneficial to me. So I am unsure of what to do. Everyone can benefit from therapy, sure, but should I seek therapy for this? 

I guess this is just me venting. I am very frustrated. My mother and I have a strained relationship where we go through phases of being best friends and hating each other (I have always wondered if she has undiagnosed mental disorders as well). I still live at home because I am in school and cannot afford to move out. 

I wanted to feel relieved with this information, but now I just feel even more frustrated."
758,I’m waiting for an assesment with a psychiatrist - what should I do in the meantime?,"I (23F) think i have ADHD and was just misdiagnosed as bipolar. I didn’t say I think I have adhd just that I didn’t think my bipolar diagnosis was accurate and I wanted to be re-assessed.

I kind of feel like when I realized my life isn’t supposed to be as hard as it is it got even harder to deal with.
So emotionally I’m doing worse now.
My assesment isn’t until the second week of December.
I don’t know what to do in the meantime. My chores are never done. I’m having a hard time with work attendance which I always have, my emotions are all over the place, I get up at 4am or 4:39 am and am still leaving my apartment in a rush for work at 8am.

I’m always impatient and anxious, I’m pretty angry or depressed a lot of the time. I’m just so not doing great. I tried to self medicate with diet pills today for the adhd stuff and it worked. But I have none left and I just feel like I can’t keep living like this now at this point. I’m an adult and I have no safety net if it does fall apart. If they think I do have adhd I want to be medicated for it because I feel like I’ve done everything to cope and it hasn’t been enough."
759,"I am lost, broken, and don't see the light.",Not sure why I am posting. Maybe I just need to say it since I have no one to talk to. I recently found out that my wife is having an affair. She has a son that I help raise. I love them both dearly. This has shaken me down to my very core. Each day it feels worse and worse and I just want it to end. I'm not sure what to do at all. I haven't confronted her yet because I have barely had the strength to get through the day. My step son's father had abandoned him for a few years back and only recently came back into the picture. This would destroy him just as much as it is destroying me. I have spoken with people who asked if it was okay because I look like I am going to cry any second. I wish this never happened. I am so fucking lost that I don't see the end of this.
760,...I don’t know anymore. Thoughts and memories of the hospital keep flooding my head,"Hey guys. I hope you’re all doing well. 


I keep thinking about my time in the psych ward in the hospital (late April of this year) and every little detail. The people I met, the way my room was, the card games we would play in between groups and a meal, the outside time flipping through music stations on a radio, the pancakes I always ordered in the morning, the strawberry-kiwi water, the styrofoam plates... all of it. 

I can’t stop thinking about it. I kind of want to go back and live in those moments. People my age, going through similar things, no outside crap like school or family issues, we didn’t have to wear masks, free meals... I just wish it was forever. 


Is that wrong of me??




I also got a girls email my age and was planning just keeping up with her via email after our discharges. I’m trying to gain a lot of trust and respect with my parents so I told them about it before I did or sent anything. I even showed them a draft of the email I was hoping to send. No addresses or personal info... just hoping to have someone to talk to and support each other on our journeys in life. 

My mom said no... she said she’s older than you and she’s probably been through a lot so hold off on contacting her to give her time to heal... it’s too soon... 

As much as I get that, she said that in late April and it’s mid November and I haven’t brought it up until last night... she still said no. Even after I tried to prove myself by saying I still hadn’t sent the email,  I’m trustworthy let me do this please. In all honesty, I could send the email right now if I wanted... It really sucks though because if I do they will never let it go and they will be so disappointed in me.

And what really sucks is when that girl was getting discharged, she said email me when you get home. She probably thinks I’m some white a-hole. It’s been so long and I don’t even know what to say anymore... I just know I need to reach out. What if she attempted again because I never sent that email? What if it’s all my fault. I have the choice, I’ve *had* the choice, since i left the hospital."
761,Who is dealing with mental health issues alone??,"Listen...I'm a licensed Social Worker who has been in the mental health field for many years.

762,I feel stuck,"I’m a senior in high school and I just feel like I’m living day by day without any reason. I have friends but I barely spend any time with them because they don’t invite me to hangout. I just watch anime all day and play shitty video games but I have no interest in doing anything else. I want to start getting more active and working out but can’t even bring myself to care enough and just tell myself I will start some other time. Im not even sure what I’m really looking for with this post. 

Anyone experience something similar? Have any advice?"
763,Struggling with brain fog for 10 years now.,"I think that it all started when I was 15 years old where I played a lot of mmorpg games. I had to check on shops, and had open chat with dozens of people at once. It felt like I am forcing myself to level up and I had pretty good memory about everything what I was doing and suddenly something happened what I've figured out was a brain fog. I am 25 years old and I never recovered from it. It made me feel sad/depressed/anxious/weird and a lot of more.

I started to drink and smoke weed occasionally and when I was 18 I started to consume much more weed and alcohol than I did before but it was just a beginning. We started to party with mdma and few times I've tried  psychedelics. I've developed tinnitus and I am not sure if I was 18 or 19 where it started but I had it since and it never went away.

 My recalling skills are really bad, I tend to forget a movie I just saw or conversation i just had too often. I really feel like I am brain damaged for life and I can't do anything about it. Sometimes it's like I  can't recall a TV show I just saw because my brain feels foggy and it felt like that in last 10 years, but if I solve a quiz where I can choose which answer is correct  I'm not having a problem at all with solving it.

It's like I can't remember names from tv show, but if someone came up with different random names until the real one came up I'd imeddiately know which answer is right without hesitating.

I had really good memory before and because it's gone i didn't felt myself in really long time. It was a long journey with brain fog which probably will continue for the rest of my life but I still have faith in finding a way to get my clear mind back.

I feel like it's difficult to find someone who can understand what I am going through who can guide me on what can I try to do to see if there is still hope. I tried to eat healthy /exercise and being sober for months but it never helped. If there is anyone who can help me out please let me know, I've talked with doctors/psychologists /psychiatrists and no one ever could help me out."

765,What should I know before going to a doctor about mental health?,"Tw: mentions of suicide and self harm 

Back on Saturday I finally told my mom about what I have been going thorough and she scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician for tomorrow. What should I know before going to a doctor about mental health and what will a primary care physician do? Will they actually diagnose me with anything and prescribe medicine or will they just refer me to a psychiatrist? 

If they will diagnose me, how does that even work? I suspect I have depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety (and my mom who’s a psychiatrist says the same) but how are these things determined? 

In addition, should I tell them about self harm or suicidal thoughts? I’ve been cutting and I’ve also thought a lot about suicide, but is it unwise to tell them since I’ll just get sent to the hospital? Or should I tell the truth? Anything else I should know before going?

Thanks for any answers :)

Oh and edit: what is the policy on confidentiality if I’m 17? Will they tell my mom about stuff I say it only if I’m a danger to myself? They also happen to be my moms best friend and closest colleague so I’m worried that they will tell my mom about stuff..."
766,is it depression making me lose interest in my partner?,"I don't know if it's me losing interest, or depression is making me feel this way. One minute I love him so much, one minute I don't even want to talk to him. We are still in the early stage so I am very confused by my feelings now."

768,What is the process of getting an Emotional Support Animal?,"For context: I have served as a puppy raiser for a national assistance dog organization for over 4 years, so I am already extremely involved in the assistance animal world. I am very familiar with the ADA, as well as assistance animal rights and the difference between a service dog vs an emotional support animal.

However, the vast majority of my experience comes from the service dog side of things; I am unfamiliar with the process of getting an ESA.

I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and an adjustment disorder with anxiety this semester, and I think that I may strongly benefit from bringing my small (very calm, very well-mannered) dog up to college to live with me. I have both a mental health nurse practitioner and a counselor/therapist that I stay in contact with regularly - would either of them be able to provide my ESA note? What is the most common channel to go through in getting approval for an ESA?

Note: \*\* I do know that there is no official ""registration"" for ESAs.\*\*"
769,"I don’t mean to overshadow others, but I’m feeling INSANELY happy for absolutely no reason it seems. Thoughts?","- some factors: my social life has been improving recently and I’m sure that brings me some happiness, but I wouldn’t think this much. This jolt of happiness arose last night listening to music and I just couldn’t stop dancing, it died down during the day today. Today was a pretty bad day overall compared the rest of my recent weeks which have overall been great. I’ve lost a lot of weight and am proud of that, but again, I never thought this much happiness would arise from it.

-again, today was pretty bad, had an argument, embarrassed myself in class, etc, but suddenly when I got home the happiness shot through me like a lightning bolt, multiple times as strong as last night
-I’ve suddenly fell in love with a girl in my class that I’ve never even spoken to a few hours ago. 

- is this happiness just natural from how my life overall has improved and I’m just not used to it? Is it just a teenager thing with hormones? Is it a chemical imbalance opposite the likes of depression? Would that he Mania?

- Not knowing much about mental health id love thoughts from others. Thank you for anyone who responds, I appreciate it.

TLDR; Im suddenly the happiest I’ve ever been with no clear reason and I find myself falling in love with a classmate I’ve never spoken to. Should I be worried?"
770,Got a ton of things on my back,"At this point this is required for me, I have so much on me that I need to get out of the way, reddit is my safe space because there’s a ton of people who can help me and stuff, my parents are nice to me but it’s just awkward for me to let it all out to them, I love them so much but I don’t really like venting to them, same with friends, I like them but I don’t really feel comfortable around them talking about this, because I don’t have many people I can vent to, its mainly female I trust because they actually help me a lot, my guy group I just don’t feel like venting to them except for one guy who I trust deeply, but reddit is a safe place as I said before. But there is so much on me because of school and my “social” life. Sometimes I wish I was back into elementary where I could be decently happy with my stuff, being a freshman is hard for me already because I always been introverted, and the person who I feel comfortable venting through is going through a hard time right now, it’s because her dumb ass ex ruined her life through drugs and she’s kicked out of her house, and my other peeps I vent to don’t know how to respond, and my school situation is worse, I don’t have a girlfriend to vent to and actually trust because I can barely trust anyone, it’s honestly so hard for me to keep up with stuff if this is pulling me back, and of my things that help me is either gaming and listening to music, it just takes me some place where I can feel happy. I’m not depressed but I just hold everything on my back, and most of my old friends just left me for “cool kids” I don’t like talking to school counselors because it just makes me really nervous. I just needed to let this all out because I’ve been really stressed for the last two months."
771,Depression and oversleeping,"Hi reddit, i am 20 yrs old and since May 2019 i am struggling with a very hard depression. Since may, last year, in 2 months i lost more than 15kg (i had 120kg). After that i started to lose weight 'healthy', at the end of the summer having 95kg and maintaining that weight even today. I have 180cm so i am still overweight but since the last 2 months i didn t pay attention to the fact that i am constantly sleeping 12-16 hours daily, one time a week even staying up 2 days without sleep because i overslept so hard that day, and after that crashing another half of a day in the bed. Last year it seemed pretty nice since i thought if i sleep i can't eat but now it started to interfere hardly with my university, and it is very bad since i am on the last year. Until the depression started to come i was a daily weed smoker and i ocassionally snort cocaine in my last highschool year but i never overdoit. Since last year i think i abused so many drugs (speed, ketamine, cocaine, acid, shrooms, benzos, basicly anything but not opioids) that i think my brain is fucked up without any hope. I know the cause of the depression is a girl i am so attached and i just can't stop speaking her because when i tried the beggining of this year, the 3 months when we didn t talked i abused the majority of the drugs mentioned above.
I also know i am responsible for my actions and i try to be as moral as possible since i am student at philosophy and since highschool i was very interested in religion and spiritualuty but i can't handle this situation anymore because even though i don t do other drugs anymore other than smoking weed daily i still sleep half of the day.
I am sorry if my story bothered or annoyed somebody, but i thought there is someone else here who overcomed his depression and can help me with mine. 
Also, sorry for my english but it is my second language."
772,I recently went through a strange paralysis-type experience.,"So to set the stage I was recently trying to support someone who was recovering from a flashback. I (in hindsight very stupidly) offered this person a teddy bear and nudged it at them. This person then, understandably, screamed at me not to touch them. I felt really bad for making the situation worse, but then I kinda just curled up with the teddy bear for a while, staying in the same position for what must have been about 30-40 minutes. My muscles were starting to hurt but I was very conscious of the fact that I couldn't move but really wanted to. About halfway through it I was able to do things like wiggle my fingers and toes but trying to do anything more put me on the verge of tears.

In all I've never experienced this before and can't find anything that sounds similar, has anyone else experienced something like this and if so is there any kind of treatment available if it happens again? Thanks for reading my rambling."
773,Healthy impulsive things?,"I so easily get stuck in a cycle of work then home then sleep and I get antsy and anxious because of this, it makes me feel like I’m not living enough. Any ideas on impulsive/exciting and easy/cheap things to do that are healthy? Stuff like going on hikes or long drives or dyeing hair etc. I wanna make a list"
774,Think I finally reached a emotional breaking point.,"I'm 26\[M\] and it wouldn't take a doctor to tell you that I've contended with severe depression and confidence issues most of my life, but a few days ago I sort of broke emotionally.

I started life as an angry little kid that would throw temper tantrums and slam doors, to which my Mother's response was to ""make fun of me until I developed as sense of humor"". From a certain perspective I can see her wanting to help me develop some thicker skin, but what she really did was invite half of my mother's side of the family to endlessly harass me for about 13 years. Words were constantly twisted out of context or put in my mouth, embarrassing moments of my life were intentionally put on display for all to see, shamed for being overweight and reclusive, etc. Socially I was allowed to do most of the same things as other kids, but was always given far less freedom than my brother and sisters, and didn't start to notice until I got older. Academically I was expected to out-perform everyone else as if I was some sort of prodigy, despite being the epitome of average. The punishment for getting a 'C' on a report card was to be grounded in my room for the next semester, only allowed to read or do homework and come out for school or meals, a 'B' was just met with extreme disappointment.

I started smoking weed in 9th grade through my brother, since it was really the only thing I had ever found that kept me ""happy"" through it all, but at 18 I got caught with a gram. The state put me on community service, supervised probation, 5k in fees, and 4 months of paid addiction treatment. My mom kept her word and kicked me out (the pre-established punishment after my brother got caught by her), but when I didn't take it hard enough she upped the ante and took my scholarship, car, and consequently job with it, and spent the next few years slandering me at family gatherings. I cut ties after that and haven't spoken to her since. Her attempts to contact me over the years have slowly turned from anger and accusation to begging me to come home or even just talk to her. I think about talking to her all of time, but I've caught a glimpse of what waits for me when I go home and will have no part of it, nor can I ever think of anything to say that could accurately convey my feelings over the years or reasons for taking the actions that I have.

Fortunately I was pseudo-adopted by my friend's family (that I'm indebted to) and allowed to stay with them until my probation was sorted, at which point I moved to CA to live with my dad. Aside from partial custody every other weekend where me and my brother lived the same structured routine for many years, we never really saw him much or developed any real attachment to him. At first moving to another state where I could start over sounded like a dream, but the reality has been completely different. We were both under the impression that I would live with him until I finished my undergrad, then get a real job and move out; the reality has been a degree path littered with complications and restrictions beyond my control. We have nothing in common and we never used to spend any time together in or out of the house except for at dinner, but after a couple years nearly every conversation turned to listing all of my failures in his eyes. Eventually, after the comments got more personal and insulting I just stopped coming to dinner; He still cooks dinners for me and leaves them in the fridge, but we don't eat together. Its reached the point where we don't talk unless its necessary, and I try to avoid him and stick to my room as much as possible. I wish and often wonder what it would be like to have a healthy relationship with my dad, but to him I'm nothing more than a failed financial investment that he feels socially obligated to tolerate for now.

Objectively my life doesn't really seem so bad, but the older I get and more damage I accumulate, the harder it is for me to hold it all together on my own. I'm comfortable being alone most of the time, but never having anyone to trust or emotionally confide in, and never knowing unconditional love has slowly taken its toll over time. Nowadays my biggest issues is that I've lost the ability to connect with people, even at a fundamental level of interpersonal interaction. When I first moved to CA I was optimistic about the opportunity and new experiences, but so far its been a living nightmare. I'm a country bumpkin from a small town, so needless to say that I stood out enough that the moment I got off of the plane I was being made fun of for how I looked. At first I just shrugged it off and assumed the people around here were just really style conscious, but it got worse and more personal with time. These days no matter where I go, how I behave, how I dress, or what I do, there's always a surplus of people that need to do some pointlessly cruel thing towards me or treat me like a freak; Just walking from class to class on campus, standing in a checkout line, or sitting and working/eating in peace there's always someone that can't just leave me alone. While I'm sure that some of this is all just in my head as some self-confidence/image issue, there's too much tangible evidence and too many witnesses to deny that it isn't happening at a disproportionate rate. I wish I could just stop caring about what other people think, but its like listening to a continuous loop of personalized insults tailored to your insecurities 24/7, and after a few years it got under my skin.

At this point I've all but shut down completely. A few days ago between harassment at work and a small cancer scare and stress from school, I think I reached a breaking point. I haven't been able to cry for myself since I was a teenager, but I broke down crying for about 20 minutes and then just stopped feeling any want or desire. I just sat there for hours not moving, thinking, or caring about anything. I didn't eat for over 36 hours, I knew I was starving but couldn't stomach anything and eventually forced myself to eat something bland. While today I'm more-so back to my usual self, I still don't feel any enjoyment from anything and still have no appetite at all. Until recently I coped by drinking myself to sleep every night and smoking all day, but after discovering that I may have been blacking out several nights a week I decided to stop drinking and at the very least cut back on smoking. At this point I'm back to staring at my ceiling cuddling my pillow girlfriend until I fall asleep, while trying to ignore the feeling of loneliness so overwhelming that it now registers as an intense physical feeling.

This was much too long and incoherent for any person to have actually read, but at least I got to vent."
775,Pandemic blues,"Feeling really sad today. Not seeing my sisters for  months is getting to me. One just had twins and I haven't been allowed over to see them because of covid. Sad I'm missing seeing them as newborns and I probably won't get to hold them anytime soon. 

My other sisters and her husband decided they were okay with my parents visiting them only but won't come near me or my husband because my husband is a first responder (firefighter) and I'm working out in the community too. My parents still see us and many other people so I don't understand why they'd draw the line at us. I  told my sister I feel really hurt and now she won't talk to me at all. She made a comment  about me trying to control them or something... I just feel it's really unfair. 
It really hurts to be so disconnected with everyone and none of it is within my control. My mental health has not been good at all as a result of the isolation. 

Work has also been so stressful and busy. I started a new job two weeks before the pandemic hit. The pandemic created so many obstacles and extra tasks and my boss keeps piling on the woek... I can't keep up. 

Also I just recently had a miscarriage. I was only 5 weeks pregnant and I knew it could happen but it was just awful and it's probably messing with my hormones. I want to get pregnant again but I'm just so stressed right now I'm worried it won't happen. Ughh... 

Anyways I just needed to vent because it's all really just too much. Anyone else feel this way?

776,Unsure how to deal with intrusive thoughts and feelings of dread / sadness,"Hi everyone, for a bit of background, I’m a 23F college student and I’m currently living at home with my family, taking classes online (didn’t return to campus this semester because of COVID-19).

I’m very much an introvert and thrive on alone time, so not leaving the house or seeing friends often hasn’t impacted me much at all. In fact, in the beginning months, I’d say having to quarantine actually improved my mental health. I was sent home from my school in March this year, and I haven’t been back since then. I’ve visited a couple of friends maybe 3 times in the past 8 months, but that’s it. 

The problem though is that suddenly I’ve started to have intrusive thoughts. They’re all centered around death, primarily. They’re worst at night when I’m trying to sleep. I get really sad and anxious about people I love dying, and I’m even anxious about dying myself, too. And not even from COVID, really... it’s more so that I have these odd fears that my loved ones could die at any time in some freak accident. I even got anxious recently about having to take a longer drive on the highway, because I thought “if I crash, then that’s it for me.”

And now this has permeated into things that have nothing to do with me. When I hear about tragedies on the news, about people dying in accidents, it always breaks my heart and just makes me feel dread. And then I can’t stop thinking about these stories afterwards. Most recently, for no reason that I’ve been able to tell, the story of the 16-year-old teen Kyle Plush who died a couple years ago from positional asphyxiation after getting pinned between the backseat and trunk of his car after the seat flipped over on him, I can’t get that story out of my head. It’s even worse that he managed to call 911 using voice commands with Siri (he couldn’t get his phone out of his pocket because his arms were pinned too), and tried to explain what was going on, and police/dispatchers didn’t handle it well and didn’t find him. What gets me most is that he said on the call “tell my mom I love her if I die”.. all that just from getting pinned down by a car seat, it’s so messed up. 

I feel so so so horrible for that boy and especially for his family that now they have to live with this loss for the rest of their life. And I feel so terrible for Kyle, just thinking of somebody dying in that way... it’s to the point where I haven’t been able to get the story out of my head, and the scenario of how he died keeps playing back in my mind over and over, involuntarily almost. I’ve cried much of today over it. I feel crazy honestly. I don’t know why my thoughts are spiraling so out of control like this, why I’m so distraught over a horrible tragedy that happened a couple years back, that has nothing to do with me personally on top of it.

I don’t know what’s going on, or how to cope with this. I’m really tired of these thoughts. About death, and tragedies, and especially this one story in particular that my mind has now decided to latch onto and play back in a loop for whatever reason. If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this, I’d appreciate it a lot. I just hate feeling so alone with this awful feeling of dread / sadness in my gut"

Tonight I was rearranging my room, and my parents room is right next to mine. Things kept accidentally falling and making a bit of noise and my parents were texting me telling me to continue the project tomorrow, and I understood why I needed to do that, but for some reason I just couldn’t. My brain wasn’t letting me stop this project. I couldn’t handle being surrounded by all the stuff in my room I still needed to move around. It was so overwhelming I just turned off the lights and have been sitting on my floor trying to calm myself down. 

And this hasn’t ever happened to me either, I’ve never had a “breakdown” like this over anything. But I have always felt like I could never leave a task unfinished, even for just a couple minutes. I always feel like I need to finish it the first go. 

Is this like a thing at all or am I just being over dramatic lol"

789,Need some thoughts and some advice with my situation.,"

I feel so alone. And i don’t know how to fix it.

Hi, I’m currently a senior in highschool and this is my story on how my life seemed to crash and burn in the entirety of 2020. January 9th is a day I’ll never forget, it’s when an ex girlfriend (dated in 8th grade) told the world the biggest lie imaginable. That i had raped her. Instantly instead of being asked for my side of the story people assumed it was true and pushed me away calling me a monster, the worst person to walk the earth, to kill myself, and i should die. Now people usually don’t get to me when they say these things, i was kinda the annoying, funny kid, that everyone liked up till then so i used to jabs. But this was different people I’ve known all my life changed at the snap of a finger. I shut myself away from the world because no one wanted to listen and i was dealing with the state police aswell. This continued till July where on the last day of our family vacation we received a call saying that the case was being thrown out as the other person was caught lying multiple times. I was so relieved, happy, and overwhelmed with emotion. I cried on the beach and remembered thinking i got a second chance for my senior year. However, this wasn’t the case, instead of sorrys from people that betrayed me they chose to ignore me and act like nothing happened. Basically saying “....shit.... well good job for not raping”, i thought I’d get my friends back and people would be open, this wasn’t the case. My step father who worked as a campus security officer after retiring from being a correctional officer, was then attacked by a student claiming he was racist, homophobic and transphobic. He never backed any of these claims up and with my reputation already dragged through the mud since i lived with him i was obviously all these things too. I will say it once because that’s how many times it’s needs to be said, he or I are none of those things and it is incredibly disrespectful to just throw words like that around when they have heavy meaning. I’ve emailed the school asking for repercussions as these false claims are blatant lies and i will not be lied and bullied any longer. That was in august and i have not received one update from them regarding the situation. It seemed like everyone changed and I’m a victim but i dont want to feel this way. I don’t want to be the victim of anything, i want my life to be the way it was before that girl told that awful lie. I want my friends to go on late night drives and laugh and sing in the car, i want to go to party’s and be a normal 17 year old kid. But i live in constant fear, with anything i do i could be lied about and what if this time it doesn’t work out. I avoid parties because of drinking and I’m scared to open up to new people. I used to be so good at making friends and now i trust no one. I feel like a ghost in the sense of no one gives a shit about me and like people would be better if i moved away. I don’t know when or how to learn to trust people again. And I’m so tired of being scared to open up. This is the first real time I’ve told my story to the world so please if you have any questions about something i wasn’t clear about just ask. I’m not trying to throw a pity party or look for sympathy, i simply just want advice on how i can learn to trust, love, and feel emotions other than anger, sadness, betrayal, and loneliness. Thanks everyone who read this far. Hope y’all are doing well. Sending out positive vibes❤️."
790,What am I supposed to do now?,"I have been struggling with my mental health for 3 years now. At first I thought it was due to me struggling to get good grades but it manifested overtime with something else. I am in college and college can be very busy. I coped with my issues with staying busy for the first year but soon it caught up to me. In the second year I finally told my parents that I needed dedicated attention for my issues. By my parents I mean my mother, my father has no idea about my mental health. My brothers really freaked out because they had no idea about it at all. I waited for my summer holidays to come so that we can move to city. But we had family issue that summer and the whole focus shifted and I couldn't get through with the appointments. 

Throughout my college I reached out to the psychologist of the Institute which made me feel very hopeless about getting help at all. She neglected my issues and steered my issues to something else. She never checked up on me or paid attention to what I had to say. She even told me I wasn't busy enough while I had 4 active colleges groups at the same time. 

The problem lies in the faith my family has on me. From the childhood I was considered to be the stoic kid. I was. I didn't feel too much when I was a kid. My stoic nature often made others feel like I was mentally strong. And so my family believes . I have always been the person that kept things to themselves. I have had my share of traumas that my family know nothing about because I chose to not share them and suffer alone. Be it getting mercilessly bullied in every way possible or getting sexually abused by middle aged person or slut shamed. My family knows nothing and not even my friends now. I have always been like this. 

My mental health has deteriorated so over the time that all I could think for the past 5 months is to just get over and be done with it. I can't pick up stuff and not visualize harming myself with it. My chest is constantly tight. I am the most miserable I have ever been. I am away from my family at the point and I have been thinking a lot about doing it. I have cut out my friends so much that I have none at this point that I could talk to or even share what's going in my head. I can't talk to my family because my cousin recently died in an unfortunate accident and they are very distrubed. And to top it all, they still pine about me being very strong to be able to live alone and do it so nicely. They are not at a good place noe mentally and neither I am. I can't even bring the topic of me getting help without freaking them out. 

Truth is I don't know that getting help will even help me. I don't know what to do"
791,Likes and comments on Instagram are hurting me mentally,"I always see these girls from my school have like hundreds of followers and then I see my account with 200 followers and feel worthless and not at cool as them?

Idk what to do, it’s hurting my self worth cause In my head I equate it to likes = popularity and I feel so sad :("
792,Help identifying what's wrong with me,I know theres been something wrong with how I think and act for 2 or 3 years now (I'm 22). I've slowly cut off contact with all my friends simply because they've done things that made me uncomfortable. Not anything really bad I just grew disconnected from them no matter how long I knew them before and little things would disgust me. I feel lonely all the time but the thought of actually interacting with someone is very intimidating. I work at a gas station and my boss always gets on to me about not saying hi to customers becuase putting on a friendly face is genuinely exhausting for me. However Despite all this I actually have a girlfriend. We're long distance but she's the only one I feel I have any compassion for and yet I have to make myslef stay in contact with her on a day to day basis. We've known each other 1.5 years now and visited 4 times for 1 week through out. I think she really loves me and I think I love her but when were away it's like I have no urge to communicate with her. I feel like I have no energy in my soul. I have no compassion for others. When ever someone tells me something bad has happened to them or that they're going through something tough I feel absolutely nothing and try to put on a caring face until they walk away. Now that masks are commonplace in public I don't even try to smile when I talk to someone anymore. I feel inhuman and I can feel my emotions getting darker. Sometimes their are periods where I feel so angry all I want to do is cause as much pain as possible to anyone around me. I don't know what any of this means and I just desperately want to find a name for what I'm going through so I can attempt to manage it.
793,I had a breakdown listening to one of my favorite songs and now when ever i go to listen to it again I get really bad thoughts and feel the need to breakdown again,"as it says in the title I go to breakdown if i listen or see the song. its a japanese suicide song that goes by the name of  ""I'm getting on the bus to the other world, see ya!"". 

i really want to start listening to the song again but whenever i do, all it brings me is despair and to the point where i brackdown again.

a little bit f backstory which i should have already given. i was just chilling in my class (14 in high school)  listening to the song through headphones but for whatever reason I broke down really fucking badly. to the point where I choked myself out for a couple of seconds in front of everyone, not even realising they were there. 

i have no reason to why i broke down nor will i ever know the reason. i just wanna listen to the song again but i can't. anything anyone can suggest so i can stop getting all these bad thoughts when hearing the song?"

When I’m not texting with them I constantly worried about whether or not I’ll get to text them again. I’m going crazy constantly thinking about it and I could really use some advice. I don’t want to tell them I can’t handle them talking about all of this but I want them to be able to come to me. I really care about them and I don’t know what to do."

800,"I am becoming increasingly unstable, and this is my last resort...","Let me just start this off with some background info. I'm a 18 year old male from the United States and for the longest time I have struggled with anger management, coping with depression, and my bipolar disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, recently it seems I have jumped off the deep end and it's hard for me to get up in the morning, I regularly get in verbal fights with family (once in a while it goes physical), I have no drive whatsoever except for my job. I was supposed to graduate from highschool in 2020, but I never finished; I do go to credit recovery but ever since it has gone full online because of COVID I have not done one ounce of work. I lie all the time and manipulate people once in a while, and I my emotions are like a rollercoaster. I DO want help but I'm deathly scared of psychiatric hospitals. I have been to one twice before, but now that I'm an adult, I don't know what to expect. I just want a somewhat ""normal"" life and lifestyle but all I do is hurt myself by doing stupid things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also very suicidal and have cut myself several times within the last couple weeks; I think that I deserve the pain and suffering, tbh..."

804,Recovering from a toxic relationship,"I tried posting this in r/relationship_advice but it didn't work for some reason.

Hey reddit I've been trying to help a step relative(female, we'll call her Sarah) for a while now with their mental health but have recently hit a brick wall. Basically Sarah still has left over feelings for a partner(male, we'll call him dick) that Sarah acknowledges was toxic, but doesn't know why she still has feelings or how to identify those said feelings.

Dick was a awful manipulator. He started out nice enough. Both Sarah and dick had a mutual attraction to each other so they started a relationship. Dick was really kind and nice at first but slowly started to show his true colors. He would start to body shame Sarah constantly calling her fat and making fun of her, telling her to work out more often, telling her that her clothes don't look good on her etc. On occasion when snacks where had like a single cookie or candy bar, Dick would tell Sarah to eat something healthier. If Sarah ever did put on a swimsuit he'd make fun of her body and tell her to ""put something on to cover that up"". 

Now this seems pretty bad already, but it gets worse. Dick was constantly bringing up any mistakes that Sarah made, waving them in her face for weeks to even months. It was dicks trump card. "" I'm wrong? Well heres a bad thing you did! Remember this? How bad you screwed up?"". However if he ever made any mistakes he expected to be given forgiveness withen the day. If Sarah ever brought up something dick did he'd non-shalantly shrug it off and say something along the lines of ""you should get over it"" or ""your still hung up on that?"" 

He was also embarrassed to be around Sarah and to even associate with her. In private they were a couple. But at school or in public places dick didn't know Sarah. It was to the point almost only Sarahs friendgroup knew they were dating. Dick was also really nice guy to others thus giving him a positive reputation in most peoples eyes, including Sarahs friends.

Some of the emotional abuse doesn't need to be shared on reddit but suffice to say Dick introduced more emotionally abusive activities to his schedule. To say he made Sarah cry often would be an understatement. Which was only made worse by the fact when Sarah tried reaching out to her friends about the abuse none of them believed her, because Dick was ""so nice"" "" he would never do/say something like that"" ""are you sure its not YOUR FAULT?""


By this point in the story you're probably wondering ""why didn't Sarah just leave? Does Dick have blackmail?"" No. Sarahs mentality was just that ""this is the longest I've been in a relationship. So this must be [the one]"". How dumb that may sound to you dear reader but Sarah? Sarah believed it. She gave that relationship her all. She would make him presents (for almost every holiday and his birthday btw). Apologies for next to nothing, and just utter compliance with his abuse. Don't get me wrong Dicks an awful guy but every now and then he'd sprinkle in a compliment about Sarah. A ""your really pretty"" or a "" you so thoughtful and kind"". I guess these compliments must have felt really genuine coming from Dick. In hindsight I feel like those small quips of self confidence is what kept Sarah in that relationship for so long.

After a while Dick knew he was being well a Dick. He told Sarah ""I don't want to feel like a dick so what do you want for your birthday?"" Sarah just said money... Dick brought 15$ usd. Keep in mind Sarah had constantly made thoughtful gifts for him on several different occasions. That was the only gift Dick gave in the relationship and he had to ask. To add insult to injury, one night Sarah asks why Dick is still in a relationship with her if he dislikes her so much. He responded with a ""I don't know"" this is where the relationship takes a nosedive. More arguments, more insults,more abuse.

Eventually Sarah's mom catches on to the trend of her daughter crying at night. Connects the dots and tells her to break up with him. Sarah reluctantly does so over text. Dick is of course a pretentious asshole about it, and blocks her on all platforms. Not even 2hrs after the breakup one of Sarahs friends messages her a image of Dicks snapchat story asking if anyone wants to hook up. Words fail me.

Now Sarah was in a relationship with Dick for a year and has been dick free for a year. Sarah still sort of has ""feelings"" for dick though, she keeps a box of his stuff in the garage for some reason. She says she wants to thank him give him a hug and say goodbye. I don't understand this at all. I don't know if she thinks his abuse bettered her and made her a better person or what. But she can't identify these feelings. And she doesn't want to move on in relationships without squashing this beef. I have also found this trauma is a massive Boulder in her mental health. And I can't really help her with other issues while its in the way.

Can anyone offer some solutions? Anything from the name of what this feeling of emapthy? Towards a abusive partner, is called to ways to deal with it, to personal experiences would be helpful. Thank you reddit."
805,How to help my cousin with BPD?,I’m a 31 (f) and I have a younger cousin 14 (f) who just got diagnosed with BPD. She got diagnosed after she was sent to a mental health facility because she hurt herself. What can I do to help her?
806,Every time I'm near resolution I distance myself. Please help me.,"Thirty minutes ago, i woke up.  

Twenty minutes ago, i had come to terms with my reality, i meditated, i realized my situation, i understood myself and set tenets so i could improve myself every day.  

Ten minutes ago, i forgot about it all. It already feels like a lifetime ago. All that I had realized and set for myself gone like an innocent whisper in the wind, falling on none's ears.  
This has been my life for much longer than i realize. I have been assessed as possessing both a mind and a heart broken beyond repair, believing them to be my fault, i continually down myself in a spiral of self-hatred, of titling myself worthless of living.  

All I've been were masks created by a pained child to cope with existance, to shut himself away and let another form grieve for him. I'm not the same person. I don't have any memories of that person, but neither do i have memories of days shortly past.  

In truth, I am happy. I am terrified of how complacent i am with my reality. I live each day making room by forgetting yesterday. I want to know how to better myself and to hold onto that feeling, but each routine i ever adapt and grasp turns into dust falling between my fingers.  

By the time I finish writing this, I'm already another person, another mask. The same one that assessed me back then, told me they were ways i hurt myself, but if the child hadn't made them in the first place, i doubt he could had withstood the grief without snapping, but then again, maybe that's why we were made im the first place.  
They all tell me to take off the masks, but there's no personality behind all of them, or if there is, They're afraid."
807,Ways of avoiding depressive thoughts,"Some of them are -

* Regular Exercise - It is scientifically proven that regular exercising would help in the prevention of depression.
* Stress - Often stress is unavoidable but due to that, it can cause depression. So managing stress is very important.
* Sleep - Getting high-quality sleep is very necessary for both, mental and physical health.
* Substance Abuse - Reducing alcohol, nicotine consumption and drug use can be a difficulty, however, it is associated with higher risks of depression.
* Relationships - We have all come across people in our lives who weren't healthy for us be it friends, partners or even family members. Regardless of the situation, it is very important to avid toxic people who put us down at all costs"
808,I think there’s something wrong with me,"There has to be something wrong with me. I just don’t see how it is normal to be this way. Ok, my explanation is probably going to be nonsensical but here I go.
I am obsessed. Like insanely obsessed. I go onto apps and websites to get to know people because I’m lonely. If someone starts talking to me something in my brain just sort of flips and I start waiting. I constantly check my phone for messages and my emails. If I like a person I will talk about them for a really long time with my friends but as soon as they fail to respond I begin to dislike the person and/or feel like a failure. I hate it. I know that I want the validation of being acknowledged but I can’t seem to control it and it feels like my brain is splitting in half as I try to tell myself that it’s ok, while the other me says ‘no it is not’.
I feel all over the place. I’m happy one day then I’m not. Being happy feels overwhelming but usually I’m having a hard time trying to convince my family that I’m not cold or callous and that I do care. I care. It’s just that not that much. And I know that sounds awful. 
I’m not sleeping well and I’m pretty sure that’s affecting my mood but I can’t go to bed. My mind keeps rushing into a thousand directions and making up scenarios where I’m gravelly injured. 
I don’t know if I’m doing everything for attention. I think I usually do and the reason for that is that while I’m doing anything or feeling anything there’s always my mind in the background just being a casual observer. At a funeral I cried and stopped crying at random intervals because I couldn’t tell if that’s what was required of me. I know that I wanted people to see me cry at the same time the other half of me told me that I was being ridiculous. I don’t understand myself even when I think I do. 
I don’t know. I just know that when I show emotions it is for attention and I hate that I do it. Heck, maybe that’s why I’m writing this. 
I’m tired of myself. I just want to be normal.
Ok. Now, being positive. I’m sorry to whomever read through all of this. I just needed to rant."
809,Vent,I don’t know what’s wrong with me I don’t know how to explain it but I know I need help but since I can’t explain it my parents don’t believe me I wish they’d get me a therapist I’m sick of being tired all the time I’m sick of being sad all the time I hope I don’t reach my breaking point
810,I'm not feeling very poggers recently...,"So recently, I've been feeling kind of down. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 9 years (pepehands). She was quite weirdchamp and not very poggers and used to always beat me. I stayed with her for so long though due to the fact that we had 4 kids. When they were born i used to feel very widepeepohappy but for the past year she has turned into a kappapride. Due to this I had to battle in court for the custody of my kids and i lost xqcL pepehands. In the courtroom i tried to convince the jury that my wife was the impostor but they voted me out capitaldcolon. My mental health has slowly been deteriorating and I don't think I can live anymore sadge.

813,I am afraid that I might die of stress related heart attack before I turn 35. I don't know if I can do anything about it.,"Long story short, I have always been regretting things. Almost all of my stress origins from overthinking and regrets.

1) I did not get into good university for my undergrad. Got civil engineering. Regretted not working harder in my high school. Overthinking led to not participating in activities and classes enthusiastically for the 4 years. This led to poor GPA, and poor resume during undergrad.
&gt;
2) Luckily, got into a good master's program in materials engineering. Did decently in first year. Regretted not taking part in clubs and running for student body head. Regretted opting for a research project that was hard and not a very hot topic. Overthinking resulted in not getting a good job after master's. I felt worthless. Left job after few months. Regretted my poor decisions and performance. Have a gap of 8 months in my resume.
&gt;
3) Meanwhile, applied for PhD to 5 university, got accepted only in the safe choice university. Did not like the topic very much, was not very enthusiastic. Regretted not working harder to get a good GRE score or publishing papers during master's. Spent 2 years avoiding social events and not working hard. Regretted not taking relevant courses in the fear of getting poor grades. Now I don't have sound technical knowledge. Somehow completed my PhD in 5 years. I now like my topic but I have not done enough to get a PhD.
&gt;
Now, I regret not working harder during my PhD. I regret not publishing papers early. I also did not do any networking or be in organizing committee of social events. This led to not getting any job after graduation. Now I am working as a postdoc. I regret not working harder this year. I wasted first 5 months worrying about not able to start my job and delay in my work permit due to covid.
&gt;
I am always stressed and full of regrets. I am 32 now and am afraid that I will die in few years from stress. I don't know what to do.

But what if there was no before, no better, and I’m just a piece of shit pretending I’m depressed but I’m actually just a sack of garbage.  I’ve screwed up my life so much at this point.  Idk.  I’m just not worth the effort.  I really just want to stop existing."
816,How to have success with counselling?,"Hi, so finished my 3rd counselling session yesterday.

I accidentally turned up drunk to my first (legit forgot about the appt - adhd!) so it wasn't too in depth, the other 2 sessions have been decently exploratory.

However, I sought counselling simply for an ongoing history of trauma age 14-21 (bullying, grief, abusive ex etc)

My counsellor often asks:  What are you wanting to get out of counselling?

Things is, I don't know, as I mostly chose it just because I've heard it's helpful.

So:  What should I say?  What SHOULD I look to get out of counselling?  How has counselling benefited you?  Did anything specific help you have success?"

818,"Boyfriend is starting on antidepressants, should I expect a huge change in our sex life?","
Hi,

As of this week my boyfriend is starting on citroplam. This is his first time trying antidepressants and he asked to avoid sertraline as several of his friends told him the side effects are horrendous, so the doctor prescribed citroplam instead 

I am aware antidepressants can completely kill sex drive. Obviously my bf’s mental health is the most important thing, so I don’t really want to discuss this with him in case it stresses him out, but I want to prepare myself privately. My boyfriend currently has a very high sex drive, can anyone give me any idea how this is going to change? I know it will be different for everyone but wondering if anyone has any anecdotal advice/experience on this 

Thank you"
819,“Love” my dad,"Ok so before I start ranting about my useless self my dad is a Trump supporter, Christian, and homophobic (and divorced with my mom) so you know all that combined is going to be bad.
(WARNING VERY LONG AND TINY SELF HARM/SUICIDAL THOUGHTS TRIGGER WARNING AT THE END)
When I was in elementary I still am today struggling with a lot issues with myself. Like figuring out my sexuality and my gender.

My dad has been a very important person in my life due to him probably buying me stuff my mother wouldn’t do often cause she always told me to ask him to buy it. He was one of the many reasons why I even kept on living. My dad is very bi polar I guess you can say he is extremely mad one minute and happy the next second. 
I always that what he does and say was normal until middle school. I have never realized how racist he was and then he says well know one is perfect and that It takes time to change(he is a devoted Christian now) he keeps using that excuse but he never even tries to change. My dad says he has never hit me or yelled at me when he has. The thing is he comments about my weight and makes jokes about insecurities like socializing and freezing up in public but when I do I’m the bad person and deserves to be yelled at. I feel so god damn stupid and think why the hell did I do that. I thought it was okay when he does it too. My dad guilt trips me a lot when I have to go back to my mom or anything really. He always tell me that If I love him but he responds with if I’m lying and to prove it. I just don’t know what he wants me to prove like I’m always with you during the weekends what else do you want!? Then when my older sister steps in I just feel more worse. LIKE I’m sorry that I can be daughter I wanted I’m so sorry that I’m a fucking disappointment. I deserve this. He keeps on telling that I’m so fucking ungrateful and how I take things for granted. I’m starting to believe maybe I do deserve to be ridiculed like this or I’m being such a bad daughter I deserve this. I honestly feel like I deserve all the hate I give. I also have this habit that if I accidentally hurt someone I will allow them to give me the same pain back to me and let them hit me as hard as they like. I guess you can say I’m use to being hit because of living in a household where we use hitting as a sort of punishment. This is probably the main reason why I flinch A LOT. 

Then he pretends he is different races changes his voice and use racial slurs. I always tell him to stop but then goes of saying he has a friend of said race and he lets him. Oh god let’s not get start the only reason he goes for trump cause he did something that happened in the Bible(MY WHOLE ENITE FAMILY IS HISPANIC SO YOU KNOW THAT IS SOME CRAZY SHIT TO SAY) Then he got super fucking angry when he found out the pope is accepting gay marriage. He kept going on a rampage saying all gays are going to hell. I just sat there the car ride home taking all this is in. HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY I SHOULD TELL MY MOM ABOUT THIS. My mom thankfully accepts me for who I am(I’m pan and gender-fluid ) and like she even said that was crazy she is catholic to show that her religion won’t stop her from accepting me. My stepdad barely knows English so you unbothered but I hope he accepts me. Like my dad is super crazy like I love him a lot but I am scared of him and when he gets angry or pressures putting me in situations I can’t not handle being in I’m terrified of him. He knows I cannot handle stress well and top of that I cry very easily especially if I’m being yelled at I can’t handle being yelled at well. I’m not Christian or catholic at all but I have to pretend so I won’t face his wrath. I honestly fear the day he finds out I’m not straight and not Christian. 
Most of the stuff he has done is the main reason why I purposely scratch my wrists and arms until there raw. I haven’t actually cut myself due to the fear of making myself bleed but I’m at my breaking point I actually have thought about and I don’t want these thoughts. I stopped purposely harming myself for a couple months and now I’m back we’re I started. I also very self conscious on how I eat like I wish I could stop eating so my dad can be happy about my weight. I hate my body so much. I have always thought about ending it during  elementary to now I always wrote a new suicide note in my head. I realized I have so much pills in my house I could easily overdoes myself and know one will notice. They will just think I’m sleeping in my room until it is to late. I’m trying my best not to think about this anymore but it is so hard. I’m going to have to cut it off here as this is getting to long sorry for the long vent I am just to scared to get a therapist thinking that they will make talk about these problems with him near."
820,My dad is in the ICU due to severe Covid,"Everyone in my family got tested positive for Covid 19 except for me. My mom is also in the hospital and my dad is in the ICU. The doctors have tried various things but his condition isn't improving. I've been trying to arrange donors for plasma therapy and at the same time I'm trying to stay strong for my younger sister who is at home alone and I'm in a hotel since i couldn't stay at home as i have asthma. 
I'm finding it really hard to stay positive and strong for my family and it's badly affecting my mental health. I'm not able to focus on my job nor am i able to eat food or sleep since I'm on the phone almost all the time.
I've tried thinking of positive thoughts and I've tried to imagine positive things gor my family but being an overthinker, some or the other thought creeps in.
I'm looking for suggestions or any kind of help that you can offer to make me cope better with my dire situation. 
Thank you 🙏🏻"
821,I always feel super low and often suicidal but I internally don’t feel capable of getting help. Anyone else feel this way or have gone through this?,"That was terribly worded but I’m not sure how to explain it. I always feel like shit and have gotten told I’m probably this or that but I constantly give myself reasons not to get help. I feel constantly stressed and have no self worth. I flinch and get genuinely worried when my phone rings, and whenever I hear a loud noise from something breaking I flinch and yell something along the lines of “HOLY FUCK” while putting my hands on my ears. There’s just so much weird shit I do without thinking and Ik I should get help but internally I just refuse to. I grew up with a dad that was very emotionally abusive and would constantly throw dishes or furniture at walls or windows whenever he was mad, among just lots of other things, and I think that’s part of why, I honestly don’t know, this is a fucking stupid rant and I know without question I’m gonna regret saying this when i wake up so let me know your thoughts or if you relate because why not?"
822,I Want to know what’s wrong with me,"I cant feel emotions no matter what the situation I can’t feel anything I am completely void of all emotions I am completely empty inside I want to feel something i want to feel all of these wonderful feelings that are described to me but I just can’t no matter how hard I try

And before you even say go see a therapist I can’t im underage and my parents don’t give a shit about me 
but I guess for now I will keep up my Oscar worthy performance when I’m around others"
823,Is this derealisation/dissociation?,"Even as young as six, I would stare at an object for a considerable period of time and get this really creepy feeling. Asking myself if what I could perceive with my eyes actually existed, asking myself if this is all an illusion, asking myself if I need to wake up and there's a reality greater than me or something. 

Bear in mind I have autism and anorexia nervosa, I experienced a lot of childhood trauma, and I'm self-diagnosed PTSD and ADHD."
824,how to help.,"How do you help someone before a panic attack? I've been with my girlfriend for 11mouths and I try to help her with her bad thoughts but I normally only help with panic attacks and depression episodes. What are good ways to help before hand, so she doesn't get episodes or panic attacks and her thoughts don't get overwhelming to her?"
825,"I feel so fucked rn and I’m panicking and stressed out about everything I can possibly think about there’s just so much shit in my head, anyone have any ideas to take my mind off it so I can fall asleep?","One thing at a time, I just want to go to sleep. Every time I close my eyes I just start thinking about suicide and situations where it would be understandable as well as just everyday things that are stressing me the fuck out and I’m having a hard time with it and all
I want to to fucking do is fall asleep and escape fore the few hours I have left but even that’s being taken away from me by me it fucking sucks. Sorry for the rant, does anyone have any idea on how I might get my mind off things?"
826,Is it normal for your mother to force you to become her “husband”?,"For context I’m a female, always been a tomboy sort since a young child.  Also I’m an only child that has realised my mother has other nasty habits which is for a different post. 

This idea started when I was in my early teens and got harsher as I got older. As you can guess my mother was a single parent (father was absent but that’s a different story) and it started as “I don’t need a man, I have OP”. Over the years it turned into “OP is my husband, no need for a real man as got her”

She was not a fan of men after father (not sure why as the “truth” has a lot of holes of what really happened) and instead she pushed the “father/husband” stereotypes and role onto me. Even to a point she would introduce me as her “stand in husband” to strangers. Honestly back then I thought it was harmless or light humour but now I’m thinking was it normal? She has a lot of bad habits like being the golden child and throwing a tantrum if she’s not the centre of attention. At the same time she always find ways to ruin her own relationships/friendships. 

She was always extreme on letting me being social even as a child. I could never go to a friends house or even leave without her. The only times I could be away from her was with another family member but that was only for a few hours (3-7+ hours) at a time. I never made a proper friend till age 14/15 but was only allowed as they had special needs and mum thought it would make her look good if I had them as a friend. She ignored the fact I saw my friend as a sister and love who she is as a friend and person.

Has anyone else had anything like this from a parent? Or what are peoples thoughts on this happening?"
827,Friend and phone boundaries,"Can someone please help me.  I am at my wits end! I have now asked my friend repeatedly not to call or message me between 10pm and 10am, other than to a facebook chat I created for late night messages for things she wants to say, but aren't urgent and I can read in the morning.  Last time I asked her was last week, she has broken this every day since, other than yesterday.  I don't know what to do, I have to keep my phone on ""Do Not Disturb"", I keep missing other messages because of it, when other people can only talk at that time, and I need my family to be able to contact me as my mother and father aren't doing so well.  I have asked now around 6 times, surely I shouldn't have to amend every single contacts settings in my phone so they can get through the ""Do Not Disturb"" setting.  Surely asking her is enough and I have told her how important it is to me.  It seems to be some kind of power thing with her, I want it so she'll do the opposite.  I really want to stay friends with her, but it's just late at night... if I wake up I am fully awake and stay that way for 4 hours, it's having a huge impact on my life.  I don't know what to do.  Any help will be so gratefully received.  If you think I'm being unreasonable please feel free to say this too."
828,I lost my entire support system in a week,"A week ago I was riding pretty high, I had a lot of great friends, I was speaking to my mom and dad, and I had my career all lined up. Then, over the course of two days, my father stopped speaking to me as he thinks I’m brainwashed by liberals, my career fell through because of an injury that disqualified me, my girlfriend of a year broke up with me (tells me she still loves me) , and she made me leave the group chat and friend group.  My mother also moved 800 miles away on Monday, the culmination of a divorce that started in March. So I sit in my room, roommates often gone, alone, ALL the time. I do well when they are back but they often aren’t so I spend all my time alone with my thoughts wondering what I did to make everyone in my life push me away all at once"
829,I can’t remember the last time I hugged someone,"Covid has made everything strange and at first he isolation felt awesome as I’m naturally mostly introverted but it hit me tonight that I literally cannot recall if I’ve had a meaningful hug at all this year. Prior to covid my family lost my cat while I was away for a week so I haven’t had my little dude to talk to, and I have a hard time talking family or friends about this kind of thing. I don’t need a number to a hotline or anything like that, but the loneliness is finally caught up to me and I needed to express it somewhere. I know there are other redditers in my shoes, how have you been coping?"
830,i only wanna use people and to lovebomb them unless they're a rare exception,"i can't describe how amazing it feels to receive praise. I am in lncredibly in love with being a dom while others be a sub.

The idea of pushing others around gives me a great sense of pleasure, the idea of being powerful and feeling as if it is me who is great at what i do. the idea of lying and making someone chase you, while being able to just end it on your terms is a great concept.

i can't control myself. i see this as so addictive and it only gets worse, i can't control how incredibly skilled i am at these things, the fact no one is capable of understanding my feelings, makes me feel superhuman and as if there are things i have still not pursued that will only enhance my sense of uniqueness"
831,Just feeling lost,"So for the past 5 or 6 yrs ive just regressed i had a mental break down it just feels like i have one everyday but i try to hide it, comes out every once in a while, iv become hyper vigilant and hypersensitive, but even stepping outside feels like I lose myself  going to work is a daily struggle i constantly feel like im being judged like im the butt of every joke , i know im capable of doing great things but my self worth is so low it puts a cap on what i can accomplish, im in a constant state of stress im terrified of seeking help cause what if im just crazy cause manic depression and bipolar disorder and schizophrenia run in the family im currently watching the most strong and positive influence in my life give up on life stage 4 copd it literally feels like its sucking the energy out of me and there's so much more"
832,Intense Feelings Of Fear For No Apparent Reason,"  This is a question. I made this account just for this. My partner has these weird ""spells"" where she is terrified and jumpy. These happen out of no where and is a weekly occurrence. They happen mostly during the night but rarely during the day. These spells are strange. She'll murmur things like ""if I have my back turned for too long.."" and will say she'll hear things that I don't hear. Most of the time I brush this off as some sort of paranoia. She does have a bad fear of the dark. But lately I'm concerned because it scares me too sometimes. The other night I turned off the light in the hallway, and while I was standing in the door way, she told me to turn the light back on. It wasn't three seconds before she curled in a ball and started screaming. I turned it on, and had to console her for an hour. This makes alot of our nights sleepless and hurts my job. 
 What could this be? I don't think she's crazy, she's mostly normal."

834,Mental health &amp; parental support,"You'd think when I asked to go to a doctor (mental health side), that you'd want me too. But no, what matters the most is the prospect of getting a fucking job and not having a label on me! You and ""father"" dad. Fuck any job that doesn't understand that people aren't perfect and that things can go on beyond the surface. When I mentioned feeling depressed, you went into a dumbass rant, insinuating that depression is ungrateful and that you're not gonna waste your life with that thinking. That when you start feeling bad, you should just start doing things that you like...***you're an idiot***. It's not solved because you're sweeping it under the rug and if I kill myself, know that you're gonna be responsible too. The most I get with helping my mental health is self-care &amp; looking at things psychology but apparently that's my problem now and I think I have ""that"". Anyways, rant done. It's crazy to think about how ignorant, willfully ignorant, some are concerning this..."
835,Depression and anxiety,"Hi everybody I just want to share with you my life moments. In 2019 year I started my studies in university. I was living with my girlfriend and it was amazing. But suddenly I tried molly and started to hang out with wrong people. I was doing a lot of drugs and tried almost everything. After I felt very depressed and anxious. I could not complete my university tasks and had a lot of problems with my relationship. My life went down and I felt trapped in my own problems. I had suicidal thoughts and almost tried to kill myself.  When I came back home to my country I found a clinic where I had lot of different therapies. For my luck they helped me and doctors were so proud that they made their job. Now I'm taking quentipine daily and I'm feeling much better, I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore. I feel like I can do anything what I want. Now I want to continue my studies and get back to university. I started to exercise and meditate every day and I feel that it helps me.  
 I don't know why I'm writing this message, just want to leave it here. Thanks for reading and enjoy your day."
836,Asking a friendly advice,"I'm 17 female student and i have a problem with my emotion. It started when i'm 15 there's one time that i laughed uncontrollably for couple minutes and I suddenly bursts tears really hard, it's like there's nothing sad thing happening and that making my friends uncomfortable and looking at me weirdly. It happens rarely but I worried is that something serious or just a common stress. sorry if there's some mistakes because english is not my native language."
837,i feel like my mental health is realy screwed up for a 17yo with as much going for me as ive got,"I dont even know any more, i want to tell someone but dont want anyone to know at the same time. I feel like im just not enough for anyone or anything, all my friends seem to prefer someone over me (no ones best friend) but they all mean so much more to me than it seems i mean to them, im overweight, not funny, not attractive, im broke, i have no tallents or skills, strugle to comunicate and i dont enjoy the things i used to. It just seems like everyone has someting that makes them, *THEM*, but i seem to lack everything that makes people intersting in their own way. Im tall (6'5) which would be my only positive atribute if it didnt mean everywhere i go i stick out like a sore thumb and stress about what people think of me thanks to my low self esteem. I dont enjoy hanging out with my friends cause the girl i like is friends with everyone i know which is a problem because she has started talking to some guy and wont stop talking about how great he is and it makes me feel like a lesser person which i really dont need right now. I dont know if im depressed cause i still laugh and smile most days but im certainly down more often than not. And i have thaughts of suicide but ive never considered it as an option yet. Although i do scare myself when i have them.

Idk, anyone have some advice."
838,How do i get confident in making jokes and being funny,"I (m/19) am not funny by any means. 

I became depressed an anxious since i was a kid due to bullying i experienced for 8 out of 10 years of school(the last 2 years i was moved to another school). And i didn´t want anyone to feel what i have felt. So i became very careful when it comes to making silly jokes and trashtalk someone. Eventually i ended making jokes entirely.

So here i am. I´m getting professional help with the depression and anxiety for over a year now. But i just can´t find my way back into humor. I am very serious about absoultly everything. This resulted in becoming distant to new people because i don´t know how to break the ice otherwise than with humor. I really don´t know where to start. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
839,I don't want them to notice nor worry about me,"Lately I've been thinking about my mental health and discovered some stuff.

I want to be able to get help without worrying anyone nor want them to know, I want it to keep as much of a secret as possible but I'm almost at a breaking point and can't hide it anymore.

I'd be really grateful if anyone could tell me if there's some kind of free website (in Spanish if possible)
I'm scared to post my problem here but if it's the only way, I'll do it."

I have been diagnosed with BPD w anxiety disorder, unipolar depression and ADD. 

Nothing was helping me and Ive been getting really low in life and back into my suicidal thoughts...

My ADD has gotten worse bc I didn’t know you shouldn’t mix weed with it, and my focus and memory has gotten so bad but it keeps the suicidal thoughts away. 

I am at my lowest, and I just got terminated from my job affective immediately bc I couldn’t function.

I don’t know what to do anymore... IF you have any advice I would love it. I’m gonna lose my house I rent it’s perfect (I got kicked out of my parents home) and I’m so close to giving up.

P.s I have been calling the hotlines daily and have a weekly therapist.

TLDR: Everything is falling apart and I might give up soon. Need advice."
841,Could this be depression?,"I'm 24 F, in december 2019 I got diagnosed with autism and ADD. But I'm worried there's more to it.

The truth is, I'm not doing so well lately.
For starters, I'm so tired all the time. It doesn't matter how much I sleep at night, or how many naps I take during the day. I'm still exhausted. Both physically and mentally. I often start to cry at random moments, just because I'm so tired. Even answering messages or calls from my friends costs too much energy. 

People ask me how I'm doing but I just ignore these questions because I'm not okay, but I don't know how to explain. 

Apart from the tiredness, I don't feel like ""me"". But I can't really explain this. I feel numb and less happy I think? 

Can someone help me? Any suggestions what's wrong with me?

842,How can I manage my emotions better?,"I’ve been super on edge as of late. I’ve been extremely irritable and I let sometimes the smallest things get to me and effect me. My main problem I think I have is issues with my past. I have a lot of hurt and resentment from certain people. I feel taken advantage of by family and friends. I feel like they’ve given up on me or are never there when I need someone. I feel abandoned. My ex broke up with me and shut me out completely without hearing anything I ever had to say, like I was forced to bottle up everything and now I feel so broken down inside. I feel as of late, everything that’s been happening in my life has taken its toll and I just reached my breaking point. Like i just feel dead and numb inside. Like my feelings aren’t validated. I can’t seem to focus on anything else. It’s like I tune everything and everyone out. I have no interest in listening to other peoples problems anymore whereas before I never had this issue and was always there when someone needed a shoulder to cry on. I feel unsympathetic. I feel like I’m becoming a shitty friend, sister and daughter. I have no emotions towards anything or anyone anymore but when someone does something to upset me or hurt me, my emotions take over and I lose control, get upset and shut people out even more. I hate feeling this way but I can’t seem to find ways to just manage my emotions better and to just be happy in general. I never use to be this person. I feel like I’m having a pity party that I can’t seem to get out of. I don’t like what I see in the mirror and I hate this person I’m becoming. 

I’ve been wanting to see a therapist to find ways I can cope and just talk about my issues but I can’t seem to find anyone who can take my insurance or are taking new patients. Paying out of pocket is just too hard for me right now. It’s extremely frustrating and I feel hopeless. 

What can I do to manage my emotions and to stop letting things from the past effect me so much? I just want to be happy and not dead inside anymore."

844,I am gonna have to go three days without meds,"I am in college and I have been getting my meds sent to me through the mail. My psychiatrist sent a script for a three month supply. I assumed my pill bottle that I had would last me till I got home. As it turns out it doesn’t I have no pills left. I have until Friday until I get home and get medicated. Last time I went a period without taking my medication I was hospitalized. I also have finals. I have no idea what to do. 

I literally cannot sleep without my meds. I took 40mg of melatonin last night and couldn’t sleep still. If I don’t sleep my mental health deteriorates FAST. 

What should I do?"
845,"I finally got to speak to a psychiatrist today. I wasn't diagnosed with anything specific, he just said it's not clear cut depression. There are a lot of traits of both CPTSD and BPD.","I'm not sure how I feel. It wasn't an overly helpful appointment but it wasn't unhelpful either.

I think I just wanted to hear something black and white, I get that things like this are never going to be that simple, and rightly so. I think i'm just striving for the validation of a professional to let me feel a certain way. I was told that my emotions are real, and that I am in fact in control. It's so easy to hear that but it's not so easy to accept that. I'm sort of at a loss of what to do next."

Stimulants did not show short-term benefit when given to the general population in terms of improving actual performance on tests:

853,My girlfriend left me because of her anxiety,We've been together for almost a year. I knew about her anxiety and i wanted to support her. She made real progress these past few months. She even seeked professional help. But today she just had enough. Seemingly out of the blue. She said she doesnt deserve me and i should be happy with someone else.it started with us being on a brake to actually ranting at me about made up things i did. We planned our life together. But now i dont know what to do. She wont respond to my texts. She asked me a couple of times before to leave her alone but i couldnt let her suffer alone. Maybe its my mistake.

855,A unhelpful break,"I had a lot going on the past 11 months and i took a break from everything 2 months ago because i was anxious 24/7 but i feel even worse now, i was trying to maybe disconnect from everything for a while somewhere but nothing is going as planned"
856,Any tips on self-care to improve BPD?,"I’m 19, and I have a 1 year old son. His father died before he was born, and he was horrible to me, which left a mark. Finally, over a year later, I’m ready to date again. I just want someone I can make happy and take care of, someone I can share my son with and have a happy little family with. 
I have diagnosed and untreated borderline personality disorder. It’s kinda ruining dating for me. I slip into this cycle of love at first sight, then irritation, then jealousy, then subtly begging for reassurance. 

Is there anything I can do at home (I don’t have insurance and therapy isn’t cheap) to improve myself so my relationships can be healthier and more fulfilling for not just me, but my future partner as well?"
857,I seem to be stuck in certain patterns and i don't know what the fuck to do?,"I'm 20 years old 

  
Something is not right with me and I cannot seem to figure out what it is. Ever since a few years i've been extremely anxious about a lot of things. Example: asking a grocery store worker where to find certain things is almost impossible for me. I also have problems with going to physical stores that I have not been too before, same with restaurants. Not too sure where issues like these come from but i've really been struggling with this, especially now that i'm doing an internship at a school and I start to feel physically anxious when I need to correct or be harsh to students. It's like feeling afraid without knowing what I am really even afraid off. 

I've also been experiencing mood swings. I'll feel happy and excited to move forward one day, but then another day I shut down and get stuck in my own thoughts. By far the most amazing thing in my life right now is my girlfriend and i'm really afraid these patterns of behavior that i've been finding myself in will impact this relationship.

I also have no idea how to start and finish projects anymore. I get stuck in many wonderful ideas but i can never really seem to put them into practice. All i've been doing for the past year is just smoke weed and get through the day chilling with my girlfriend, watching movies and most of all: Browsing Reddit. Now that i'm finally being productive again by doing an important internship for my study I cannot even feel motivated for this anymore because every lesson is dreading to me since I always feel so anxious. 

I've also gotten into the habit of buying expensive clothes. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but one of the most fun things for me to do is sign up for raffles and limited brand drops to buy clothes. It brings me enjoyment and i don't even know why.

I just feel fucked up and I don't know where to go with this. Thanks for reading"

859,Struggling with myself.,"I’ve recently gone out of almost a 2 year relationship and I’ve been struggling with myself and my feelings. I’ve had negative thoughts of myself and recently got into a worst situation with my ex. 

Sometimes my friends would say stuff and all, like “it’s her fault” and all that, after she had been doing stuff with other people so soon after the relationship. I felt betrayed and more heartbroken than I was already. People around me say she didn’t care about the relationship,and she says she does. 

I don’t know what to think about it anymore. What’s worst is that I have self destructive tendencies that I can’t let go for some reason. Whenever I feel down, I usually think very negatively about myself and that everything is my fault, and that affects everyone around me. One day I’d be happy the next I’d be sad. I don’t know how to control such emotions with myself. I end up distracting myself with something else just to forget the pain, but now it’s been like this for 3 days and I don’t know what to do."
860,My Oscar worthy performance,"Even though I can’t feel emotions I can fake them perfectly i am faking my entire personality, I want to let people in so they can see the true me I want to be able to communicate with people but I am terrified of letting people in cause the last time I tried no one cared or they called me a attention seeker I’m honestly done with all this shit I just want someone to see the true me and not judge me for my mental problems or my past experiences I want people to look through this performance I want them to see the true me not a bunch of stolen fake personality’s but that day will never come because I’m just a edgy teen that doesn’t know anything about mental heath man if only they were able to see past my performance this shit performance that is slowly pushing everyone away 

Well anyways hope whoever is reading this is doing better than me rn"
861,I don't have confidence,I don't have confidence at all like when I'm taking a test I say you're going to fail you are not going to get a good grade and it not just with test I do it with everything I do this a lot is this mentally healthy?
862,How do you keep a positive mindset?,"So I have the classic trifecta of mental disorders (adhd, anxiety, and depression). I am on medication for all three, but I’ve been falling into a really bad hole recently. Every day I wake up feeling pretty good and have a good plan of attack for my day and am feeling good about myself. But then around midday (in between 3-5) I find that I do a complete 180 and everything that I was feeling good about is flipped on it’s head. Assignments go from challenging but approachable to seemingly unscalable mountains that are too steep to even start to climb. I feel like my energy, motivation, and any semblance of happiness is completely drained from my being and I end up just rotting away looking at all of the work I’m not getting done. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so, how did you manage to work around it? Right now it’s just a struggle and I feel like I have to constantly rush to get work done in the time early in the day when I am still able to get it done but there is just too much to do (I am a music student and practicing multiple instruments takes a long time)"
863,Why didn’t I try this sooner???,Is it fucked up that one tab of acid and watching the whole season of the midnight gospel did more to help me than all $1100 of therapy sessions combined?
864,"I feel terrible taking another mental health day to properly take my medicine and do my course work. Upcoming in-person 3-hour class I haven’t attended much, thoughts?","This past year, online school has benefitted me since I have intense social anxiety, depression, and adhd. I’ve been treated for mental health issues since the start of highschool, and it has been getting hard again. More on myself now rather from others, that I have established such a negative view of myself. I barely eat, I have a lot of trouble sleeping, but my grades are good. 

I have this final project for my fashion design course due today, and I have been working on it, there has just been so much other stuff going on that throws me into such a deep depression that I have to distract myself. I feel terrible knowing I could have spent that time completing my project, but it was impossible to get myself out of it. My mind is thinking about so much all at once. I have no job, no car, but I’m trying to do both while keeping my grades and mental health in check. I went to the hospital the other night for suicidal thoughts, but since I had no plan, they let me go.

I already speak to a psychiatrist and a therapist.

I don’t want to tell my teacher my whole life story. I’m so embarrassed of myself already lately. I don’t even want to show my face because I’m scared he will call on me to present, and then I would have to awkwardly ask to speak to him after class and put together my past few weeks."
865,Advice Needed,"I’ve struggled with mental health most of my childhood/adulthood but I’ve never felt so unstable. I grew up in a very traumatic situation and my whole childhood was spent with the ideal that once I got out I would be fine. After graduating high school I bounced around finding jobs in different states but always returning home due to financial reasons. 

Recently I moved away again but don’t have any safety nets due to cut ties/lack of support. The past few years I haven’t thought about what I was doing or how I was building my future and I am stuck in this vicious cycle. I feel completely lost to myself. I don’t know myself anymore. I can’t trust my opinions or thoughts because of extreme intrusive thoughts/ anxiety attacks. My emotions do not feel like my own. I am the passenger in my own life. I feel like I don’t have control. If I try and change my situation I generally act impulsively and make very strongly opinionated decisions that in a year or so down the road completely regret due to me making decisions out of a very triggered place. Which leads to me cutting out good people, good jobs, ect. Which is why I can’t trust myself. 

My confidence had dwindled in the last couple of years. I don’t feel confident in getting jobs, talking to people. I am completely shutting down and I am living in a car with my partner. It is very difficult to try and take care of myself living in a car. 

I have tried seeing several different therapists. Each was like a really shitty date in their own way. I have spent almost a grand trying to get help and feel like I’m wasting money. I’m not at a point where I can spend money like that at the moment and am turning to y’all. 

I have extreme ADHD(not medicated) and am at a place with myself where I feel I strongly need some medication. But again I am not in a place where I can afford this. 

I am so tired. I am so frustrated. My days are miserable. Whatever I am doing I do not enjoy. I am anxious, depressed, and I can’t remember shit which makes me not know who I am. 

I keep expecting my parents to finally show up and be parents and I don’t know how to let go of that. They’re not there. 

I don’t know what to do. I am stuck in these cycles reacting on shit that happened ten fifteen years ago. I don’t know how to be consistently present. 

Please any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I am spiraling dangerously and want to catch myself before I completely fall."
866,hey wanted to vent,"Burnt out as fuck uni student here, with a lot of things i want to do but not getting much things done - not procrastinating but constantly getting uni work done at a snail's pace - literally getting chewed out by my boss for being 'remarkably slow' - being unable to cope with any major event and not being able to vent to anyone and just uses the internet and porn to cope - losing face to face contact with friends with everyone being busy with assignments and exams

At this point, i desperately want to do something to change but feel im so constrained with feeling forced to spend all my day doing online uni and still feeling so inefficient

yea i realise this isnt a mental health forum so dont worry im not gonna kill myself, but I guess it constitutes as sharing my emotions. thanks for taking the chance to read this rand internet stranger :)"
867,"I think I’m getting better, but should I still have my mental health checked?","Over the last 18 months or so I hadn’t been doing too good, but a few weeks ago, everything started to turn around.

I didn’t have any close friends, I was struggling to make some, I thought no one liked me or cared about me, and the ones who did were just pretending, I’m very pessimistic, I was very irritable and I argued with my parents a lot. Throughout most of last month, all that was starting to make me very anxious and a little depressed. To the point where I was frequently having what may have been panic attacks, and it even turned into crying a couple of times... But then, something happened which changed a lot of that...mostly.

Towards the end of last month, a friend of mine (who wasn’t close then) noticed something was up, so he asked what was wrong. We had a long conversation about it, where I opened up to him about everything. He said he used to be like me, pessimistic, friendless, and unable to make friends. But today, he’s full of optimism and positive energy (maybe a little too much at times, lol) and he’s able to make friends with just about anyone. In saying that, he wanted to help me out. Since then, we’ve only become closer and closer. The only friends I ever had never cared about me much at all. To have him show that he truly cares about me brings tears to my eyes. For once in my life, I can finally say I have a true friend!

But not everything’s been perfect. A week later, I was in a car accident. No one was hurt (apart from the other driver having a little chest pain at first, but I think she was fine after paramedics checked her), but both my car and the other car have since been written-off, and I was put at fault... (my car went sideways under heavy braking for some reason, which caused it to hit the other car next to me, and yes, it had ABS). Being young, my insurance excess is very, very expensive (thankfully they just took it out of the insurance payout this time), and on top of that I currently don’t have a car. Until I buy a new car I have to rely on public transport, which is terrible in my area...

After my dad picked me up from where the accident happened, and while at the scene, we were both talking in a calm manner. But when we got home, we started talking about it with mum. Then, a lot of stuff went down (not from mum, probably me)... There was arguing, yelling, and at one point, physical violence. After all that, I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. I had the perfect day with my friend and a few others, then that accident happened on my way home and ruined it... For the next few days, I was depressed again... Almost like I was back to square one. I’m not too bad atm though.

I’ve considered getting help before that conversation with my friend, but now I don’t know if I need to. During that conversation, I brought up my mental health, and my friend said I may have some form of anxiety and depression, which is exactly what I was thinking. It seems to go up and down at times, so should I still seek professional help? I’m already seeing a counsellor btw."
868,Anyone else feel this way?,"Today I  went to the doctor's for a jaw scan cus I've been having jaw pain, and I keep getting scared to ask questions or too scared to continue asking the question and then that leads to me getting upset and beating myself up in the car on the way home, and asking myself why I can't just do it.  Does anyone else have this same problem?  Or feel this way?"
869,My friend's mental health is spiraling out of control. How can I help her?,"Recently, I (19F) have been getting worried about my college friend's (18F) mental health. I think it's becoming worse ever since we started college together, but I don't know what else I can do to help. Below is a list of instances (in chronological order) about her mental health that I hope will give context:

* In freshman year, she started to have suicidal thoughts (around 6-7 months after college started). Our group of friends and I advised her to go to the school's counseling center (we have free therapy sessions at our college). She did and said the counselors did not help her. Eventually, she was busy with school and push her suicidal thoughts under the rug.
* In freshman + sophomore year, she often discussed with me a lot of depressing and anxious thoughts about school. She also started to have some mental breakdowns. I advised her to maybe take fewer college classes (she takes 5-6 classes per semester + is in a few clubs), but she said that's difficult considering she is a nursing major. 
* In junior year (present-day), her mental health is at a low point. She complains to me a lot about her stressed schedule and being anxious about her assignments. 
* (Present Day) With her boyfriend (in a relationship since freshman year), she starts to get angry verbally and sometimes physically (e.g. throwing objects on the ground but not at him)  at the boyfriend. 
* (Present Day) Her suicidal thoughts are getting more intense. Last time she tried to cut herself with scissors but failed to do so (no cuts or bleeding). Her boyfriend has now put anything sharp away from her reach.
* (Present day) She did say that she has been in contact with a psychologist/counselor, who has prescribed her some meds to calm her anxieties and combat depression, but she is not reacting to it well and has been struggling to sleep for most nights.
* (Present day) A few days ago, she also told me that she might have a binge eating disorder due to her stress eating from anxiety/depression. I was doubtful at first, but considering her history of mental health, now I am worried.

In general, I think my friend's mental health is declining and I'm worried that she will go down further on a destructive path. Although I tried to be there for her and give her advice, I don't know what I can do to help considering that I am living in a different state now.

Tl;dr My college friend's mental health is getting worse every year since freshman year of college. She is in contact with a psychologist/counselor now, but it's not helping her much. What can I do?"
870,"I have a lot of unpacked trauma(?) related to being sick; how do I go about asking a doctor about a medical issue I'm suffering from? Kind of a rant, too, sorry.","Honestly, tl;dr right there in the title, but for context: growing up, and well into my twenties, my parents called me a hypochondriac whenever I was sick with anything. I have a twin sister with severe medical issues that needed constant attention, so I think they thought I would fake being ill for attention, or maybe they just didn't have the money for me. Obviously, this has caused several issues, the biggest being that I have come to ignore or downplay illnesses, I constantly fear that I'm faking my symptoms or that people think I'm lying, and have a very hard time seeing and talking to a doctor.

Furthermore, it seems like every doctor I try to talk to ignores me when I ask for help. The biggest help I've ever received was when I admitted that I was depressed, but any other illness or injury is scoffed at. If I'm suffering, it's obviously because I'm overweight. Weirdly high white blood cell count? Overweight. Arthritis in every joint of my body? Lose weight. Severe vitamin D deficiency? Obesity, obviously. Nauseous and pain in my gut every day, long bouts of constant diarrhea followed by constipation? Have you tried losing weight?

I'm starting to think it's me; maybe because I come off as someone who assumes everyone thinks I'm lying, I could be leading them to think that I am? I also just can't seem to describe my symptoms in ways that doctors understand (but random people on the internet do??). Idk, I'm very sick and very very exhausted, and I just want to know what I'm doing wrong. 

Thanks for reading and/or responding."
871,How do you deal with negative feedback without getting anxious?,I've had some bad experiences with getting feedback in the past (work situation) and now I mentally shut down every time I get negative feedback. Like it makes me scrambled and then it's almost impossible to do any other work. How do you deal with negative feedback without it derailing you?
872,Can I beat depression without medication if I have a chemical imbalance,"I’ve heard that therapy and medication is necessary and was just wondering if this is true , and if so why?


I deff feel imbalanced from day to day, but all the time an overall numb feeling mentally. That is it. A lack of motivation and inability to focus . Do I need medication? I feel I’ve tried everything else to help."
873,My friend is in a bad condition,"Idk if it's the right sub to post this so excuse me

So my friend has serious issues regarding his sleep. Now, I actually don't know if it's insomnia because no professional has diagnosed him with this but I know that he has some real trouble sleeping and it's getting really bad. He doesn't sleep at night although he wants to sleep at night. He tried to fix it but in vain and I don't think he will be able to fix it by himself. He needs someone. 

He is also mentally unstable and um has a death wish. He is in a very bad condition and all I want is to help him but I cannot figure out ways how. I've looked up various things on Google and told him to do those things but he is not willing to. He doesn't want to consult a professional. Apparently there are no good therapists or psychologists within his province. 

It hurts to see him like this. He just wants to sleep but he is not able to. How do I fix this situation considering the fact that there are no therapists he can meet up with?

Fyi, he has type 1 diabetes.

And this is not important information but I feel guilty posting information about him when he is not aware of it. True, I did not reveal his name or anything but I still feel guilty.. aaaaaaa idk why."
874,COVID is draining,"Im sure similar posts have been made but this post is mainly for me. To write out some thoughts I haven’t said out loud in months -  to anyone. It’s kinda therapeutic... 

I know this year has been hard for so many and we have all been affected by COVID. 2020 has seriously sucked. I’ve experienced mild depression and I suffer from anxiety but this feeling I’ve had these past months is something I’ve never felt before. Combined with just graduating and entering the work force amid a pandemic... I feel completely empty like there is nothing to look forward to and no way of differentiating one day from the next. I think I’ve lost hope, passion? I’m not sure how to describe it. 

It’s a combination of finally entering the work force (I was lucky enough to get a job during COVID), getting rejected from my top choice law schools, seeing my friends go on to study what I’ve been working so hard to get into, and then (of course) seeing the financial, physical and mental toll COVID has taken on myself, my family (especially) and my friends. 

There is literally nothing in the foreseeable future to look forward to and it’s bleak.

I’ve tried to stay positive (towards the start I was one of those who convinced themselves COVID could be a “good thing” (I hope you know what I mean when I say this - not ignoring the deaths, illnesses, stress etc.) but now I can’t pull at any positives from this experience. I haven’t gotten fit, I haven’t started studying for the LSAT so I could give law another try... I’m just here. And from the often short conversations with friends (“how are you” “good - nothing different same as last week”) they too are just here.

Just seeing people on the commute to work, interacting with the barista while grabbing a coffee, petting dogs are you cross their path and asking their owner how old they are... it was all human interaction that I didn’t realize I (we) needed. They weren’t just nice encounters... they gave me energy. Days where I was really feeling my outfit and noticed people looking (they probably weren’t but let’s pretend) gave me confidence. Funny interactions i witnessed on the bus gave me stories to tell friends over drinks. 

I know it’s a bit of a “well this is what we have to do...suck it up” situation. But I’m trying to really come to terms with these feelings that I’ve pushed aside for so long. Things are not okay and knowing they won’t be for so many for a while is devastating. 

Anyways if anyone’s still reading I hope you were able to relate to this in some way. I know my perspective right now is pessimistic - trust me when I say I wish it wasn’t. If you have any tips for how to change my outlook on this whole situation I will take anything. 

Hope you’re all staying safe, healthy and being kind to each other."
875,Someone please tell me what the hell is wrong with me,"my mental abilities are decreasing every day. I'm disconnecting from reality. I can't focus and pay attention or understand concepts easily.

But after trying on so many different outfits I hate the way I look so so much that I want to bail on the date. Some outfits show off my back fat way too much, others stomach fat and baggier outfits just make me look like a huge box.

 Honestly I don't have many full body pictures on my social media either and in the ones I do have I look a lot slimmer than in real life. I guess I fear rejection. I just need help getting out of this exhausting mindset but I don't know where to start. Would appreciate help. Thanks."

882,Suffering from depression vs just being down,"Hi !

So I've been having episodes where I am very depressed for the past year (no motivation, no enjoyment in anything I usually like, crying a lot randomly and struggling to identify/manage my emotions, can't focus and work correctly). I am getting very tired of being in this state. I also have anxiety issues with random panic attacks.

My question is : how do you know you might start to suffer from depression, or whether you're having a rough time momentarily ?

When I do try to talk about how I feel with my boyfriend or my family, they're usually telling me to focus on how good my life is compared to others (still have a job, no money issues and nice apartment) and telling me it's momentary. It makes my feel guilty about feeling bad as I don't have specific reasons to feel depressed or anxious. It really makes me question how I actually feel and whether I'm giving too much attention to the moments where I feel bad. I'm considering seeing a therapist but I'm wondering if I actually need it and I'm worried about having to explain it to people close to me."
883,My roommates were talking about ways to kill yourself and I have no one to talk to about it,"TW; suicidal conversations/actions

Posting on a throwaway cause some of my roommates are on reddit

I (24f) live in a house with my boyfriend (25m) and his friends (25m's) and last night they were having a casual conversation in the kitchen that turned into ways to kill yourself. That's the part of it I walked into while making dinner. They talked about everything from carbon monoxide poisoning to jumping off a bridge. They talked about the ways they'd kill themselves if they had to then suddenly asked me if I had thought about how I'd kill myself and I just froze up and said I can't say I've thought about it before. One of my other roommates was in the living room and yelled in he didn't like the conversation they were having but they continued on anyway. Eventually it just kinda fizzled out but not before I finished cooking. I don't know why I didn't just immediately walk out when I heard what they were talking about.

Now for the reasons this was triggering for me:
1. They brought up trying to kill yourself with Tylenol which doesn't work: which is how I had tried to take my own life in highschool 9 years ago as of November 15th (3 days before this), panicked and threw it up immediately after (I still can't take that kind of medication) 
2. Talked about jumping off a bridge: a lost a friend to suicide that way within the past 5 years 
3. Asking me how I'd kill myself: upsetting for obvious reasons

Reasons I have no one to talk to about it:
The only person that really knows what happened is my bf and I know if I told him he'd be pretty pissed at them for it (he wasn't in the kitchen when this was happening) and I don't want to start that kind of drama in the house. I'm not ready for this to really be out there, don't know if I ever will be. Another reason is my best friend (who doesn't know about the suicide attempt) is dating one of the guys who was in the conversation so I feel like I couldn't go tell her even if she knew. 

So I need help as to how to cope with this situation, I'd go stay with someone for a couple days but a) covid and b) I feel like I couldn't just leave with talking about why I'm upset.

I'm doing okay and am not a risk to myself as of right now. Sorry if this was kinda long/messy

TIA

Edit to add: I feel really uncomfortable now being around them for fear of conversations like these coming up again does anyone have tips for helping to overcome that?

Edit to add 2: would it be worth it to talk to even just the roommate who asked me how I would kill myself about being careful about asking those kinds of questions to"
884,Overthinking and stuck inside head,"Hey Guys,

So I have this issue. I'm stuck inside my head. Even when I'm performing tasks, the inner noise goes on. It can become so ""loud"" that I'm not present at all with what I'm doing; leading to mistakes and disappointment with myself, as well as from my bosses, peers and friends. This is a very frustrating reality, but I'm dedicated to coming outside of myself and engaging fully with my surroundings. I feel that there must be some sort of blockage that keeps me trapped in my head, but I have trouble defining what that blockage is. I take accountability for the blockage, as I feel it's self created. 

I know I'm far from the only person that deals with this, but I'm curious to hear how other people overcome this issue and live on to lead productive and successful lives. I know if I don't work towards a better self now, this will remain an issue and grow more frustrating and inhibiting with time.

I'm looking forward to hearing your responses on this topic!"
885,How do i calm down from a schizophrenic episode please??? The voices won’t be quiet and i’m tempted to follow them and run away idk what to do.,"Alt account because i don’t even know if i should post this on here plus im scared of people bullying me again for it.

I had a schizophrenic episode and i’m still calming down from it all i hear is voices and im seeing things and hallucinating i hate it i’m really scared. 
My parents have gone shopping for christmas stuff and idk what to even tell them when they come back. I’m shaking really bad. I’m crying and have been for about 1 hour through the schizophrenic episode. 

The voices are loud and they are telling me im a horrible person and im worthless and i should run away from my house. I’m not going to i am in my bed trying to hide from the voices but it’s not working. I haven’t taken my meds today and i haven’t been to school for reasons i might say in chat but its kinda private if you really need to know. 

How do i calm down? I can’t stop the voices they are really loud i hate them so much i can’t do this much longer they won’t be quiet. I can see things in my room and it’s scary. I saw a figure and now i just saw a dog in the corner. I’m shaking really really bad and im sorry if it sounds weird or something but"
886,"My brain tricks me into believing that the future is looking bright, only for it to crumble and make me extremely suicidal (and delusional?) for no reason at all. Rinse and repeat.",How can I take myself seriously when I can’t tell if I’m not just faking or just unable to deal with whatever everyone else can.
887,I feel like I am getting worse.,"I (23f) have been seeing a psychiatrist for about 5 months and am taking LamoTRIgine, Sertraline, and Prazosin. I have an appointment scheduled to see a new psychiatrist soon because I have been feeling worse. Last night I got so obsessive I picked off an entire toenail and have to go to the urgent care. 

I have been feeling like I am completely stuck in my head and have no control over myself. Honestly, I am just looking for support because I don’t know what else to do."
888,My (22M) gf(21F) is severely depressed and keeps telling me shes going to commit herself to the mental hospital.,"We have been together for 4 years and have lived together for about 3 of those. When she is feeling good, she is amazing at work and at school, but she always reaches a critical limit before her depression kicks in and she loses all motivation to do anything. Its really hard to see because she blames herself so much. This week she quit a well paying, work from home job that she says she really liked. She was really good at it too. But her depression has kicked in and she lost all motivation. I recently got promoted at my job, and am making more money and I keep telling her i am more than willing to support her through this, but she doesnt want to even look at me or be around people. She keep insisting that to commit herself to a mental hospital. She has been there before and she has told me that staff was very abusive and horrible and that it only made her way worse in the past. And that was a mental hospital for minors (under 18) i cant imagine what atrocities go on in adult institutions. I really need to make sure she doesnt check herself in. Im afraid she will be assaulted or become even more depressed because of isolation. But im afraid to leave for work because im worries that when i come back home, she wont be here and ill have no way to track her down. She hasnt made many new friends since highschool, so im her only real pillar of support. I love her with all of my heart and i want to spend the rest of my life with her, but i need to talk her into getting help in a more healthy way. I set up a therapist appointment for her with a very skilled CBT psychotherapist, but she doesnt feel comfortable going to the appointment because its going to be over the phone and not in person. I really need some advice or stories of how you or a loved one has dealt with a similar situation. She really needs help sooner than later or im convinced i wont see her for months and that would break my heart. Im worried for her wellbeing.

Sorry for any misformatting or spelling errors. Typing this on my phone."

890,Just a talk about how I’m doing,"Lately I’ve been very stressed and overwhelmed. It’s been hard to even get up out of bed. I feel so emotionally and physically drained. There’s so much going on in my life and I’m so confused. It’s hard for me being as young as I am to process this. I hold in my emotions so much. There’s only so much I can hold in. It’s hard for me not to break down at random moments. I feel like my worlds slowly falling apart. I’m losing so many people. My thoughts get to me so much. I end up pushing people away. I feel like everything that’s been going wrong in my life is my fault. I’ve been having all of these bad days, and I don’t know what to do. My mind is all over the place. I feel alone. I’m always there for everyone, but I never have someone check in on me. Anyways thanks you for reading that. I hope you have a good day much love"
891,Living in a confusion,"So, my parents are in a brink of separation. But my both mom and dad hasn't even talk about this till now. My mom is currently very unhappy with her life and I'm fully supporting her to want a happy life. She's already involved with a guy and a guy has proposed to her and she accepted but she isn't finding the courage to say that to my father because of his past physical abuse on my mom and she's afraid what he might do to her. And now, I'm the confusion of what I should feel, what I should do or whom should I support. Note that, they separated (divorced) in the past and got back together and now the same thing is happening again. I really don't know what to feel right now. And what I should do for all this. This is becoming very frustrating for me as I'm the only one who knows all of these things. I don't know what I should do or feel or whom should I support."
892,I am just tired of being depressed,"Coming from an Indian household , depression is a major taboo in our society. Mum is convinced that depression is nothing and everybody has low days,but I want to shout at the top of my lungs and say that depression is not just having low days. Battling low self esteem and suicidal thoughts every frickin day is extremely draining. My mind is over exhausted from overthinking+COVID.I want to do so many things but still have zero willpower to  even eat.I only wish I could get my old self back.Just one last wish."
893,Liver test for strattera??,"Hi, I just had a quick question because I’m really confused and skeptical about this.

I’m in the US and my psychiatrist just prescribed guanfacine. I asked him to prescribe strattera instead because I have low blood pressure. His response was that I need to get a test of my liver functioning before he could prescribe it.

He’s been really weird lately with missing phone appointments and being inconsistent about whether or not he can prescribe anything (I asked him last year if he could prescribe something for ADHD and he said no, but now he says yes). 

I have not been able to find any information to suggest that it’s normal to require a liver test before prescribing strattera (from what I could find there’s been like 2 cases of liver problems? Ever? I think?). 

I’m 21 and have not had liver problems before, and don’t have a family history of them. I’ll do the test because it was already ordered as part of a panel for something else, but I have a serious fear of getting my blood drawn so if it wasn’t for that I would absolutely refuse.

So I just want to know if this is normal? Is there any actual reason why he would claim that my liver functioning has to be tested before prescribing this? Has anyone else been told this?"
894,What can I expect at my first Psychiatry appointment with it being online?,I just scheduled my first appointment with a psychiatrist and I’m anxious about what to expect with it being online. From past research I saw to show up early to sign additional paperwork but now I don’t even know what to expect in the slightest. Has anyone else started seeing a psychiatrist for the first in these COVID times?
895,Is my friend ok?,"So my friend went to the psych hospital last year because he took to much acid. He recovered just fine, however he continued to smoke weed. 6months later he did acid quit a bit of times as well as shrooms. Hes been living with me for 3 months or so and we recently went up to my brothers house to hang. At this point he hasn't done and psychedelics in around a month. However, he continued to smoke and he was slacking in school. Hes a smart ass kid but didnt really give a shit about school at the time. He went to take the SAT and afterward facetimed me and told me it went horrible. He felt like shit because he got a 1480 on the psat and couldnt finish any of the sections on the actual sat. This is when things started to snowball, he started acting strange and thought our friends and I were doing shit to him. He wasnt sleeping. The next day, we had school but he went out to skate. I thought he was only skating in my driveway but ended up running away. At this point i told my dad and his that something was up. We found him naked and he was really fucked up. Totally incoherent. Hes only been in childrens hospital for a week. He continues to call me and hes definetly getting better. Hes now coherent and can have a conversation. However he keeps telling me that this psychosis wasnt the same as the last time. He keeps going in and out and says he doesnt understand things anymore. I keep telling him that psychosis doesnt go away in a week and things get better but hes firm on believing hes not going to understand things anymore.  

Is there anyone whos gone through similar shit or could possibly tell me anything helpul. Thanks sm🙏🙏"

897,Babby trouble,"Hey there first of please forgive my spelling and grammar as i am not the best at them.  As the title says babby trouble and me and my girlfriend have a huge problem.  That problem is i am 40 and she is 46 so age is against us.  also she has pcos, secondary progressive MS and possibly has copd.  So the chance of her falling pregnant is almost 0%. Add to that i am also disabled with hyper mobility in my knees and ankles and sensory neuropathy.  That wouldn't stop me fathering a child and there's our problem.  

I love my girlfriend with all my heart and soul andi know she would be a wonderful mother.  She has said she would love to have my child because she thinks i would be a good dad.  As you can see there is no way to naturally get a child and fostering or adopting is out of the question because of our disabilities.  That brings me to what is affecting my mental health.  I am scared to death that my girlfriend will put my desire to be a dad first and leave me so i can get a partner that can give me a child.  I have told her that my love for her means more to me than becoming a dad.  But i am scared to lose her and i have told her this but my fear eats me up inside.  So wonderful people of redit is there any advice you could give me please"
898,I feel guilty for my mental illness...,"I struggle with anxiety, PTSD and depression. Unfortunately wearing a face mask actually causes really bad episodes to the point I get extremely dizzy and unable to focus. I feel guilty that I can't wear face masks even though it's literally out of my control because of how my brain works.
I don't want people to think I just don't want to wear a mask, I actually can't and I feel guilty because I wish I could be normal and wear a mask like everyone else. 😣"
899,Sex makes me feel dirty and cheap,"I (23F) know I'm wrong, and I know most people don't feel this way. But sex has always made me feel dirty cheap. Whenever I think of sex it's something dirty, private, disgusting, and wrong. It makes me feel exposed and weak, and the few times I want sex I am quickly overcome by feelings of guilt and shame. Bc I must be disgusting and wrong to want such a thing. 
Sex has to me always been something that I ""must do"" to keep my partners happy, not because it's something I want. It feels like a chore.

Now, being in a good, healthy relationship, I wish I knew how to not feel this way. I am trying to work on it, I'm just not quite sure how. Talking about sex is unnatural to me,  and I don't know how to express my thoughts and feelings. It's like a mental block stopping me from opening my mouth. All those intrusive, negative thoughts spins and makes me feel like shit anytime I try. It's just a terrible spiral.

I've tried speaking to my partner, but he doesn't get it.  Not that I know how to accurately describe my feelings. He has always had very positive experiences with sex, and has confided in me that his two last relationships was mostly based on sex. Given my very limited and mostly not great experience with sex, it has made me even more insecure. I'm struggling, and I don't know what to do.

I just need to know I can improve, and that I don't have to feel like this forever."
900,My story and my advice for others,"I had just left the Ukrainain army after completing my service, I had found my girlfriend had left me and moved away with a different person without me knowing, it broke my heart so I decided to start fresh. I moved to Australia where I struggled with addiction and I hated my job, I thought about suicide a lot. But that's when I stopped and looked at my life and thought ""what am I doing"". If you want to get out a hole first put down the shovel, I decided to join a support group and soon things started to Improve, I was surrounded with amazing people who listened and helped, I soon stopped my addiction after I realized it was doing more bad than good, I also left my job and pursued something I enjoyed. I also met an amazing girl and we started dating, a few years later we're married and I'm a happy stepdad to 2 kids. 

So to everyone struggling, you arent alone, there's people who will listen and support. Stay strong everyone 👍"
901,I have a terrible problem with using stuff that was mine when someone else already used it. Is this something related to mental health?,"i’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I can’t find any other place to ask. 

so some background:
My grandma has been staying in a guest room that i once used. She has been using my bed frame, mattress and dresser. Now i can’t use it and i can’t explain why. It just makes me so angry thinking that someone used MY things, I tried explaining this to my family but they just ask “You have no problem staying in one place? You use my stuff when i moved out, What’s the problem?” 
This could have started with my parents always walking into my room unannounced and my room has always been my safe space, so now when someone uses my old things i can’t put together it’s a safe thing now. 

I just can’t piece together why i can’t use the old stuff and now i have to explain to my grandpa who doesn’t understand some things, what my problem is with that room and why i can’t be in there yet. I’m just so confused and i’m freaking out having to explain this all."

905,just created reddit to ask this one question. i really need help,"I can't tell anyone else cause i promised her i won't. She's my best friend and as she says,i am the only person besides her mother she talks to about this issue. She suffers from depression and all her attempts (3,to be exact) to solve the issue medically have failed quite badly. The first two times she tried visiting a psychologist,but that didn't do any good. This time, she tried going to psychiatric hospital and, as she tells, she literally escaped from there. She says that although she was there with the diagnosis of depression, the personell treated her as though she was completely mad, and they gave her pills which were literal drugs and though she's out for 3 days, the effects haven't worn off yet and her pupils are still dilated. She lives in Russia, where the quality of the medical care(especially that relating to mental health) is not in the best condition. I was the one to encourage her to take a medical approach to problem and i was the one to ensure her that ""sooner or later it will be better"". Now she doesn't even want to hear that and she is now struggling more than ever (both mentally and physically) because of all the medicine they gave her in the hospital. I don't know how can i help her,telling her that she just wasn't lucky with the hospital will be straight up a spit in her face, i can't reach out to a mutual friend for an advise, because i promised her i won't tell anyone, so here i am. This post probably will drown among the others, but i really, really need advise. Thank you in advance"

908,Rel(ease)ief Breath (37),"Trans Being. Being Trans. Grateful. Exhausting. Divine. Proud. Sadness. Pain. Lack of Being in the body that I am currently Living in. Dysphoria at every given second to the point that i'm Hurting........Broken........Healing.

This is something that is a daily struggle, daily strength. I am learning to make peace with the things that I can not change in this very moment, that will change with time; my facial hair, my body parts, wearing what I want, accepting myself for me and embracing the empowerment that comes with that. Its difficult but I know that this is my purpose, this is meant for me and honestly I'd rather it no other way.

Being grateful for the ones who understand from the get go and learning to have compassion and empathy for the ones that it might take a lot more work and a lot more time with, my parents, distant family etc. Some days it feels like too much, some days im exhausted from the minute I have risen. 1:11. Make a wish. I know this all apart of my purpose and journey. Its greater than right now by living in the present.

Remember, its ok to feel tired, its ok to admit that I don't feel good today because their is always a higher reason for all of this. Sun shining, break through the clouds. Something I realized the other day is that in the midst of the worst storm possible, the blue sky hasn't ran away, its lingering behind the clouds, the Sun is still there, it hasn't gone anywhere. Its about Perspective and Self Awareness, to feel all the feels and sit in them but as well as, to know that this will only last for a short period of time. With the back end of Growth, Self Love, Self Fulfillment, Abundance and Miracles. God, Thank you For it All.

I love you.

909,I wish I could be more positive,"My biggest flaw is my pessimistic personality. People hate me for it. Even when there are a hundred good things going on in my life, my mind always wants to think of that one negative thing that makes me feel like shit.

I have a pretty low self esteem. And I'm also a victim of the infamous trio - ADHD, anxiety and depression. 

I just want to be more positive about life but I can't. I'm stuck in this vicious cycle that I'll probably never get out of."
910,COVID is a nightmare,"I had a nightmare about the pandemic.

I was at a party with so many people. No one wore masks but me, I didn’t even wear it properly. I had my mask on my chin as a usually do when I’m alone in public. But the thing is... I wasn’t alone. I was almost touching people’s shoulders.

I couldn’t put my mask properly because I had my teddy bear in my arms. It’s not a big teddy bear so I don’t understand why I couldn’t just use one hand to put my mask on.

When I attempted to put my mask on I had to put my teddy down on a table. A girl stopped me from putting on my mask by stealing my teddy bear... I had to chase her to get my bear back.

I didn’t know COVID had much of an affect on me.

It’s weird. Have you every had a nightmare that is about COVID."

912,Tips for dealing with depression fatigue,"Hello. This is my first post in this community. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for multiple years, and I’ve struggled with fatigue my entire life. I take Lexapro 20mg daily, and it works great for my mood, but the fatigue persists. 

No matter how much sleep I get, I always want more. I’ve implemented exercise into my lifestyle, but it doesn’t make a significant difference. The fatigue is pretty unbearable, as I’m a college student with a demanding schedule. I want to find a way to make this better before I have a full time career."
913,Doctor won't give me the right diagnosis,"I'm not wreally sure how to start this but basically I was put back on the same medication for my depression that has come back recently. The only problem is that I have periods of good, elevated moods, lots of ideas, feeling restless to the point where I feel like my head is exploding.

On the other hand I have days where I don't have any motivation and have clear signs of depression, to the point of suicidal thoughts.

This medication has only increased the symptoms on both ends of the spectrum and I feel very agitated. I come up with the most nonsense ideas, but at the same time I wreally try to be honest with myself and how I'm feeling.

Any advice?"
914,Online Counseling,"Has this worked for anyone? Can anyone suggest a source that has actually worked for them? Due to my social anxiety, making appointments is extremely difficult... I tried ""betterhelp"" briefly but left because the counselors it kept matching me with just... did nothing for me. it felt no different from talking to a bot, honestly. and one insisted on video calls... any suggestions? other experiences? I really need to speak with someone."
915,My entire self esteem is based on my looks and I’ve lost them. What do I do now?,"I need some help with how to build up self esteem from rock bottom. I used to be fairly attractive as a teenager, I would get attention from guys and was constantly told I was pretty. Even though I never really believed it at the time, I think I internalized it and I felt like if I didn’t look a certain way, I wouldn’t be accepted. Not just in relationships but even with my friends or at work (even though I had no basis for thinking this). 

Now I am 25 and I have put on some weight (about 20lbs in the last year). I don’t use tanning beds anymore. My hair is shorter/thinner and I have dark shadows under my eyes. I don’t really wear much make up/don’t know how and i don’t have the nicest clothes or style. I don’t get any attention from men, or anyone and I just feel like I’ve totally lost my identity. I have a boyfriend who has totally lost interest in me sexually (although he would never admit it). He avoids sex, never compliments my appearance and I feel he is embarrassed by me. 

I feel so insecure. And the worst part is I know in my rational side of my brain that attractiveness and beauty should not wholly comprise your self worth. But I don’t feel like I have anything else to fall back on other than my looks which have gone. this is so deeply ingrained I just don’t know how to get out of it and move on and accept I’m not attractive anymore but that that’s ok. 

Any thoughts/help? I just feel worthless and it’s really affecting my life. 

TL;DR My looks have faded and with it so has my self esteem."
916,How to stop?,"I am recovering from my ed, but I have no idea how to stop counting calories or to eat when I am hungry even though I 'reached my limit' for the day. I can't get myself to eat more if my stomach is grumbling because I 'reached' my limit. And I don't know how to stop counting calories it just stresses the hell out of me. Any help appreciated"
917,Have I been living life all this time with undiagnosed/untreated mental health issues?,"Tldr; I'm fairly new to reddit but I've been reading a lot of posts on mental health and have suspected for years that I could have clinical depression and anxiety. What types of treatment(s) are used besides medication?

Sometimes I go through bouts of depression where I cant seem to follow through with goals, stay on task, and generally feel down about life and relationships. A lot of times I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around people. I've dealt with this since childhood and always thought this was just how life works. There have also been periods where I've struggled with substance abuse but as I've got older that's been less frequent. I've thought about seeking help but have always feared negative coconsequences of that like being put on some kind of list that could possibly affect employment or other rights as a person living in the U.S.
 After reading some of these posts I think I should be taking these possible issues more seriously and seek help just to see what's going on with me.
What does seeking treatment involve besides being prescribed medication? Are there other means of treatment like how to think about things better or cognitive skills to work on, etc.?
Thanks in advance."
918,What is an appropriate way to thank you therapist/healthcare professional?,"So I had a bad bad bad breakdown recently. Won't go into details now, but if someone reading this for some reason wants to know, I am always up for talking about it because apparently that helps.

I went into a big crisis, and the crisis team here (don't know the english term for it) was so kind to me and so nice, and i feel like thanking them more than just saying thank you. But I don't know what is appropriate, because it is their job. And I don't want to look silly if I bring them a card or something, but really just want to let them know that I really appreciate and admire them and that they should know how good they are at their job.

920,Im not sure where to go for help?,"Ive had a bad shutdown and depression every November for 4 years now. I have quit my job from being unable to leave bed every November the last several years and my college work slacks and I fall behind. I know I am doing it but can't seem to stop being self destructive. Today I called in, Im 3 weeks behind on lectures, and  worry I am doing it again. Where do I turn to for help in this? I upturn my life every year and it's like Im in the backseat watching myself do it. Who can help this bad impulse? I know it's bad and today Im telling myself Ill catch up and not miss more work but it's like I go out of control. What kind of person do you see to help this?"
921,How to bounce back,"So I've been depressed on and off for the better part of 11 years and have definitely let myself go in the process.

I just hope I haven't done too much damage to the point where I can't remedy those issues."
922,Having a very bad night. I’ve been maintaining a face for so long it’s fell off and I just can’t put it back on.,Have barely moved from my bed today.

Maybe if I just keep sleeping It’ll go away
923,I Feel like a potential sociopath?,"Hey. You read the title, you probably don't know what I'm talking about, so sit back, relax, and listen to my story. IDK if anyone will see this but I just feel like writing a diary entry and share it. So here we go.

Let me give you a little context about me. I'm a 16-year-old who likes art and math I guess, that's how I usually describe myself. I've had some teenage angst periods from 13 to 15, where I frankly don't know what happened. I have the worst memory of concrete details except when it comes to some random sad/hurtful things. I have many memories I have internalized, such as (I don't know if this was real or a dream that I had ) when my best friend, a few years ago, told me that I seem nice when you start talking to me, but if you get to know me better, you're not as nice or something like that.

My whole life feels like a paradox. I genuinely do not remember the last time I felt love towards something/someone (except my mom, brothers, and best friend), yet I occasionally have sleepless nights thinking about love. Sometimes, though, I feel a real fatherly connection to my drawings, which may be weird.

I'm usually aware of my problems, but I rarely know how to solve them. I have been fat for my whole life and despite some tries of losing weight, It's been over a year since I worked out. I'm socially inept most of the time with my heart racing when I talk with someone I usually don't talk to, but I can't for the life of me fix that.   Many times I feel like my friends from high school don't actually want to talk to me because I'm weird and anxious all the time.

And then there is my superiority complex. This is probably one of my biggest problems I feel. My friends at school most of the time label me as the smartest one in class, the problem is I am both aware of this and not at the same time. I am usually ashamed of the top scores I get. I got 800/800 SAT math and am soon getting my full TOEFL score (4 sections: first two sections I got 28/30, 30/30, and am waiting for the rest). I usually don't say anything unless asked or I just lie and say that I got lower scores. I feel like I'm good at art, I feel pride in my drawings, but I also know that I can improve. 

With all that said, one part of me just hopes that this whole thing is just puberty and I'll just grow out of it, but I doubt it. I seriously don't know what is wrong with me, but I can only guess, and I guess that I am some kind of sociopath with anxiety. What do you think?"
924,My anxiety wont stop,im 16 i have been dealing with really bad anxiety since i was 11. it feels like it controls me its hard for me to get out of bed somedays because of how bad it gets. my thoughts feel like they are racing all the time and nothing makes sense i feel like im going crazy. i havent been able to go to a therapist yet because of issues with money. its hard for me to sleep at night because of my non stop anxiety. any help to deal with my anxiety would really be appreciated.
925,I hurt the feelings of my best friend. The though of hurting him makes me threw up. I already lost some pounds. I need help.,"Tdlr: I hurt one of my best friends feelings. The though of me hurting his feelings made me anxious and I had no appetite and every time the thought of hurting him crossed my mind I had to threw up. Even though I apologised and he told me all was good, I knew he was lying. So when everything was okay again and we talked like before that incident everything went back to normal. The anxiousness and the urge to throw up went away. Now two weeks later, the though of him or someone mentioning his name, makes me anxious and want to throw up again. Wtf is wrong with me ? Shouldn’t be everything be back to normal ? 

I (F,21) have been feeling pretty bad the last few weeks. I hurt some of best friends feelings. It was so bad, he didn’t talk to me at all and he has been really distant. Wich is extra depressing since we used to talk to each other every day. I apologised to him, several times. He told me its all good, wich I know was a lie. A mutual friend of us  told me that he has been really hurt since then. He told him he didn’t think I would hurt his feelings ever, especially since we knew eachother for several months and used to talk every single day. We laught together and talked about our ups and downs in daily life. Everything you could think off a good friendship is made off.
Well he was quiet and distant for a few days and these days were the worst. I don’t know why but just the though of hurting his feelings and that this friendship is never going to be the same made me really anxious. It was so bad I couldn’t even eat and every time I would think of him I had to threw up. It was really bad so I wrote him a text apologising and telling him how much I appreciate him and all the time we had together was special to me and that I would never do something to hurt his feelings intentionally. So we met up with our mutual friend. I apologised again. He told he would be over it. Mind you, he didn’t tell me at all that he was hurt and why my words hurt his feelings so bad. Our mutual friend told me what was going on. Nonetheless, since then  it’s been like before that incident. All has been good. All the anxiousness and the throw ups have been gone since. Now, two weeks later, I do have the same symptoms as before. I get anxious and want to threw when the thought of him crosses my mind or when someone mentions his name. Wtf ist wrong ? Everything was fine. Why did this affect me so much at the time ?  And why is it still affecting me so much now that everything is fine ? It’s just exhausting and I think I lost a pound or two or even three. Can someone tell me how to cope with that ? I really need help"

927,Feeling Burnt Out,"I am spent.

It absolutely feels like I am running on fumes these days, and, as we head towards the end of this hellscape of a year, I am most certainly feeling burnt out.

And the worst part is that it’s not concentrated from one thing. It seems to be everything that’s feeding it. It’s the election. It’s Covid. It’s the daily helping of bullshit that seems to get served up without fail. It’s life across the board right now, and it’s exhausting.

When you’re feeling this drained, it’s hard to find motivation to accomplish anything, because both your body and mind are just telling you no... and guess what? That’s okay. It’s okay for you to tell yourself that you need a break. We don’t always have to be constantly be pushing past, hoping it’ll just go away.

Sometimes we just need to slow down, process everything that is happening around us and take some moments for us.

On my podcast this week, I decided to use my time to talk about the burnout I’m feeling right now, and really to let you know that I know you’re struggling with it, too. How could you not? It’s a shit show out there. But you’re not alone, and often knowing that at least provides a bit of comfort as we keep doing our best to deal."
928,My mom does not believe that I have anxiety,"Earlier this year, I started going to a boarding school. It was all great at first, until I started feeling really bad. 

I spoke to a therapist, who told me that it sounded like I had developed symptoms of anxiety.

She spoke to my mom about it, and it seemed that she took it seriously at first, but now, around three months later, she doesn’t believe me when I tell her how I feel and says that I am just “nervous”.

I feel stuck. I took a little break from the school to stay home, and then I got sick, making my break a little longer. I am going back tomorrow. In was originally excited about it, but I can feel something that feels like a panic attack boiling in my stomach. I don’t know what to do."

930,"Am I depressed, maybe something else?","Reason I ask about depression is I hear that something like this can be a sign of depression. I'll keep this pretty short. I've been cleaning my room for about half an hour listening to some music I really like. I sat down to take a rest for about a minute and start messing around with an empty notebook. Out of the damn blue, I just feel super sad, tired, and lazy. The notebooks even feel kind of hard to pick up and I really just wanna lay down. This happened around five minutes ago and decided to write here because well... curiosity. Thanks"
931,Overthinking - Thinking the Worst,"Hello,

I have been struggling against something for a number of months that is a difficult and ongoing trauma. It’s destroyed my mental health and I am left consumed with anxiety all day long.

One of the worst and main symptoms contributing to my condition is that I continually think the worst will happen. I’m constantly terrified the trauma I’ve suffered will resurface and I will have to deal with it over and over again. The situation I went through is basically over with, but just small reminders place me in a position where I can hardly move and leave me terrified.

I constantly think the worst will happen. That this situation will resurface and my life will always be hell. In reality, it probably isn’t rational. But I can’t stop thinking this way.

Does anyone suffer from this or can relate? Perhaps there is a medical name for this type of thinking? 

I am at my wits end. At this point in my life the chances of my fears occurring are infinitely small and I know that my reasoning of the worst occurring is unreasonable, yet my mind believes them as a possible reality."

933,A &lt;1 minute exercise to connect with your feelings. All you need is a mirror,"Here's a quick experiment if you haven't tried mirror work before.

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jawEase your shoulders downUnclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

&gt;I love you  
I am going to take care of you  
You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**How did it feel?**

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

That's why I am sharing this with you.

If you find it helpful, please share it with a friend who needs it &lt;3"
934,How I'm dealing with insomnia.,"I do this thing when i close my eyes i roll them in circles gets me close to hitting that perfect zone to fall asleep in and if i wake up and go to washroom i have to do some more closed eyes ete rolling.

Warning.... It causes a  pretty intense feeling/sometimes trips me out so....

So its not always a sure thing sometimes i do have to stop trying it cause my body will have adverse reactions depending on the day

Has anyone reading this.... experienced the sensation of falling while trying to fall asleep its like my body fights my mind thankfully its rare and if i control my stress levels its not there."
935,Does anyone else get random violent visions in their head?,"I randomly get violent ideas. I'll be eating food and wonder if i can stab myself with the fork... I'll take a bath and think of drowning myself in it... I'll look in the mirror and want to break it so i can slit my wrists with the glass.
 
I know i have issues and i know i am partially suicidal. But i still think i'll never actually harm myself as I've never done it before. I also feel like i dont actually want to get counselling."
936,"Idk what to do nothing bad is happening, if anything my life is going reasonably well atm but I feel so bad and depressed for no reason","I have SPD and depersonalisation disorder (neither diagnosed though) and maybe anxiety/depression and am 13f. My dad is really confident and expects me to be confident too but I am not. I hate it.

I just... idk where to start. Life is going fairly well, I’m doing well at school and my crush/good friend has started talking to me way more which is good. But......... I just hate everything. It feels so stupid to be saying this because nothing is actually wrong. Idk where I got it from, but I’m paranoid that I might be going death which I’m probably not but I feel like I am, and even just slight earache now completely destroys me because playing piano and cello and music just means the world to me. 

I’m just finding it so hard to do anything or get the motivation. I feel so tired, and I’ve started feeling physically ill and idk if that’s related. Tomorrow (Thursday) I really want to skip school and just cover myself in blankets to trap myself and read fluffy fanfics because that is my coping mechanism. I want to listen to music and play piano all day. I don’t want to go to school and have to deal with... people. I quite like the learning part of school though, apart from english. 

Don’t get me wrong, I have a lot of friends, and I love them, but I just can’t be bothered. I feel like absolute shit all the time and I genuinely have no idea why so I’m just venting here. If anyone has any kind words they’ll be appreciated."
937,What resources can extroverts use to avoid depression during quarantine?,"I’m not very extroverted, and I’m doing fine mentally with or without quarantine. But my roommate absolutely loves being around other people and needs that energy to stay sane. The official lockdown #2 just hit today and she’s already not doing great.

I’m no stranger to mental health issues and what warning signs to look for, but I’m wondering if there’s anything I could point her towards to avoid feeling so alone? Therapy’s great, but not feasible (broke college kids), and she’s been burned by the campus counselors once already so I don’t want to refer her there (they literally just hung up on her). I’d offer my company but my social battery runs out quick and it’s just not fun for anyone after that.

Any self-help books, chat forums, pen pals, etc.? 

Us introverts really got lucky in 2020."

939,"Boyfriend is going through serious anxiety + depression, what are some things I can say or do which will be effective in making him feel better?","I""m not going to get into super detail here, but basically my boyfriend is going through some really rough times right now, and I want to be there and do as much as I can. He's experiencing heart clenching anxiety for the first time ever, and on top of that he's just feeling pretty shitty with a lot of things. Overall he feels frustrated as his anxiety and depression haven't gone away and it's been a month already since it started.

 Obviously I'm not a psychological professional or expert here, but I at least know what it feels like to have depression and anxiety, so I completely understand where he's coming from. I know not to say stupid things like, ""Just be happy, simple as that."" etc. However, again I'm gonna say I'm not an expert.  I don't want to throw seemingly helpful and encouraging words at him when it's just making things worse. I love him so much and I just want to be able to be there for him as much as I can possibly be.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here are things I say to my boyfriend to make him feel better, please let me know if they're actually damaging. He's said I've made him feel better, but I don't know if he's just saying that because he's in a state of self-denial, and feeling ungrateful in life because he can't comprehend or care about things right now. My intentions with these words is to make him feel like he isn't alone, that things are going to get better even if it takes time, he's actually a great person, and to make him be less harsh on himself. 

\-Everything will be alright

\-I believe in you

\-I am there all the way

\-You are a great person

\-Accept that you're currently going through anxiety and that whatever you're doing now to function is perfectly alright

\-Other people are going through the same feelings and thoughts you are, you're not walking alone

\- Don't feel ashamed if you want to seek professional help with your anxiety

\-You are worthy

\-You're going to get through this, these things just take time

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Also here's some quick research I've looked at, please let me know if these are true. 

\- Recently found out that you shouldn't say, ""Everything will be alright.""

\- You shouldn't give your own personal experience

\- Sometimes just being there for a person is all you can do

\- Ask a person what you could do for them

\- Listen instead of giving feedback

\- Don't be forceful, like telling a person to BE positive 

\- One last thing, don't portray getting medication or professional help as something that is a shameful , or unreachable option.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this, please definitely give me your advice on what to say."

my mental health has improved since i started, and despite it still being early to tell for definite i have a strong feeling that my medication is helping me. however, since i started antidepressants i have done barely anything. on some days the side effects have been too bad, so i don’t count those days — but for the most part i have been so low, so unmotivated and i am so bored of my life.

i want to do more with myself. i want to do things that i enjoy. but right now i can’t seem to push myself to do anything, and it’s getting me in a cycle of: doing nothing -&gt; being depressed about doing nothing -&gt; doing nothing as a response to the depression.

946,My friend randomly will leave me for no reason for long periods of time.,"I'll try to explain it all in one post. 

My friend believes he is controlled by ""entities"" that make him do things against his will. When he changes ""entities"" he says he gets really jittery and acts strange physically and he will pretend to be a character. (Usually animals)

He does this multiple times a day and some days he will just flat out block me for literally no reason. His ""entities"" usually say that they're gonna make him kill himself but eh never does that. 

-----

I have a few theories:

He has a Personality Disorder and he does this to try and manipulate me into becoming desperate for him to unblock me.

He actually thinks he's a different person, possible mild Schizophrenia.

-----

He thinks I have the entities too, I used to believe in them but I have since realized that i have something else that is actually real going on with me and I'm trying to get professional help. Every time I bring this up to him he says I'm a ""bad entity"" who ""lies and manipulates"".

One last thing to mention, he absolutely despises people with mental illness especially Autistics, Schizophrenics, and people with Personality disorders.

Also I am 16 and not very well educated in anything outside of music and video editing. He's 14."

949,Is my friend okay and why is she draining me emotionally?,"I have a friend. The more I get to know her the more interesting I think it is. I like her and she is nice, but I am emotionally drained after being with her. I don’t know what to do, is this normal, I am also a bit concerned about her. 

- She is very emotional. Sometimes starts crying, seems extremely lonely, up and down.
- After talking to a guy once, she will be mad if he takes more than 10 min to reply and ask very serious questions before the first date even. 
- She is kinda childish and very touchy feely sometimes. Clapping when seeing one and saying hooray as a small child, and looking sad/hurt when I rejected a hug because of corona.
- When she broke up with her boyfriend, she posted a pic on facebook of them and said he left. Also did that with her boyfriend before him.
- She is older, but still think she is our age as me and our other friends, thinking it is natural for her to get invited for all the parties by people our age and sound sad when we get more invitations than her. Goes for much younger guys intentionally, while keep complaining she can’t trust younger guys because of her age and gets very sad about her age.
- She talks a looot about herself, write weird things to people she barely knows like I am a good person, open and honest, I love my friends and kids, and I see you as a good man, my ex hurt me so much and I want something serious I am not to play with, why didn’t you call me back yet.

She is smart, speaks multiple languages and has a nice job.

I don’t know if she is okay, or what I can say, but I am mentally exhausted after being with her sometimes and I feel so guilty as she is a kind woman trying to please everybody."
950,Apathy.,"Nothing excites me anymore; there is nothing that can make me truly happy. I can't feel anything and I haven't for some time . My life has only been able to progress due to the routine of school, as the UK have for some reason still allowed schools to continue like usual. I feel like I'm currently just existing, until I don't, I guess. My head feels heavy and my mind is foggy. I have no friends, or no one to really talk to outside of school. Through self-sabotage, I didn't really bother to maintain friendships, though it's fine because I can convince myself I don't really care - until I don't. I spend a lot of money at times, just to feel like I care about something for a few days, but the feelings of apathy come flooding in and I am left to submerge. I feel hollow and empty; I'm without soul and I don't know why.

I want to get help. I want to improve, and to feel happy - because right now I don't feel anything. I haven't for the last two years, but the lack of structure over the 6 months of lockdown only amplified my feelings of worthlessness and lack of meaning to my life. 

I need to get help, because my mental state has been deteriorating over the course of this year especially. But, I don't know how. I have been repressing my emotions for so long that I cannot communicate them directly. I don't want to involve my parents because then it's real. Then, I have to commit - and I don't want to be labelled forever, or pitied. School counselors are a joke, and doctor appointments are currently done over the phone - plus I'm not 18 so my parents will have to be involved. I just don't know what to do."

953,Is it normal to feel this way?,"To start I am a 19 male living in Los Angeles. I fully support myself but as time goes by I feel like things are constantly changing. Especially me and where I’m at mentally. I wanna say it’s better but a lot of times I’m so confused. I wonder am I on the right track, if I’ll achieve my goals, and be truly happy. 
I had a rocky childhood because we were always moving and my parents were abusive. When I started high school things got really complicated with dcfs getting involved. I spent the remainder in foster care and with my grandmother until I decided I wanted to try being on my own due to conflict with my grandmother. I’ve been renting with roommates ever since then. 
I’ve had some difficulty with continuing school recently and I’m only doing 6 units at community college. When I first moved out I was working two jobs and I really burned myself out. I was super underweight, not managing money, and just felt like I was forcing myself to go forward. A year and a half later I’ve fixed most of those problems. I eat healthy and right, have saved some money, and just passed my driving test. I hope to get a car soon. 
I guess a lot of what I struggle with is fear of missing out. Most people my age don’t have half this responsibility. And when I see on social media them celebrating holidays with their families, parents getting them their first car, and at nicer colleges taking more classes I get sad. I know not everyone is living to good life but I feel like I’m really in the sh*t sometimes. I was fortunate enough to get into therapy through dcfs during my first year on my own which was great. I can be pretty solitary but it was nice to have someone with me to help me navigate things. And that first year was hard. I’d just gotten out of a 1 year relationship and I felt so lonely. I feel like I’m learning so much so fast. Some of the decisions I’ve made have been great and been not so great.
Things are different now but I just wanna know is this what it feels like to be an adult. Maybe always a little lost? Will things be all squared away before I know it? The thing that makes me feel better is that this experience will make me a smarter and stronger person."
954,Living Alone during the pandemic,"Hi, I'm on a UC Berkeley design team that's doing some research on living alone, especially during the pandemic.

We've put together a quick survey that aims to gain user input on our product idea, and it would be amazing if the members here considered filling it out! The data from the form will not be shared outside of our team and all survey participants will be anonymous. Hopefully, we'll be able to make an impact in your lives in the near future.

955,Narcissistic abuse,"I am 21 (f) and my mum is married to someone we will call Harry on this post for wanting to be anon. He is a narcissist and a drug user but I did not know all of this until they split up. Long story short he has abused my mum emotionally and physically (low end physical spitting in face etc) and emotionally abused me, my mum got a non molestation order against him as he wouldn't leave us alone after she left him, this escalated to him breaching it and me having a harassment charge against him, he was sending an average of 100 messages to me a day involving threats and then loving messages and then back to spiteful horrible messages including his and my mums sex life. I am estranged from my own father so I got really close to Harry and I wouldn't even say so much like a father way (although it was also) but he was like a really good friend who I could always have a laugh with and thought cared for me deeply. His harassing messages would go from ""I love you both so much I haven't lost one this time, I've lost 2"" to then ""Get your mum to meet me, she's in DANGEROUS shit and you're not helping the situation"" ""I have a new woman now, ALL 3 of her children went to uni"" (my mum has 3 children, my 2 siblings went to uni, I didn't)
We went to crown court yesterday and he was mouthing horrible stuff through the glass and if looks could kill we would both be dead, he pleaded guilty to breaching the non molestation order and harassment charge. I expected him to play fake tears to the judge and stuff and for that to naturally make me feel genuinely upset and guilty for putting him in prison but nothing. He showed no remorse or empathy for what he's done and said, he has been given a 20 month sentence. I'm posting this because I feel so upset due to the fact that I miss him? I miss all of the good times I had with him and I feel distraught he is out of my life even though I know he's a narcissistic abuser meaning he has put on a false personality and that I never knew the real him, heck the judge literally called him a serial abuser due to previous charges. What I'm hoping to receive from you guys is I know it sounds crazy but sort of confirmation that he is a narcissist and whether they actually care about you and just how long it'll be until I feel better.

957,Will I be always lonely,"Hi there,

Loneliness has always impacted me in my life since I've never been good at approaching people, or rather approaching the right people. Most of my friends I have were initially the first once who started conversations and started to initiate a friendship. 

I'm afraid that as things change, friends will go, but new once won't come. I don't know if I have some kind of social anxiety, but I'm always afraid to show my true self so finding friends that fit to me is rare since I'm always kinda different around new people. I guess I am afraid of people don't liking me or people thinking I'm boring. And always failing to make new friends makes me even more insecure and lonely, it's like a vicious cycle. 

So I never am the first to try working towards a friendship unless I can clearly see the other person likes me and I feel save enough to think this could be a friendship. 

So basically I am too afraid of rejection which is why I'm always waiting for people to approach me. Even If I like them, I'm never sure if they won't get sick and bored of me. 

I really don't know how I can change that, does anyone have the same issue and has success in overcoming this?"
958,I have nobody to talk to,"This isn’t me just not having someone to talk to, but I have fucked yo and I just can’t function right now.
I don’t know if this is going to help, it probably isn’t but I need to try something because everything keeps getting worse"

960,Anybody try SAMe pills from Walmart?,"I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression last year but was to scared to take any medication, I started walking 30min a day &amp; started taking SAMe pills from Walmart, I feel a huge difference.."
961,idk lol,"I don’t want to get on any medication. I’ve heard the side effects can be worse than the mental health issue itself. But maybe I should consider it now. I started feeling “down” since 7th grade, and have been diagnosed with only anxiety since. But I feel like I have both anxiety and depression. I feel like every day is the same... I do my 8hr, I work on homework, I spend time with my family (I still live with my parents)... but whenever I’m alone the numbness comes. I feel like I’ll never shake my depression or anxiety. I never feel good enough. It makes me want to cry if I don’t keep myself busy with endless social media scrolling. 
I know I’m my heart I am good enough. I have a good job, I have a loving family and boyfriend, I get good grades, I’m growing my nest egg to buy my own place someday... but it all feels like it’s all for nothing. I’ll never be fully happy. I’m a fake. I’ll never have the happiness that I see other people experiencing. I wish I could just leave, start over in a new country with a new job, leaving behind everyone and everything I’ve known. I feel so lost yet so bored on a familiar path. Nothing makes sense but everything makes sense. I hate reliving every embarrassing or stupid moment I’ve ever had before I sleep or in between quiet moments. I hate this brain fog that I can’t shake. I hate how tight my chest feels 90% of the day. I’m physically so tired. I’m fat, I’m mean online to people with different opinions than my own liberal thoughts, I’m worthless, not as good as the next girl, I’ll never achieve my dream job and will live a mediocre life. Not sure if I’m just wallowing, being a pessimist, or just being realistic to the shit show of life. I just know my brain never feels the way that it should, the way it does when I’m having a good day. Idk."
962,I guse this isnt normal.,"Hi i'm 18 (m). When it's dark, i see.... Thing.
Most of the time it is gray human-ish figure standing in midle of the room, or seeing them peeking from behind doors/closet. But recentyl i started to see like, faces when i close my eyes. Not ""high quality"" just gray outlines of deformed heads. Smiling with quite sharp teeth. Just for few sec tho. Does anyone know what culd it be, and how can i ""fight"" this."
963,Today was a good day,"Woke up before my alarm clock, took a cold shower, finished my shift and I just got home from a walk to treat myself and to welcome the oncoming evening. Now I'm going to play some video games, eat dinner and do some guided meditation before bed, those are my evening plans. Thanks for reading everyone, take care now. ✌"

965,Life in a day of a drug addict,"I remember before I tried drugs, I asked someone what it was like. They said “it’s like a nice warm/numb feeling, it’s the best feeling ever, idk how to explain it really”  but now if someone were to ever ask me what it’s like, I would tell them.. 

”Its like spending every single penny you ever had, on drugs. 
Its like going days without eating even if you were starving, but you needed the withdrawals to stop. 
Its like having to lie to every family member and friend youve ever had. 
It’s like lighting a whole pack of cigarettes and never smoking one. 
Its like waking up hating yourself from the shame and guilt. 
Its like going into withdrawals every 8 hours unless you had more dope to do.
Its like never attending any family event because you needed to get high. 
Its like everyone eventually stopped inviting you anywhere or talking to you. 
Its like everything was on your drug dealers time. If they said a hour. You’ll wait 5 hours or more.
It’s like being late to every single day of your life even if you started getting ready long before you were supposed to be somewhere.
Its like losing so much weight you can’t fit into any of your clothes. 
Its like losing everything you’ve ever owned in your entire life. 
Its like nobody believing a word you said, even if it was the truth. 
Its like being a prisoner inside your own head. 
Its like contemplating suicide every single day. Its like never being scared to die, because that’s what you wanted. 
Its like trying to shut your brain up for even five minutes. It was worth that little time of peace. 
Its like seeing your family beg to spend time with you only for you to leave and go get high. Because stopping wasn’t an option. 
Its like you’d do anything for more.
It’s like talking in circles for hours about absolutely nothing.
It’s like losing days,weeks,months, years off your life and not even realizing it happened.
It’s like going inside places you’d never go before you did meth.
Its like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.
It’s like thinking everyone is out to get you and people can read your every thought.
Its like walking into treatment 100 pounds with the clothes on your back and being scared to death. 
Its like giving your entire life away..”
So if you’re ever curious like I was, please at least know the truth. Curiosity killed the cat, and it’ll kill you too"

967,Advice on dental care with Depression,Hey I'm 14 and I'm recently been really grossed out and disappointed with myself with my non existent dental hygiene routine. Depression has made it really hard for me to do simple things such as brush my teeth daily and I'm rlly starting to see it (my teeth are a little yellow) and to too it off I have braces so I obviously need to take care of my teeth better. So I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me to do especially when I don't have the motivation to get up and brush my teeth?
968,Me and my friends being an idiots,So two weeks ago me and my friends we 4 so anyway we sat in my car chatting and being acting stupid when my friends said something and i acted like i was grossed by so i open the car day and walked away when my other friend jumped to the driving sit and and reversed and drive around at first i sat on the car till he reverse and i get off and start acting like they stole my car ofc they didn't go too far and when they saw me tried he parked and stoped also me and one of friends sent the same text to our friend! I just looked at him and laughed like a dumbass! I'm so happy I'm was able to met them!
969,When You've Had Enough,"I've recently lost everything of any sentimental value I have of my mother (she's dead), not to mention the entirety of my 20's, in memories stuck in the cloud, on my g mail account. 

I followed all of the prompts for weeks and they still can't verify me because I made the mistake of adding a secondary email I'd lost access to, as an additional verification, in addition to my verifiable number that does go through.

Had I kept it strictly associated with my number, I'd had recovered my account immediately, but I'm tech-illiterate and didn't realize that was a horrible idea to add a secondary email account for verification.. 

I just figured, flippantly: ""cool. New google account feature their advertising, lets do it!""

Over the years I became complacent, not having my passwords written down or having my memories backed up in multiple places; not with the ease and laziness of a simple phone transfer app! 

But with my luck.. it didn't back up properly, nor restore, this time around, to my phone; as I needed to factory reset in a failed attempt to fix some bugs on my phone.

I thought I had my google password written down correctly, but that wasn't the case... 


_______________________________________________________


I'm accepting that it'll never get better, my feelings of this existential loss..

I can't shake apathy nor nihilism, after it's taken it's grip on me a month back, and especially after a recent stint in the psyche ward... 

My mental health afflictions are medication (and therapy) resistant, after exhausting all of my healthcare options of medications and therapy programs that are available, in the past 30 years.. been on every drug on the market, since childhood to no avail.

Therapy is just paying to talk to someone who's paid to pretend to care and actually pay attention.. so I feel more isolated and pathetic when each season ends because I'm merely a paycheck to them..

I have family and friends, but they're no longer there for me, due to my overbearing and distant nature; and from the nature of having of their own families that need them more, and immediate family comes first; so I get it.

The ""Friends"" that still answer the phone; they allow me to vent, but have no words of support because they can't relate..

I just want euthanasia in a calming profesional setting.

Suicide would merely only bring shame and embarrassment to my family for religious reasons, a sense of comic relief, as they are nothing but indifferent towards me.

They wouldn't mourn my death.. they'd welcome it.

I have a two young nieces that are young enough to forget the trauma of my existence, it would destroy my sister for a while, but she would move on quickly because she always gets back on her feet and has plenty to keep her busy and distracted..

I plan on getting a short term-job (hopefully not catch covid, so I can control the end of my life) and save up enough for my casket and burial; request no service bc thats more money..

Before my 31st birthday.. I can't do it for one more year.. 

These aren't cognitive distortions.. I am of sober and sound mind, as I write this with confidence.

I'm comforted by the idea no longer having consciousness, just darkness.. and gone.. no more existing.. rot in the ground, feed the worms. and give back to the soil of the world that broke me."

971,Is it possible for warts to cause mental problems?,"I have a very strong immune system (tested) but I've 4 of  them so far in my life and they're always super stubborn, even if i start treating them early - one took over a year to get rid of. I literally can be happy about getting rid of one and then it'll come back somewhere else. It just makes me feel super hopeless and like my efforts are not paying off at all.

Ontop of that i developed trauma level reaction when I find something mildly resembling a wart (panic and hyperventilation included). It has led me to a few times when i damaged my skin by using acid because of a false alarm. It literally makes me go into full on hysteria.
After the first one as a child I got a feet phobia. They disgust me and I have to wash my hands throughly a few times after touching mine (even at the periods when I didn't have any warts). 
Recently I got one on my right hand and I will never see it as 'clean' again, it'll always be the hand where the wart might come back someday.

Tbh I'm surprised with it bc i never had any serious mental issues (only mild body image ones) and this panic thing came out the blue after the third wart i had. 
I'm writing this in an absolutely hysterical state, bc i found an yet another potential wart and this time I'm pretty sure it's not a false alarm :("
972,How to know what am I feeling and why? I can’t remember the last time I felt at peace and didn’t have nightmares,"I usually can recognize my unhealthy patterns (codependency, negative spiraling) and I know that they make me feel a certain way, I usually then journal, meditate, talk it out, listen to podcasts. Now I feel SLIGHTLY heavy but consistently? Nothing makes me feel relaxed and from the moment I wakeup I feel very sensitive to everything. I have nightmares everyday that feel really heavy, often it’s either seeing people not being nice to me or me not being able to escape. I’m exhausted after sleep. How can I know what’s the source? I’m really just tired I can’t even rest."

974,Kinda dope my therapist is gonna come home to me. lol,"I have OCD and some other stuff which makes it extremely hard for me to leave the house. Now my therapist is coming home to me instead, and that’s kinda interesting."
975,Does anyone else wish their parents didn't care?,"Sorry if the title sounds insensitive. And just to preface, I (M 24) do love my mom and respect my dad. But I just wish they were out of my life. They were good when they were raising me, but I just don't want to feel their presence anymore. I want my life to be similar to those fish who give birth to their children, and then don't give a seconds thought to them afterwards. I just want to be free of the hold they have on my mind. I don't want to think about how they perceive my decisions in life. It's not that I just don't want to disappoint them. I mean, I've done enough of that by not finishing college (burned out with only 1 semester left) and never being in a relationship. I don't even want them to root for me or be there for me, which they try to do. But I just want to be alone, with only me to answer to and no one else (in terms of accepting who I am). I've been isolating myself ever since college in order to achieve this end, to the point where I've even moved across the country to get away from it all. I often fantasize about changing my name and just disappearing from the face of the earth. And if I do come to the decision to commit suicide (which I'm not leaning towards now btw), I don't want them to know or feel responsible. Because I do care about their feelings. Does anyone else feel this way or am I just a horrible son?"
976,Suicidal loved one,"Hi everyone, I hope everyone’s okay.
I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and recently he fell to depression, he’s always had tendencies towards it. Ultimately the relationship has been really toxic since he “cheated” (he sexted and send nudes with several girls while we never even do that) on me, I was devastated, he said it didn’t mean anything at all but to me it did so I wanted to end things. He has told me about his depression before and his thoughts and I was afraid to leave him like that. He started going to therapy and getting treatment but stopped. I discovered he still texts the same girls but erases the conversations and it hurts me a lot honestly. He’s supposed to go to therapy. Every day the time we spend together is more toxic, I try so hard to be there for him...
Although it was been worse everyday, he’s been telling me about his suicidal thoughts since stopped going to therapy. Every now and then he drops the bomb on how much he wants to kill himself and how much he hates life and I just can’t handle it anymore, I just want to end things with him but I don’t want him to commit suicidal, Id feel super guilty. My mental health is deteriorating everyday... what would you do?"
977,I am a psycopath,[deleted]
978,I know the holidays are the worst time for some people.,"I tend to have severe depression around holidays. Not enough money, not enough time for people, and especially this year, not enough time with people I love. 

It's going to be a whole different thing this year with covid. I decided to start my holiday movie tradition this week and it's cheered me up a bit. Just some laughs and feel good moments that make me like this terrible season."
979,What should I do?,"Hello, I need your advice. I talk to my best friend almost every day. I'm almost always the first one to message her. I sent her my usual texts but she didn't respond. I decided to send her multiple emails asking if she was fine but she still didn't respond. At that point, I was full out panicking. I was asking friends if she had talked to them recently but they all said no. We have online classes so fortunately, I know she's still alive. I've been using multiple methods to try to contact her and yesterday she finally responded.

My friend told me that she feels tired and borderline suicidal. She skipped her therapy session last week because she didn't want to talk. She said she just wants to sleep. She told me she can't stop having panic attacks, and she's vomiting everything she eats. She's still attending her classes because she's struggling with some of them and needs help. To add on, she's afraid of telling her teachers about her mental health because they sent her to a mental hospital.

What should I do? I want to help her feel better. We planned to watch ""The Room"" together during Thanksgiving break because I won a bet with her, but I want to do more. I feel awful for saying this, but I want her to get better so we can have fun again. I hate seeing her like this and I'm afraid that it's going to persist.

I posted this earlier on r/depression but no one replied :/. I think this subreddit is more appropriate."
980,I finally got diagnosed and am starting medication!!!,"I made a post yesterday that I was finally getting help today. Well it went well and I’ve haven’t felt this hopeful in a long time. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and general anxiety disorder and am stating on 50mg of Zoloft every day as of tomorrow! 

I still have mixed feelings about it though. I hate that I have to take medication to be “normal” and actually function as a person. But I’ve lived with anxiety for so long and depression for years and can’t wait to maybe be a bit better. I know that medication takes a long time to work, isn’t always a good fit, can have bad side effects, and won’t fix everything though so I know not to get my hopes up. I’m just glad I have a *chance* at finally having some relief especially my social anxiety since it prevents me from doing SO many things I want to do (heck I don’t even have my drivers license at almost 18 because I’m too anxious both to drive and take the driving test). 

So here’s to hoping I finally get better :)"
981,i don't think I can have a good day (superficial),"flair:first-world-problems

nsfw warning: me. I am nsfw. I cannot do productive things. therefore, I am not suitable for work. ha. that's actually kind of funny. too bad stupid puns aren't a valid contribution to society, u/BRoccoli20 of reddit dot com.

I was having a good day today. I made somewhat significant progress on my next ttte fanfic. I was reading a nice harry potter one, plus rereading Chamber of Secrets. I continued writing the basic (as in, it's two pages so far) summary for my book series. I watched the aristocats with my dad and it was fun. so naturally, I had to dive into religion-related things that trigger my hair-pulling (which isn't so bad as it was in, say, july, to be fair) and make me anxious. I don't really wanna go too in-depth but yeah. 

I told you these are just first-world problems.

I was gonna post this on my profile but hey, why not here? actually, hours ago when I was happier, I was thinking of making a quirky post titled ""dear diary"" on my profile, like I used to do just because and also did weird posts like just typing ""UUUUUUUGGGGHGHGH"" my mum's coming im posting this bye

you are such an idiot uwu"
982,okay so here's the thing-,"I've been thinking about this a lot so don't think I'm just pulling this out of my ass. Over the course of this year I've gotten really weird about certain things, like textbook paper. I. Fucking. Hate. Textbook paper. Whenever my nails scratch against it or when I turn the page I hate it. I usually start scratching the lower part of my fingers really hard (I'll ball up my hand so that the 3rd section of my fingers are flat and I'll take my nails and rub up and down them like a violin) Or i just kinda AL;AIWGUV;WEGF;OWGFE with my head and hands especially. I'll rub my nail tips along anything to get the feeling a w a y. Even thinking about it makes me just ugGHg. I'll also shake my head no and kinda do jazz hands while hunched to get the feeling away..? I'll do little grabby hands with my nails stabbing into my palms. Usually I don't shake my head or hands around others because it's really fucking embarrassing, but the feeling takes longer to go away. This has also been happening when I touch regular paper as well, which sucks because I'm a student in HS. 

I really hate this because it happens with noises (LIKE MF C H E W I N G UGH) so it's just awkward for everyone really. I don't have tics, and this is not a form of autism. I'm not trying to diagnose myself I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of this shit. !!! I HAVE TRIED DESENSITIZING!!! about 1 hour and tons of crying later I still hate textbook paper."
983,I don’t know who I am,I don’t know who I am. I would always put on a act for people and after a while it became second nature. For example your parents would ask how are you and you would answer good. But after doing that for a long time I forgot who I am. I think I would of kept putting on an act for people but this one common phrase just shook something in me. The phrase was ‘’ just be yourself” I am just looking for what to do and how to actually be myself.
984,How long do you have to wait in between messaging the crisis text line.,"I texted them back in august when my guinea pig died and I texted them last Friday night when I needed mental health advice on whether I should go into counseling or not.

I decided to start counseling from the conversation last Friday and my first therapy appointment was last Monday. Long story short she was not a good therapist at all. She did not listen to me at all and she kept going off about how I should start essential oils 🙄I did not feel comfortable with her at all. I'm going to try again with a different therapist in 2 weeks (next week the office is closed for thanksgiving)

But my real question is would it be too early for me to text the crisis line today since I just did last Monday? I'm having a really bad day, my parents kept yelling at me about how disappointed they are in me. I just feel so defeated. I think it would help but I really don't want to take up their time or take advantage of the crisis line. I've been having bad thoughts and a really rough time today but I'm not in active danger of killing myself. What should i do?"
985,Really quite lost trying to deal with unknown chronic illness preventing me from seeking out self-sufficient alternate lifestyle," I already posted this in a couple other places, because I really don't have any idea where to start to ask for help with this. I’m a 21 year old woman from Texas, and I’m really in a rough spot and really honestly don’t know how to get out of this situation. I’m experiencing some seriously awful fatigue and cognitive dysfunction issues that are really stopping me from living life. It’s so bad that I can’t do much of anything I want to do most of the time. I can’t force myself to do anything, I can’t give myself commands- it’s basically like being controlled by a puppet master that refuses to do his job. It’s sort of “if I do it I do it”. It really is just like purgatory because I can’t even make myself do fun things like go to a resale shop or play video games or read books or ANYTHING- god forbid doing things like cleaning or stuff. I can’t cook or clean 90% of the time and the only reason I can keep myself clean or change clothes is just because I get so itchy without bathing every day and being in the shower feels really good and like a couple minutes of peace for me where I feel serene- but most importantly I’m sort of thinking clearly and my brain is working for once rather than this nearly constant state of agitated nothingness. That basically means that I’ve got the level of angst over being unable to work on my battle jacket or play Minecraft, that people usually get over not being able to focus on homework or whatever. I desperately want to do SOMETHING besides lay in bed with my brain barely awake but it’s like every thought I have doesn’t actually work. I want so badly to stop doing nothing and even go out and make friends but there’s some insurmountable unseen force blocking me from even the most simple things. I live with my parents but it definitely causes some tension because I keep sleeping and don’t help out. I get so frustrated because I hate doing nothing all the time. I believe in using every last available second of my life to actually live and experience things. Let me put it this way: the idea of being hooked up to machines in a hospital and forced to just survive makes me distressed- it’s not anxiety where it’s interfering with my life because I don’t have a life for it to interfere with though. I don’t live in fear of that happening because it’s basically already happened. Except I’m my own machinery sort of. Something is blocking my alertness and actions so I’m living in this purgatory, this haze that I just can’t break through no matter what I try. I don’t know what’s causing it so I don’t know how to make it stop. But there is nothing I want more than for it to stop, to just be able to live again. 

I know I have major depressive disorder but none of the medications I’ve been given by the low income clinic (I can’t make myself take any steps necessary to get a job, and I can’t figure out how to get insurance, either- so the low income sliding scale clinic is my only option really.) have helped with the lack of energy and presence. They’ve helped with the suicidal thoughts, but thanks to the problem of the overwhelming brain fog (sounds like an understatement to call it that, it’s more like having my brain trapped in a block of lead than just fog) not going away the hopelessness and despair aren’t being kept at bay as effectively as they used to be. And I just can’t get myself to find another doctor to go to for some reason, someone who’ll actually try a different course of medicine than add a medication every time I say I’m still not feeling better, that doctor has me on 4 or 5 medications. That’s in addition to all the stuff I’m taking for thyroid problems so I’m having to take a ton of pills every day. Every time the doctors take my blood it comes back perfectly normal, thyroid levels and all! It’s really frustrating because I keep getting told I’m normal and I’m like “NO. There’s something seriously wrong here! You’ve got to find it! Stop taking my blood and making me take a fuckton of antidepressants and just try something different!! It’s obviously not in my blood and it’s obviously not depression related!” 

Honestly the symptoms of multiple sclerosis sound exactly like me- as do a few other autoimmune disorders. I’m trying to see how to get the low income physical health clinic (as opposed to the mental health one I previously mentioned) to screen me for some autoimmune diseases and not just draw blood and send me away then look at my goddamn hormone levels again and tell me everything’s fine for the billionth time. Clearly, like I say, something is VERY wrong since there’s no way I can function independently and take care of myself here. And I have to find out what it is and how to fix it before I lose even more precious sanity I can’t afford to lose any of. 

There’s something that I’ve been desperately wanting to do that this is preventing me from doing. Besides all my hobbies that seemingly became suddenly forbidden for no real reason, lately I think that I’ve finally formulated a life plan that would offer peace with not just the world but myself. I want to just leave the rat race of society and the obsession with social media and complicated shit, and go live a more simple life. I want to go off the grid… well sort of- I don’t want to live like a caveman and do all the outdoorsy stuff like a never ending camping trip. I still want electricity and plumbing, and I still sort of want access to computers so I can play with speech synthesizers and listen to music. I won’t miss the Internet though- well except for discovering new music, that is. I… I want to go leave the cities and never play the stupid game of modern life again- and find a Victorian steampunk alternative lifestyle thing to settle into. Like a village where everyone lived like they did in the late 1800s, and we didn’t have to leave, we could just rely on ourselves as a community. A little oasis of Victorian life, almost like you stepped into a time warp or something! Where my problems would then be so much more down to earth and I’d enjoy being amongst people like me, in a rather close knit society of people who weren’t so petty, and were more insightful and resilient and really saw the value in simplicity and the little pleasures of life... Where I would no longer have politics rammed down my throat 24/7 with absolutely no escape, and I’d actually be given a chance to just go at my own pace and be a more easygoing person… Where sure I’d have to do more mechanical labor but I honestly feel like that would be far more rewarding than the sort of lifestyle people today live. I used to think this was an America problem but then I came to the grim realization that while Eastern Europe is a little more traditional and has a culture that would fit me better it’s still as much of a rat race and too damn complicated- and I realized it’s a modern times problem. 

Unfortunately I realized that I’ve got two major problems preventing me from going and living out these dreams and having peace. 

One, I have no idea if such a community exists, or how to go there. I have no idea if it’s even possible to do this and I really have no idea what to look up or ask about to find leads to this. 

And two, my biggest obstacle, the fatigue issues I was talking about in great detail earlier. I desperately want to do all this and have every reason to in the world… but I can’t even rely on myself and take care of myself as is. How could I ever make it in a society of heightened independence and self discipline? That’s why I need this problem fixed now, so I can go live my alternative Victorian lifestyle. (Just with old computers too, is the difference.)

I know this is just a jumble of words and thoughts and probably makes no sense whatsoever, and that I sound like one of those “I was born in the wrong era” people… but if just one person can get some meaning out of this, and if someone can rescue me- or rather, can help me rescue myself really- from this purgatory and angst, that’s really all I want. Because then maybe being okay won’t be so out of reach anymore. Please, somebody help me out of this purgatory and on the path towards serenity and an actual social life. Anything would be great, whether it's just someone to talk to me and offer comfort and kind words, or any steps to take. Thanks y'all"
986,Has therapy helped anyone without friends?,I guess I’m just concerned that I will end up relying on therapy or it worsens my depression if my therapist is the only person I can talk to.
987,Please help me...but Is it true that I’ll be able to see the real them when I pass away? Or am I crazy?,"I keep having dreams where people in my life are happier and want me to come with them to be happy with them. And that they miss me, and ask why I don’t want to come home? It’s a been house-creep to deal with.. Is it true the ones who’ve done me wrong are actually, changed and actually want to be in my life as a Utopia when I finally commit suicide? My dreams have been trying to tell me something and so has my subconscious. Has anyone had this before? I can’t say it’s heaven, but...it’s like a parallel universe. Things aren’t perfect, but it’s... everything I’ve been wanting. I actually wanna die and give them a big hug...are they real?

I made a similar post on another subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jugbql/i_think_i_might_make_the_decision_to_die_tonight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"
988,Don’t have a personality,"I’ve come onto here because I feel like I don’t have a personality and it’s overwhelming. Nothing really goes through my head. I don’t have any strong opinions and I’m simply on the fence about EVERYTHING. I also change my personality depending on who I’m with. If someone tells me they believe something or hold a certain view, in that moment I will agree with them fully even if I don’t really think that. I’ll copy the way that they talk and their mannerisms. I have no opinions about anything. At all. I don’t feel strongly about anything. I don’t have any passions. I don’t have opinions. Nothing gives me true joy and I barely have a sense of humour anymore. I match my personality and beliefs to the person I’m with, but when I’m not with them I become no one again. On my own, nothing goes through my head. I just exist. I used to feel joy, I used to dislike things and like things. Now I just try to please the people around me."
989,A shower just sent me over the edge,"I’ve been going through a lot. I almost lost a few family members and I don’t want to go into a whole lot but I’ve officially been diagnosed with depression which my therapist said looks like has been present my whole life. I’ve also always had anxiety. It’s just never been this bad. October made it this bad. 

I have had a bad week in terms of mental health, nothing stands out as to why it’s been bad but my motivation is non existent. Just leaving my house makes me jittery and on edge, I rush home to my family. If my family goes out of the house it’s fine, if I leave the house with my family it’s fine. But even to just see friends it’s been bad. Lucky I work from home. I’ve been managing poorly this week though in all aspects where normally I bottle it up and go, it always works. This time my shower sent me over the edge. 

Every other day I shower. I keep this routine no matter what I feel like. Sick, migraine, depressed, heartbroken, nothing keeps me from my routine. Today I woke up and decided I needed to shave. I needed to for awhile but it’s just now come to a head that it’s to itchy to keep going without. It’s been well over a month. I go to get in the shower and the water isn’t quite warm enough so I try to warm it up, again this happens until I hit the end where it can’t get any hotter. My dad has cooled the house off, the shower water was so cold my skin had goosebumps and I tried to at least get my hair clean but I was shivering so hard I brushed it and gave up. It turns out my dad had started a hot load of laundry that will take about an hour to cycle. So no shower for another hour. They said I could pause and wait 10minutes until it heats up but I was already over it. I wanted to cry. It’s so stupid. It’s just a shower but my anxiety is through the roof just thinking about showering again tomorrow and then deciding if I will need to shower Friday also to get back in routine. This never happens. I usually know what to do and I don’t over think it but my anxiety is up, my depression is spiked up to making this seem more hopeless and the logical part of my brain knows this, I just can’t convince the other part of my brain that it’s okay. 

Any advice would be helpful. I have tried tapping already with no luck."
990,Do I need help ?,"I’ve been very down lately, I haven’t really been finding any enjoyment in anything. Smoking is really the only thing that helps. I am very mixed up in my head, I have a hard time going out because I am too scared to talk to people, I can’t sleep at night I just toss and turn, I have points of deep hopelessness when I’d rather be dead than deal with things, am I sick ? Should I seek help ?"
991,How do I release my emotions without screaming?,"How do I release my emotions in the moment? I’m very impatient lately, and tend to clench my jaw or scream in order to move on from minor inconveniences (traffic, slow computer, etc). With little people watching, I want to model appropriate emotional responses. What are some strategies I can use?"

994,Looking for help,"Disclaimer: sorry for the long post :/

Hello, I am 19 years old and I’m ready to get better. I have struggled with this for a long time - i have major anxiety, paranoia and insomnia. It’s not diagnosed but im certain, at the end of the day I believe it’s common to be anxious and paranoid.

Anyway this has really made me struggle in life. It has prevented me from going after certain goals, getting out of my comfort zone, getting a drivers license, going to certain events, like i played guitar and was a swimmer FOR YEARS, since i was a child, and I missed about 90% of competitions/concerts because I was scared of people looking at me... The paranoia made my confidence drop dead since I have trouble believing people like me. Even around my girlfriend that I love with all my heart, I start to feel nervous sometimes, I’m scared that I’ll do something wrong even when it’s an amazing relationship.

I avoided this for a long time. Fooling myself, saying that I am okay and that this is normal. And it led me to being very depressed, to the point where I had suicidal thoughts snd even an attempt at a young age(those thoughts dont come across often these days, thank god). Recently it’s getting out of hand. I started having panic attacks and I don’t remember the last time I was that scared. I’ve realised that this can’t go on any longer. I have talked to people like my best friends, mom, girlfriend about this and they had suggested that I go see a therapist but I think to start I want to try taking this one myself.

Is there anything that helps you deal  with anxiety and paranoia? I already journal frequently since writing is my hobby already. Is there something else like a certain meditation or routine? Absolutely any advice would make me very grateful.

Also tips on insomnia would be amazing... I don’t remember the last time i got quality sleep lol. And the dark circles under my eyes are making me look like a zombie and people notice it and are worried about me...

So any advice and sharing of your own story would be highly appreciated. I hope you have a good day/evening! (Sorry if I made mistakes in the post, english is my second language)"
995,"Please help me, I can’t watch any movies without feeling a deep level of anguish.","I don’t know if this is the right place for it but I don’t know how to deal with this. I have not been able to watch a movie or show in a long time. If ever I see someone in emotional or mental distress on screen, it eats me up. 

I tried watching the movie Minority Report yesterday. It starts with a guy getting cheated on and breaking down over it. I had to stop the movie right then and there. I didn’t sleep at all last night, and at work today I had to go to the restroom to cry for a bit. It’s still bugging me to think about. 

This same thing has happened with the movies Jurassic Park, Alien, The Dark Knight, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, Les Moserables, I could go on. It happens in tv shows as well but I’ve never tried to watch many. It’s all had an affect on me to greater or weaker extents. 

Lately I’ve found watching Bob Ross episodes are on of the few things I can gain enjoyment out of without feeling devastated. Very young children’s shows are ok for me as well. I was t always like this but I’ve grown worse and worse. I literally cannot stomach mature entertainment anymore. It’s not just something that bugs me a little. I’ve become inconsolable at times and I have no idea how to deal with all this. :("

997,I think I might be depressed...,"This is a throwaway. (19M)

I've thought about making this post for a bit.
The truth is, I think I might just be depressed.

It's been going on for a while. I do things I don't normally do. I cheated on my girlfriend. I'm no cheater. But I did it. Because I was sad, I guess? I don't sleep well even though I'm denying it. I have a problem... I live alone, and my appartement is just getting messier. I don't wash myself or my dishes. My girlfriend broke up with me because I cheated. I'm not upset at her for doing so though... My life is a mess. I argued with most of my friends and I lost them too... I've become a mean person. I cry a lot. I'm filthy. I'm disgusting. I've spent 100$ on dating apps in hopes of meeting someone who can change my miserable life because I don't believe in myself. I'm fucked. And now, at college, everyone is counting on me. I feel like I'm gonna explode. I don't want to wake up tomorow. I'm not suicidal, but I don't think any of it matters because I'm failing a class and my parents can't help I'm far far away and I truly hate myself more and more everyday.

I can't even talk to a doctor. I don't have the courage. Therapy is too expensive. I am on a waiting list though. It might take a year. To be honest, I don't think I can survive this for a year."
998,I have these reoccurring periods of time were I don't feel anything and in between my feelings a very limited,"Friends can't get me out of this fog of nothingness. Talking doesn't do anything. Loss of appetite, interest, gumption, sleep, hard to form thought, I find myself impossible to talk to, and frustrated that I hate talking about it.

What's wrong with me?
What are my options to mitigate this? Besides therapy and anything that costs a lot of money."
999,I can’t get him out of my head,2 days ago I saw this video of this dude in a suit smiling. It was just a photo of this dude in black and white smiling with this music playing in the background. The longer you look at him the more he just creeps you out. I can’t stop thinking about the photo and last night I had a night mare where he was a 7 ft tall man who was chasing me through a fires and whispering to me. In the dream he was some sort of blank. Nobody knew who he was and then they pushed me into the forest. I was trapped in there for the rest of the night. I can’t get him out of my head. Please help.
1000,Why isn't therapy helping me?,I'm I *that* broken? Maybe it's because I don't belong here. I'm an anomaly that this world doesn't understand.
1001,I can't tell if things aren't funny or if I just don't find anything funny,I don't really have much to say about it other than that. Nothing really makes me smile anymore.
1002,Feeling lost on options,"I don't know where to start so this might be all over the place.

For the past 2 years I've been dealing with anxiety and depression. I wouldn't call it severe to the point it affects my daily life.  I'll just have episodes here and there. I have a hard time dealing with it and I feel like it's getting increasingly worst.

Others looking in might say what I have going on in my life right now I shouldn't feel depress or anxious. I'll be graduating from college soon, moving to a new city, and recently just got engaged. All these things people will see as happy moments only feel like they're providing temporary happiness. The majority of the time I feel miserable and hopeless. I feel guilty feeling this way with all the ""good"" things happening in my life. 

I tried therapy for awhile and felt like it helped a little but not much. I guess because I can't pinpoint the cause of my anxiety and depression. I recently tried taking zoloft but that only lasted 3-4 weeks before I gave up on it. It made me extremely tired so I stopped. I feel like therapy would help but at the same time I dont know because of my previous experience and not knowing how to help myself. I'm emotional all the time and slowly starting to care less about everything. 

Sometimes I believe I like feeling this way but at the same time I want to feel normal...help?"
1003,Frailty of Life,"I’ve been struggling lately with the frailty of life and trying to function in a world that has no permanence. A little background for you: I’ve been a combat medic in the US Army for 14 years now. I’ve served in Iraq and Afghanistan during the height of both wars and saw some pretty heinous things. My coping mechanisms centered around compartmentalization and temporary alcohol abuse early on. After getting in some trouble for drinking my focus became pinpoint on school and I will be graduating with a Master’s of Public Health in the spring. The realization that my school goals are coming to an end coupled with processing the recent loss of my sister in an automobile accident has brought into stark reality the fleetingness of life. 

This anxiety has leaked into my family life, as I find it hard to function as a parent. It is paralyzing to consider that my child has to grow up in this world. After all the things I’ve experienced it’s hard focus on the illusion of normality. Truly looking behind the curtain of the cruelty and apathy of mankind has exhausted my hope that there is any lingering peace to be found. I would not consider myself depressed and certainly not suicidal. I’m still goal oriented and love my family beyond belief. I feel like my anxiety and fear of losing anyone else close to me (another Soldier, family member etc) is causing me to miss or not appreciated milestones in life. Has anyone else dealt with this before and how did you reconcile your emotional responses and continue living life to the fullest? "
1004,Is this normal? Or do I have something going on? Or is it just temporary things?,"[self harm &amp; food trigger warning](?)
Some backstory: I really dislike people who make a big deal out of their emotions when they’re fine. And that applies to myself too where I would hate to exaggerate my emotions unless it’s to someone I don’t like in order to make them feel bad...

I just started balling my eyes out when I came across a video about different examples of self harm with excessively piercing your own ear, not eating etc. And I don’t do those things but I couldn’t stop myself from crying uncontrollably in my bed, where I thought of the time 4 years ago when I interlocked my fingers and dug my nails into my hand and imagined walking into the pond near my house to drown. And in those moment when I cry, my heart really hurts and this isn’t the first time. And earlier today my s/o asked how I was doing and I got teary eyed and had an intense feeling of wanting to ball my eyes out but I had to ignore it cuz I was still in class on zoom. I thought of telling someone about my sadness but had a number of reasons not to.
My s/o whom I want to talk abt my feelings to has depression and I feel like I shouldn’t tell my s/o about my problems because it’s gonna make their’s worse, because it’s made me worse with getting to know my s/o’s condition right now. It’s going downhill. 
Don’t wanna bother my best friend(prob not online rn), my other good friend is busy with school so don’t wanna bother him either. 
Family is a no no because no one knows this side of me.

But what’s got me confused is, in the midst of feeling like my heart was tearing apart, I was going through all the sh*tty feelings I had and all the stress, and I suddenly remembered that I had to post something for my job for today and today is almost over. And I went from 100 to 0 with my emotion and just read the email and posted the things. And now I’m not crying anymore.

So right now I’m just questioning should I be concerned that my heart is aching rly bad now whenever I cry? Am I just having a bad moment because I don’t feel anything now? Did that count as an emotional breakdown or was it normal? Was that a panic attack?(I couldn’t break for a second). 

What should I do about letting my s/o know about this..? Or should I not?"
1005,I’ve put off making a therapy appointment for weeks and I finally made one for tomorrow..,I went to therapy once a couple years ago and I felt so uncomfortable I never went back. I don’t know why I guess I just really struggle to communicate my feelings. Well things have gotten so bad these last few weeks and I have been trying to convince myself to start therapy up for a long time but I finally did and I have my first appointment tomorrow. I am proud of myself but also so scared. I don’t have anyone to share this with (except my therapist now I guess) so I just wanted to tell someone.
1006,I think I have schizophrenia and I want to get help but don’t know how to,"
Hey, I’m getting overwhelmed by a lot of things which have been happening for quite a few years and I just want to know how to get it sorted out. I’m 17 (and in England) and have been showing lots of signs of schizophrenia for about 5 or so years and it’s having a serious affect on my ability to do anything really, as well as leaving me exhausted but unable to sleep basically every night (like now). I’ve been putting it off for ages (recently by telling myself that I’ll get it sorted when all this pandemic stuff has blown over because I get really anxious on the phone and I’m scared of not conveying what I need to) but I think it’s getting to the point where I’m desperate again. So how do I get this sorted I know from the nhs website that I need to contact my GP but how do I find out who my Gp is without asking my parents (I don’t want them to know) and also is there any way I can contact them without using a phone? Thanks"
1007,How to talk to my boyfriend?,"I have been very suicidal lately and have been seeking help. I’ve seen a doctor etc but I am stuck on how to speak to my boyfriend about it. (We’ve been together for just over a year now) 

I have had problems since I was 14 and have been made worse with university and Covid-19. My boyfriend has suffered with anxiety and other problems and has been on anti-depression medication. (The same one that I have been prescribed recently) He is very supportive but when it comes to very personal things it’s very hard for me to talk to him about it. I suffer with an ED and tried to talk to him about it but he said I can “keep it to myself” even though I said
I felt guilty about not telling him. Should I bother talking to him about how I’m feeling or should I just keep it to myself and speak to my doctor/counselors about it? Thank you for any advice."
1008,Why don’t I have any skills?,"I can’t do anything well and it’s ridiculous, I suck at math I suck at writing I suck at chemistry I suck at everything academic even when I put my full effort in. When I play video games I always suck at aiming and can’t have any fun with them at all, I can’t talk to girls because I have so much anxiety about everything that I’m 99 percent sure it will end terribly and I’m probably too ugly anyway."
1009,I feel like drowning.,"I'm in my senior year of high school and have completely wasted school up until this point. I have horrible social anxiety and have no social life to speak of, my home life is extremely rocky (I was homeless for 9 months and had an abusive parent figure in my life) and I just feel worthless anymore. I'm failing most of my classes at the moment and I hardly see a reason to get up in the morning, I feel completely alone. I just want to be more than this"
1010,I’m worried about my friend,"She told me she’s seriously considering and planning on committing suicide, how do I help her? I can’t reach out to a trusted adult, because there are no trusted adults in our lives. She doesn’t even want help, she’s convinced that none of it would work in the first place. I just really care about her, and i don’t want to lose her or see her hurting anymore. I don’t know how to help or what to say or how to respond, I just need to figure out a way to keep her alive."
1011,lately I feel so pissed. all the time.,"sometimes for no reason, sometimes for the tiniest reasons. I get just like. so mad. and then being mad just turns into hopelessness and hating myself. see through my eyes I feel like I look like a monster, like something that should scare children or could be in a horror movie. people tell me different, and while it's nice to hear (of course) it goes nowhere because it registers as them lying to me, or like everyone else is in on this big joke that im not. if I do believe it its very short-lived (till the next time I look in the mirror or whatever) and then I just feel stupid for believing them. like such an idiot. n I havent even done anything terribly terribly wrong in my life, but I feel like the only way to get what I deserve is dying in a super painful way. that i deserve nothing but that. idk wtf is up with me. thanks for listening to my vent lols"
1012,"Exhausted caring for other people's mental health, while struggling mentally/emotionally myself","I hope the title isn't too confusing.

Basically, I am a leader in college ministry, in which I lead and disciple others and care for people's mental/emotional/spiritual wellbeing very regularly. It is not uncommon for me to drop everything and talk through a hard situation with somebody, offering support and advice.

But, this semester has especially been a struggle for me. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as well as an Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety. I have been working with my doctor to experiment with different antidepressant medications and therapy, trying to find the combination that best meets my needs. In addition, 2020 has brought the same unfortunate events to me as it has everyone else, and I have had some extra unfortunate events occur as well in my life recently (i.e. academic probation from the rigorous academic program I am a part of).

I am struggling emotionally myself, but I still feel a responsibility to be there for these people who reach out to me (which almost seems to be more and more by the week). If I'm not there for them, who will be?

\*\* I did go to a therapist regularly this semester, but I am going home for winter break this weekend and will no longer have access to counseling again until I am back at school in January. \*\* I feel like a burden going to others with my problems, in fear that I will cause these emotional hardships on them as well.

How do you balance this?"

1014,I halfway fixed my insomnia,I used to not be able to shut my eyes for more than 30 seconds without my ears ringing. I have found that a fix for this is just having a fan at full blast in my room every night has stopped that from happening. I still have trouble sleeping but it’s much better now.
1015,What do I do to help my friend?,My friend has recently been going through some tough times. We have this mutual friend who hes fallen hard for. His entire life revolves around her. Once he finishes school for the day he normally just goes to lay down in bed and talks to her for the rest of the day. The thing is she's a lesbian and he knows this. This made him depressed and he has not been doing well lately. He told me he started eating more and cries himself to sleep. He lost interest in all his hobby's and stopped caring about school. He has repeatedly told me that nothing matters to him anymore. I did not know anywhere else to ask. I just want to know if there is anything I can do to help him?
1016,My girlfriend needs a professional," My long distance girlfriend has been struggling with very extreme ""mood swings"" for the past year. She gets very depressed during her lows. Shes opened to me about her suicidal thoughts and on top of that multiple other things in her life have been weighing down on her. I've always supported getting her to see a professional however shes always been against it till recently. Shes always said she'd ""get over it"" but I think she now realizes that it may not be the case. She is 18 however she said she still needs her father to seek a professional. She finally mustered up the courage to ask her father for help however, he is very ignorant and has said that she does not need one and that proper sleep and diet should fix the issue. It angers me that she has taken the first step and her father brushes it off. She resides in upstate new york and I was wondering if there is some way she can get help herself for free somehow without her father knowing. I worry about her and I do what I can, but being across the country limits my options. Thanks 

&amp;#x200B;

This past week she has been doing better mood-wise, however whenever I ask how she is feeling she tells me she's alright. I'm sure she's hiding her true emotions cause she never really wants to talk about it, but her mood sometimes tanks out of nowhere."
1017,My doctor has started to reduce my medication with the intent of stopping it. He has done it before too and it didn't go well . I expressed by concerns of relapse but he says he's 99% sure I can cope without medication.,"I have been on Flupentixol 20 mg (and more occasionally ) for 4 years now.  I have been on and off olanzapine 5 mg or less ( never more ).  I was diagnosed with progressive schizophrenia last year and have been on Flupentixol 5 mg since then.  I also have ocd but been on some medication for it only for a month.  

So , basically my doctor has always believed that I can and should come off medication.  However , whenever he has stopped them ,I feel like I'm going insane to the point of not functioning . I mentioned this but he is bent on stopping my meds.  

I'm scared I'll get depressed or maniac.

Edit : What I mean to say is that I had been a depressed teen with insomnia and panic disorder that was not treated in any way because I was not aware of mental illnesses.  I sought medication when I was 19 . I am 22 now and I basically don't know what life is without medication.  I strongly believe that mental illness is in curable."
1018,Why do I do things that I know will result in a bad outcome?,"I do it a lot. I'll be messing with something, and my brain will go ""stop that, you'll break it"" or ""stop or you'll hurt yourself"". 

Today, I was playing with a plastic wine glass and suddenly I started squeezing it. I brain said ""stop, it'll break and cut you"" and yet I didn't stop. Well, as you can imagine, it broke and I got cut. 

Last week I smashed a Christmas light bulb with a crowbar and had to buy new ones, as apparently if one breaks they all stop working...

It's as if my brain craves the reaction, whether it be good or bad. I'm worried that it is becoming mildly dangerous. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"

1020,Mental health and cannabis use.... Im in canada! But cant afford 200bucks a month to self medicate.,"Thanks for taking the time to read....
My diagnosis are from hardest to easiest to deal with are. Anxiety autism essential tremors depression and asthma and a bad back. It strains quite easily

So since weeds been legal i finally for the 1st time in 13 years have it all under control the only thing i truly changed was pot usage the main factor that's changed is i finally got rid of my suicidal tendencies .

 i was attempting on and off for 7 years and have had countless admissions to psych wards mainly voluntarily but i think 4 times for an attempt. I'm on meds for them but it feels like i just need a small push up the hill to hit that breakthrough threshold. I would stay on olanzapine to prevent MJ psychosis but get rid of the other 2. I was also not talking my meds regularly but have accepted now that i do need too since staying on cannabis to help with my concerns. 

I was thinking i would only need like .5g of weed at night every day. Which is like 3.5g a week 14g a month. Sounds really low to most i know with prescriptions already and even that i just like having a bit for PRN reasons like panic attacks.
Probably a 10percent THC 10percent CBD strain ive seen those as common medical percentages since its sold out of retail stores here. 

It should be noted i have struggled with 2 former addictions but conquered them so i know if written a prescription i would not disobey it I'm honest to a fault 95 percent of my life. I just am not honest with my psych about how much i smoke cause I'm scared he's too old school 

The primary reason i started smoking was because i have bad tremors when under distress. It was eating me alive that my family had to watch this. And even my mom came around to seeing its a benefit to me overall. And i soon realized it helped with those other concerns besides asthma. 

Even b4 on pot i was struggling with sleep pretty intensely once stayed up for 6 nights with no illicit drugs. Right now I'm detoxing from weed just to see whats gonna happen without it but my sleep is bugging me again wasn't again since legalization for the most part. 

I remember when i was between 18 and 21 i used some pot here and there and i actual did well at jobs but as soon as the cannabis stopped became sporadic i went back to being ""disabled"" from my issues. Then i proceeded to just sit on my rear from 21 to 25. I'm 27 now. I really don't know what I'm gonna do if i hit 30 and cant even get volunteering. 

How do you all feel about MH and cannabis use how has it helped you? Or how has it been the opposite. Should i chase a prescription?

Just looking for opinions i don't take anything anyone says on reddit as factual. Its all anecdotal. If you respond i could at least show this to my psych so he could see a wider range of things.

 He's probably the smartest person ive ever met intellectually so i don't wanna have to stop seeing him and start anew. He's the reason ive been doing better but gosh like why cant he see that ive taken the time to actually learn how it works for me. Theres been a patch here and there where i wasn't in control but i know for sure I'm like 85-95percent in control when on cannabis and like 50percent in control when not using.  Upvote comment dm me or just move past this post if so desired. Thx you all!

Like why cant i just get my prescription and move on with what will be an awesome ive bern stuck here for 2 years"
1021,I don't know what anymore,"I'm a 18 year old male and I have been having more and more issues lately. I don't really know what is going on but I don't know where to go with this, I've tried asking my family for help and they just told me to get over it and I just can't. The issues I'm having lately are 
Skin picking, this started when I was around 14/15 

I've been having these weird mood swings where I'll get annoyed with everyone and everything around me to The point where I'd rather go and break or hurt whatever is causing the annoyance 

I've been having thoughts where I wonder what it would be like to hurt or kill another person and it's scaring me a lot 

I've been obsessing over the most stupid things like when my pen ran out of ink and I just freaked out way more than I should have over it, I ended up just finding new ink for it online which I spent way more on than the pen was even worth, and this pen is not even something I've had for a while I just found it and started using it a couple months ago so it has no sentimental value or anything 

I've been trying to find people to talk to, but whenever I do I don't talk to them cuz I'm scared I'm going to say or do something dumb and them stop talking to me or ignore me

I haven't found the enjoyment in things I used to, playing video games, reading

I've been doing stupid things just to get that moment of happiness that is definitely not worth the price 

I have a addiction to porn that I'm struggling to get over 

I get these stomach aches caused by I think anxiety and I can't focus on anything and it's been causing me to feel nauseous 

Reddit I'm begging, if someone can help me I'd appreciate it so much, I just can't deal with this anymore and I really need advice on what to do. Ideally something I can do without my parents causing me problems with it. I just can't take this stress and worry about anything anymore"
1022,"I had been living my life saving myself from addiction of any type. I literally don't smoke, drink, drugs, porn or whatever. I don't addict anything. I am literally a free person by all means. Why am I addicted to this specific person? I cannot let go of my ex.","

I see that I need this hormone of dopamine and serotine. I am addicted to kissing and hugging her and I feel enslaved and chained. I am unable to let go and my jealousy, my thoughts, are literally painful. Love is hell of a drug. I just realized that. I really need to stand my ground. I cannot live my life away from all types of toxic intakes and when it comes to love, I am just as chained. I literally only today symphysed with all the people who get addicted to certain stuff. It's definitely not easy. I am craving her. I am craving her love, her attention, her texts, her voice, her touch. I am craving the past. The memories are messing with the chemicals of my brain. How do people quit that? 

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps that's the question that I should have asked myself when the break happened? Instead of asking how to move on and how miserable I am and victimized, well, with all the bad things that happened to me against my well, it's my addiction to her. My brain chemicals that are not functioning well, my cravings, my memories. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's the way to now look at it from this perspective, I am breaking my golden chains and I understand the painful journey behind it. No one said it's easy, it's just that I have to get back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all, I hope that was some sort of help."

1024,My Little Brother is Anxious.,"Two years ago, my little brother was 10 and I had just been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression like a year before. My mom said she started to notice a little that he was acting very anxious and my mom thought that he might have Anxiety.

Last night my mom got really mad for no reason and yelled at my little brother, who is now 12, and I am 18. Him and I sat at the top of the stairs and listened to her slamming and throwing things around and talking bad about us to our grandma. I knew he had anxiety at this point but we've never done anything. I took him to his room to talk about his feelings and he got really upset.

He started talking about how he'd been feeling lately and a lot of the thoughts he shared exactly mirrored mine when I was first diagnosed with chronic depression and extreme anxiety disorder. He said he feels like nothing matters anymore. He wants to get stuff done but he cant make himself get up in the morning.

He said he doesn't want to go to the doctor for it because hes afraid our mom will post about it on Facebook and hes afraid our mom will tell our grandma (she doesn't believe in depression) and she'll think hes faking it, or copying me. He also said he doesn't want mom to worry about him because she already has a lot on her plate.

I kept telling him it sounds like he might be a little depressed and he kept sobbing and saying he wasn't, and he had nothing wrong with him, and how my mom can't have two depressed kids. I don't know how to get him to talk to me because the moment he starts tearing up he'll make a joke or change the subject.

I dont know what to do because I struggled with depression for many years before i told my mom for the exact reasons hes not telling our mom. I'm also afraid my mom wont do anything about it because she says hes going through puberty, but its much more than that. **What can I say to make my brother feel better or realize its ok to have depression? What should I do to help?**"
1025,Abandonment issues,"I was told by a psychiatrist that my anger and depression came from issues of abandonment. 

My earliest recollection of that feeling was when my parents would leave for work without saying goodbye because I was asleep. Seeing my mom in photos of events I wasn't tagged along gave me feelings of betrayal as a kid. 

What is wrong with me? How did I become too sensitive as a child? I know in my heart my mother loves me and spoiled me even."
1026,Emotionally withholding,"My partner hasn't been feeling good lately, neither have I, and I know I can be emotionally needy. But if came to a head when what I thought was a funny accident (farting on his leg after a night of fried food) made him leave our bed to go lay on the couch. He said he needed a minute, but he was fully laying down and had put on his sleep show. When confronted about over reacting and being hurtful, he was nonchalant and kind of agreeing just to make me quiet. Came back to bed and couldn't be bothered to apologize like he meant it, or discuss it. But I thought we had done so much more emotional work than this. It has been so long since he let his anger get the best of him and was emotionally withdrawn. But I wouldn't even care if he hadn't left our bed, without saying anything, lying about coming back, and placating me. It's a thing I have about our intimacy where we dont go to bed angry and we always say goodbye to eachother always. He knows this, so it just hurts. I feel like he thinks me being gross is the same as being emotionally distant. Idk how to feel right now. Need to sleep and I know my anxiety is making this worse. And he says we will talk in the morning and I really hope we will, but I'm afraid he's going to keep placating me."

1031,"Friend has anger issues, would really appreciate help.","This will be a long post, sorry. I'd really appreciate you reading the whole thing and giving advice though.

For a bit of context/background:

The ""main"" friend group is 3 of us. We're early 20's males, live in the same city and have known each other a couple years now (the other 2 have known each other much longer, I'm the new part of the trio). Let's call Friend 1 Alex and Friend 2 Jake.

Our main/mutual hobby is gaming. All 3 of us banter which is super standard behavior for our demographic. It can get out of hand occasionally and we take time apart (usually just one of us does something else for a few days whether its hang out with other irl friends or just not talk in the group chat)

We all have our quirks (Jake is definitely an instigator towards both Alex and myself at times) but Alex has genuine anger issues. If they get set off its 0-100 instantly and they basically just go for the throat saying the most hurtful/personal things they can think of. Myself and Jake aren't *extremely* offended by what Alex says but it can be somewhat hurtful but mostly it's extremely taxing to deal with.

It's like flipping a switch, you can literally get Alex absolutely fuming in about 2 seconds and at that point your only option is to do what I do and either just mindlessly agree to whatever they say (""yeah my mom is definitely a whore, i really am shit at this game, yep my girlfriend definitely hates me"" -- this usually makes Alex feel stupid after a few seconds and they lay off) or do what Jake typically does and defend themself/argue back. When Jake argues back is usually when all hell breaks loose and one of them will be away for a week or two.

**NOTE:** Before anyone asks, I have absolutely no fucking idea how Alex and Jake were friends for years and years before I met Alex. I'm 2-3 years older which isn't much but there's definitely a somewhat noticeable difference in maturity, hence why I usually just let Alex go off for a few seconds and be done with it. I've also just stopped telling Alex personal stuff that will inevitably be used as ammunition. I'm not a saint though, there's definitely times where I defend myself and am the one to leave for a few weeks (the longest period was about 4 months.)  I've honestly almost not returned after the last time and there's a real chance the next time is the last. The only reason I came back last time is because Alex apologized and asked me to come back after me being gone for 2 weeks. There's a few people in our group chat that I introduced and without me, the group chat (Discord server) was extremely dead the whole 2 weeks (which honestly felt good to know that I was kinda the connecting piece but that's completely besides the point)

Also important to note, Alex genuinely thinks he knows best and his word is law/absolute truth. If he disapproves of something you're doing he will almost definitely ""attack"" (can't think of a better word for it) you over it. He acts as if your decisions are his. So basically anger issues *and* narcissism.  He NEEDS to be the absolute best at everything we play and if he's not he kinda just pretends he is.

Example, Jake has been streaming the past couple days on Twitch. Alex and I mess around in his chat or whatever but he doesn't really reply. Instead of being himself he was acting super professional/honestly kinda fake (even though he only had 1 or 2 other viewers) and I called him cringe for not interacting (this is pretty standard, I'm not actually being rude and Jake knows it) but Alex takes this personally. He instantly starts attacking his life, his college grades, what school he goes to, what course he's in, the fact that he has no viewers, no job etc. He basically just goes way too far/too personal as always. Jake has a light courseload so the no job is honestly a fair criticism (especially since Jake has criticized me before when I'm unemployed for even 2 weeks when moving).

As usual, Jake leaves the server and claims he's not coming back and honestly, I wouldn't blame him. This post isn't how to get Jake back though, it's what the fuck do I do about Alex? He will absolutely lose all his friends (or worse) if he stays like this. He's allegedly attempted to get help before but said it didn't do anything. Another note: I've tried talking to him several times about his anger issues. Asking him if it's reasonable that Jake and I babysit his mental illness and be completely submissive, if it's reasonable that he gets so insanely personal. I'm comfortable being vulnerable, discussing relationship issues and whatnot but it will absolutely be used as ammo. Is that reasonable?

Alex, without fail, will agree he's in the wrong, agree he will make an effort to change but somehow it never changes even in the slightest. I have really no clue what to do about it.

So basically, please help lol? When I was younger I had anger issues that I've kinda grown out of and it makes me suspect he might have ADHD which just makes everything way worse."

1033,"What do you do when ""get help"" didn't help you at all?","In like all of the mental health campaigns and talks, they always tell you to ""get help"". Well I did (in a way), I attempted suicide, my parents found out, and we had a conversation about it that ended in me saying I'd like a therapist. (They agreed and we all watched a movie together.)

That was in May, I'm in my senior year now and am even more suicidal thanks to the stress of school and college applications. There's been like no mention of the 'incident' nor therapy. And I don't really know what to do.

Like I already did what I was supposed to do. I got help, and everyone always acts like getting help will somehow magically fix your problems but it didn't do anything for me. It just resulted in an awkward conversation between me and my parents. And now I just find myself constantly thinking about killing myself. Because in my head suicide is the perfect answer, all my problems would be gone and there would be no more stress, y'know?

I just.. don't know what to do. I don't really have friends to get support from, I don't think my parents are gonna be any help. So now I'm here on reddit asking complete strangers for help because somehow that's less scary than talking to the people I know (and this is a site I don't even use that often)."
1034,What do head meds feel like? Do they completely take you over?,"I have always wondered what “head” meds feel like/do to you. Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, and whatever all else there is. If being down is so central to ones being and these meds make you feel “up”, does it feel somehow like a fake/synthetic “up”? Overall, what does taking head meds feel like? Do they completely take you over and become you? Act on your behalf, etc. I really want to understand. Do you feel you lose anything? Creativity? Dreams? Do they totally hijack who you are/were? Did you ever feel out of control on them and had to stop, because you’d rather suffer whatever it was they were meant to fix than not be fully in control? It’s such a deep, complex, and fascinating topic."

1037,Anxiety due to guilt,"This seemed such a small matter to share, but it’s been causing me stress and anxiety and I hope to find some relief.

I am a university student and this past week, I’ve been bombarded with assignments and with stress piling up, not being able to go out in so long, my physical state was at the low. Two days ago, at 930am in the morning, I had a group presentation. I even practiced and all but ended up not being able to hear my alarm and missed the online presentation. I woke up at 10am and found out that the presentation was over and they were doing a q&amp;a. I was prompted to join but at that point I was panicking and so anxious that I could not go into class. I apologized several times to my group members and while one of them told me it was really okay and understandable, others did not reply (i completely understand though). I was completely dejected, filled with guilt and anxiety and haven’t been able to really overcome anxiety from it since. I have emailed my professor but he has not replied me back either. My biggest anxiety comes from how I negatively impacted the group members and how they would think of me as well as the professor, and it’s been eating me alive ever since. I just feel really terrible and worthless—any advice or support would be appreciated.

tldr: woke up late and missed a group presentation, feeling really anxious and sad since"

All these people who told me to talk to them when things get hard, all these people I trust and hold on for. I don't blame them but I'm starting to think they're not worth holding on for. A lot is going on and a lot of little victories I've embraced, yet it's just not enough. I'm fatigued for no apparent reasons, school works keep piling up, exams postponed.. I can't deal with school and I can't deal with the fact that no one likes me when I get this way. It's not like I have a switch off button. I don't like it when I get this way either. I'm tired. And by that I mean I'm tired about everything when all I do is nothing. Maybe I should try harder? But what would be the fucking point? Its the same thing every time, I self isolate when I feel this way, and people leave me be. And when I get help it's all the same advice I've told myself a million times. I feel like a burden to myself. I self sabotage-- I'll try and try again yet i just feel hopeless. I don't blame anyone. I don't even blame myself. I know I did what I could and tried as I can. I don't think the fucking sunrise is worth holding on for. Not even for the people I might help if I live to see tomorrow. Not even for myself, or my dog.

I hate that it doesn't matter if I stay sh free or not. If I cut myself I've failed. but I still feel like I'm failing even though I'm one year? So what does it matter?! Why can't I atleast make myself feel better and be a failure? 

I fucking hate how Anytime I. Struggling with anything I somehow convince myself that I'm lying and only doing it for attention. 

And I think it's so frustrating that I can't connect with people the way I want to. I have such great friends who are nothing but kind to me. but I still manage to convince myself they want nothing to do with me. I still can't talk to them or open up to them like they do to me. I'm always tenses and akward, I don't even eat or drink around them with out being forced to. There are days when I literally can't even manage saying hello to them.

1045,I don’t feel like I’m real.,"I’m a very odd person and awful at socializing, but I really try to be normal. So much so that I think I forgot who I really am. My mind feels like a tornado of a thousand clashing opinions, and I don’t remember what was mine or that of someone I was talking to. I tend to mimic a lot when I talk to people. 70% of the time I have no clue what they’re trying to say to me so I just try to agree and escape the conversation. Like I can hear them but they’re just not making sense.

I don’t know what’s me, and the only way I’ve found to deal with that depressing fact is constant distractions. Constant. 

I went one day without playing video games and my mind kept rushing back to the idea that I am essentially non-existent. Just a husk meant to be accepted by people I don’t and will probably never understand. 

It’s terrifying, and there doesn’t feel like there’s an answer. Nothing feels real. It’s like I’m living in someone else’s body and nobody notices. Nobody. I’m just very distressed."
1046,A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness," 

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don’t ever take it for granted.**

Don’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill"
1047,I feel like I'm dying every day,"I have really bad depression and anxiety. It's been an extremely bad couple of weeks. I'm in a bad livimg situation that's extremely uncomfortable and hostile. Worst part is that I can't leave. I have no where to go, live in a farm town, and can't drive. Every morning I wake up sick (nausea, vomiting, migraine), so I medicate with cannbis. I also take Cymbalta and busperone every evening.

My doctor refuses to medicate my anxiety with anything other than benadryl. Which I already take an unhealthy amount of. It's this constant dread of having to suffer through another day... Another year.. It's suffocating. When I lay down to go to sleep, I convince myself that I'm going to die tonight. I don't know if it's because it's just the way i feel physically and emotionally or if it's because I honestly hope I do.

I feel the urge to just harm myself every day. I haven't in a couple months. But a part of me just wants to throw it away and just do it. I know that it won't solve anything. I just need to bitch and moan about my feelings. Thank you for reading my bullshit."
1048,"Anger, Lack Of Logical Reasons &amp; More Issues With A Family Member","We've been dealing with a family member possibly having undiagnosed mental health issues &amp; it's starting to take a toll so I'm here to vent &amp; maybe get some ideas on how we can take this forward.

The person in question (61y;F) in a country where culturally, families are tight knit, patriarchy is strong (though weakening in urban areas) and parents/mom are always right. A little background : The Possible Patient (PP) has been separated from her husband for years now and has 3 sons out of who 1 is married. Only 1 son lives with her currently and they aren't on good terms.

The problems that we see with her are:  
**- Extreme Anger Issues:** The smallest things can upset PP greatly. When her children were younger, they have been subjected to a lot of ""normalised"" abuse when she got angry. I write ""normalised"" because parents hitting children in our culture was a relatively normal thing. Because of this, she got away with it too but it's important to note that she really took it to another level. Even today, she is angered easily. Sometimes, she recognises her anger when reflecting back on it. She's also always angry about her separation from her husband and that no one from the community could step up to stop it. 

**- Lack of Logical Reasoning &amp; Understanding:** It's next to impossible to reason with her logically. Because of this, she also doesn't understand reasons behind our several actions and gets extremely angered and then it's almost impossible to calm her down.   
*A recent example: One of her sons was to pick her up &amp; bring her to his house for a specific reason. PP suggested she could take a cab but son said no due to the pandemic and that he will pick her up in the afternoon. An installation for something at his house that was supposed to happen that morning got delayed repeatedly &amp; the labour showed up just as he was about to leave to pick PP up. He couldn't postpone so called her up to tell her so they could re-plan but she didn't pick up.He continued to call her several times over the next 1 hour but she didn't pick up. He also tried another way to get in touch with her but it didn't work out. She finally called him back right as the labour was leaving. As per original plan he was supposed to have been there at the time to pick her up. He filled her in and told her about his delay and she instantly got angry. He then told her he could still leave then and pick her up, but if she is on a strict timeline, she could take a cab so they could save time. That was it and she was absolutely enraged. She screeched/screamed/yelled. She was angry her ""son didn't make a proper plan and doesn't want her there."" No amount of reasoning worked &amp; the anger lasted days.*

Other problems include:  
\- Always wanting things her way. She's constantly lecturing everyone around her on how to lead their lives. It gets exhausting to be around her because of this.  
\- Not listening/comprehending things others say. I don't know if this is because she doesn't listen to others when they speak or because she genuinely cannot comprehend what is being said. *Example: We recently took her shopping and she kept wanting these one particular style of pants. The lady kept telling her they don't have it in her size but she just kept asking for it repeatedly. This happens a lot when she likes/wants something and others are presenting a different POV/talking about a problem.*   
\- She doesn't have a social circle and always ends up fighting with any friends she makes.  
\- She's extremely conscious and often thinks people are laughing at her/talking about her or how her husband left her.  
\- She's often delusional and talks about unrealistic things. Nothing too crazy but just...silly/outdated.  
\- Repeating herself often. If she has something to tell you that she believes is good for you, she will constantly repeat herself despite us acknowledging what she has to say multiple times. 

It's impossible to take her to a therapist but we're hoping to take her by using an excuse of ""family counselling"" with her. Let's see if it works."

1050,I don’t know where to start. I am a 19 year old male and I’ve felt so bad for so long. How do I understand my feelings,I feel like I am faking things for attention.  For so long I have wanted help but in my head I say that it’s for attention that I don’t need help and I’m making it up.  I don’t know what is real.  I feel numb and I feel pain and I feel totally fine. I’m so lost and confused and I don’t undertAnd how I feel at all.  How am I supposed to understand what I feel.  I try to talk to my friends but I feel like I can’t tell them what I feel I can’t get my feelings into words.  I don’t know what to do I’m so lost.

1052,can anyone help explain this? :(,"Hi so I've had this really weird feeling lately and i cant really seem to understand it. over the past couple of weeks I've suffered with extreme overthinking and not being able to think straight. My brain has attached itself to the idea that i am transgender (which if i was wouldn't be an issue btw) without any real evidence of being uncomfortable in my own body or any evidence at all. It's just one of these thoughts that continuously shows me new ""proof"" that isn't true, and even though i know it isn't true i can't seem to stop thinking about it. Fortunately after weeks of non stop overthinking the thought has seemed to slow down and I'm able to push it away, but now i am left with the weirdest feeling, something I've never felt before. I've never felt as though i am in the wrong body and never felt uncomfortable with my 'parts', but after this whole overthinking thing im left feeling really strange. Its quite hard to explain but the only way i can really describe it is feeling like a drag queen, (i know it doesn't make much sense) its as though i have the mind of a boy and the voice inside my head is the one of a boy, but i want to be a girl and am in the body of a boy. I don't know if this is what it feels like to be transgender, but i also have no desire to be a boy or be more masculine (i know that doesn't mean i can't be transgender). whenever i dress feminine i almost feel like when guys wear skirts and makeup, almost like a drag queen. it might also just be that my (sort of) deep voice confuses me, whenever i talk it seems so strange, as though it isn't mine. I thought i might be3 non binary, and i still think i probably am, but i really want to feel like a girl and be comfortable being feminine, and i dont think that means i am non binary but i could be wrong. Most of this year i have spent in my own head (i moved to a new school) and spend most of my time in silence and hardly talk at all anymore, so hearing my voice could be confusing me. I have no idea what any of this means but it has only occurred recently in the last few days as I've recovered from my weeks of overthinking. I've recently started seeing a psychologist and she's helping me through all of this, but with this new feeling i haven't had a chance to talk to her about it yet. I hope this makes sense as i don't really know how to explain it, i want to be a girl, i want to be more feminine, but it's almost as though something in my brain doesn't feel like that 'suits' me in a way. when im sitting here writing this it's almost as though i am hearing it in a mans voice, i don't know why. honestly I'm probably just overthinking this way too much, so if anyone has any tips on how to slow down my brain and the overthinking it would be greatly appreciated :)"
1053,does this count as sexual harassment?,"⚠️possible trigger warning⚠️

idk if this is the right sub, sorry if its not

when i was 11 or 12 (i think) i was at my friends house and we were sitting on her bed. i was laying down and for some reason she got on top of me and straddled me, i pushed her off but she got back on and wouldn't get off. she did it 3 times, once on a different day but the same situation. she didnt do anything else but i felt really gross and talking to her made me feel worse. she never apologized, i never brought it up. now that we arent friends anymore she denies it ever happening 

i never considered that it could be harassment until today and i feel really weird about it. shes not a good person and never has been, i dont know if she knew what she was doing and still decided to do it anyway."

1055,please give me encouencouragement im having anxiety this never happens,"I’m basically begging for some encouragement from you

Hello guys, I have just joined this community and to be very honest. To let out what is messing up my head and my mental health. If you’re reading, please just acknowledge or say something because I really don’t have anyone to share my stuff with anymore. I’m a grade 12 student in highschool right now, soon applying to universities. To be frank, pre-covid i used to be spoiled, only caring about parties, sex, and all that dumb useless highschool stuff. I had a 80 average in grade 11 which is not bad but not the best. I realized that my friends have no future and all they care about is vaping, girls with big breasts and just not giving back what they got from their parents. I’m only 18 but my life has been moving countries, cities and schools so much. And I have gone through shit and I’ve acted like the rebellious kids too. But I realized, all my mistakes and everything in quarantine. And I knew if i wanted to change, things needed to be harsh. I needed to take strict actions. I cut all my spoiled friends, only have the ones who study now. I am excelling in academics like I never have, I have one of the best marks compared to all students rn and a 93 average. The kids who I used to beg for homework last year to plagiarize and all now call me and ask for my help. I put everything of myself into studying and I actually like it now. But the problem is, I’m trying to go to a film school. i have the marks and the extracurriculars, and good written answers. what i dont have is a portfolio, hell I’m not even bad and I’ve such creative ideas. I swear I know I can make a portfolio i.e. short stories and I know I can get into my dream film school. I know because I have worked immensely hard to change my life around at stuff I wasn’t good at but this is something I am actually good at. But everytime I try and start video editing and learning color grading videos, I just burst out crying that I will fail. All this hardwork will be useless. Time is running out, I need to make my portfolio soon, I know i can do this, but at the same time, I just...cant. I have come so so far than I ever imagined myself to come and I can’t back down, not now, not anymore. This is the most successful I have been my whole life and this is the most happy I have ever made my parents. I cant back down, but I just...I get scared, I’m getting scared to move forward to do those uni apps, that portfolio because im scared. scared that i will fail and all the work will be useless. god im rambling so much i’m so sorry. i am getting so anxious while writing this but I don’t have any friends who will listen to me anymore. I don’t know what to do, just if you can, please just acknowledge something aboit me if u can. I know I can reach great heights, I just..."

1057,Is it normal to be unaffected by death?,"I have been dealing with people dying a lot for someone who is only 26. My stepmom, my mom, a sister, one of my favorite cousins, all my grandparents, 4 miscarriages, and several other less important figures. But from my moms death onward I don't seem to be bothered anymore. My dad nearly died last month and all I could say was ""that doesn't surprise me."" I was prepared for the worst but not in a dreading way, just kind of like ""well, at least he will stop being in pain"" kinda way. Like no sadness, no sense of loss, just, nothing. Death statistics are nothing more than vaguely interesting. I just don't seem to care. I doubt its sociopathic because I still have a strong sense of empathy but death is almost meaningless to me. It feels weird to have no emotion about it when literally anyone else freaks out over it."

1060,What are 5 positive things you can say about yourself right now.,"I have noticed how many of you beautiful souls can't see the beauty within yourself. You may even read other posts with people thinking negative things about themselves and you have not thought that at all about them, and know that others think the same about you, how could you think such negative things about yourself, its not true, but for some reason your mind has believed it about you.

Every post i read i see people who have established false and negative beliefs about themselves, and this comes from a mixture of traumas and our society and lack of good leadership towards creating and instilling the things that matter most in life. You and me, we are what matter, not things, or status, or where you live, or income etc. Life is precious, we are a part of life and I want to try and help you all let go of all these thoughts that create your own suffering.

I know that some people want to identify with a mental condition, but you don't want that, don't identify with these things.All mental conditions are really symptoms of much greater underlying causes within the subconscious mind. If you are feeling super depressed then stop saying ""I'm depressed"" because the more you do that the more you keep putting that impression in the mind. Now i know all about depression, and suicidal depression, but i also know i was experiencing depression, i am not depression. The next step to ask then is why do i feel depressed. This can take a lot of practice to learn to sit with the discomfort but seek the answers from within. I know this to be a fact because i have done it and learned a great deal about the mind in doing so. This applies to all negative feelings you have, they are feedback to let you know something isn't right in your thinking and this can be from external factors such as negative people of even substance abuse within yourself., and when the mind gets disorderly it can be hard to know what to do to find peace within which is really what everyone wants, its just that people go about in ways that ultimately aren't helpful. People turn to drugs and alcohol as an attempt to find peace by obliterating their minds, but it just ends up with more pain, its a method but not a great one. So what's the answer then?

Its a process of cultivating a mind of peace. There are different aspects to this and its a holistic approach, that is all areas of your life must be addressed, from the food you eat, what you watch, listen to, your environment at home,or even just in your bedroom is that's all you have, and begin to notice all the things that dont make you feel good about yourself. Then remove those things from your life as much as practicable or diminish exposure to them at least. Food, placse people, things, habits etc, you know what they are you just need to take action towards your mental health in this regard. Now the reason to get this stuff out the way as much as possible so you can start to work through the junk in your mind you need to deal with. In my opinion the only way out of mental anguish to address it. Popping pills every-time you get anxious is not fixing a thing. Its another escapism a lot of the time. I am not saying not to use medications if you are doing so, especially if it helps what i am saying is that there are much deeper issues within the subconscious levels of the mind that need to be dealt with for true healing to take place. All medications do is treat the symptoms, not the cause, they don't heal you.  I am telling you words of truth because i cured myself of schzo-afective disorder, so i know its possible, and through my own research have found others do the same. Not everyone is ready necessarily right now to really do what it takes, because i can tell you from personal experience, its not easy, and its challenging and its painful. But its what is needed for true healing.

There is a lot to be said about the power of stopping, closing your eyes and then just breathing in as slowly in through the nose so that your lungs expand fully, and you do this by allowing your stomach to rise as you breathe in, then slowly release the breath either through the mouth or nose. I recommend only exhaling 3-5 times through mouth them through the nose exclusively. Just stop, and just think i am only going to think and focus on what it feel like to breathe right now, and keep shutting off any other thoughts when you start to think about anything else than your breath.

Each day think 5 good things about yourself, think 10 things you either already are or would like to see within yourself. Move your attention away from the tired worn out old negative self talk about yourself and others. Think about how you can be more loving towards others, then think how you can then also be that to yourself, because this is really the focus, keep thinking and focussing on how you can feel more love within you, research how to do it, consume your life and mind with everything positive, research ways not to feel depressed or anxious, listen to everyones perspective. I know this is rudimentary but that is it, how much positivity in your life and thinking do you experience daily?  i am not surprised by how much anxiety and depression there is when i see how most peoples days are filled up with so much negativity, and oyu likely dont realise because you have become accustomed to it, and as a result you may now be experiencing a mess of emotions and confusion. There is enough mental disordered thoughts in many peoples heads anyway, so cut out the negativity as the very basic first step. This is the first step and i know many think its wasy but its not, you will realise how dependant you are on a lot f the negative aspects in your life. The way around this is this:

Recognise the isssue, Remove the issue, Replace it with something positive.

I write what i have written so far because i really do care about you that are suffering, i have been there. I wrote a book this year about it, i invested the money i had into this book because its what i have to share with the world a positive path to how i found peace within.

There is nothing wrong with you, its the disordered thoughts and false negative beliefs you hold about yourself that is the issue, not you. The mind needs to be re-ordered, and it can be done."
1061,HOW TO TYPE | 3888 variants for each jungian type (enneagram elements mix) and mental health notes.,"Cognitive functions vibes of enneagram types. I also added some interesting observations and correlations about personality disorders/mental illnesses and information metabolism.

Correlations don't imply causation. Having a certain information metabolism doesn't automatically translate in the individual having specific personality disorders. Rather it indicates that the individual is potentially more suspectible to that specific personality disorders/mental illnesses.

The enneagram (basic motivations), as well as non-typology factors, can influence the individual in how he/she chooses to develop functions. Overall I found out that each jungian type can have 3888 archetypal variants (differerent mix of enneagram elements)... Some combinations are more common, some less.

Overall these differentations can lead to ""pseudo-types"", with the individual appearing to have a different type on surface level. A lot of people mistype themselves initially to the pseudo type. Also a celeb can be easily mistyped superficially to his/her pseudo-type. Be very careful when typing someone!

1062,Should I warn my friend about a possible trigger,"POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING 

- self harm mentioned -

Hi so my friend and I are going away for schoolies (aus) next week and since it’s coming into summer we are going to go swimming, wear shorts etc. (Relevant later I promise)

Recently I noticed she had a few self harm scars on the top of her arm. I didn’t think it was my place to bring it up, she knows I am here for her. I asked my friend who she confides in more if she is safe and I got a yes. Apparently they’re kinda not deliberate? I’m assuming in mental breakdowns they happen when not in the right state of mind. 

Now to the part where we live together for a week. I have self harm scars on my thighs that she hasn’t seen before and I doubt knows they are there. I’m unsure if I should warn her about them before hand so she can prepare herself for a possible trigger? On the other hand they quite high up and I’m not one for bikinis so it’s possible she may never see them (I also wear boardies) should I risk possibly triggering her now by telling her or just hope she doesn’t see them?

I’m sorry if that was a bit rambling
TLDR: should I pre warn my friend she might see my self harm scars as it could be a possible trigger for her. But she might not even see them"
1063,Lack of Motivation During this Pandemic [F22],"Hello everyone, I just feel like I need to vent. I don't know what to do. Before I get into it, I'll tell you a few things about me:

I've always struggled with anxiety and depression throughout my childhood. It was to the point where I couldn't bring myself to go to school or meet people. Of course living in a household with traditional Asian parents didn't make it any easier. I had expectations I had to meet. The decline of my mental health brought me deeper into the pit. Years passed by, I tried to get better, my dad passed due to cancer just before my last year of highschool, and then..I just  couldn't do it anymore. I ended up dropping out of hs in my last year because I couldn't cope.


I'm a lot better now. I even have a career choice in mind and I really want to go back to school so that I can pursue my dream. The problem is that I'm constantly thinking that I'm running out of time. I signed up for online courses for adult learning last November before covid, and I still haven't completed them yet. My goal is to finish 2 courses by January 11, 2021 and work on my portfolio to submit to my university of choice by April. During this pandemic, I've lost a lot of my work hours and a large portion of my income and am also dealing with a lack of motivation on depression. I feel like everytime I try to bring myself back up I end up hitting a wall. I had a plan, I really thought it through and through - I feel lost. I feel disappointed in myself and I just feel like I'm letting a lot of ppl down. At this rate I feel like I won't be able to apply for the program I wanted to go in this year. I don't know what to do."

1066,Love / not,"I am currently 24 years old. When I was in school  I was really intrigued by the idea of love. I wanted to find love so badly . I had crushes and short term relationships and such but I never got in a real relationship until I started college. My first and only long term relationship was in the 3 years of college. During the last semester of college my bf at the time told me that he is still in love with his ex and they were in a on again off again relationship even when we were dating. Obviously I felt bad.  I even cried . But the next day I woke and it all went away. I was no more in love. I felt kind of relieved . I was in good terms with my ex until I had to move away. 

It was a weird feeling that I thought I liked this person  so much and the moment I had to end the relationship it was like flipping a switch and I no longer felt anything for him.When I went back and thought about other incidents, I have been told by many people that I dont love anyone. I used to feel bad when people say that I dont love anyone. But at some point I just had to acknowledge the fact that I dont have an emotional connection to anyone.Not even to my parents or siblings. I dont have close friends neither am  I romantically interested  in anyone. 

On the contrary I like being alone.People look at me weird when I say it. I often think if I am a bad person because I dont miss home or because I make a concious effort to get lunch alone instead of with casual friends from work.

 It's not like I dont feel anything. I sometimes feel like I am constantly in pain... Or like I am falling and falling and falling just waiting to hit the ground. I don't know it's confusing how it feels. 

I just wanted someone's opinion. Is it normal not feel emotionally attached to anyone ?"

To make a long story short, it was NOT covid but my smart self used that trigger word and now I have to self quarantine because I work at a school. So you’re thinking ‘what’s the big deal? Paid time off because you said COVID?’ Well it’s honestly made me reevaluate my entire life. I have no idea what I’m doing and honestly I feel like I am developing schizophrenia because of all the trauma I have been through and my son is just the icing on top."

 I just wanted to say a place I live in is going on lockdown again, I haven't been out of quarantine in nearly a year now in a few months it will be a year since I have been in school since I haven't seen my best friends that had to leave the country in almost a year. I am wondering when people will stop dying and when people will start wearing their masks when people will stop partying during a pandemic. I just wish people would listen and stay inside when we are supposed to, oh my god... I just looked at the world deaths. 1.34 million people have died from this virus, to those who have lost somebody I am so sorry I just pray I won't lose myself or anyone else from this.

I don't want another lockdown but honestly, if it prevents more deaths I am okay with it. I haven't been myself in months and my parents and therapist know, my mental health got extremely bad and I lost a lot of people to death this year, I am praying for everyone is doing okay and coping well. I just wanted to post a log here I highly doubt anyone will read this on my subreddit, wash your hands, wear your masks and social distance, stay healthy :)"

I just feel like my mental health is worsening, it’s just getting worse and worse and it’s destroying my self esteem on a daily basis :(

There's like one time she wants me to be in a medical field but I like taking accountancy more. She was so mad. For a week, we've been arguing and to the point, she threw our telephone at me. I went to school the next day my body filled with bruises. I told her this is my future we're talking about. She keep on saying who'll gonna take care of her when she get old.

Im just so confused. Ive gone from being completely destroyed to just nothing, empty. I had a call regarding my job looking positive for me and i didnt feel any weight lifted, just the same. I feel guilty for smiling and laughing and i feel like ive lost my motivation for life. Ive got no goals and its like im stuck in a weird limbo of i dont enjoy life, but i dont want to end it either. This was also the case before i met my gf, its like meeting her fixed my life and now its falling apart. Like ts highlighted the issues ive had before in a much greater light. 

Even without what im going through recently, ive always had trouble meeting and talking to new people because i just dont know what to do. Im constantly worried that if i have a conversation ill say something to offend or hurt someone. I also have a habit of just letting a conversation die when it can be carried on or trying to continue a dead conversation.
Again  i cant tell if this is a problem or me worrying to much.

Ive never done anything about it because my biggest fear is that its all me over worrying and its nothing and I'll be seen as almost disrespecting anyone with a genuine mental illness."
1080,"What kind of therapy should I look for? (Obsession towards my ex, breakdowns, social phobia, anxiety)","**Backstory:**
__I (24M) used to date a person with Borderline Personality Disorder this summer, and now that she left (actually 2 ½ months ago) me I'm totally obsessed by this person (21F), and think about her everyday, I think I'm codependent.

When we were dating, I didn't know about her personality disorder, she self diagnosed it 1 month ago and told me (yes, we're still talking at least once a week). __

**Issues**

While at first I was obsessed about how the relationship ended (which I think it is pretty normal as the previous day she was telling me how much she loved me, then the following afternoon that she liked someone else), when she told me about BPD I had a sort of quiet week because I felt that I finally understood the reason of the breakup... But then, after this realization and a week of quietness I started worrying about her and ""caretaking"" her.

And this obsession is hurtful, as I can't do anything anymore. I'm a college student, and when I start studying I keep distracting because I think about her.

It was the first time I've ever felt romantic attraction towards someone.

Also since the breakup, aside from this obsession which is my main symptom, other things are happening:

- I'm having continuous breakdowns, at least once a week I find myself crying in my bed, alternated with some sense of emptiness.

- social anxiety. I can't meet groups of people anymore. I enter a state of anxiety so I started to isolate myself from friends. (Just saying, before Covid I used to organize nerd events with 100-150 people, and I used to go around the tables talking and assuring everything was doing good/explaining things to gamers). Now if there's more than like 3 people I know I drop everything. The only way that allows me to meet these groups is Valium.

- I can't sleep. I continuously wake up at night, and in the morning I feel sleep deprived. As other physiological symptoms, the first month I couldn't even eat (I lost 7kgs (around 15 lbs I guess) in that month).

**First experience with a therapist (psycodynamic therapy)**

My University offered a free psychological health service for students having troubles, but it's bureaucratically limited in the number of sessions.
I've had a few psychodynamic psychotherapy sessions with a psychiatrist, and she said that the breakup was the trigger for sure, but I have more underlying problems (she hasn't been too explicit, aside from mentioning that I'm totally unable to manage my emotional sphere) which should be treated by a more long term approach with another therapist (even due to the fact that I'm stuck at home because of lockdown, so it's better finding someone nearby where I live).

She has not given indication on what kind of therapist I should look for, though. What do you think? Again psycodynamic? Cognitive behavioral? Or something else?"
1081,"Don't want to be ""in the middle"" [eating disorder recovery]","167 cm and almost 15. Currently recovering from anorexia. I've never been technically underweight for my age, only borderline underweight. They want me to be healthy, and my periods coming back will be a good indication of that. My periods haven't came back yet, I'm at least 50 kg now, and my goal weight is 54 kg (which is like the 50th percentile for my age and height). I know I'm skinny and I absolutely love it, but I'm scared that some time in the future (like after recovery) I'm going to be ""curvy"" again. Obviously still far from obese, but more ""cuddly"" or ""on the chubbier side"" or ""in the middle"" or ""slim, but not skinny"". I'm frightened, I don't want to be that way at all! I want to stay skinny."
1082,Having trouble finding a Psychologist in my area,"I am really struggling right now with stress and depression, and have decided to finally seek help (though I suspect it’s to late). I tried to look for a psychologist in my area through my health insurances website, but the list was very limited/ far away. I tried to call my MD though it seems he is out of town until next week and not sure if he will have a list anyway. 

How does someone go about finding a psychologist? I feel like I’m drowning right now and don’t even know where to start."
1083,Lonelieness and hopelessness feelings - can anyone relate?,"Can anyone relate to these feelings of lonelieness and hopelessness? I'll describe how it impacts me below but I have yet to meet anyone with these kinds of thoughts. 

I'm female, 31 and have had these feelings for yearsss but it comes and goes and I'm usually very good at ignoring and surpressing. However with this pandemic it has been harder for me to surpress and it's becoming an issue.

 I don't like being alone. I've been working from home since March and even towards the end of the work day I start to get sad and gloomy. It is starting to impact my relationship with my husband too because if he is wants to have lunch with a friend he has to make sure I'm occupied because hes afraid to leave me alone and come home to a sad version of myself. Even if he leaves for a few hours on a weekend to meet up with someone or help someone i get very sad and unmotivated to do anything and I become a blob. I'm only able to avoid these feelings if I myself am busy hanging out with someone else.

it even happens in social situations when I'm around acquaintances/strangers. My husband is the type to say hi to anyone. If I'm already primed with my dark cloudy mindset, I tend to withdraw even further and don't want to interact with anyone even though I am feeling lonely. Enter the hopelessness feeling. When it comes to socializing with strangers/acquaintances I get this overwhelming thought of ""what's the point"" and ""their lives are perfectly fine without me in it so what's the point in saying hi to this stranger, they will continue living with or without me so an interaction with me doesn't matter"". I feel so small and unimportant. Even though I receive so much love from my husband every day. When I think about it, it doesn't make sense, but these feelings still take over sometimes.
 
When I get this feeling of loneliness/hopelessness I can usually swat it away and ignore it, but when I lean into it I withdraw into myself and struggle to snap out of it. It's like I'm walking through mud and I'm trying to crawl out but it's so hard because I don't feel strong enough even if someone is trying to help me out. I usually need to go to sleep and I'll be better the next day. Like a reset button.

This was unintentionally long but I wanted to see if this was something others have experienced. Can anyone else relate? If so how do you cope with it? I want to get better. 

Thank you :)"
1084,"I really need some advice, I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while now. Since covid has popped up I have been forced into inaction. I have no motivation to do anything no matter how much I try. I struggle sleeping and at this point I feel like I'm fucked.","&amp;#x200B;

No matter how many times I promise myself to go in to collage I cant bring myself to do it, I try so hard but any motivation and even will to get out of bed just vanishes. I'm terrified they are going to kick me off and then my future will be fucked. My parents constantly display their disappointment no matter how many times I try to do things. I try to explain that I'm trying but I always just get a '' Whatever '' and ""Your lazy"". I don't know what to do at this point I'm slowly giving up. No matter what I try to do it i just cant bring myself to do things i know i must do."
1085,What do I do?,"I know the pandemic has been impacting everyone's lives in a negative way, but how is everyone else still managing to get things done. I'm a sophomore in high school, and the work is always very difficult to manage with my terrible mental health. It's not like I don't understand it, I just can't get my body to move and do it. Even now I'm writing this rather then getting my work done. I just can't move and it stresses me out. This is just one of the things that's been effecting me. Recently, my health has been getting worse because of my lack of exercise and poor eating habits, and I know I should change I just don't know how. In middle school I'd always have extremely bad mental breakdowns and I ended up going to a therapist who only said ""find someone to relate too"". I'm so tired and I can't move to get work done. My back hurts a lot and its difficult to breathe and all of my issues that I pushed aside in the beginning of high school came back and hit me 10 times worse. I always feel so empty yet I feel so much at the same time and I can't process it. Whenever I'm in public I get hyper and talk to anyone and everyone without thinking my actions through. I'm loud and obnoxious yet when I'm alone I feel sick and tired. I also daydream for at least 4 hours a day and if I don't I get agitated. I'm sorry this is all over the place, I just don't know how to properly get my emotions out. 

**Does anybody know how I could fix these issues? Or at least any tips on being able to explain things better?**"
1086,"I feel like I'm in a competition constantly with all the other mentally ill people I know personally, and I feel so horrifically guilty","I've struggled for as long as I can remember with my mental health. I'm currently at uni (somehow) and I'm so close to my housemates, they're my best friends. I've been going through a horrific mega crisis lately and I started cutting again after being clean for a couple of years, and I know that one of my housemates has seen it. He struggles with his mental health too, and we've spoken about cutting in the past and I know he'd never done it, but after I started I know that he's since started too. This is completely my fault: if I hadn't restarted then he wouldn't have seen me and copied. I feel so so so guilty but also so angry, because in my mind I feel like I always have to be more sick than everyone around me - I don't know why, it's just always been that way so when I see things like my best friend cutting it makes me feel guilty, anxious because I love him and he's hurting himself, and also so angry because I'M the sick one and it's being taken away from me (which I know on a rational level is so so so horrible and I shouldn't think like that because everyone's struggle is valid but I just CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT). I am really obsessing about it but before I noticed he was cutting I was just really obsessing about him, which I tend to do a lot as well - I get close to someone in a friend way and I think I've fallen in love with them, and my whole world starts to revolve around them instead of me. I'm so broken up inside and I don't know what to think or how I feel, everything has just merged into one big Blob Of Anxiety and I cannot physically move the majority of my body because it's all so tense and I can feel the anxiety everywhere. I feel like I'm going to have to kill myself at some point just to prove to myself that I AM the sickest, which is horrible to me and also to everyone around me. I have seen countless therapists and psychiatrists and psychologists but I just don't know how to get help for this because I don't know what it is. I just want it all to go away so I don't have to try to cope anymore, because the world it very heavy"
1087,Struggling,"I got super-triggered yesterday at Program. It was the STUPIDEST thing too that had done it. The counselor had lit a candle and had put it on the table at the front of the room. Usually I LOVE candles (obvious reasons and normal reasons!) but this time, it had sent me spiralling into my Pyromania like I haven't experienced in a LONG time. I mean, I have been triggered a lot since I'd begun this journey (including going to prison) but I hadn't been triggered on THIS scale since I had been up in the woods, setting fires to boxes, papers, and assorted junk. I needed to chill out...and I couldn't do it. Ugh. Either my Pyromania is going back to that level (and evolving into something stronger...and possibly more dangerous?) or I am going crazy. I don't think it is the latter. Seriously. I am functioning. I can take care of my needs just fine. I just have this fucking demon inside me that won't leave me alone. I LOVE my Animal with all my heart (please don't try to analyze that or even understand it) but Jesus Christmas. I can't believe how strong that was. It took EVERY OUNCE of my willpower to not go home and set a fire that I can't be setting (there are too many dry leaves around my ""area"" right now so it is not safe)...or take off and do something very illegal (but satisfying DAMMIT) again. I had only gotten the smallest relief, if you can call it that, by playing with my lighter when we went out for break. We get a 5 minute break every hour, and a 15 minute break around 12 noon to get food for the Lunch Group.

Fuck. I call these feelings (I guess the easier term would be urges) as ""being UP"", which means that my disorder is very active and usually controllable. I need to find a word to describe that feeling I had yesterday. That wasn't just UP...that was ...??????...

Sorry to vent like this. The counselors here are great and all BUT...they have no training to deal with what I have. Not one therapist/psych in this area has had more than just a short education on it--probably in their Abnormal Psych classes in their college classes. Sad. So here I am...lost and confused.

And people wonder why I was/am suicidal. How would YOU guys (a general you guys, not Redditors specifically) like a demon like this in your head 24/7/365. No rest, not even sleep. My dreams are funky a lot of the time, and the disorder is there when I wake up, and when I lay my head on my pillow at night. I don't expect much reply to this. I don't expect anyone to understand. There are so few of us that it is hard to feel part of this world sometimes...not always, but at times. Bye now, I guess. I am supposed to be watching a video at my Partial Hospitalization Program...I am not watching. I actually am writing this and listening to Phil Collins belt out ""I Don't Care Anymore""...

How appropriate for my mood today."

1089,"My husband has chronic physical conditions, I am depressed. I feel guilty about confiding in him about my depression and need advice.","To simplify... my husband is constantly dealing with a few different physical ailments, most of which are chronic and don't go away. He's always dealing with something new that is physically wrong with him, and I'm left to deal with everything. We don't have kids. I also work full time and we are in the middle of dealing with some issues with our home. Because he is always sick, I'm just stuck dealing with all of this, including taking care of him.

On top of all this, I have been dealing with depression since I was a teenager, so over 20 years.

Lately, the depression has gotten worse. I used to get a break every now and then for myself, which helped so much. But since COVID, we are together ALL THE TIME, and his illnesses have just become more prevalent. I feel overwhelmed all the time. I feel helpless against everything that's wrong with him. I feel pressure to continue performing well at work.

I feel guilty about telling him any of this because he is suffering and going through enough right now. I don't want to put this stress on him on top of everything, but I cry multiple times a day when he's not around. I don't feel like I can continue going on like this without getting some help, but I literally don't have time to seek help for myself.

I just don't know what to do anymore, and I don't know how to talk to him, or if I even should, but life just feels like it's too much right now."
1090,Completly crashing,"So yeah, I am atm completly going to crap inside my own mind and have to just really tell this to some strangers on the internet.

I am not ""vibing"" on this pandamic. 

I am a 22 year old guy from the Netherlands and had a relationship from januari to august this year. I broke up with her because I noticed myself getting worse mentally. She had visual snow and not the best situation and I have even prevented 1 or 2 suicide attempts of her. After I broke up with her to prevent myself from going insane I learned that she hook up and got into a relation with a guy I introduced to her. She was closecduring our relation but I felt it was platonic and both of them assured it to. No cheating occured btw, we were together all the time so it couldn't be possible. 

She got with him no les than a week after the breakup. I know, not really my problem but it does hurt. I know 5 months isn't long but we fucking LIVED together for 3 of em. It really hurts to think I was blind to that.

That is one thing I am going bad on atm. The other is the lack of seeing people. I miss going out and clubbing, going to festivals and all that shit. I miss just worrying about school or work. I feel shitty most of the time.

Another fact about me. I have ADHD and PDD-NOS (autism) and not a little bit too. At age 10 they thought I would never be able to be self sufficient and could never have a high degree because of it, seeming as that would need a high level of being indipendent and I lacked that. I worked my fucking ass off improving myself and outdid myself. I was the fucking secretary of the regional student counsil which I ALSO HELPED SET UP. Multiple internships have very good opinions as I outdid myself there. Long story short: I really try to get to my max capacity. Which brings me to my next point. WHY IN THE FUCK CAN'T I JUST GET ONE MOMENT WHERE I AM HAPPY.  Where once, people wouldn't know that I have autism or ADHD. Where once, it isn't something you'd notice. 

I realize that I really need help, and am planning to go to a  doctor to get it. (Thank got I'm not american). I don't even know why I am typing this. It just feels good finally screaming to the whole world that it would be best to just sart over. 

I just want to believe for once, that the shit I go through, that it is worth it. That you know, at one time. I can judt enjoy it all. 

If you read all through it. I know this is probably the messiest post ever. But thanks anyway for just hearing me out. Even if I can't know, it does feel actually good that just someone heared me out."
1091,Only coming to realise now that I am actually very broken (?) and not really sure how to deal with it without access to therapy or something similar.,"I got into my first real relationship this year and for whatever reason it has caused me to really access my mental health and how i go through and i have discovered that i might actually have a lot of issues.

The thing is, I function very well, don't really have too many problems that would be obvious to any external person and I don't really like to talk to people about my stuff so to everyone (sometimes including myself) I seem fine.

I think most of my problems evolve around me having no real connection to a sense of self or a connection to my own body which might sound weird (this isn't like dissociating though), I don't really have a clue how to deal with it. I don't really have access to a therapist, I am a student so i have no money and i might be able to get one free through the uni clinic but to do that i need a doctor to refer and like, wtf am i gonna say to them, ""hey, i am functioning fine and in reality could live life like this perfectly fine and have basically no traumas, give me free therapy."" 

I am also kinda worried that maybe this is just how I am because to not realise all these issues and emotions inside me i much be suppressing them without knowing it and that is usually something someone with severe trauma can do but i don't have that. In reality I can't watch a slightly sad movie without balling my eyes out but would somehow have suppressed years of things without realising it? that doesn't really make sense to me but who knows.

Anyways does anyone have any sort of online resources about anything to do with improving self image or processing things inside your head because i really don't know where to start? (i am uk based btw)"
1092,In need of community,"This is my first reddit post. I'm a 30 year old gay male, and I have absolutely no purpose in my life. I suffer from some pretty awful anxiety and depression which has become more acute over over the last few years. I sabotage my relationships because I convince myself that I am worthless and no one wants to be around me or my attitude. My partner (33, M) has been so supportive throughout this time of my life, but has a mission in life and such a defined sense of purpose that I wind up comparing myself constantly, despite knowing how harmful comparison is. I am losing hope in everything, and yet, the reason I think I have never been suicidal or in bed for days on end is because there is some part of me thats holding onto some kind of hope. I cannot seem to get where I want to go, and I am my absolute worst enemy, I truly believe that I have nothing to offer and that there is something fundamentally wrong with me beyond depression. I've seen multiple shrinks, my current one for 3 years, and talk therapy has just not done much. This pandemic and the toll it has taken is really painful.

1095,No enjoyment in life at all,"Hi,

I’m a 17 year old guy living in Ireland. I can’t find any enjoyment in my life at all. Every single thing is very depressing.

The worst problem is loneliness. I have absolutely no friends. At school, I’ve been bullied, excluded and ignored many times. Every single day, I absolutely dread going to school. I just can’t make friends and nobody likes me. I live in a small town so there aren’t any other schools. I hate living in a small town in Ireland, I feel so trapped. I wish I could live in a big city in America like New York or Los Angeles where I could easily make friends. I can’t make friends outside of school, because there’s no clubs or anything because of covid and there’s very little going on in a town anyway.

Another problem is schoolwork. I’m so overwhelmed with the amount of homework and exams. I have no free time. I can’t focus during study so it takes me a long time. When I get home from school, I study until midnight and on weekends I study for the full day. I never leave the house. I feel like I’m wasting my teenage years on schoolwork. I’m getting very little sleep.

Another problem is anxiety. I have hypochondria or health anxiety and that’s honestly becoming a problem in my life.

Also, this last part would probably be better for another subreddit. But I’m a Christian, and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about Christianity related things. That is really disheartening.

Because of all these problems, there is no enjoyment in my life at all. I know this subreddit probably receives a load of posts like these a day, but I’m hoping I’ll get a few responses. Thanks."
1096,in a bit of a mess,"TW: rape/sexual assault  

&amp;#x200B;

so I started smoking since I was 13, which I managed to quit at 16. Around April this month I was raped by a housemate while I was drunk, so I started smoking again. I didn't report him nor move out of the place, which was stupid of me, I know. I was in so much stress and couldn't tell if it was my fault or not since I was drunk when it happened. I was living abroad at the time and I just got home recently but still couldn't quit smoking.

My mom found out about it and confronted me. She said it was okay because technically I'm an adult now (19) and can do whatever I want. I know she didn't mean it at all, this is something she would never expect me to do as I always try to keep up the 'good kid' facade with her. I've always been obedient, had good grades and I seem smart enough to distinguish between right and wrong.

I told her she needed to trust me, that I'll quit soon and there is nothing she needs to worry about. Everything was all well and good until just now she hinted that I might move back in with her forever. I'm still in shock. I've lived abroad for the last 4 years of my life, my life pathway has been made there. I'm doing pre-med and I've worked so hard to get to this point.

I might need a proper conversation with her tomorrow about this, since she's asleep now. I'm just in a bit of a dilemma just because considering my mental health at the moment, and the bad decisions I've made up that brought me to this point, maybe it is best that I just move back in?

I know if I try hard enough I can be better, but so far I've turned into a borderline alcoholic (I'm mostly sober now but still). Mentally I'm in a horrible state and the only thing that I managed to keep up is my education.

I'm just so confused and sad atm. I can't tell her the actual reason why i started smoking again, but anything else that I made up would just lead to her thinking it's because I moved abroad by myself (friend I've made, stress from uni and being away from home, etc.)."

They believe that those places can connect people who are ABLE to fulfill my needs not wants

I end up with people who tell me I'm their parents age or they give hints that they are naive and younger

People dont know what older people experience with employment, financial needs, housing and healthcare

I sent her a very large and lengthy angry message and sent it without proof reading; it was so early I didn't have coffee yet.

I just noticed it was marked as read and went to read it back over, I apparently mentioned the time she saw my self harm scars when me her and my aunt were going shopping, and she dismissed it **publicly** by saying ""*Oh she just does that for attention*"" and I followed mentioning this with ""..Yeah I was doing it for attention; so much so that I never told anyone about it ever again. I bottled it up and opted to wear winter clothes all year round. Didn't tell anyone about feeling suicidal either; or my plan to actually go through with it last year, because that'd be me seeking attention; right?""

Uh.... What the fuck do I do? Losing my shit over here. No one has messaged me back yet; just read it, I'm out of town, and I'm scared shitless of what they're gonna say. My dad hasn't even checked any of my DMs since 9 and they're both radio silent. What do I do???? I apologized but it hasn't been marked as read yet.

it didn't bother me because it was just a ""fantasy"" and in real life i'm actually completely pain intolerant (seriously, i completely hate being or seeing others in pain), so i would never want to be hurt or to hurt anyone. but recently, after the thoughts started getting worse, i started feeling like that made me a completely despicable, horrible, deprived person and that this one thing completely ""annulled my personality"" if it makes sense. so even though when i think about that type of stuff now i get anxious and/or super uncomfortable sometimes i get groinal responses and since i used to have it i'm not sure if it's just that or actual arousal. the fact is that this is making me feel completely miserable and my brain is trying to actually make me feel worse by telling me i got turned on by things i really shouldn't have and know i didn't (like for example, if you ever saw the movie megan is missing, my brain tells me that i *liked* the scenes where the girl gets tortured and raped, even though it actually made me feel super anxious and disgusted, and even though i *did* feel something down there i know it was the groinal response because it started after i got worried that i liked it)

so basically i'm afraid that i still have that ""fantasy"" even if i don't wanna act on it, ever (because fantasies usually appear during childhood/puberty and its when mine appeared) and that it doesn't matter how fucked up its format is, i'll always get turned on by those things. its also telling me that i have a paraphilic disorder because of the ""weird things + possible shame and guilt"" (even though that's unlikely because as i said i really don't wanna act on it and i can get turned on by ""normal things"")
also, at this point i don't even know if i actually ever had it or if all this time it was just me acting on my thoughts not knowing what they were and all the arousal feelings were just groinal responses (even though that's also unlikely bc until recently this didn't give me anxiety at all) 


so tell me: is this ocd? teenage hormones? straight up a paraphilic disorder?"
1108,My feeling of loneliness,"If anyone reads this I really appreciate it
But I’m 19 year old male and studying at Uni and I’m living with 3 of my mates off campus, but right now everything feels very weird, I don’t know if it’s just my head overthinking shit or there’s actually something going on, I feel very alone and I think I might of done something, a few of my housemates have been seeming off with me recently and I don’t know if sometbing has actually happened or my mind if finally getting the better of me, I have been feeling lonely for a good few years but sometimes it does make me feel really shitty, and this is past 2 weeks is probably the worst I’ve felt for a long time, it was really bad then went back to normal for abit but then suddenly it’s really weird again, I feel so alone in the house with my friends. 
I wanna speak to them about it, I want to speak to people about it but I’m scared, it’s the old cliche but it’s just the truth, I’m scared to open up and I don’t know why, I just don’t want to feel lonely but I just don’t know how, I don’t know how to open up and I don’t have anyone to speak to because of me being scared, there’s probably some stuff I’m missing but I just needed to put my feelings somewhere for the first time, but yeh I don’t know, if you actually read this really appreciate it :)"
1109,what is attention seeking a symptom of?,"sorry for format but just a genuine question. 

why do some people seek more attention than others?i know some people react poorly when they’re not given the attention they crave; some people get emotional, physical or verbally abusive.

young children also lash out when not given enough attention but, what’s the reason for it? why do we have this need for attention? does everyone need it or is it more of a want instead of a need thing?

hope this makes question makes sense."
1110,Are there some people who don’t feel any anxiety at all?,Is this possible?
1111,Voices and Images,"I've been struggling with anxiety for awhile. Then I started getting visual mental images and hearing voices/sounds while falling asleep. Sometimes this wakes me up. I've heard about hypnagogic hallucinations, but it's bothersome some night. Does anyone else have similar experiences?"
1112,I can’t be happy (M14) (I’m also gay),"Does anyone know how to be happy? I hate myself for everything, there’s not a single thing I like about myself. I’m not masculine enough, not skinny enough, too short, etc. 

I have a boyfriend, I love him. I really do. But when I look at him I feel jealousy so strong that it makes me hate him, but he’s everything I want in a relationship and everything I want to be. He’s smart, has abs, everyone likes him, his family’s pretty wealthy, etc. he has everything. 

School stresses me out, just waking up feels exhausting. I don’t wanna say I’m numb, that sounds terrifying, but I feel like nothings real. Reality isn’t real anymore, there’s nothing and nothing matters. 

I guess this post is pointless, I’m sorry."
1113,I feel unsafe at home,"I live in the United States and I am worried that going to the ER will cost my family money. But, I feel unsafe and I worry about my mental health. I've been crying more than normal and I have been having sudden and sporadic thoughts of suicide and self harm. Should I goto the ER? Or should I do something else. I'm really unsure on what to do."
1114,What is this feeling?,"- I'm buzzing (like im not moving but I feel like im vibrating)
- I'm so tired but I also have so much energy
- I don't want it to be quite but I can't handle the sound of a video or music 

Is this some form anxiety? How do I make it stop? My usual methods of distraction don't seem to be working.

Thank you in advance!"
1115,Did I do something wrong?,"Today at lunch, my mom and I were eating alone and I wanted to tell her that my Dad is worried for my brother’s future (because he games ‘till the morning instead of preparing for his future). And my mom began to say, “Your brother is like all the other Americans-” and knowing that she wasn’t going to say anything nice, I interrupted her and said, “he might hear you, you know.” She just said, “It’s not like I was going to say anything bad.” And I admit that I interrupted her, but my brother doesn’t seem to be in the right metal state right now. He already has a low self-esteem and I worry that it’ll only get worse when he hears his parents talking trash about their own son. She went into a silent mode after than and I was trying to make it less awkward by talking about Black Friday and what she wanted for Christmas (even though I can’t afford anything). All she said was “Why does it matter, it’s not like I’m going to get anything”. Which I can also admit is pretty true, but it’s only because I can’t afford things, but If i did have money, I would get her anything she asked for, the world if she wanted. I question why she says things like this, maybe because my Dad promises so many expensive gifts but never actually gets them. But I feel like it’s my fault she feels this way. And I wish I could just go back in time and not interrupt her. I try to see things from her perspective on why she would be so cold to me, but I don’t know. Please help me understand what’s wrong, is it me?"
1116,Medical help,There are people out there who can’t afford the help they need. How should they go about getting that? It’s a weird thought...people need to pay a hefty amount on the medication they need just to live or stay sane. Everything I’ve tried to help my problems at least a little bit just hasn’t worked at all. There isn’t really anything else I can do

1118,Am I zoophile?,"I am 15 year old female. A couple days ago I started to fear if I am a zoophile. I am really scared that I am a one. It all started when I was masturbating, and my Cat came to me. I didn't mind his presence, and I got orgasm. And Then a thought came to my mind: ""Hey, I masturbated near my Cat and I didn't mind him. What If I am a zoophile?"" And That's how my nightmare started. I think about it 24/7. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't talk to people. I can't enjoy things that I enjoyed. I think that I am a monster. I can't even look at my Cat, because what if i Harm him? What if I want to have sex with him? 

When I was 10, I touched my Cat's genitals, because I was curious and I remember that after that I felt extremally guilty. But Still I think I am a zoophile. 

Especially because I kind of get aroused when I think about having oral sex with my Cat. 

I also think that this could be OCD. I am not diagnosed with it, but I think that I had TOCD and Harm OCD in the past. 

I am also very horny and sexually frustrated teenage girl ,because I am lesbian and I can't find a girl, who is also attracted to girls or would want to be with me. Maybe I am so desperate to be close with someone, that I started to have thoughts about sex with animal?? I honestly don't know anymore and honestly I feel terible about myself. 

PS English isn't my first Language. Sorry If that post is a mess."
1119,Eyelid bruise common? What do you say to someone who asks what happened? Embarrassing day...,"Have no makeup on me sadly... had a severe allergy to past makeup so... yeah hello to embarrassing bruise on eye... It's been an embarrassing day

Lol 😂 I guess just could use comfort

Can my posts get anymore stupid? Lol good question"
1120,So tired of fighting,"I'm so tired of trying to convince my child that they are beautiful and worthy of life. They're always talking about ending their life. They constantly say they're worthless and don't deserve to live. Constantly researching ways to do it. I've been fighting this battle for years and I don't know how much longer I can do it. They're in therapy and taking medication, but it's no longer working and they don't want to tell their doctor cuz they're afraid of being committed. I try so hard to let them know how much they're loved, appreciated, and wanted. My family let them know we're always here for them. But every time they pull this shit, a part of me dies. It affects us having to go through this constantly. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want my child to die but I can't continue to live on pins and needles wondering if this will be the day something sets them off to finally permanently do it."
1121,Looking to talk to someone who has had health anxiety and has gotten through it,"Very long story short, I am lucky in that I have always been physically and mentally very healthy. During the summer, I experienced my first panic attack, and almost went to the hospital because I thought I was having a heart attack. In the past two months, everything has gotten 10x worse. I am working with a therapist, but I have full-blown health anxiety now, and it's been absolutely ruining my life. I am looking to talk to someone who has had the disorder and has moved past it. Anyone?"
1122,What's better for mental health cardio or weight lifting?,In your experience anyway? Particularly anxiety
1123,Identity and Mental Health,Have a conversation with your doctor about what it means to be an elephant.
1124,Im having a meeting with my mom about my mental health at school and I’m pretty scared about it,"Hello, my name is Jacob (14) and today i came out to the principal here about my suicidal thoughts and mental state and she said I might have to have a meeting with my mom here. I’m scared of my mom and I always try my best to be happy when I’m near her. I don’t want her to think she’s a bad mom at all. Im not ready to take a big leap because I don’t want fighting happening in the family and I don’t want my moms drinking problem to get any worser. 
I really hope the principal forgets this happened because i don’t want to sit down and tell my mom how I actually feel. I’ve tried telling her how I’ve felt before and she made things worse and  she thinks that all of this is because of puberty. but there’s a tiny part of me that thinks this is good for me. if I do this it might help me come out to my family again about me being trans again and them Finally accepting me as their son unlike last time. My thoughts of what’s going to happen are getting in the way and I can’t really think at all."
1125,I can’t do this anymore!!,"To the person that’s reading this, heya! I’m 19 y.o, Male, and in my first year of college.

Listen, I can’t do this anymore. I’m watching as people step over people, the #killallmen movement, there are people I used to be close to that have straight disappeared from my life...I’m sick of this world and the way it’s become... and plus, I’m also sick of always feeling either anxious, sad, alone, or all three! There’s times where I do feel happy, but I just can’t seem to make it last!

I’m deep “in the trenches” of college and quarantine and it’s all taking a toll. I can’t push through math, and I feel dumb. Barely holding on at a 68% accuracy score, and it’s stressing me out. Everything else is actually going reasonably well tho, in terms of grades.

But seriously, I’ve been trying to be strong because even with a few good things, I have a deep seated sense of self-loathing... and today I just cracked after I swore I’d never crack again.

Look, I’ve tried to just focus on me... but this anxiety is everywhere I go. I can’t NOT worry because there’s always something TO worry about, and I’m sick of it!

Plus, I’m dealing with bitter memories of romantic failures, and there’s one in particular that won’t go away, which is because one of my exes is my “best friend”... but it certainly doesn’t feel like a friend. And she acts like it never happened, like I wasn’t good enough for her then. Anxiety’s a bitch ain’t it?

Ok, vent over. I’m out of things to say. I’m gonna go into my room and try not to break down from multiple sources of anxiety further."
1126,I feel like I'm going crazy,"Some context: I'm a 17 y/o male. I always had anxiety issues but I was feeling pretty good lately, I'm doing therapy and taking Sertraline, that helped me.

A month ago I started feeling random sprouts of intense anxiety and an extreme sadness.
Sometimes I feel alienated (from myself and from society), my identity feels really liquid and I'm like a ghost for society.
I don't really belong anywhere.
School is going really well, but it's boring, really boring.

The only thing that seems to keep me sane is music, I love playing music. I play the same song over and over again sometimes.

I never liked parties, but I tried to make an effort to like them. I went to two parties. In one of the parties I smoked weed (I regret it, I felt awkward), and in the other party I didn't. I felt out of place in both cases.

I used to be really introverted, but nowadays I'm not.
Nonetheless, socializing fills me with deep feelings of shame and sadness.
Ever since I was a kid I never felt adapted with those that were supposed to be part of my social circle.

Sorry if I made some gramatical mistake or something like that, english is not my first language so I suck at it."
1127,You are not alone,"Hi Everyone!

I recently came to a breaking point of silently dealing with my mental health, and trauma for years. I wanted to share my story so that others know they are not alone. Please check out my website to hear the audio along with the current project I am working on. 

[Origin Story](https://projectaltruist.org)"
1128,"Guys, after numerous shitposts on internet I'm starting feeling better.","I was a shy and introvert person who don't talk with other people. I don't liked social media. But after I went into distant education I have a problem with staying in home. I have a lack of conservation. That's why I become crazier and strange at home. My family says that I'm acting horrible.

I ttied to control my impulses, but it was such a pain for me. So, I started to act like a crazy. Like insane. I created many shitpost which are disliked. People are complain how I'm acting horrible. Bug I feel so good after that! I feel more freedomly. I feel more happier! And I know how why some people are toxic. In internet, yoh can be yourself just to take off your impulses."
1129,"Spacing out, losing time","I've been in isolation for 8 months now.

I do go outside sometimes. I was gardening during the spring and summer, and I've been camping a few times in the last few months.

I went through a bad bout of depression the first few months, but I adapted and I've been much better.

BUT...

Lately, I feel like I am losing time. The day seems to end really quickly, and I don't recall much about what I spent my time doing.

I don't feel like I am blacking out or losing memory, but I do think I am spacing out quite a bit, and my head is in a fog most of the day.

My job hasn't kept me busy, but I have to stay in front of the computer so my status shows as online, so I will get paid.

Is this something I should be concerned about?"
1130,IMPORTANT QUESTION??,"If i Delete ALL types of Social Media from my phone including including Reddit... If Stop watching the news , toxic movies and toxic music... instead I focus on Meditation , Go to therapy  , Studying ,  Excerising and watching inspirational things on YouTube and doing other things to help mental health .... Do you think in 
1 Year I could completely clear my mind of Negativity and overcome most of my Depression &amp; Anxiety"
1131,Lockdown ruined everything,"This year I finally turned myself around. I was getting 75% for all my tests, I finally was getting thinner by going to the gym, my mental health was at an all time high, I actually started talking to a girl I was very interested in, and now it’s gone

After 5 months, the girl I was talking to post interest because we just couldn’t advance further without meeting up. I gained weight back due to not going to gym. I’ve been back at school for a while now and my average mark is now a 35%-50%. My mental health has gotten so low at this point because of the above plus other insecurities coming back from before. This month I’ve woken up 8 times due to nightmares and my sleep is getting worse. My final exams have started and I feel like I failed my first exam. My life is a mess and I thought of ending it twice within 5 weeks"
1132,Is it just me?,I only get up bc i’m alive. It’s like i have to do these day to day menial things because i’m still alive and didn’t die in my sleep. I lost the sense of living. I can’t find any motivation to do what i need to do in life. I don’t want to vent on my closest friends bc I already know what they’ll say and it’s actually tiring to hear the same advice(some are response out of sympathy) over and over again.
1133,I have... stopped feeling emotions?,"hi lol, i'm on mobile, so apologies for the formatting. 

i guess there's not really much to say—but recently, i feel like i've become desensitised to everything. few months back, i didn't really feel the explicit emotion of happiness, but i did feel like… sadness, and anger, and stuff. recently though, i don't know— i just, really don't feel anything at all. i guess i just feel very empty? there's a lot of things that used to upset me, but they don't anymore. i've lost interest in most of the things i did and i've begun to feel this disconnect from the world—i don't feel like talking to my friends, and sometimes i think that i don't care about anyone in this world. is this normal? if no, what could this mean? i'm young, so maybe it's a phase? i'm not sure, but i guess i was just confused because i couldn't stop thinking about these changes in me."
1134,When is it justified to feel things?,[deleted]
1135,"The Big ""S""","I come from a cult background in CALIFORNIA; where I was ritually abused and then gaslit to think that I was vile and I deserved it.

I was a friendless child; name-called for my physical appearance. I suffer for my physical appearance to this day; mostly at work due to customers, who interrogate me about it.  This causes me the most intense social anxiety that my mind turns to the big ""S"" to escape its touch.

At 26 I suddenly snapped and realized everything the cult told me was a lie. I found a job, where I almost immedaitly made enemies for being liked by mgmt, customers and being good at my job. My mental health dwindled and my star fell; and my enemies found gratification in my ""failure"". Now, I am a black sheep. I'm a pariah almost; for being ""quiet"" and ""weird""; which makes me a mean person somehow. I am often mocked and bad-mouthed (despite doing nothing but minding my own business). Furhtermore, i've continously met horrible, narcissitic types who have made it their part time gig to drag what remains of my name through the gutter; so i'm often viewed as incompetant on top of being a jerk.

Customer interactions feel like humid suffocation which set me off and reinforce the stereotype that I am a jerk. 

Yet again I am in a situation I am helpless to escape where I am made to seem vile and am mistreated for it.

This is extremely triggering for me, and my mind turns to the big ""S"". 

I've been stuck in this acidic work environment for 5 years now. I can't land another job. I rub interviewers the wrong way somehow. I'm in Hell, and my mind is turning toward the big ""S"". I have enough in savings to quit and wing it for 5 months; maybe I should..."
1136,YouTube is recommending videos to me that are detrimental to my mental health.,"17M here. I spend much of my time on the Internet nowadays, and one of my favorite destinations is YouTube. I mostly use it for music, memes, educational/comedy videos, and some let's plays.

However, I used to watch commentary channels.

I remember starting to watch them around 2016. Something about the community's constant drama was entertaining to me, to the point where I would make parallels between it and my daily life. Looking back, I believe I had an unhealthy obsession.

I stopped watching commentary channels in the summer of 2019. A series of high-profile incidents stressed me to a breaking point (I remember having a massive panic attack when I learned of Etika's suicide), and I unsubscribed from almost every drama channel I had subbed to, leaving the ones that  were mostly focused on other types of content. But eventually, I unsubbed from them, too.

In hindsight, I don't think it's a coincidence that the worst years of my life coincided with the times I watched YouTube commentary channels.

So, after going a long time without watching a drama video, you'd expect YouTube to get the hint and stop recommending them, right?

Nope. Over a year later, I am STILL getting these goddamn drama videos recommended to me.

I've said I'm not interested in those videos. I've avoided clicking on them. I've even manually gone through my watch history and deleted every video I found that could be even remotely tied to drama. But they keep showing up. I've started using the ""don't recommend channel"" option on some of these videos, but if one channel stops getting recommended, another one immediately takes its place. The genre's like a damn hydra.

Admittedly, I've reduced their prevalence to a point where they're very infrequent. But I'll scroll through my homepage and still come across some shitty Keemstar knockoff almost once or twice a day. And that's way too fucking frequent for me.

...anyway, I think I'm done venting. If any of you guys feel the same (or know of any other solutions), feel free to comment."
1137,Negativity of social media,"I deactivated my facebook account and uninstalled instagram today. I am sick of seeing people creating divide. I fucking hate it. People try to create divide based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation and what not. People fucking went nuts in comments when CERN changed their profile picture to a rainbow flag to celebrate LGBTQ people in science. What's wrong with people? I was seeing these too much recently. People just can't accept something that's out of their idea of ""good"" and ""acceptable"". Fine, don't accept but please, mind your own fucking business. 
People of different religions just can't stop bashing each other. They make every fucking thing about religion. Every. Fucking. Thing. 
Some woman posted a picture on instagram in some revealing clothes. There were disgusting comments. Even rape threats. Where have we stooped down to? Why can't people mind their own business? 

All these negativity depresses me. I just can't focus on the work I really need to do. I have things to study and learn. I can never achieve my goals if I just sit and ponder over these depressing thoughts. 
The saddest part is I can't do anything about it. Why is it so hard for people to understand that demeaning others will get us nowhere? Life is not about competition but about cooperation? Why is that so hard to understand? 

[r/UpliftingNews](https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/) has been a great place to visit. Infact, reddit is the only place I really enjoy. 

I hope people learn to co-operate not compete. After all you are just a person who is going to die one day. So why not make the world a better place for others to live in?"

1140,How do you become happy “in the present”?,"This is not necessarily COVID related, but obviously makes it ten times harder.

How does one become happy in the present? I think back to past moments where I was happy (although I wonder if I felt happy in that moment) and I think to the future to possible happy moments or events but I can never feel myself being happy in the moment.

1142,Why is being suicidal considered to be a mental health issue?,"Okay first of all, I'm not suicidal. I can't even dream of doing that to my family. But I can't understand the stigma associated with suicide. Is it always related to some mental illness? Can't it be treated as just opting out of a deal you never agreed to? Is it not possible that some people were dealt a bad hand and were born into bad conditions which they can't fit into, can't find anything that excites them or keeps them going? Why is having suicidal thoughts considered to be ""wrong""? Is it just because suicides are bad for our society as a whole? I'm very puzzled by our general reaction to suicidal thoughts.

Edit: Is this pinned? wtf lmao"
1143,What's going on with me lately (long),"I'll start from the beginning so around a year back from now.
So since December of last year I haven't had any social interactions besides my family. And in general I never really was a social kinda person, I really like my small place with only me, food, books and internet in it.
I finished highschool the year before, learned for a test equivalent to SAT I think for a few months until December and got a good enough score for me.
Afterwards was at home because of covid and such, then came August and I had to join the army (it's mandatory here) so I joined at the end of August.
It's separated to 3 parts, first part is just something general most soldiers do in our position, it was 6 weeks, then a course in the specific field we'll work in, this was 18 days, and then the real service where you really work and last for 2 years and some months.

The first part was too much for me, all the suicidal thoughts I had buried inside after therapy came back up after more than a year, and they were almost as powerful at their strongest (that's a story for another day) the people in charge of me, didn't really know how to help me so they always just asked futile questions and walked in circles around the problem, I saw a psychiatrist of the army and i had weekly check up with her in the first and second part.
Almost at the end of the first part I was about to do it, to end it all, I had a bullet in the rifle, but then I stopped myself, nobody knows about it. Last day of the first part was just a bad day, all the other people in my group got compliments from the superiors and Didn't get anything, it made me for the first time since I was a child to be jealous, I hated it. (Important to mention didn't make even 1 friend all these 6 weeks, barley spoke tbh)

Then came the second part - the course - it was actually alright at the beginning but because of mental and physical issues it ended on a bad note for me with the supervisors, not much to say, but I did find some people I think I have the potential to be friends with.

Then third part - the real service- because of covid me and my friends got separated so starting from 0 again, started 2 weeks ago and, at first it was really scary, a completely different new place and now we start the real thing, not like the course, I tried getting a conversation with my new supervisor and it took a full week and I was completely lost that week.
After I talked to here, told her a bit of this story to ask to continue the psychiatrist meetings, with a new one sadly, and there'll be only one free in the end of December (hope I'll survive this month without breaking emotionally).
I had another talk with another superior that said its unallowed to talk to different superiors except the 2 I talked about here, and they are not even here every day so I just have to keep whatever I have to ask in mind.
I feel better now but I trust 0 people outside my family now.

Some important things to note, between part 1 and 2 and between 2 and 3 I became more and more social, tbh it's kinda amazing, I still don't say anything I want to say but I'm getting there.
Second thing to note, in the third part my aunt husband died young(40+) and left her behind with 4 kids 2 of them are autistic and she herself (the aunt) is pregnant and in a great danger right now cause of this. I wasn't attached to him much but still feel it though to be honest I'm more worried about the kids and aunt.
My parents are there to help them, it's almost in another state so really far away so since the beginning of November whenever I get back home I'm alone and lonely (though when I was this alone I was actually happy, don't know to explain why I just was) but I want to talk about all this with someone and I have no one to talk to, cause from my experience with the superiors in the army they'll make you trust them and then Break your trust (I think I have trust issues now tbh) so I'm tired of talking to them, I need someone who'll listen and care.
And now I'm here, that's all for now"
1144,Leaving Therapy,"I (F14) am changing therapists. I have been going to CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) since the beginning of summer until now, but my mom told me that this kind of therapy isn't really working for me. I really like my therapist, but I also realize that my progress so far has been quite slow. My mom and therapist talked for a little while, and then I talked to her to say goodbyes. I feel absolutely terrible about leaving this therapist since she is my first therapist since I opened up about my mental health. Is there another way I can think about this situation to make myself feel better?"
1145,I get songs stuck in my head to a whole nother level,"I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS SOMETHING MENTALLY ILLNESS WISE I AM COMING HERE FOR HELP AND OR ANSWERS!!! I get songs stuck in my head, BUT SO MUCH WORSE! I will have one song from Dear Evan Hansen stuck in my head (which is normal it happens to everyone) but then it mixes with another song from Dear Evan Hansen. Other times it will be the same song but somehow it will mix within the song. Like if there is a beat drop or something it will mix with the words. I can't concentrate with it. It just keeps on and on and on. Is this something? Am I insane? Am I overreacting? I'm so confused. So if you know, please please help. &lt;3"
1146,I don't know about my mental health!!!,"I am here beacuse i am scared to talk to people about that.

1147,My boss thinks i cant take a day of for my mental health because “i’m not really sick”,"So my diagnosed depression (just saying because self diagnosis is way to common at the moment) has in the past for about 2 years now and i have lately been having ups and downs. People around me say i should call in sick if i have a bad day because i don’t function at work when i do go. But my boss and coworkers all think i’m a little bitch for calling in sick for “being a bit tired” as they call it. But when i do go i just try not to cry and run away from everything i know. 

Today has been one of those days that i did go, I haven’t really eaten today and can’t get myself to and just end up staring to my fridge for a couple minutes. I want to call in sick tomorrow morning but i don’t want them to call me a bitch on monday. I’ll see what fits best tomorrow morning and sorry for bothering you guys with my bullshit problems."
1148,TW: Self Harm,"Does anyone else self harm as a form of punishing yourself?

Now I have stupid cuts on my leg and it’s all because I needed to punish myself for being a waste of space.

1149,OFF MY MED,"so everything was fine I had med/ therapy then the pandemic happen I still had my med

I waited a little bit before contacting my therapist since you never know what happen in there life and 

how there are doing through this pandemic so after 2 months  I ask my therapist to do a zoom call 

\[she is a really therapist and pay a good amount of money\]  she said she will go to the meeting

and never came I called her to see why she didn't come to the meeting and she said she had some 

personal problems so we decided to go to another zoom call and she never came

\[I have to go to therapy before I get my med so I had not had my med in 2 months\]

she said I do not need my med and should not go to therapy and I believe her

2 week later I stat going crazy like seeing people and I  almost kill a lot of people

1150,I DONT KNOW WHAT TO Do,"Probably gonna delete this later Long story short, . I dont know what to do, i dont have a diagnosis because i dont want to open up to anybody. Had social contacts and friends, but still cringe about everything that happened and regret every single minute of meeting new people. Ghosted about 20 people because I cant take it anymore. I get extremely tensioned once I see those people and I am, in general vert tensioned. Not an anxiety attack I guess, I dont have any trouble breathing, I just start shivering, folding ny hands over my head and then I start to cramp idk why, sometimes because I remember of such things. This is the time when my self harm urges are the highest. Happens randomly and I feel like I cant trust anybody because they will out me into a ward or tell someone else. 
I feel suicidal, I think, from time to time but not drained or anything. I mostly still do the things i like but the mornings and evenings are the worst.
Right now its more like a tension and the cringe I feel from past social events. 
I dont even know if I feel like that

1151,I think I have fear of abandonment,"Im going to basically keep this very simple and short. I’m not self diagnosing the title is just how I can summarise it!! 

I’m CONSTANTLY fearful of the future. Especially regarding my relationship. Its healthy and amazing and my boyfriend reassures me all the time hes an angel. BUT well, if you have tiktok you’ll know what I mean. My whole fyp is curated around relationships ending/ cheating, everything BAD - girls sharing their experiences and crying. I did notice a massive improvement in my mental health and feeling more secure after I had deleted the app for 2 weeks. But aside from that I CANT LIVE IN THE MOMENT. 

Does anyone have an self help tips as to how I can just live in the present without having to worry about how my relationship will pan out? I always fear I’ll loose him for literally NO REASON. Ofc I keep this to myself and try to not let it damage our relationship. I have a hard time 100% trusting people - and not for any reason in particular aside from hearing of others horror stories regarding their failed relationship.

I see othee peoples bad experiences and immediately think its going to happen to me in the future. I know heartbreak and stuff is inevitable but I just want HELP

Note- Im 18 and we’ve been dating long distance since I was 15. Its my first relationship. Sometimes I feel incredibly stable and secure but most of the time I DO NOT. I think a tiny amount of it may be down to my body dysmorphia. - yes i was clinically diagnosed. Buts its more so the fact I’m always on edge."

Like my family doesn’t exists, my friends don’t exist. What if instead of walking with my dog I’m just walking alone and my dog isn’t there. 
I know it’s pretty stupid lol. But i had like a mild panic attack about it this morning and I was surprised.

1154,Been feeling inadequate for some time now,I am dealing with a lot of stress from university that mainly stems from the fact that I haven’t been able to befriend anyone in my degree. I always talk myself out of interacting with others and now I am feeling really isolated after the lockdown. The friends that I do have outside of my degree are all busy with their new jobs or studies which has made it difficult to get in touch. I enjoy the degree I am in but have begun to associate it with the feeling of isolation. I’ve been wanting to communicate these feelings to people I know irl for some time but I just can’t bring myself to let them know. I honestly believe that my friends and family will be there for me but I always get cold feet at the last second as I don’t want them to worry about me. I have never been good at expressing emotion and I tend to bottle everything up so I’m hoping that this post might be the slight pressure release I need to actually start worrying about myself and tell my family and friends what I’m going through.
1155,Should I reach out to somebody?,"Hi everybody,

I’m a 20 year old in university, and for the past few weeks I just can’t get myself to do any schoolwork. I will take 3-4 hours just watching a 20 minute recording even when it’s on 1.5x speed because 1) I relisten to it a bunch of times because I’m scared I missed anything the prof said (I know it probs won’t affect my mark if I didn’t hear clearly one word, but it’s like I can’t stop myself from feeling like things will go wrong if I don’t listen again) 2) I take longggg breaks when I pause between sentences because I just DREAD doing the work so I just end up going on YouTube or playing games. At the start of the semester I’ve been keeping up on the recordings, but then I just couldn’t bring myself to study anymore and I just want to sleep all the time. 

I wasn’t always like this though. I’ve maintained a good gpa for my first 2 years of uni and I’m an aspiring premed who just self-studied for the mcat during the summer (I essentially studied 10 hours a day without much problems and scored well on the final mcat). My marks as of now are still good, but I still feel unaccomplished and stressed for procrastinating. Sometimes to kind of “punish” myself for spending too long doing work, I consciously drag out my dinner time a few hours so I starve a bit or I only sleep 5 hours because I tell myself “you deserve this for procrastinating”. I don’t physically harm myself though, except maybe occasionally hitting myself in the leg when I get mad/stressed. 

I also get a lot more irritable with friends and family. Sometimes I just want nobody to talk to me and tell people I’m honestly tired of helping them with stuff. I want to cry all the time and it seems I have nobody to talk to. When I tell my best friend I’m stressed she’ll just say I should be grateful for everything I have because there’s a lot more people who are less fortunate than I am, and it makes me wonder if I even deserve to find help or talk about my problems because it seems like I shouldn’t complain. My parents would probably also just say I’m just too stressed and I should relax. I’m also a bit shy to find a counsellor or somebody to talk to because I get scared to call/video people I’m not familiar with. I’m not really sure what to do now, and I don’t know if what I’m describing is not really a big deal and that everybody experiences."
1156,"Just soon as I was getting better, tought ill have fun talking/playing with them..","They literally invited me to play 3 days in a row and because of my fucked up sleeping schedule i fell asleep before the meeting time 3 times in a row, now i feel like shit, and more depressed because i just couldn't even control my sleep, but to happen 3 times."

But now, one of my very dear friends have started to feel worse. She is also struggling with depression and anxiety, and during the last couple of weeks, it has been really bad for her (I think). 
I really want to be there for her, and I so want to help her, even though I probably can’t. 
What would you guys suggest me to do to be a good and supportive friend? 
I am currently just letting her know how much I appreciate her, how lucky I and everyone else around her is to have her (because she is a truly wonderful person), and I also really try to let her know that if she wants someone to talk or rant or complain to, I’m there. I also try to make her know that she isn’t alone. I know the struggles, and she isn’t alone in this.
Would you think that this is appropriate? Am I being a good friend? Am I doing too much or too little? 
I find it really difficult because I really want to *be there* but I also don’t want to smother her. 
What do you think?

1160,I can't do anything and I don't care anymore (long post),"I (17F) feel more and more demotivated to do any work, or basically to continue to exist.

I used to think of a future, going to college, having a career, but I don't see that anymore. I've started to think a lot about self harm and dying. I'm dealing with a lot of insecurities, I feel like I'm annoying anyone I interact with, I cry very easily and once it starts it goes on for hours, I feel like an outsider in my family, I can't sleep, don't eat, leave work to the last minute and beat myself up all the time, even for the slightest mistake, or for things that I'm not even responsible for. 

I used to be expressive, and would confide in people I trust, but now I just cover it up with humour or sarcasm and bottle up my feelings. I used to have hobbies, activities that made me happy, but I've lost interest in all of them. Nothing seems to be working out.

My family is pretty judgemental, and everyone has their own set of expectations for me, I feel like I can't freely be myself around them. My mom tells me to 'snap out of it' if I'm feeling sad and makes me feel uneasy if I do something like try out new makeup, my dad wants me to start thinking of a career and my standard of living once I'm on my own. My brother treats me like a stranger and doesn't want anything to do with me. My grandma wants me to always keep my body covered up, marry in my early twenties, stay quiet, never argue with anyone, and listen to my husband. 

I'm having issues with my friends too, but they don't realise it and sometimes I feel like I'm taken for granted.

I've started feeling like I'm just something created to please others. I hate myself and I hate the way I'm spiralling out of my own control and can't get a grip on myself. One of the few things keeping me going is this one person I talk to, but I've started feeling like I'm just a burden on them and I need to stop texting them so that they don't have to deal with me. They haven't done anything to make me feel this way, this is just me overthinking and telling myself that I don't deserve them. 

The other night I was in a really bad place and wrote a huge paragraph to myself about how I don't deserve to live, and to be honest I was horrified by it when I saw it later, it was so terrible, but unsurprisingly, I believe every word of it. I don't know how long I'll be able to go on like this.

This post is all over the place, sorry about that. If you've come this far, thank you for reading. 💞"
1161,Medication weight gain,"Hi people of reddit, I'm on sertraline (I take 100mg daily, 22F) I've been on it since february, I was wondering if it's common to gain weight from being on medication?

I'm not the healthiest person so I'm not putting it all on that, but I think I have gained some chub from being on it but I could be wrong.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Thanks in advance"
1162,"I’m just sharing this here too, hope that is okay. Desperate for help or advice regarding OCD",
1163,How corrupt is the psychiatric community?,"(This is kinda long, there's a summary at the bottom)

I've been talking to a counselor for some time now, and she strongly recommends that I set up an appointment with a psychiatrist to take a look at my alleged anxiety and depression. I contacted a psychiatrist, and it turns out I need to find out what insurance I have in order to set up an appointment. Embarrassingly enough, I am not managing my funds yet, and so I am unsure about what insurance I have.

The technical problems aside, I asked one of my legal guardians, who are in charge of finances, if I could schedule one appointment just to decide what my next step should be depending on the results. However, this person insists that psychiatry should be avoided as much as possible unless it is a genuine emergency. I probably given more context; I did talk about my odd mood swings, but I did not reveal that I had harmed myself again. That aside, I do understand this person's point of view: I can see that, similarly to how physical doctors will be eager to make money by prescribing medicines, mental doctors may be just as likely to want to make money in the same way. How helpful the advice they give also really depends on the situation and how well they understand my context.

However, I can't help but feel somewhat belittled. Maybe it's true that there's nothing wrong with me, and I just need to live a healthier lifestyle. It's just that I would feel more comfortable if I at least had the opinion of a professional to consider when I look at my mental health. It's not like I'll dive right into taking medications, I know that can definitely mess with people's heads if used wrongly.

Some context as to why I want an appointment in the first place: first of all, my counselor has recommended it to me for a while now, and I have a history of spontaneous self harm. The self harm has never been more severe than some cuts on my legs and unlocking my window on the second floor. Some days I feel alright, but other days, I feel pretty low, which I think is pretty normal. I also have a lifelong problem with focusing on anything and everything, be it studying, conversations, and so on. I don't know if my moods are going back and forth too fast or if I'm just a moody person. 

In the end, I will probably be fine if I just work on getting physically healthier without any appointment. But sometimes I wonder if I should get checked up on just to be sure.

Summary: I've asked my guardian if I can set up a psychiatric appointment, but they don't think it's necessary unless it's an emergency, and they think it's corrupt in a lot of ways."
1164,I thought I was a monster,"I think I need to get a diagnosis of some sort.
I’m an 17 year old from England and from a young age I’ve always been an obsessive type, routine set. Always had a designated seat on the sofa, always had a specific seat at the dinner table, had to be in bed at a specific time. But that was as I was 5-12 ish and I just thought it was usual behaviour, my parents had thoughts that I may be slightly on the spectrum due this desire to stay in routine and my melt downs if my routine wasn’t met- but in my head it wasn’t the fact that I didn’t get my way it was because I was, and still to an extend, convinced that something bad would happen if it didn’t happen. 
At the age of around 13 I began to experience the sort of thoughts I just described but a lot more vividly. I would be lay in bed about to go to sleep and a thought in my head would go “touch the wall on the opposite side of your room or mum will die tomorrow” or “tug the bottom of the curtain or something really bad will happen” these thoughts continued for quite a while but as I mentally matured I began to gain the ability to suppress these thoughts and distract my mind when a thought popped into my head, and when nothing bad happened as a result my fear of these thoughts slowly went away and I was able to ignore them even tho they still entered now and again. 
I have a few specific things and routines I still have to do, while grabbing a drink in the kitchen I always have to wash the glass out 3 times before I drink from it. When I drink anything it has to be in multiples of 6. When I brush my teeth I have to rinse my mouth out twice to then take 6 gulps of water from the tap. I never felt the need to ask questions about it because it didn’t really effect my life in anyway if that makes sense. 
BUT recently over the last year and a half maybe, things really got out of hand. EXTREME EXTREME intrusive thoughts. They began shortly after a really bad break up of mine. I will never express what these thoughts are but they were truly hellish. But I never linked the obsessive behaviours with these ever. I knew nothing about any mental health issues so I thought I was a monster with all these deep down desires I didn’t know I had. They made me feel physically sick.
But I couldn’t tell anyone about them because...well the images that had been forcibly played in my head were actions u hear about people on death row committing.
I’ve been struggling with it for a year. I looked into intrusive thoughts and saw it was a tour of OCD and seeing that the extreme thoughts I was having were also experienced by others was so so so so so so relieving. I broke down into tears.
Should I go and see someone about it? Will it help me?"
1165,i'm literally going insane please help me,"i've been suicidal since i was around 17-18 and tried killing myself at age 19 but i failed, i tried overdosing on some strong meds (i remember looking up if they were lethal and they were) and since then i've REALLY been trying to change my life for the better but it's all pointless, the last time i was ACTUALLY happy was when i was around 12 when skyrim came out as far as i remember lmfao what a shitshow man and i swore to myself i really really really swore to myself back then with 18 that i WILL die before 21 if nothing changes and i'm turning 21 in two weeks and guess what life really doesn't have anything for me to keep me going, i had a gf, tried all the drugs i could possibly get, went to partys, had good friends and a loving mum, i even became semi pro in a videogame (it was my passion) AND YET all i think of at the end of the day is that it is pointless and worthless to me i don't know maybe i'm a fucking psycho who's destined to live a miserable life but maaaaybe i really should just find peace in taking my own life, and you guys know what's the funniest fucking shit ever??? If i would kill myself tonight, in a couple weeks (or days even LOL) no one on this planet would ever again think about me or the fucking pain i'm feeling right now it is fucking torment my head is a ticking time bomb i just wnat it to stop why can't i be normal"
1166,Im dreaming too much.,I started dreaming too much since the beginning of this month. I can't have a quality sleep because of that. If I listen to music before bed those music keep playing inside my head. So in every morning I just feel like shit. Sometimes I cant sleep at all. Looking for some solutions to fix this situation.
1167,I have a loving girlfriend who has never showed any reason for me to doubt her yet I’m still super insecure about her leaving me,"I met my current gf around a year ago, we hit it off really well and started dating within 2 weeks. Something we realized quickly was how different we are as people. That wasn’t an issue but just an important thing to know, she’s always be a positive person who hasn’t had too many serious mental health struggles while I’ve always struggled with my mental health. 

She’s never given me any reason to doubt her and she’s been the best girlfriend I could have ever asked of her to be. So much so that I genuinely considered marrying her in the future. A big mental health issue for me right now that I haven’t communicated with her yet is that I feel very very insecure and scared that I’ll lose her for some odd reason. I can’t imagine living my life without her so the thought of her leaving almost makes me cry whenever I think about it. I don’t want to talk to her about it because there has been nothing she has done that has caused this and it’s only a fear because of my own brain being dumb. I don’t really know how to fix this but I really do want to fix this for myself, one less broken piece. I genuinely do want to get better so that one day I can be who I want to be for her."
1168,How to ask for help?,"I’m in a pretty tough and stressful time right now with balancing online schooling and all of the work that seems to be piling on day after day even though I try and get ahead as much as possible. I also am in the college application process and this waiting period until decision days are hell.

I’ve never been more anxious and hard on myself, a majority of nights I cry myself to sleep in trying to think positively but I am being drowned out by self inflicted negativity. I’m raging and hyperventilating over already submitted essays and word choice or something I feel could have been better multiple times a day after I check on my application. 

I know I’m not the only person going through this right now but it sure as hell hurts and I don’t really know how or when it’s appropriate to ask for help, but I feel like I’m running out of gas and I don’t know when to stop. Any input is appreciated, thank you for your time."
1169,hey..,"Today has been a very bad day as far as my mental health is concerned.  I'm 39 years old.  When I was a college student, I was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts.  I went through it and came out on the other side.  I've been taking anti-depressants since then.  A little over 3 months ago, I told myself that I wanted to stop anti-depressants so I weaned off of them and stopped taking them.  I never realized how robotic-like I was on them.  The anti-depressants did their job as far as emotions are concerned but it did its job too well as I got used to feeling nothing.  When I went off of the meds, I started feeling all sorts of ranges of emotion again.  I felt human again.  

Now, as the insanity of the world gets worse and worse, and nobody is doing anything about it, I'm finding that I'm starting to sink back into depression and suicidal thoughts. I haven't felt joy in months and, although I am grateful to have a job that I can do from home that will support me, there is nothing creative or fulfilling about it. 

My job is in media - news specifically - and so I'm constantly surrounded by the insanity that is going on in this country.  There are days that I feel like I am literally going out of my mind. Today has been one of them. 

I'm not sure what I wanted to accomplish with this -- maybe just to reach out to somebody. I've talked to my therapist -- I've texted the crisis lines.  The crisis lines are nice to talk to but they're pretty generic with their help.  ""yes, I understand"" - ""things are tough... that can be overwhelming"" those kinds of responses.  I'm not sure that I want someone to listen to but someone who knows what it feels like to feel like I do.  Somebody who REALLY understands and is not just trained to ""listen."" 

Somebody is going to suggest that I go back on my meds -- and maybe that's a good suggestion.  I was taking 10Mg and the lowest dose is 5.  I DON'T want to try other meds... the last time I did that, it was horrible.  I know that this med works... just works too well.  I'd love to stay off of meds if at all possible. 

Anyway -- thanks for reading, I guess."
1170,[Serious] Can my doctor just stop prescribing 9 medications taken consistently for 4 years?,"\[Posted and deleted from /r/psychiatry\]

It's been two days since I've taken any of the following (or slept), so please forgive any errs.

Lexapro, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Clonidine, Trazadone, Wellbutrin, Namenda, Nuvigil, Mydayis and Suboxone.

Short version: 2 months ago my long time psyche doc decided to focus entirely on coronavirus related (psychiatric) symptoms. He said, here's a month's supply of your 10 medications, go find a new doc. I recently changed jobs with downgraded insurance, and so began to make calls to the narrower field of folks in my new network. As you may have guessed, with the terrifying uptick of pandemic / election related mental illness, psychiatrists taking on new patients are few and far between, especially in my heavily infected state.

As my supplies dwindled, I grew desperate and rang my old PCP to see if she could help. She didn't even have time to see me, but got me in with her PA who saw me face to face, and bless his heart, prescribed the Lexapro cause he's a good fucking guy. I've been in touch with my old doc throughout, and his last text from this afternoon in response to my asking what to do reads - ""I don't know. I think people go to an urgent care center"". Not wanting to risk my life or that of my wife without merit, I replied ""I can be at one in 10 minutes. To confirm, they'll be able to contact you to confirm the history, and write these prescriptions?"". Then nada.

I'm totally up for advice as my entire body is tensing like one gargantuan monkey's fist. My withdrawal experience includes valium, synthetic cannabinoids (yea it was a thing), methamphetamine and heroin. But I was never expected to hold down a corp job while doing so, nor endure all at once. There's no end in sight, and forgive the dramatic bravado but I'm scared shitless. Like, it's leaking out of me (where my subs at?). Also, I do not have the funds to purchase , most or all of these from dark web vendors, or pay ER prices (repeatedly).

Thanks in advance for words of wisdom. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. And if you hear about an MA state resident ramming his Impala into the side of a CVS pharmacy before bounding over the wreckage to walk away with just one month's supply of each aforementioned medication, well, I might know the guy. Namaste"
1171,"I Want to Improve, But I Don't Know How","I am a young male who hasn't even graduated High School yet. I generally do not experience the usual worries of people my age, as I have good grades and I will most likely get into a good college should I choose to do so. The problem is, my parents are straight-up Fascists. They indoctrinated me into their hateful ideology when I was a young kid. Thankfully, I got out around 2-3 years ago, particularly with the help of a girl who I will refer to as C. Now, C is a really nice person, and she convinced me of the obvious fact that Fascism is bad and helped me find a new way of thinking. Only problem is, i've ended up distancing myself from everybody and everything and I have only wanted to speak to C. I only meet C twice a week, and she has been talking to me less and less. With her slowly drifting away, I feel as though I have nothing left, as speaking to her was literally the only thing that made me happy. I know that I need to find new people to speak to, but most of the people in my school suck. I have hobbies, but I only see them as a way to pass the time, not something to live for. I spoke about my issues with C, and she told me to come here. I want to improve and meet new people but I don't know how to do that anymore."

For context I am in college at the moment currently taking 18 credits while working part time. I had a test today that was worth 20% of my final grade in a class I currently am barely holding on to a B in. I have no passion for this class and am only taking it due to it being required for the major I actually am passionate about. I had not done any of the lecture associated with this test and had no motivation to do them. I was struggling through them today but had kinda accepted I would pull out like a D+/C- at most and just take the L and lose my B, which would hurt my GPA and my grad school chances (I need to keep a high GPA to improve my chances of getting scholarships for grad school. If I don't get scholarships it'll mean I'll either have to go into massive debt to pay for grad school, give up my dreams and settle into a job I don't love to make ends meet, or work for a few years while living at home with my dad, who would make my life hell). Suddenly, I got an email that said that due to an issue with the cheating-prevention software at my college, everyone would be getting a 100% on the exam. 

At first I was ecstatic, but now I am freaking out because I don't deserve that grade. I would have most likely failed had this not happened, but now I got a stroke of luck, but as a result I must be repaid with something awful. It's so fucking stupid that I feel this way but I just can't shake this terrible feeling that something awful is gonna happen to me or my family because the universe needs to balance it's good deed. Maybe it's just because I never get this lucky, but it just feels like something bad is on the horizon now. It's so dumb but I just know something bad is gonna happen. I don't know all I know is that I feel so anxious over nothing and I'd rather just fail the fucking test than sit here knowing I'm fucked because no good deed goes unpunished. What do I do? Should I just watch TV and try to forget about it? I don't want to bother my friends or family with this. I feel so dumb for being so anxious. People have real problems and here I am, being nervous for nothing."
1174,I believe I may be developing an unhealthy dependence on a new partner and aren’t sure what to do.,"Approximately 6 weeks ago I began a relationship with someone I had been friends with for a few months.  Around the same time I started developing a general sense of apathy to everything else in my life; school (I am a pre med student), fitness, and my hobbies.   I originally chalked it up to the fact I must have been so excited to be with this new person, that it was all I cared about.

I have been in quarantine the last 3.5 weeks from covid.  The general sense of apathy has since gotten significantly worse and I can’t bring myself to care about school and am watching my previously extremely great grades drop.   In addition to this I have been feeling a general sadness throughout the entirety of the day almost everyday, similar to what heartbreak has felt like.  I don’t know why this is. 

The new partner and I talk a lot, and generally end up video chatting for ~6 hours daily.  We both ended up bonding rather quickly.  When we are talking it’s the only time when the heartbreak feeling recedes.  

When we don’t talk I don’t necessarily long specifically to be talking to her, it’s just a general sadness and apathy.   I have had other romantic partners before and never experienced anything similar.  

Is this an unhealthy dependence building on a new partner?  Or is it just a “down” time as far as my general disposition that’s normal?"
1175,Feeling numb,"I don't know if this the right place to share this but I really dont know what to do. I received a phonecall earlier and I was told my dad passed away from a heart attack, he was only 53. My family is under the impression I'm the grieving daughter at home, one of my cousins wants to send me a card/flowers but the truth is I don't feel anything. I had a little cry when I first found out but it was short, I honestly don't know how I feel. Iv had messages saying that they are sorry to hear about my dad, the main reason I think i feel Numb is because my relationship with my dad wasn't the best, he physically and emotionally abused me throughout my whole life eventually I just cut him out my life. But surely I should feel something? Surely this isn't normal? I really hope I'm not the only one that feels like this"
1176,Sick Dreams,"I've racked my brain about if for a long time now, but I've gotten no where closer to understanding why. Context: some of my family members are Buddhist, others are Catholics, but they never taught or talked about anything religious of sort. My stepfather does, but only recently. Whatever it is, the only thing I'm sure of is that it's more deep-rooted than that. I also watch videos and look at photos/videos of war and serial killings a lot, but it's only in the past on year or so. A common theme to see is Guilt, running away from something, Betrayal, endless searching, etc.

But this thing happened as far as I can remember. 

5 or 6 yrs old: I started to have dreams of betraying my mother and grandmother and they ultimately fell to their death. It stopped when three or four years later, but it feels like something in my psych suddenly changes. At this time, I starts to get sad and unable to sleep at night because I realized that one day, everyone and everything will die. There's no comfort in that.

6 or 7 yrs old: Search up ""Biblically Accurate Angels."" I only found out about them this past year or so. But I had dreams about those otherworldly abominations since that age. I feel like being judged. It's not even self-judgement. Sure, a lot of guilt is there, but I'd dreamt about hiding in the darkness while the Seraph (with eyes all over and composed of light under every color the human eyes can perceive). Suddenly, it disappeared. And I started to dream about rape and strangling (even though I've never being abused. If anything, it's more like some sick sh\*t I couldn't stop obsessing about.)

About 8 yrs old: So altars devoted for Buddhism, Catholicism, and the dead starts to seriously bother me. I never thought about what happened before you are born and after you died. But it bothers me, still. My paternal grandfather just passed away at the time, and my biological father's side of the family starts to put purple mourning banners up and never took them down; they are always something among the line of calling for the Lord to protect his soul. Because of that, I starts to pay attention to the Buddhist altar at my maternal side of the family's homes. Then I started to dream... in each and every single one of them, the paintings and statues of figures like Guan Yin, Christ, and Mother Mary disappeared from the altars. The people around me became lifeless and brainless, as well. I was scared. I was scared of not surviving. And every time I fell ill, I had these kinds of dreams when I see colors and hear sounds that I remembered, but couldn't comprehend. It's like the weight of punishment and pressure on my soul. Every time I had these things, my body would be frozen like a corpse whenever I woke up. Then when I'm awake during the day, I would look at the portraits of my ancestors and if religious figures, and then I feel comforted-- as if they've spared a little mercy on me.

9 yrs old and above: They are weird, but generally has the same meaning; I'm scared and alone, but I can't trust others. I know they'll abandon me, they'll betray me, or they are too innocent/ ignorant to understand the danger. Whether I take their hand or not, I'll end up falling. I feel the need to control the situation, to govern what everyone's doing, so that we'll survive. But in truth, I always wake up before finding out. I dream nearly every day, so it's becoming more and more prevalent in my thoughts. One day, I had a dream about a voice (that's too abstract for explanation) that appears to only exist in my head, and yet omnipresent at the same time trying to comfort me. I cried a lot, and asked for guidance and knowledge. The voice didn't offer anything, but it comforts me nonetheless. The weird, sick sh\*t about rape, murder, flinging organs and blood every where in the room, torture, and landscapes that looks straight from a Trevor Henderson artwork/ another dimension starts to bother me less. 

But something is there... a lingering feeling that I've committed the greatest sin of all. I'm just a human who do bad and good stuffs, make little lies about stealing food from the table, and trying to hide my issues. I think the best comparison is that you've done something to horrendous and disgusting that you're bellow humanity, but suddenly your memories and your guilt had suddenly been cleansed and then you're reborn anew. But deep in your heart and soul, and whatever's watching you never forgot what you did, like to remind you every day of this. 

I'm sorry for this. I feel like I need to make this, without a solid reason as to why.

P.S: My mother had a history of dreaming about dead family members, actually dreaming things that suddenly happens in the future, had Buddhist statues and snakes appearing in her sleep, and depression during her 20s. My grandmother had a similar thing, too. One of my mother's brothers is no human; he's neither insane nor totally immoral -- yet is both at the same time... One of Mom's cousins went insane, another autistic, and the entire extended family (both maternal &amp; paternal) had 90 years of tragedy, superstitions, and absolutely horrendous events of war, famine, people drowning/ poisoned/ executed/ burned alive. Thinking about it, that sh\*t's surreal. At times, I don't even feel like I'm existing or ""there,"" and that hopefully all of our existence is just a simulator we can one day escape from. But that isn't helpful either, since nearly nobody in our family died peacefully and rest in peace."

I’ma start this by saying i overdosed. And ran away. Like 20 mins ago and i’m near a wood / lake and it’s dark. 
I tripped up and i think i broke my arm and i’m left handed and it’s my left arm and it really fkn hurts bad. I can’t even move it and it’s swelling up alot. I’m crying alot. Fuck. I’m sorry. I’m sorry also if this post is a mess i can hardly type with my right hand. 
My parents are awsome and really nice but they are both out on a drive to my mum’s friend’s house for christmas if we can’t meet up. I’m scared, cold and i’m fucking crying alot because my arm really fucking hurts and idk what to even do. Idk when the meds will work either. Fuck. I’m sorry. I need help. What the fuck do i do?"
1178,I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I was wondering about this problem I have...,"So I should be doing my schoolwork and look for college scholarships, but I often find myself distracted by other things. I might get sidetracked and go downstairs to get a snack, come back up and mess around on my piano, play video games or go about on Youtube. I don't know if I'm just not motivated enough, or maybe it's something else. What should I do?"
1179,Are there any people here who are not on disability who are educated and over age 45?,"I thought most people have Bachelors and Masters degrees. 

I guess I'm wrong.

Are there any non-disabled people on here who are over age 45?

Or is Reddit for young people?

One person responded to my other post on here, but she is dependent on a spouse, and the govt for income and healthcare.

I have to earn a living

Which I cant get due to my age

Age isnt a disability 

Being over educated and a female is a liability but not a disability 

And I cant explain my circumstances with anyone because all women in my age group are apparently dependent on a man's income through a direct marriage, a divorce or a live-in boyfriend or a parent.

I cant earn a living and thats why I have to suicide

You know why the wealthy suicide?

Because they know 211, and the hotlines are not staffed with people who understand their lifestyle issues

Cultural fit is important and knowing about a persons lifestyle, income needs, education level, finances are important to be able to relate to them.

Most hotlines are young college students or retirees or less informed volunteers 

They are just legal buffers for therapists and lawyers and nurses and teachers to prevent a malpractice claim from being paid put by the decedents family or next of kin

I wrote a note and left it for my estranged relatives to have my body buried or cremated

One line is put in there, ""no mention of suicide or call hotlines, they are legal buffers that I dont support. No one cares about anyone, all relations are based on money """
1180,I'm losing my shit tonight,Hope I am better when I wake up
1181,How to not focus on thoughts so much,"
So I’m not sure who else suffers with this (I guess it’s Pure O) but I feel like I give importance to my thoughts and get very anxious if I’ve just had a thought and I’ve forgotten what it was... as I feel I need to think thoroughly about each thought and to go through different things within my head to ‘rationalise’ and understand each of these anxious thoughts. 

How can I just let these thoughts go, rather than go through a series of mental compulsions each time I get the thought? 

I feel I wrack my brains trying to remember all these thoughts, which often leads to mental list making. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
1182,I'm 28M and I've been looking back a lot lately. It's sometimes unpleasant when things make sense.,"Hi there... First off, thank you for clicking here, this is the first time I've decided to write something about me on a social platform in this manner. I feel like I greatly need help, but I'll do my best to stay concise (hint: I kinda failed) and at least not to bore you to death (hint: I can't tell that by myself).
As the title says, I'm a 28 years old male. I've got a job which I'm passionate about. I've done enough in my adult life that I feel like I could die today and not care, except for my loved ones. But at the same time, I crave for more and want to make the best of my abilities, and keep on learning, for the purpose of being useful. That is my jam, that gets me going.
Around ten years ago I took a stand with myself to never end my life abruptly, as to give life a chance anyway. I had been struggling with very negative thoughts since I was around 6-7 years old. I had been sexually ""abused"" by someone very close to me around that age. Happened that I ""showed off"" my distress by crying with a knife in my hand and talking about ending it all a couple months later. Sadly, to no avail.
Also, I felt that I wasn't given proper consideration growing up, that my curiosity rarely was ever met with sufficient attention. The base of my pyramid was taken care off, other parts not as much.
Growing up, I have been diminished and insulted when I dared say I didn't understand. I also had been bullied multiple times, sometimes for standing up for a friend, sometimes for sitting by myself. I surprised myself enjoying to endure a friend in school writing with a compass on my forearm. My mother did not enjoy his artwork, but I must have played the victim card to ease her wrath, as it was easy to do.
I'd have learned to close off on myself, and became quite good at it. Flicked my bubble switch and nobody could ever hurt me. 
But darkness could, it did, and still does. 
Way less often now than then, for sure. I've traveled a long way since, on a psychological level. But when it gets to me, this abyss earns it's name, and I've become used to staring at it enough as to discern the shapes moving down there. 
And I feel my body aching and keep on going. Who has the time for a medical appointment? Cigarettes might kill me... that's why I've started them to be fair, so might I consider that an achievement? I was allergic to its smoke when I was a child. I've been through multiple bronchitis, had two pneumonias. I haven't been in the hospital in a while but next time might not be as easy on me as the couple last ones...
And my mental health definitely has been going downhill lately... As I might be overpressuring myself, and the lack of contact with my friends is hitting me too. I haven't managed to sleep more than 4 hours for the whole of the week.

Writing this felt good, but reading it back I feel like a clown. 
What is for you to make of this now? I'm not really sure... I feel like crying but I can't.

But for anyone wondering... I'm glad I took this path: forcing myself to get up and through life. I tried finding purpose and now regret that I decided to bring forward my deadline... But maybe I couldn't have managed without it.

I am not able to make sure the whole of this makes any sense to anyone other than myself, right now. Bear with me if it didn't, and accept my apologies for wasting your time and attention.

I'll end this with my own PSA: 
Keeping on is invaluable, let us all not give ourselves the comfort of giving up. I've developed a feeling that purpose is often found in adversity: so y'all be your own best challengers. I hope I'll make sure to be mine too.
My step for tonight will be having the balls to post this here, and not erase everything because of shame."
1183,Flip of the switch mood change,"One moment I am completely fine, and then all of the sudden, I’m not. It happens so quickly. Today it happened when I was midway through a sentence. I can “feel” the change in my brain. 

I immediately become withdrawn and have intrusive thoughts. I will typically then spend however long is left in the day in bed. Usually by the morning I am fine. 

Does this sound like bipolar? Does anyone else experience such sudden down turns?"
1184,Does anyone else NEVER have good dreams?,"Every night I’m scared to go to sleep because I know I will just be feeling anxious as soon as I wake up due to a nightmare. I’ve had a single good dream in the last 10 years. A few weird dreams and the rest all nightmares. 
I also sometimes have like 5 quick scary dreams right before I fall asleep. And no, not that I’m falling or that type. Just quick flashes of stupid scary stuff. I’m so tired of it."

For the past couple of months and I've noticed that I feel less interested in things that I would once enjoy doing, the thing that makes me feel this way the most would be playing video games. I used to be able to play games for HOURS on end having fun but now I mainly feel like I'm forcing myself to play a game to try and enjoy it but I don't feel the same enjoyment that I once did. I've gone weeks to see if I was just burnt out but after those weeks end I feel that same way I did before I stopped. Another big thing is I just dont ever feel like going out at all, I rather just stay home than go out even if it means that I'm doing absolutely nothing here at home."
1187,Am I over medicated?,"I have bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, and recently started having acute stress. I’ve been taking 150mg of Lamictol, 150mg of Wellbutrin, and 100mg of seroquel.

1188,"Could this be a part of my bipolar disorder, or something else?","*Trigger warning: domestic violence, and suicidal ideation 

I have recently had thoughts of suicide. I just feel like I no longer want to be here, but I am not going to do it. Then my brother started to verbally abuse me, and I was crying, and begging him to stop. He would not. He was standing in the kitchen, at the other end of the room, at the time. I picked up a knife, from the side, and I held it in my hand, shaking. I continued to cry, begging him to stop. He continued, but I put the knife down anyway, and collapsed on the floor crying. I did not want to stab him. I just could not emotionally handle what he was saying. I just wanted it to stop. I feel like I lack control, and my head was just tellinh me how much of a bad person I was, and trying to talk myself into putting the knife down. This is not something I ever thought I would do. I scared myself. My brother is not scared of me. He knew what he was doing, he did it on purpose. He was doing it on purpose. He finds it funny. I do not. My brother is usually verbally nasty to me, and my friends, and I do not usually act this way towards him. The only other time I have hurt him, was when I was 10, and he was talking to me like I piece of shit, because I touched a bin, so I slapped him on the arm. I hit his sun burn. I did not mean to hit his sun burn, but I did mean to hit him. Then he turned around, and gave me a black eye."
1189,Impulsively shattered my dads car windshield during a panic attack,"(Call me spoiled all you want, but these are my feelings and I really need help as I have no other resources)

On my way home from vet school, my dad was driving and kept screaming at me and I reflexively spasm-ed and tensed all my muscles and hit the windshield with my foot, cracking it. This car is my dads brothers and was expensive, and now my parents are screaming at me and going to make me pay for it.

I have ptsd, manic bipolar, manic depression, and extreme anxiety. My parents shrug it off. They expect me to be perfect and then yell at me no matter how hard I try to be. I got in to veterinary school at 16, got a job, and do the best I can with those, but I’m still mentally ill and have days where I can’t move without freaking out. I stopped going to school for 2 weeks because the bright lights scare me, I barely show up to work anymore, and my room is “absolutely disgusting”. I have yet to have gone to the hospital, but I think because I’ve actually hurt something other than myself for once (I’ve sliced myself up a couple times and nobody cared bc it’s MYSELF and not someone else) and now I just feel like killing myself because I hurt too many people.

My parents think giving children anything other than food, clothing, and shelter is spoiling them. They think that if they were to give me anything else besides those that I will become a disrespectful POS child and “go do drugs and have sex” (I already do both of those because I get no positive reinforcement from my parents and think that being called hot or getting high is the closest thing to it). I am NEVER given any positive support and just want them to love me. 

I’ve come to the conclusion my parents don’t care about me anymore because they refuse to get me treatment unless I hurt other people. Now that I’ve accidentally broken a windshield I think they’ll do something. I want help really bad but nobody will help me. For gods sake my parents took my brother out for OCTOPUS DINNER at a fancy restaurant and left me at home crying having a PTSD fueled panic attack. 

I have no more friends. I am constantly posting cries for help to my thousands of social media followers, but nobody does anything. My own parents won’t help me. 

Here’s a list of what’s been hurting me lately:

- got into vet school at 16 but no congrats from my parents, it was expected 

- forced to do so much for my parents when they do nothing for me
  
- parents constant procrastination when it comes to getting me help

- yelled at for bad grades when I barely can get out of bed let alone not freak out in class and get sent home

- I have no hobbies atm bc I don’t have the ability to upkeep them

- I am bullied CONSTANTLY for my choices 

- my parents control all that I do and don’t let me see friends or work the hours I want

- my parents don’t provide me with reliable transportation and often leave me waiting for hours to be picked up from the bus stop 

- I cannot buy my own car due to my parents thinking I’ll destroy it and they’ll lose money if I were to kill my self in/with it

- my parents are divorced which I believe sponsored my shitty mental health

- I go to a school where everyone drives Porsche’s, range rovers and Mercedes where my parents tell me that I’m already spoiled and that I’m a shitty child for “wanting a want” 

- ETC.

Idk what my point in posting this is, I just want some sort of support or a pat on the back for staying alive bc atm I really want to finally go deep enough and leave this consciousness for once and for all"
1190,M34 - High level managerial role and never been able to complete any assignment. ADHD?,Hi! I’m a hotel general manager that has never been been able to complete an assignment or project. I keep procrastinating it and eventually always been able to find a way around. With my current position I’m able to delegate it all and make sure that things get done. What could be reason behind? ADHD?
1191,Is there something wrong with me?,"A while ago I began to get extremely disgusted by any type of ""mouth noises"".

I can't even look or listen to it for a second it makes me physically ill I can't even think about it it is so disgusting. Like sure I think most people think its gross but I am just unnaturally unnerved by it. I have to leave the table or cover my ears or shut my eyes and somehow burn the image from my mind.

But now that I am thinking more about it, the thought of kissing anyone and their saliva mixing with mine, remnants the food they ate getting mixed in my mouth god that is so disgusting. that is just so disgusting. I never want to kiss anyone now that is so repulsive it makes me shudder. is something wrong? is this normal?"

July: nieces were taken away from my brother and his wife for abuse

During this time, I have been trying to get them. 

October 22: brother was arrested on 2 indecent liberties with a minor

November (1st week) my mom stopped talking to me because I told the detective things that went against my brother and possibly put him in jail longer. 


I found out yesterday that I wouldn’t be getting the kids because they think it’s too much for me, 3 kids in a single adult home. The worker is recommending them to be put up for adoption. 

Today I found out that my brother has confessed and there are 2 additional children. 
His new charges are 4 indecent liberties with a child and  2 3rd degree sexual exploitation. 


Since this began, I have started therapy for stuff that this brought up and I knew that I couldn’t figure this out on my own. I have my second appointment in the am, I called her today and told her she what was going on. 


I do currently go to a public mental health facility and my doctor referred me to a program that assigned me a case manager. 

I know this is something that I have to deal with but is there a prescription that can help dull this some?  A friend recommended Valium/xanax but I’m on gabepentin 3x (100 mg) daily and that isn’t doing anything. 

I left my case worker a message asking to her to ask my doctor to prescribe me something just now. 

I guess the reason I’m asking is so that if they ask me what/why somethjng will help, I can be able to say somethjng besides I don’t know. 


One last thing, does anyone know of a website/articles/anything I can read about someone this close to you doing this type of thing? I had a brother die before, this feels a lot like that but different. I shouldn’t be hurting over him and I know this. 

Just any tips."
1194,I’m anxious about taking my new anxiety medication,I got prescribed Zoloft from my doctor this week to help with my anxiety attacks and just general anxiety thats been taking over my life. I have health anxiety and think that anything new I try/eat/drink will cause an allergic reaction and my throat will close up. I know it’s irrational but that’s majority of my anxiety and it’s so hard to stop. Any time I think about taking it I get all worked up and can’t bring myself to do it. The irony.
1195,I am mentally exhausted and I don't know how much I can take,"I am currently taking my Master Degree in a subject that won't take me far in life. I already failed two courses, and I only got 1 chance to pass them in February or else I will be f*cked. At the same time I also have 2 additional subjects this semester. So I have a handful of assignments I need to submit by the end of this year. And it's taking a tool on me.
I am looking for a job as I am currently broke. I always said if I ever find a good paying job that I am fully happy with, I will drop out from school right away. But that chance is really slim as I already sent out dozens of applications this month without any replies. And on top of that, I am currently taking my driving license, and I am scared of failing. 

I feel like a failure. I haven't slept properly for days. I lost a significant amount of weight. I'm so drained. Like really really drained. I'm stressed and anxious all the time. My mom commenting the other day that I am becoming abnormally thin, but I wish she asked me if I was ok. Actually no..because I know I will break down crying and I don't want to make her sad. 

I'm so exhausted..When will it end?"
1196,Moving on?? What?,So we all know how they say you need to move on after something bad happens (Like if you lose someone close to you.) Well I lost my dogs almost 9-10 months ago and I'm still not over it. I kinda wanna move on but I don't know how and I'm afraid I'll forget them. any advice?
1197,Having a hard go of it,"

I'm sure you guys will go through my history and determine that I am a neurotic headcase. That's true in a sense, but I am a decent partner overall.

She seems to be happy most of the time. When I tell her that I am having a hard time, suicidal thoughts, or stressed out she turns against me. Last night she came into our place and caught me on the suicide hotline.

She went to the kitchen and complained about my cooking. I asked her to talk about the phone call and she went to the bedroom and locked the door. I was sitting on the couch in an emotional teeter totter. Deserve to kill myself, or will the pain I inflict on my family be too much?

We have a rule where we don't talk to others about personal matters unless we explicity say that we want to. It's a little relationship quirk, but it's very important to me. I started to get concerned calls from a lot of contacts. It was very embarrassing to say the least.

The trust violation has really hurt me. Today we went for an outing that she was really looking forward to. I felt hurt about the past and sort of afraid because she has been violent and has lied publicly about me to diminish my character in the past. I lost my dream job because she falsely accused me of constraining her to an isolated location. She wasn't even working and I paid for her vehicle, mma training sessions, and all other expenses.

She had her MMA friends beat the shit out me. It was a terrible, dehumanizing experience. That was our initial break up.

A few months later she calls me because she is pregnant with our son. I decide to man up, swallow my recently bruised pride, and take care of her and my future child. That requires me to end my employment and move to a state that I hate.

Tragically our son dies. I may have not loved the circumstances that brought my son into my life but I loved my son. I will forever be scarred by the memories of giving him CPR when I knew that he was dead.

I know the taste of cold baby blood forced into my mouth during CPR. That is impossible to forget.

A few months later my role model sister hung herself in an RV. About 90 days from todays date.

I have been having a very hard time."
1198,I never realized just how dead my self esteem actually is.,"Just a sad vent. I've always known I don't have the best self esteem but I've come to realize it's DEAD. Like, none at all. I don't know how else to continue this post, just a vent."
1199,My boyfriend told me he wants to kill himself and I haven't stopped crying all night.,"My boyfriend has recently been dealing with depressive episodes. He said he's constantly anxious or upset. He tends to overthink a lot which makes him much worse.

Tonight he told me that he plans to end his life. He said he had everything set up ready and wanted to talk to me one last time. 

I am currently about 145 miles away from him so I can't even be there to talk to him in person. After hours of talking and crying and begging he promised he wouldn't do anything tonight but refused to promise he wouldn't do it in the near future. 

I am terrified. i can't be there for him. I'm afraid I'm going to wake up to a phone call saying he's gone. Every phone call I have with him, I'm scared will be my last. 

I know he's struggling at the moment, he assures me I'll get over it in time but I'm not sure how someone would get over this. I don't want to lose my best friend. I feel so helpless and afraid. 

I said that as soon as we're out of lockdown and he comes home (he's working away, hence the distance) we would go to a doctor and get help. I promised I would always be there for him, especially on his bad days. As someone who has attempted suicide in the past (and very luckily failed) I know things get better, it just takes time. He's adamant that he's a fuck up and everyone is better off without him. 

I really don't know what to do."
1200,I sometimes experience bouts where I am not in control of what I say...,"I have been googling for hours about mental health disorders involving blacking out and getting into fights with people but I can’t find anything that does not involve alcohol so I thought I would see if anyone here can point me in the right direction. 

Since I was little I’ve had incidents where I blackout (but not really it’s like I can see myself but I can’t stop it) and I’m picking a fight with someone close to me and saying relationship-shattering things that I know are bad, but I am unable to stop. It’s like self-destructive behavior and physical ticks that I can’t control. Not just fighting but other general self-destructive behavior like messing up at work on something I do every day for years, but like it is on purpose. 

My parents thought I was catatonic when I was little and brought me to a therapist and a priest but I don’t remember much of what they concluded, and it seemed to resolve momentarily after puberty. But now I’m in my mid-20s it is back. Does anyone have any thoughts?"
1201,"Dreams that may be bad, but feel so good","So, I have dreams were I'm just beating my dad (He killed my doggos in horrible ways) to the point were he's doesn't even look like a person anymore. I also had a dream were Me and my Dog Ava were just beating him up for what he did. Why do I have these horrible but good feeling dreams? I know why they happen and why feel so good. It's because I absolutely hate him from the bottom of my heart. I know it's cruel, but He took my dogs lives away!"
1202,simulation theory,"

does anyone else follow simulation theory or feel that their life is just a game being acted out by some higher force? I struggle with this and the possibility of the people in my life having some sort of truman show experiment going on with me."
1203,Feeling really drained but need to push through,"I’ve had a long couple of months, as everyone else has. I have diagnosed bipolar disorder and can’t really tell if I’m in a funk or just mega drained. I am a full time student, taking 17 credit hours. I also am the office manager at a small healthcare facility that pivoted to doing COVID-19 testing. I have worked overtime for the last few months and do all of my studying at night when I get home from work. It is my finals week and I have three finals that I need to take before 11AM on Saturday, along with a few assignments that I need to complete. I have family commitments after work tomorrow, so don’t have much time to waste. But I am honestly exhausted. I just want to go to sleep and just wake up and go to work tomorrow. With plans to go to law school, I don’t have much wiggle room to screw around. I don’t really know what to do. I would love to just go to sleep and try to email my professors begging for some grace. But I don’t want to look back and regret moments of weakness. Any words of wisdom or advice or support would be appreciated."
1204,today wasn’t that great,"today really wasn’t the best day for me, and what sucks is that I tried to have a good day sooo bad. I woke up early, did some assignments, and after I went out to run errands, things went left. I’m probably gonna go sleep today off, but idk, I just wanted to rant a little."
1205,fuckin aye,i’ve been like this for 6 years and nothing good has ever happened and all of the times i’ve tried to make it better nothing has ever worked and i’ve even committed myself 3 times and it does nothing i don’t know what else to do my life is too terrible to keep going on and i’m very to trying to commit suicide again.
1206,I feel starved,"Touch deprived, lack of emotional support, few people around me. I never realized how much emotions like this are basic needs but I feel deprived of every good feeling. Haven’t got a genuine hug in months, haven’t had someone outside of my older brothers really show they care.

I’m 19 and moved out on my own with a friend, and I feel like 98% of the people in my life have dissapeared in the last year and a half. I talk to almost no one, my social interaction is limited to just work. I’m struggling. Things are only getting harder.

I moved out of my parents on a bad page, broke up with my girlfriend, quit college, and moved states. I wanted a new start and things aren’t any different. My mind is in a clutter and I can’t seem to straighten it up."
1207,"Why do I feel emotionally numb and feel like the last couple of years I strive to just feel something, anything at all.","The last couple of years and especially now in quarantine, I've been having a hard time feeling emotion, be it positive or negative, there just wasn't much. 

I'd started engaging in nostalgia to an obsessive degree just to feel that little bit of something, rewatching and rereading things that did evoke a strong emotional reaction on me the first time I read/watched them. I don't care if it's positive or negative, I just wanted to feel anything at all. I latch onto things that are making me feel anything and this is definitely not a healthy behaviour... I think?

Why is this? Is this normal? What should I do?"
1208,"Why do I fantasize about being mortally wounded in an accident, and unable to be saved?", ?
1209,Am I going crazy? Hearing things and dissociating.,"I need some help. I’m a sophomore in college and I’ve been noticing some symptoms recently that are somewhat troubling?

So when I was young, I had very clear anxiety. This anxiety lead to some weird paranoias. One that stands out was that I was convinced that there were mites living in my carpet and, if I were to stand on the carpet for too long, the mites would crawl up my legs and kill me. I was so scared that I would leave items all over my floor so I could play the floor is lava to get around. I was also convinced that my stuffed animals would come to life and try to kill me in the middle of the night if I didn’t sleep with all of them on my bed or if they weren’t covered with a blanket under my bed. These stopped when I was 10ish. 

More recently, now that I’m in college, I’ve had some more worrisome symptoms. I am medicated for anxiety and depression (sertraline) but I think I’ve been hearing some voices? Sometimes I hear my name being called in the middle of the night or I hear sounds like scratching coming from behind me. 

The other day, I accidentally stepped on my phone and slightly cracked the screen while dissociating pretty hard. I wasn’t upset in the moment because I was convinced at the time that I could just go back in time and undo it like ctrl z. I’m not sure how that would work, but I just completely accepted that it could be done. 

I’m not sure if these are signs of something bigger or may be tied to other mental illnesses. Should I go see a therapist? Could these just be normal things that I’m blowing out of proportion?"
1210,School worry’s,"My school is really pissing me off like I’m the only student doing online school and all my teachers don’t send me work or zoom me and they are always talking about being On time and being prepared but the icing on top is that they have the audacity to send me assessments and exams with no notes and even when they do send me work it’s always late and its a good hour and a half worth of work that is done IN GROUPS, and another thing I’m not in collage, I’m in year 9 and please god don’t say they are preparing me for college because I still have 3 years it’s just a shit show with my school and I don’t know what to do"
1211,Ranting...,"I’m tired, I’m tired of waking up and doing the same thing everyday. Even days off aren’t enjoyable anymore, I just had 3 days off and felt like I was doing shit for everyone else but not for myself. Everything that I wanted to do I didn’t get to because at the end of the day I was too damn tired to do anything. 

Meh this is just a rant but I am having a hard time the last few days. Not sure if this is just a mood or something more serious. I am on anti depressants/anxiety medication but recently my anxiety has been way worse. I just figure everyone is feeling anxious because of Covid-19 or just general life stuff. 

Just getting my thoughts out because my wife has heard me ranting the last couple days :p"
1212,tw/ suicide,"this is a throwaway but i dont give a shit anymore

i think im going to kill myself tonight or tomorrow. im so fucking tired of everything. i have severe mental issues but no diagnosis for anything so i dont even know how to help myself anymore. 
inpatients are too expensive and i dont want to voluntarily admit myself
im not even sad because of my life, my life is fine i guess. im tired of struggling with my mental health, everywhere i go im anxious about what people think of me, i cant understand that some people might actually care about me, i have friends but i dont believe they actually like me. im tired of dissociating all the fucking time. im just. done."
1213,How do I get fast mental healthcare with government medicaid and without taking any time off work?,"I'm stressed so far beyond my limits it's inexplicable and intolerable. I'm really crashing and burning here. I'm self-diagnosing with mania, psychosis and all kinds of other shit. Even posting this is terrifying me like I'm gonna get reported and someone's gonna come pick me up because of it. America's mental healthcare is hilariously bad and treats sick people like criminals. I'm assuming it's even harder to get help now that everyone in the world is mentally afflicted because of the shitty state of affairs. Is this hell? If there's a God, he's a sadistic, evil, malevolent POS and I'd love to kick his ass. I'm pretty sure my unspeakable levels of rage and stress have already started the countdown timer to my early demise. I just have so many seriously fucked up health issues that are blatantly stress-induced. 

But my job is just simply more important to me than being a whiny little bitch and going to get help for myself. I've been in and out of work for most of my adult life (almost 30) and unable to hold a job for shit. And it's been stressing my also-highly-stressed mother out to no end. But I've finally got a respectable job (with her company) and I finally moved out from my also-mentally-ill and abusive girlfriend's apt into my own home. So my mom is finally happy and proud of me, not disappointed in me, at peace, etc. And so maintaining the facade is simply more important to me. 

But what I wouldn't give to finally feel inner peace, happiness, contentment, lack of hugely burdensome stress, etc. And I mean.. my inability tqo cope is even impacting my work performance. But ""faking it til I make it"" is still a lot more viable than missing a bunch of work to get better, stressing my mom out again, my boss finding out I'm a fucking nutcase, etc. So how can I tell a dr I have some fucked up thoughts, desires and stress without getting locked up or missing work? 

I'm also on government medicaid (possibly not anymore tomorrow when I call and let them know i got my first whopping $13/hr paycheck and get taken off benefits). And the only mental health service they cover is inpatient. I simply refuse to do inpatient. I'm not going to get locked up and have my phone taken away and be made to feel like a subhuman criminal pos for being sick in my brain, like I never wanted. I'm still intelligent, self-aware, smart enough to not do anything too stupid, etc. Or maybe I just have delusions of grandeur.. who knows.. anything anymore... But I'm not going to be grouped in with the weirdos who pull their pants down and take a shit in the middle of Wal-Mart and the like. 

This feels so futile and pathetic. I'm such a whiny, self-absorbed little bitch. I just need to get over myself and stop being so self-important. That'll help, right? There's almost certainly no magical pill that helps someone as fucked up as me. And thanks to the rule of lawyerism, they probably can't do outpatient services for me due to liability bullshit. So there's probably no hope. Fml. What a dystopian shit hole this world is. Sorry for the huge bitchy rant. Any thoughts/suggestions? Or am I setting my sights too high, wanting to have my cake and eat it too, etc? 

Thanks to any saints out there who are selfless enough to try to help me with my fucked up problems while I'm not offering anyone else any help. I'm what's wrong with the world. Sorry about that."
1214,feeling like i don't deserve things,"let me pre-face this: i am going about to sound so privileged right now. i know. and this is probably going to be all over the place.

almost everyone i know is struggling with their mental health, financial challenges, quarantine fatigue, extreme stress, housing problems, not having a quiet place to study at home, family stressors. every week in one of my classes, my professor asks us to share how we are doing. everyone is going through so much hardship right now, and i feel so guilty to be in a stable situation, mentally and financially.

i feel extremely guilty for the privileges that i have been afforded. i have a quiet place to study, a supportive family, a stable financial situation. covid has definitely affected my family, but not to the extent that it has for others. this is my problem. whenever someone else that i care deeply about isn’t doing well, i feel like i don’t deserve my happiness, contentment, or mental health improvement. does anyone else ever feel this way? it even manifests itself on a smaller scale. for example, when my sister is feeling stressed about her schoolwork and midterms, i feel guilty that i don't feel the same level of stress. when my friends tell me about how overwhelming their life has been this past year, i feel guilty for being in a situation where i don't need to worry about the things they're worrying about. to some extent, i always feel like i need to one-up my friends and family in terms of the level of stress that i'm facing. this sounds so insane, i know. 

i know i sound like a crazy person right now, but i needed to get this off my chest bc it's something that i've always felt but this feeling has just become exacerbated bc of covid and quarantine. i think a big part of it is that i'm a deeply empathetic person, and i very easily absorb the emotions and stress of people around me. i remember i was studying with a friend for midterms, and her stress was so palpable that i could barely focus on my own work bc i was absorbing her stress. i think it also stems from a constant want to be able to take people's problems away. i know that's not possible (especially now), but i've always been the type of person who goes the extra length to check in on a friend or treat them to something if i know they've been going through it. and now, the increase in stress and mental illness is just how it is, and i wish i could just take it all away. sometimes i wish i could just take someone's burden and struggles and just carry them myself. 

i also need to add: as i mentioned before, i understand that i come from a very privileged standpoint to be able to even express these type of emotions. no one in their right mind would want to ""feel more stressed"" (for lack of better word) or shoulder someone else's burden. and i am so, so lucky to have the support and resources that i have during this time. this post is by no means a complaint regarding the privileges that i have bc i am beyond grateful for all that i have. it's more of a vent about how i have been feeling emotionally. no complaints, just expressing myself in hopes that someone else has maybe felt a similar way."
1215,skin picking &amp; binge eating,"both of these are bad habits of mine and i was hoping someone might be able to suggest less destructive habits i could pick up as a replacement? i don’t know if it’s anxiety, but i have a difficult time sitting still. i constantly have the urge to be moving, especially if it’s carrying out some small repetitive task. i think i pick up these habits because it’s a way for me to shut off my thoughts. i don’t know. can anyone relate &amp; can anyone offer suggestions? &lt;3"
1216,I can’t take this anymore.,"How am I only 17 and I managed to screw my life up so badly? I am so tired of getting attached to people so quickly just to get disappointed just as quickly. I’m tired of having that attachment control my moods for the day. I’m tired of wanting to end it all then feeling like everything’s gonna be okay and I can do something about it and it only lasting until I wake up in the morning. Then it starts all over again. Why do I even wake up in the morning? The only thing stopping me from ending it at this point is the pain I’d leave with my family, but sometimes not even that is enough to stop me from fantasizing. I just want to get through the day without feeling like I can’t control my emotions."
1217,My existence is powered by spite and sacrifice,"It's weird being inside my head these days. Unending streams of disconnected thoughts and an evermore unearthly and vague yet crystal clear views of the world around me. The great illusion of reality, humanity and self is up for debate whenever I'm not fully immersed in some menial distraction. But in-between all of the times I'm lost in the viscous cycle of the void and the eating, the engine that drives this wretched existence ever forward can be observed. The great truth that in my suffering, I am their superior, their better. Where they have proven repeatedly incapable of even a fraction of the suffering I have and continue to endure, I find myself caught in between my moral duties and my utter hatred for these lowly worms. For at the end of the day, they have created me. My flesh, this crude and pulsing meat cage, this infernal insufferable life was chained upon me by my parents, and none other. My mind on the other hand, it's twisted architecture and jagged broken glass edges digging into the sides of my skull. That was formed by them, all the guardians and sycophants, the blind guides and restless gluttons. It was through their continued work and toil I was shaped into the instrument I am today. Their hands and judging looks that shaped the kind heart of a lost child into the razors edge of a knife. I was brought upon this world and shaped by them, and it is through their continued torture that I was shaped into what I am today. I demand little more from them than what they demanded from me. P E R F E C T I O N. They cower before their own standards now. How can I possibly ask of them something so unobtainable? Do I have no understanding of their shortcomings as humans, the validity of their excuses. I have understanding, but I accept not their excuses and weaknesses. These phrases means nothing to me. Your excuses are worth the dirt beneath a pigs hoof, your weaknesses as valid as a child's pride. I expect nothing more of you than you have expected of me. Not only that I will be even more kind and generous than you ever were to me. I will listen and wait, a privilege I was denied. Because I am their better. I am a star-born child compared to their filthy groveling forms. I will live this life and serve this unjust sentence, cast upon me by children and fools. I will do my duty even if it is unfair and ridiculous, but know it is because my strength and patience transcend their weaknesses thousandfold."
1218,What do I do?,"I feel numb almost all the time. I am apathetic, forgetful and just numb inside. I realized I have always been like this growing up and it keeps getting worse. The numbness, the hazy memories of things that even happened yesterday. I am just 25. What do I do?"
1219,Is there a hope ?!,"
I am Ahmed, I have been diagnosed for a long time with bpd then i have been treated for a year and a half , I'm much better than before but I want to know if there will be a radical treatment ( cure ) of the problem, because even after dialectal behavioral therapy "" DBT "" , I still suffer greatly and I want a radical solution so that there is no hope at all in any place I search on , such as the Internet and this tires me very much.

‏1- Is it really there is no hope?

2- What about ketamine, Why haven't they used it yet? Although it has proven to be very effective in our treatment, in essence !!

3- What about BCI like neuralink and etc .??

‏ 4- Or if scientific progress and new researches can cure us in the future before we die ?

‏Thank you so much .. and i hope you reply me .."
1220,I don't have any idea what to do (26f),"Hello everyone. Greetings to everyone who clicked on this. English isn't my native languge, so sorry in advanced if I don't express myself that well, or make any mistake.

While I was growing up, I always felt that something was wrong with me. I can say that I was 'the weird kid' in my class, and I was mocked and bullied a lot during my school days. I just couldn't get along with my classmates, for idk what reason to be honest.
Then, when I was 19, I entered the university and thought that I was finally doing something with my life. Boy was I wrong.

I was in a relationship with an extremely toxic guy, that has scarred me a lot. It affected my self-esteem and self confidence in a huge way. Apparently, I internalized others' opinions and feelings of me, and I just can't get rid of it, and can't accept myself the way I am.
2 years ago I was struggling a way too much with suicidal thoughts, I couldn't handle my own existance. 

At this point, I still haven't graduated. This is my 8th year of studying 😪. I really want to finish my studies, but I can't find any motivation. I don't even have a job, and feel so bad for being burden for my parents. I come from a European Slavic country, and it is very hard to get any job, and the minimum wage is ridiculous. I feel incapable of doing anything, so I don't even dare to try. I'm still so insecure and have 0 ambitions.
Being alive is so demanding :(
Hugs to everyone!"
1221,I can’t shake this feeling...,"Lately I’ve (28F) been really emotional. I have GAD and OCD. My mother lives in GA. My dad is about an hour away. My parents are wonderful. I have unique and special relationships with them each. As I’ve grown and begun my own life they’ve settled into theirs again and my mom has fought many battles. I grew up with my mom and saw Dad on the weekends and it was perfect. They were cordial and loved me and that’s what mattered. I’ve been missing my mom so much lately. We’ve been through so much as mother and daughter. I’ll just get a text from her and start to cry. She’s been doing better lately and when she seems good I think I miss her more because I wish we could be together and make continued memories. As an adult daughter it’s a different dynamic and she is my best friend. My father, too. He is my hero, that man. My dad uncovered some home videos that I thought were gone forever. I haven’t seen any home videos in many years. We FaceTimed earlier and he showed me some and they went back to my early childhood. Seeing my mom and me as a child and hearing my dad and my mothers moms voice (my nanny). It just flooded me with memories. I find myself struggling to keep it together again. I had such a beautiful childhood. I miss my childhood so much. I think it may be because I’ve faced so much these last few years and I yearn for the ease of innocence? I just can’t shake this unbearable sadness every time I imagine the past. No regrets but just a yearning to go back. I don’t think that I am unhappy now.. I’m engaged and we’ve been together 12 years. We’re good and I’m in my senior year of nursing school and I’m doing well. But this sadness is unbearable and it makes me feel powerless in the moment, defeated. Is there something wrong with me? Is there deeper meaning here? Can anyone relate? I just want to go back then so badly. I appreciate if you’ve read this all."
1222,Can emotional abuse cause memory loss in a child?,"Just a question. Not sure if this is the right sub, but for all my life I've always worried what events took place in my childhood that I haven't been able to remember. The only time as a kid I remember actually losing my memory was when I was 12 I think. 

My parents split when I was 6 and when I got older enough I started to sometimes sleep over with my dad. I usually have the Tv on cause I've was scared of the dark. However, that night my older bro came to sleep over. And he's always been a dick. A right bully. 

I was anxious about sleeping in same room because I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep with lights off. Anyway, I ended up waking up and saw a lamp beside the bed. Did not remember any of what transpired that night or how I even asked for the lamp. Didn't remember going to sleep. I shrugged it off then cause I was young but now I'm scared something transpired that I don't remember. 

My older bro a couple years ago always used to get serious and ask my mum if my dad ever raped me which my mum told him no. She was very serious about it and told my brother off. He thought it was a complete joke. 

My dad's verya immature too. At a young age of 8 I had discharge. Never knew what it was until I was 16. I was embarassed and thought I was peeimg myself and that I'd need a catheter. My discharge always dried yellow, and I had test after test even when they said I was fine and finally sat me down and told me everything was normal down below. 

I'm just mad because nobody told me and when I had a sleepover with my dad and he thought it was funny to nosy in my underwear all he called me was piss pants. And thought it was hilarious. 

And that's ladies and gentlemen is how I've got mental health issues. :) Thanks. And sorry for the long post."
1223,I dont know what to do anymore...,"Hi everyone! So, about 8 days ago I started feeling, well, NOTHING. its like im freaking broken into 2, one half is my feelings and emotions,  and the other is conscious but ""dead"" inside me. I can now label and recognize my emotions, but they have no feeling behind them at all. I think I might be in a mixed manic state but I am unsure. (I have bipolar 1) i also just lost my baby at 13w6d today because I wouldn't have made it thru the pregnancy with my life. What is wrong with me? I am so so so scared, but feel nothing anyways, im scaring myself qnd just could use some advice. I also have been sleeping a metric shit ton. Thank you all in advance 💖"
1224,"So, regarding suicide. Given the current climate of Covid","if I were to try and go through with another attempt serious enough and fail, I would no doubt wind up in a hospital, in a bed, possibly on a ventilator or other equipment depending on method used. Now right now in the pandemic hospitals are scrambling desperately to find enough beds and ventilators and what not for those afflicted by the virus and there just isn’t enough to go around. So in the meantime I’m holding off to save a bed and equipment for someone who truly desperately wants to stay alive rather than making them suffer and be denied critical healthcare because of what I failed to do. 

I’m not sure what this says about me."
1225,Addicted to mania,"I'm currently in a manic episode, the manic spells trigger god like dulisons (fairly common for me) which  exemplifies my NPD, and triggers my psychosis on occasion. (A perfect mix if you ask me lmao) one of my friends is worred and its affected my job. At its peak i was awake for 2 days full of energy and even had a hookup. I find myself purposely triggering myself to put me in a god like state just because how euphoric I feel. I've delt with substance abuse and its a lot like that but instead of drugs I am addicted to this manic state. Any advice?"
1226,"When asked about my issues, my mind goes blank","One thing I really hate my about my traits, is whenever I am asked about my issues. My mind always goes blank, I sit there for thirty secs looking dumb in front of my doctor, psychiatrist and anyone else. A few issues come out, but what I had planned to say and written it down in notes app. I never give the full picture of my issue. I’m always getting told it’s depression and take these pills that didn’t help the first time. Oh because of your transition it’s the depression that caused. I don’t think you get an inflamed knee pain or ruq abdominal pain from depression. My psychiatrist won’t even sit down with me for an hour and talk about my issues. It’s always “how are you feeling on these medications and rate your mood anxiety and sleep” I had told him a couple visits ago that I felt really suicidal over the weekend, and his response to that was “are you suicidal now” I said no because because what I had planned was thrown out the door because of the snow, and I had gotten a severe headache. I’m barely getting by at work, I’m heavily stressed out. I work alone the whole night. The coworkers which only see me when I finish up some nights have the shittest attitude in the morning. Even gets pissed off when I’m slow some nights which their actions cause my anxiety to rise, and I try to get out ASAP. Some also have made fun of me for what ever reasons, one new coworker that has been nice to me has said a group of these guys were saying stuff negatively about me. He told me this because of his experience with his step child and other people treating the kid bad. I just kept putting these things aside like they don’t bother me and I do nothing about them. But then something happens again and I’m in a downward spiral. I keep saying I’m going to report these coworkers but I pussy up and do nothing. 

Rant over"
1227,I should be happy but I'm not,"Hello 3 almost 4 months ago I(22m) got out of a bad relationship that lasted 5 years it was a bad breakup and I lost everything she took my emotional support dog and the apartment I paid for for over 4 years(It was in her parents name). I attempted suicide and failed i spent 7 days at a behavioral health hospital. I got out and immediately started distracting myself I changed everything about myself, I've now lost 43 pounds in almost 4 months I'm healthier and I'm getting my life back on track. I sold everything i owned and moved in with some family 5 states away to Indiana. I love it here, i love the weather, the people and my family out here. I met a girl and recently started dating and she makes me super happy and I'm definitely falling in love, but i always get in these moods it'll hit randomly. I can be happy for a straight week laughing smiling having a good time then one day itll just hit me and I ask myself if it was all real emotion or just me distracting myself once again."

(A perfect mix if you ask me lmao) one of my friends is worred and its affected my job. At its peak i was awake for 2 days full of energy and even had a hookup. I find myself purposely triggering myself to put me in a god like state just because how euphoric I feel. I've delt with substance abuse and its a lot like that but instead of drugs I am addicted to this manic state. Any advice?"
1229,i just don’t want to be here anymore,i don’t know why i’m so lonely. i get so sad for being lonely. i think about why i’m even here. i’m not suicidal. i just don’t want to be here. nobody talks to me. nobody cares about me. my family sees my scars and yet they don’t talk to me about it. why am i even here? for what purpose? to feel like garbage? to feel this loneliness? why can’t i keep friends. i wish i was someone different. i don’t want to be here. i am tired of living this life. i wish i was not here. i wish i never existed.
1230,I’m so lonely :/,My best friend moved to another state and is now pregnant and living her adult life and I’m... here. Alone. It feels so bad. I have so many things saved on YouTube and Netflix and in my storage at home because I thought I could show them to her or somebody at least and now it seems that I’m just hoarding. I just miss her company. I miss being able to find solace in my solitude too. I haven’t been able to find another best friend or somebody that I’ve clicked with because I don’t know how to socialize really. :-(
1231,Small vent &lt;33,She doesn’t even say goodnight to me anymore.
1232,My state of mind,"Age 18
Country: USA

First of all I want to say I am very thankful for the things I have right now in life a house and two parents and a stable life with a job and going to college I think its stable idk. But I've been feeling this since the beginning of high-school now I'm a freshman in college. I argue with my parents alot, I always see my friends on social media posting pics of them and their parents like happy birthday dad or with my mom shopping. I don't feel this way towards my parents and it hurts me the same, I love them but feel like that's not love feels like an obligation. In my friend group we usually discuss about problems in our lives and we usually give and take advice, most of them take my advice, but when I need help I don't feel that they wanna help. I always ask myself is there even a point to life? I have had thoughts of suicide, but never wanted to suicide beliveing it will be painful for me. I'm lost but I know what I what to do in life but just don't want to. The best way I can describe it is this, there are multiple walls in front of me each wa represents a problem , I know I can overcome them smashing through them but currently I just don't want to and sit down beside the wall. Right now I feel the I have no time or it might be time mismanagement, but time is going to fast for me and I just want a break when the world stops. Idk anymore any advice?"
1233,"Since covid, I’ve really been trying to improve on myself, but some days are just really hard.","Since March, quarantine, and everything I have done my best to try and help myself not spiral, but some days are easier than others. I’ve been using an exercise bike, got in better meds for anxiety, drinking a lot more water, going to long overdue doctors appointments, and trying to fix my mental and physical health. Any tips to stay motivated and continue this journey of positivity?"
1234,How to stop having depressive thoughts around the person you like?,"My situation is a little bit unusual. I've been working on a job where my boss is the brother of the girl I like. Since I go to my boss's house to work, I have to see the girl I like everyday. Even though I'm slowly getting over my anxiety and depression, I still have the habit to think negative things.
See, I'm kind of a goofy guy, I like fooling around and make people laugh, but everytime I'm around this girl I just act serious, I don't feel like myself because I tend to think things like ""She probably doesn't like you"" or ""I guess my love life is finished"" and stuff like that. It really sucks because it's evident that I'm not acting like my usual self and people from there ask me if I'm okay and stuff.

I've never had a girlfriend so I guess I'm in a needy state right now and it happens a lot when I start liking a girl.
I have bee crying over this fact, I swear I'm working on myself, eating healthily, weight lifting, reading, attending college and working. All of these things have definitely helped me feel 200% better than I did before, but it just seems that I can't handle rejection. I wish I would love myself more, I wish I knew how to flirt more, I wish I was more stable in that aspect :(

Can somebody tell me? Are my feelings legit? Have someone go through this? How can I overcome this? Should I just start talking to whatever girl is in front of me?
I tend to believe that I don't need to be in a relationship, that I don't need it to be happy, but I know that deep down I still believe that is not true."
1235,"Are mental health problems, like panic attacks and anxiety common?","Hey guys,

Been struggling with on and off panic attacks. There was a time where I was tense all the time and I'd have one everyday, but now it's like maybe once a week or longer. Idk. I try not to think about it anymore. I always feel like I'm insane because I panic about nothing. I mean it's kind of funny (not rly but i say this to try to calm down). Just wondering if mental health problems like anxiety and panic attacks are common? I don't feel comfortable letting people know that I'm having panic attacks because they just make it worse, so I let it pass by myself especially in social situations, but it's always hard. I've tried opening up to my mom and family members, but it's always ""what are you scared about?"" or ""What's making you stressed?"" (Why don't the older generations understand?) I don't have an answer and I don't know anyone outside of my family who understands aside from my brother. I'm in college and I hear a lot of people joking about mental breakdowns and being stressed, but I've never been able to grasp if they were serious or not because nowadays, people laugh and cry at the same time while talking about sensitive topics. Anyway, I feel a sense of comfort knowing that there's a community like this out here. But yeah I guess the question is: do more people suffer from mental illness than we're aware of? (ik that physical appearance and even how they come across don't say anything about mental wellbeing) But I just want to know if it's okay that I'm like this ( I just feel very alone in my situation at home). Thank you all and wishing you all the best in your lives."
1236,I think I need help and maybe medication.,"I decided to write down my symptoms tonight to get a grasp that I might need to see a therapist and who can prescribe me something.

1237,Message for the guys of the group,"If a mental health pod cast was offered, of just guys talking through things that have messed them up. Relationships, mental health, family issues that type of stuff would you gentlemen listen? 

Make (22) - with mental health being a taboo thing for men to talk about I was curious if people would listen. It’s a thought me and my guys friends have had and wanted to test the waters. 

Any input would be great! 

By no means are we certified therapists or mental health professionals. Just trying to break that stigma of mental health and men."
1238,"Mental health aids, what do you guys use?","So other than the usual seeing my therapist, meditation apps and working out which seem to be the greatest help with my anxiety, what other things have you guys used that can help get you through tough times. Even a little bit? Has anyone tried the weighted blankets? I started cross stitching when the pandemic struck and that also was a game changer? Journalling? Anything you've used that helps get through it all?"
1239,I've (15m) already tied a noose and the only thing stoping me from ending it all is my cowardice,Im just a massive failure im failing almost all of my classes I hate myself my siblings took it as a joke when I was laying there in my bed crying saying i have wanted to kill myself for the past few months. I have no purpose at all. I've tried to be nice and compassionate to everyone and just internalize my pain but I don't think I can do it anymore this may be my last post ever.
1240,Hell's Bells,"I slept this evening...now I can't sleep. Got fire on the brain (nothing new there so whatevs) and excited that eldest daughter is coming for a week for T-Giving next Wednesday! I'm happy but I know it will hard to say goodbye again so...a bit of melancholy already?

I'm rambling. I can't sleep. It is 20 min after midnight here and things just keep circling in my mind...keeping me awake.

Fuck. I also have an ulcer (suspected) so the burning is keeping me awake too. I want to self harm (WHY???) and I'm resisting that urge for now.

Goodnight I guess."
1241,I have no idea what's going on,"Before I begin, I want to say sorry for the title, I just don't know how else to say it. Also want to say sorry for using a throwaway.  


Yesterday, I got called a slur for the first time. It didn't mean to much to me, or at least I thought. It was just some random jerk on the internet, and I was already braced for it. Ever since then, I've felt really bad. I've felt like I'm not enough for my girlfriend, and I've barely felt like talking to people. I can barely even put this into words.  


I've been diagnosed with anxiety, maybe it has something to do with that? I really don't know. Sorry if this is the wrong flair."
1242,Confession,Idk .why I did.i did with cigartt 20 and more and alchohol 6 to 7 times.and whole 3 to 4 years with tabacco.i goes upside our letout to talk to upside woman.but she didn't talk to me correctly.once she did that infront of me .It hurt more to me.after that I made something children go behind her do it to her  in imagination. goes crazy about it...i know I f I felt something always and I can't cool on anytime without tabacco.if I not take tabbacco I feel I depressed. once I made in mind that good thing happen.once I heard Krishna's mother screaming .I feel and said myself 'it m#st happen ' after that I heard neighbour (left side house) voice that 'i could not tolerat' I felt very bad . After that those voice told me this is not illness.and untill today I hearing.till now I suffering.
1243,"Didn’t get into a program at my school, I feel like my world came crashing down tonight","I know it probably seems stupid and I don’t know if this is the right place to rant, but I just feel like a failure. I didn’t get into a program at my university, and I’ve worked for years and even chose the school because of this program. The reason I’m going to college in the first place is because I want a job in this field more than anything else in the world. It’s been my life’s goal for about 6 years now. It was an interview that I didn’t pass, all the feedback was interview related and I don’t know when or how I’ll be able to improve on those. I’m still going to try again, but it really makes me feel like I don’t have hope of getting in. It’s not even that competitive of a program, most people get in! I just feel crushed right now, like all my aspirations in life have just yeeted out the window. Add that to the burnout I’ve been feeling and the lack of motivation I’ve been feeling for almost anything this semester that’s causing me to have to withdraw from a class to save my GPA, it’s been a rough day. Feels like I’m failing at life right now. I can’t facepalm hard enough at myself."
1244,Feeling extremely lonely and sad (I’m not good with titles),"This is a long post so sorry but I need to get some sort of help. I’m 19 and I’m doing college online.  For the past few months (maybe 5 ish) I’ve been feeling like I’m alone.  This I’d weird since i have a big friend group.  However this group uses me as a “punching bag” and a “therapist”.  Basically I get shit talked a lot and at the end it every joke.  I also am the person everyone goes to with their problems.  Even though when I ask for help they never respond.  They also hang out a lot without me and it makes me feel like im not really their friends since they usually don’t want me around.  One of my friends (who actually tries to help but I have trust issues) said that they don’t understand why I don’t stand up for my self.  And I said since that would possibly have the out come with no friends cuz I wouldn’t be their punching bag and therapist anymore.  And I need my friends.  Since I get really scared around new ppl.  And I over think every detail with social interaction.  

I over think everything it I’m being honest.  Sometimes I make up scenarios that just make me scared.  And I don’t know why I do that.  I also can’t make a decision.  

Also I feel alone at home from my family since I distance my self as much as possible from then.  But still maintaining a good relationship.  I do this since they say a lot of homophobic things that make me scared to be home sometimes.  (I’m bi btw) I’m sacred to ask my parents for help since they would just say that I’m fine there’s no reason to feel the way I do if I have a stable home, college life and friends. 

With school I have zero motivation and o do my work.  My grades really suck tbh. And my parents always say to do better but I just can’t bring myself to do the work.  I don’t even wanna be in college but my parents r making me. 

Overall I just feel alone but I have people to talk to.  Yes I don’t trust them or have the best relationship but they r there.  I just feel like I’m unwanted where ever I go.  
 

Sorry this long"
1245,Is it psychosis or schizophrenia or something else?,"I have ocd, depression, intrusive thoughts and a voice in my head that insults me every day. Sometimes it speaks to me or threatens me. It sounds like me or similar but i cant really control it. Sometimes i have scary Images in my mind for example jumpscares or random stuff. When i started brushing it off and was like ""whatever, its getting old"" i saw Images of the alien from alien vs predator looking at me from close distance and i got compulsions in my mind because i was so scared(pure ocd?) and i became really careful what i think of the voice entity because i dont want to make it angry so this doesnt happen again. I still see it sometimes.(even as im typing this, the voice says ""be careful, or else.."". 

When im eating my thoughts will say eww it tastes horrible and stuff even though it tastes good. Its like my mind is a separate entity that wants to bully me and i cant do anything about it. When it started, the voice would just whisper my Name sometimes and i couldnt stop music playing in my mind, and i had an almost constant intense feeling of fear for like 2 weeks straight. When i woke up after the First day of it all happening, i was not sure if it was real or a nightmare i had, but then it started happening again shortly after and i knew that things wouldnt be the same from now on. I had some weird things happening for example my thoughts would Sound like when i would speak without using my tongue and it sometimes is still happening except when i move my tongue a little like i would say the words except i think them then. I also sometimes cant think, like my thoughts would just not do anything when i try to think except when i move my tongue like i would say the words. Theres was more happening but i cant really remember it all right now. 

I love life but sometimes i get dark thoughts and just want this to stop and i get really sad and cry and sometimes i enjoy the feeling of being mentaly ill. English isnt my native language, sry if its not so clear, some things arent easy to explain for me.

I had an appointment for neurology because of my ocd but i was toi scared and didnt go. Im scared of going to a Doctor for this stuff, im not in therapy or anything like that.

I know i need to go to a doc for a diagnosis, im just looking for thoughts on this."
1246,Psychologic Therapies | How Do They Help You?,"Before you take the decision to visit a psychologist for help, it is very important that you know the different types of therapies that they’re utilizing. There are some therapies that are more appropriate for you than others. [Psychological therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) has 3 major categories –

**1.** **Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies**

These therapies concentrate majorly on your thinking or behavioral processes. It places emphasis on the fact that there's a possibility to change your behavior as well as your thinking process in order to help you overcome a particular problem.

· **Behavioral** – This therapy has its emphasis on your phobia and addiction, and it assumes that behaviors can be learned or unlearned with time.

· **Cognitive** \- This therapy deals with your various thoughts and perceptions and how they affect your behavior. Here, it is assumed that if you reassess your negative thoughts, you can become more flexible about thinking more positively.

· **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** – [Behavioral therapy for children](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) and kids is useful in dealing with the issues of various phobias, depression as well as anxiety.

**2.** **Psychoanalytical and Psychodynamic Therapies**

These therapies focus majorly on a person's unconsciousness, which often develop way back in their childhood days. They determine their reaction to all different kinds of emotions. It is believed that these unconscious emotions have a major role to play when it comes to taking major life decisions.

· **Psychoanalysis** – This therapy focuses majorly on the individual's unconsciousness that was believed to have developed during their childhood. These are the masked emotions that always have a major impact on your behavior in the present situations.

· **Psychoanalytic Therapy** – This therapy has its eyes on an individual's unconsciousness but it is a less intensive approach than the psychoanalysis.

· **Psychodynamic Therapy** – This therapy deals with the immediate needs of the client and the effective ways to solve them as soon as possible.

**3.** **Humanistic Therapies**

Every [therapist for teens Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) offers humanistic therapies that concentrates more on self-development, growth and the versatile responsibilities of the individuals.

· **Gestalt Therapy** \- This therapy has its major focus on the individual as a whole, and it deals with the slighted thoughts that come up in a person’s mind. It also deals with the various human emotions and multiple experiences with an intention to promote self-awareness of the client.

· **Person-Centered Counseling** \- This therapy is ideal for individual counselling. It is the most common choice for the people who are looking for medical advice, and it aims at concentrating on the thoughts and experiences of the person without judging them for who and what they are or what they have done. Person-centered counselling focuses on reconnecting an individual to his own self.

Thus, there are a number of therapies that are ideal according to the clients’ requirements. There is nothing wrong in seeking therapy. It provides effective guidance to you in regaining your emotional and mental health. Sign up for mental assistance and feel proud about it. It’s not the depression that brings you down; it’s the lack of will to seek help that brings your growth to a pause."
1247,I dont feel anymore,"I dont have any strong feeling to do anything good or bad and it sucks. I’ve been like this for the past like 5 months and I dont understand what it is, if i’m burying my emotions, or im just not depressed anymore, if im just a husk of a person now. Theres no way to tell, its just like a switch was flipped and everything is gray and monotone now. Ive felt like this before but it was always accompanied by despair, but now its just nothing. I cant do anything to get out of it, I dont know what to do to get out of it. Sorry if i’m rambling. 

I can still recognize some emotions that im feeling but they seem so incredibly dulled its like my regular mind is still alive and functioning but im just seeing it through a thick wall of fog. I can recognize that this apathy makes me hate myself, but its whatever. I cant describe it well and it fucking sucks. I hate this more than being suicidal. At least when I was an emotional wreck I had spirit. I was alive and had the energy and pain to HATE but now im completely one dimensional. The more I think about it the more disgusted in myself I get but the feeling has no gravity toward me anyway. I feel like a lazy bum. Im perfectly fine with cruising through life doing absolutely nothing now. I feel like an entitled piece of shit. Each day isnt a fight for survival anymore. I dont feel pain and suffering for waking up and being alive, just indifference. 

Is my spirit gone forever? Once its broken can you ever get it back? I think this is what its like for depression to win. To actually lose, and become a pathetic loser succumbing to nothing but shallow pleasure and the safety of doing nothing"
1248,I tried to off myself yesterday,"I tried to choke myself with a scarf yesterday and I was thinking about hanging myself but I didn't. My neck still hurts a bit but it's okay I guess. I was feeling worthless and hopeless, I just wanted all the pain to end. 

I was feeling very numb after trying to do that but now as I'm processing what I did, I feel terrified. I just felt like nobody would care if I did this. I feel like I'm going to be a faliure anyway, what is the point of trying? I feel too weak for this world."
1249,Constant state of anger and irritation- Is it PTSD?,"I have had a rough couple of months. Had a bad physical health episode, to the point where physical pain was interrupting with ability to do daily tasks. Reached out to a couple of friends, one of whom i considered to be one of my best friends, but both blew me off. 

One of them came over to visit me, assured me that they'd stick around for a couple of days (please note that I only said a couple of days, nothing more than that) and help me out. But the very next day, they said that they had to pick up some stuff from their apartment and left. After a couple of hours, this ""friend"" texted me to say that they couldnt help me out JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS after all. This left me traumatised since it took me back to another such event about 7ish years ago, when i was completely blindsided by the actions of another close friend. The bullshit move of making me feel safe and then pulling the rug from under my feet, especially when i am physically sick and unable to even get out of bed on some days, left me traumatised. 

On top of that, my parents who live in a small town with no access to proper Covid care fell sick, and my father tested positive for Covid. So neither could I go to them (impossible for me to get out of the door, let alone do a 4-hour flight + a 4-hr cab ride home) nor could they come to me. So i literally had nobody. Those few months were definitely the darkest times in my life so far.

I have since recovered, kind neighbours offered to cook food for me and help me with my laundry (i will be forever indebted to these people). My parents are also doing better. Life is definitely better now. 

However, i keep feeling this sense of anger and irritation almost constantly. I keep thinking of all the things i want to say to these ""friends"" (both of whom i have completely cut off from my life without confronting them in any way whatsoever). 

I keep having nightmares where i end up screaming or whimpering, as my bf has observed (short note: during my medical ordeal, he was himself on an extended sick leave back home in another state. I know! Too many things went wrong in a very short span of time). 

I only want to be alone and smoke up. I am tired even after a full night's sleep because i keep having one nightmare after another in a row. And then i wake up angry. 

Due to recent medical expenses, i currently cant afford to speak to a therapist (but i know a good one and will schedule a session next month, soon as i get my salary). In the meantime, i would be grateful if someone could help me understand my mental and emotional state. Is this PTSD? Is this just the pandemic taking its toll? What can i do to help myself? I already keep a ""Grief Journal"" where i write to vent when I'm feeling overwhelmed. What else can I do?"
1250,What has been your experience regarding exercise and mental health?,"The good, the bad and the ugly everything is welcome."
1251,Otherness,"    I am sick of feeling different. People treat me like I am some weird thing that lives by a different reality. I’m carted out by peers like a court jester who’s only joke is existing and not knowing what the joke is or that he’s even a court jester until people are laughing at something he’s done.
     I’m ADHD/bipolar II. I go to work and school and I shower regularly and get my things done and I talk my friends and have a loving relationship. I’m both well-adjusted and maladjusted. 
     There is something about me that makes my peers think I’m an other. They refer to things that I do as “my name” things and compare them to thing I might do. But I don’t think of things I do as abnormal. I enjoy birding and hikes and chemistry and geology. I tend to hyper focus and get excited but I am passionate about my things. I’m not typically masculine but I enjoy hunting and fishing and driving my truck and I do show feminine interests like baking and cooking and babysitting. And I think I don’t fit in anywhere and it takes a toll on my mental health. This constant otherness makes me anxious and untrusting. Are they interested in me as a person, or are they interested in the idea that is me that is so enigmatic that I people need to be warned about me before they meet me. I hate it. I’ve been told to my face by my best friend that I’m an enigma. Like I’m supposed to take that as a compliment. 
Rant over. I just want to be normal."
1252,"i can’t leave my sisters, they need me.","i really want to die, yes, but the screaming and crying that my little sister did when she found our dog dead (and bleeding a lot, he was killed) lives in my head forever. i can’t imagine how she’ll react if she finds me."
1253,my fear of sarcastic people makes me overthink in a conversation.,I even get aggressive sometimes to people who want me good or are just neutral.
1254,Addicted to Conflict... Even though I know its not healthy?,"Since I've become an adult (23 now), I have noticed that I run towards conflict. And that I am addicted to power in a way. 

Not like I am evil necessarily, I have fought for and achieved some really great things. But the adoration and conflict that comes along with those is something I like a lot. At the same time, it is killing me. 

My fight or flight response goes crazy, I can't sleep. I obsess over ""winning."" 

I know it comes from a beyond broken childhood, had a severely disabled sibling who was a constant stressor. Parents tried to manage but couldn't. There was no love, always fighting, me and my brothers needs were totally ignored and even emotionally abused (we were laughed off when we asked for counseling). I wasn't really allowed to have friends because my parents used me as a 3rd parent. 

I have been depressed and anxious since I was like 12 or 13 nonstop (probably before then). While my physical health has changed drastically, I feel like going from overweight to fit and attractive made me even more unhealthy mentally because I can now just weaponize those traits to feed my addiction. 

I think my mind is addicted to the negativity. Like negative attention is better than no attention especially if it is towards a good cause. But I struggle to form interpersonal relationships because I just dont care. Even though ik I need them. 

Ik I definitely need therapy, but I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. Or has any advice on the psychology of whats happened to me?"
1255,I know I'm not the only one dealing with this,"So I got let go from my last job about a week and a half before everything went into lockdown, back in February. Between applying for disability (another long story) and what I can only call really bad luck, I've not found another job since.

My landlord knows all this. He knows about my mental health. He knows I bend over backwards to make sure everything is okay and bills are covered. And he still pushed me so hard for missed rent that I broke down sobbing in front of the man, having a full-on panic attack. And when I told him that that's what was happening? ""Nothing's happening, you're fine.""

Obviously there's a lot more to this, but I'm quite frankly seeing myself needing to move somewhere else before the end of the year. My inner cynic and past experience is screaming how if I don't I'll be homeless. And I'm trying to figure everything out, and I'm slowly making progress. But I also keep feeling like my hands are tied the more I look into things and I just wish my landlord would be more understanding."
1256,Family on the rocks,"Family on the rocks

I need help Iv had issues with my anger my whole life and it’s gotten so bad it’s to the point it’s put my relationship with my wife in jeopardy I get mad during the simplest of conversations and I just feel myself losing control and it’s like I can’t help it. When we are having an argument I can feel it building even though there is no reason for the anger to be there, and it gets so bad to the point I lose track of what I’m saying  and then I get frustrated trying to find the words to say and it compounds it even more to the point I just have to throw something or hit a wall or something and I’m so terrified of losing my family because I can’t control it. Please what should I do?"
1257,"I feel bad for dumb things, is that bad?","I often find myself in tears because of how something turned out for someone, or because so-and-so deserves better, or because of a bad time they had years ago but I'm just now learning of. I feel bad about how I can't spend as much time as I'd like with family. I feel bad because of everything. I will even start to feel bad for feeling bad about things I shouldn't feel bad about. Not every moment, but certainly every day on and off. I know this sounds stupid but I wanted to see if yall think I should do anything about this or nothing or what idk it's taking a toll on me :/"
1258,"Hello, my family is going through something we’ve never experienced and don’t know what to call it? Sex addiction? Alpha male addiction? Sexual control freak?","So a family member needs help, today a couple of my female family members came out and spoke up about another male family member who we will call Don. Don is 22. The first incident was about 3 weeks ago, Don was at a family members house and nobody was home besides Don and His 65 year old aunt. At the dinner table don reached his foot and touched auntie in places he shouldn’t. Auntie said no and brushed it off. She said she was going to shower, hoping he’d leave. Auntie came out and don insisted to massage her, don proceded to massage her and touch, and grope her. Auntie made him stop and leave. She hasn’t said anything about it till today, The second incident was last week, same scenario just this time it’s not auntie, it’s another cousin who is about 26. He kept flirting and saying “nice shorts, leggings” and then proceeded to thrust himself on her behind. She has not said anything till today also. The 3rd incident was last night. He asked to watch a movie over another cousins house and kept touching her private parts and while doing so he kept trying to persuade her to do more things.


Who knows how many other times he’s done this to other people, this is just family and it’s sick! The reason we’re finding about this now is because all the victims were not aware of the other incidents and are now just coming out about it. Lasts night incident sparked a family meeting. During the incident he claims it’s a sex addiction, but showered to remorse or sympathy. He just wanted out of the hot seat asap. 

Don and I grew up together, we were close throughout elementary as we got older her went off and did his own thing. My family is very close so we don’t think much about it when we all hang out or come together to chill, but he’s crossed the line. He has this obsession of wanting to feel alpha over people, he believes if he stares into girls eyes and they look they want him.  The need to feel empowered. He’s not a bad guy, i think he’s in his own world and believes everything in his head. He sent weird like that, he sends my brother conspiracy theory’s.

The reason i come here is to ask, what could this be? Is this a sex addiction? Mentally ill?"
1259,Need advice with situation with my ex husband,"Hi all. I hope everyone is doing well. I need some serious help opinions in how to approach the situation I am in with my ex husband. He has complicated MH issues including depression, anxiety suspected asperges and suspected personality disorder(This is what his phsychiatrist told me). We are still living together under the same roof. He was meant to move out already but pandemic hit and well we've had to continue living together for longer than expected due to him losing his job and me having some physical career needs he is helping me with.

I want to have a strong family dynamic still as we virtually grew up together and I want stability for our child he is a good father etc.

Anyways previously our relationship has been rocky throughout and I am not handling how he is behaving right now. Last year it was rage screaming punching things and losing all control for trivial things. He went over a huge boundary which is the straw that broke the camels back and I could no longer be with him. Throughout the most of our relationship he has refused help and no matter what way its brought up it usually evicts an extreme breakdown type reaction and at times in the past scary reaction from him.


Well end of last year and through to this year he went back to therapy but stopped going as his therapist said he just needs to do some yoga and take some time for himself. I almost lost my mind hearing and asked him a bunch of questions about what he talks to her with and inportant points and behaviours he needs to address. I would never pry but knowing his history and therapist coming to that conclusion I did ask. One of the main things was If he told the therapist that he rage screams and punches the wall right next to his wifes head (now previous wife) and he said no it never came up. He has a history of not telling his therapists the truth and isn't interested in medication. 

Long story short I can no longer watch this man implode on himself. I am losing my mind from him and his behaviour. He is sitting around the house defeated shaking on and off and walking around like his losing his mind. We arent together but have a friendship/family situation going on and even during this period I have done nothing but try to support and help him. Telling him I am here for him, what does he need, does he want to be held, left alone, talk whatever he needs. 

I just can't handle him anymore it is making me feel sick. I have asked for some space as feel suffocated and he is now badgering me to ask what is wrong. Did I do something to upset you? I give him extraspace all the time as he asks for it(living under same roof etc)

I don't know how to approach or answer as If I tell him the truth it could trigger a massive episode and well I can't trigger that now as feel all hell will break lose. I suppose I don't want to sound insensitive but I have my limits and feel like they have been reached and need to think about myself and my child now and am having trouble being around him as my own health is suffering for it. 

I suppose I am looking for advice on how to approach this situation from people who might understand on his side and more of his behaviour illness. I don't know what to say to him without making things worse ie triggering a big episode or crisis situation. I do care for him deeply and care for his wellbeing but reaching my limits

Please be kind, thank you"
1260,How do I ask my parents to get tested for something?,"So, I have thought and put off talking to my parents about this for so long now. I feel like there is something very wrong with me this year, and I have wanted to go get checked for a mental illness for a while now. I don't know how to ask my parents and I have put it off alot. Recently everything's gotten worse and my friends have started noticing and I need to do something quick.

Help?"
1261,Bit better.,"Soo last night I had it rough, was contemplating to end my life.. instead just slept through the night, woke up with suicidal thoughts as usual, then BTS released their new album, I was skeptical, because even though I'm a fan for the past few months it never helped me or due to my depression I felt uninterested. Either way I listened to their new album and saw the MV, I realized even though they are so famous and hyped up for idiotic reasons, they spoke about depression and how they had a hard time during this pandemic, it made me feel less alone.. I just stumbled upon some videos of a japanese, I'm a huge weeb, so in the past I used to really get addicted to anything japanese and it soothed me a lot, I lost contact of it from several months, but I finally saw a few today, and it made my heart warm, idk how long this will last, I'm pretty sure I'll just go back to my old self of being depressed because of my overthinking.. but I think every little effort counts and tiny happy moments are nice. :)"

1263,Panic attacks,"I remember trying to go to sleep one night. Then it got hard for me to breathe, I started to panic. I tried to sleep but I was so panicked and scared. I got up, tears starting to drip from my eyes. I picked up one of my sisters soft toys and hugged it tight. I walked out to the landing, and started pacing, debating whether or not to tell my dad what was happening. I went downstairs to tell him. He awoke from his slumber on the couch with a jump. He whipped his head to face me and his expression was one of annoyance and anger. I run back upstairs before I could get yelled at. I sat on the landing for about half an hour after that, crying and holding my sisters stuffed animal. I eventually went back to my bed, a and cried myself to sleep"
1264,How to Overcome My Anxiety Disorder ?,Having anxiety problem from last six months. Please help me out how I can overcome from this problem.
1265,I feel like I'm in the wrong time due to anxiety/depression (Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit),"Hey, I'm sorry if I post this in the wrong subreddit (kind of new to the whole Reddit thing), but ever since I was 7 or 8, I've been feeling like I was in the wrong year. For example, I go to certain places or hear certain songs and it makes me feel like I'm in 1993 or 1994, years I weren't even born in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it sounds stupid, I'm sorry, but ever since I've had my anxiety and depression, its been worse. I look out my back window and see a red light which makes me feel like its 1987, and I don't understand why. My music also has made me feel even more in-depth with it due to the issues I mentioned, and I'm lost."
1266,wtf is up with reality,"if you really pay attention you'll see that there is something really wrong with reality, things are not right, they're not working like they're suposed to and everything feels made up. I have this weird feeling that i am not here right now, in i am not real, or what i see it's not real, i keep telling myself ""huh, i am not actually here, i'll close my eyes and wake up in a completely different place"". Just hear me out, isn't it surreal????? everything??????? Just tonight i was talking to my mom and then she left the room and i had this weird feeling that she is a stranger, who is this woman??? i know she is my mom but for a moment there she looked weird????? like i was just talking with someone i just met? reality is fucking broken ya'll. and sometimes i look into the mirror and the person i see there it's not me, just looks like m, she's evil and my bestfriend thinks she wants to replace me and send me to mirror word, this is just a theory we have. I know i sound like a crazy person rn, but i am not, i am completely aware of myself and probably just need therapy."
1267,Failure,"I haven’t cut in a few months, I never really thought of it as something that’s hard to quit and I just did it on and off when I felt the need to. I ended up self harming tonight after an intense fight with my boyfriend after not talking to him for the past two days because i needed space. I’ve only been getting 3-4 hours of sleep at night because i haven’t been able to sleep and I feel immensely guilty constantly of being a bad daughter after my mother told me i was over the phone about a month ago. She is a drug addict and I haven’t lived with her for a few years after she moved away. I don’t feel satisfied this time like I usually do after cutting, I don’t feel anything. I plan to pull an all-nighter and just suffer more, I want to suffer I can’t explain it I just deserve it. I feel horrible, the lowest I have felt in so long. I thought i was getting better after having space for the past couple of days. I’m a very emotional person and haven’t been able to express any emotions in forever since I have been hiding them from my boyfriend. I just feel so lost and stuck and miserable. I’m half awake right now and it feels like i’m drunk due to the sleep deprivation. I just wanted to fall into his lap and cry but I can’t, it’s long distance after he moved away a few months ago and he can’t even handle my emotions over text. After reading this i realize how insane i sound but it’s true, every word is true even if it’s not grammatically correct i’m just so exhausted emotionally and I don’t even feel real i’m so tired from having no sleep. I’m so lost inside."
1268,I feel bad that I can't feel bad for my friends.,"I'm sick and tired of not actually feeling bad for families and friends. Whenever my friends go through some really tough times, I just can't get sympathetic for them, and it's not that I don't care because I love my friends dearly and I want to be there for them when they feel bad. But I think a lot of time I really force these feelings because I can't bring myself to actually feel bad for them. I don't know if it's because I was raised with a more matter-of-fact approach to dark things. My first cat died when I was really young and I guess since we knew we couldn't do anything for his condition it was inevitable. Despite that, I cried, it was the first time I had experienced death. The only other time I've cried over a death was another cat that I had that passed away about 3 years ago. The only funerals that I've attended were for my friend's dad and my great aunt's. Although I was close with my aunt, I never really felt too bad, I describe myself as ""bummed"" at best. And I feel terrible for the way I approach these situations but I just don't feel upset over these things. One of my friends had tried to commit suicide months ago and although I cried, which was mainly out of confusion, I got over most of it within 2 days and just checked up on my friend but I hadn't really acted as if I was just about to lose a very close friend. I think that because of that, I don't really have the right words to say to friends because a lot of people use me as a way to vent and for me to consul them, but I feel like most of my reactions and what I say is forced, and I feel terrible. I've had some family that have been diagnosed with cancer despite that, I don't feel very upset about these announcements. 

I did, however, realize that whenever I see animals die, unless it's a natural death (I watch a lot of nature documentaries) I get extremely emotional and cry almost every time I see it happen. There are other times where I'll just be watching a cute animal video, nothing wrong, no sad backstory, and I get really emotional, never cried over these but I feel like I'm about to. The only people that has died that I cried over were Steve Irwin and an animator, Edd Gould (created the web series Eddsworld). So, I know I have more of a connection with animals, but I still don't know what it means and why I can't feel bad for friends and family. 

 I realized that I feel bad for fictional characters more than real people too, maybe this is because I'm experiencing their life, instead of just being told things, but that also makes me feel bad. I get emotionally connected to characters quickly so it doesn't take long for me to get sad when things happen to characters. I've only cried to one fictional character but, interestingly enough, it was a very realistic scenario, easily could have been a real person, but again it was because I played through his life and experienced what he went through. 

Just as one last point, I've always been dark and really enjoy morbid things. I admit I laugh at things that would be really sensitive to some people, and I've listened to too many babies falling over and people getting hurt compilations that I can't even count.  I definitely don't think this helps but more morbid things are my normal and they don't phase me.

Is there a way I become sympathetic to my friends and family? This there something wrong with me, if so what is it? Or, if I can still be there for people (despite my lack of sympathy) does it really matter?"
1269,My boyfriend discredits how I feel a lot,"I have occasional panic attacks and intense mood swings and everytime I experience them, he seems to forget about what I told him. I've told him before that talking or yelling at me during a panic attack is a bad idea and that I would prefer him to stay away and quiet so I can calm down. When I have them, he instead usually gets annoyed and says to ""get over it."" It makes it worse in the moment but after calming down, he profusely apologizes and says that he just acts that way because he doesn't understand. One time he just hugged me and comforted me which worked but that was a rare ordeal. He loves me dearly I know that, it just is hard to deal with a cynical 17 year old with some really  immature tendencies. I love him a lot but it really hurts when he doesn't take my mental health issues seriously.  
I love him though."
1270,Online classes,"My teachers have this habit of calling students out randomly and making us answer. As much as I understand that they're doing it to see if we're paying attention, it is so anxiety inducing that I immediately leave class. I can't tell you how many times I've left class like this. I'm missing so many classes because they make me so anxious and I'm so worried about my attendance and the topics that I'm missing. At this point I don't even know how to deal with this"
1271,Should I cut my friend off for this?,"I am a teenager. I have had a very close friend (P) for 2-3 years. A while ago we were watching a movie and he leaned over to fix something with the projector, twice. Both times his full upper body was onto of me with his weight. This made me very uncomfortable. I later found out he had a crush on me during that time. I told my close friends about it (we are all mutual friends with this P) and they said that if I want, they will all cut him off (stop being friends with him.) I considered P one of my closest friends, we have a lot of history, that is the only time he has tried anything. I am close with his parents, our parents know each other, anything. 

He didnt r@pe me or anything. I feel like getting everyone to cut him off is an overreaction. I dont know whether I want to forgive him or not, it really made me not trust him and think of him as a bit creepy, but thats all he did. But we have so many mutual friends, I dont want everyone to know about the situation and I dont want \~15 people to cut him off over this. 

Is cutting him off an overreaction? please help ASAP."
1272,My parent's remarks,"Whenever I start crying or get upset or simply argue with my parents, the immediate responses are stabs at my mental health. They say things like ""oh she's getting weird again,"" ""oh are you going to cut yourself now?,"" ""do we need to take you back to the hospital,"" and other lines that kinda mock me. I understand that my incidents have caused them a lot of emotional turmoil but I would have hoped that after treatment, they would take me seriously and atleast give me some respect. I remember they were so kind right after I was discharged but that faded away within a few months. It almost felt like they were only trying to be understanding when they thought I would try commit suicide again. My parents are so kind to me and love me but they lack empathy sometimes-and god does that hurt. I feel like I may be asking too much, I bet they are so drained and tired from the last incident."
1273,Need some help,"I'm doing a school research project on mental health issues. Here are the list of questions i would like ask!
- I am also someone who is still going through some mental health crisis (depression and anxiety) but i never really seek help for it - so i would like to also understand what others are going through too.

So firstly, would like ask what is the biggest challenge you’re facing as someone who is currently or having gone through mental health issues (or  tough times)

When was the last time you tried to solve the problem? (such as seeking help)

What made you want to seek help? If no, 
Is there a reason or something preventing you from seeking help?

Are you able to tell a story about the last time that you had this problem?

Do you find the current treatments effective or not? Is it affordable or expensive?

Did your condition improve after seeking help? Why or why not?

If you did not seek help, how did you manage to overcome these challenges/issues? 

What do you think of the social stigma on mental health?"
1274,Citalopram - UK,"Hey all,

Random question, I got prescribed Citalopram last year, never really took it - maybe for a month or so then stopped. I've never believed I'm depressed or anxious (I think everyone has anxiety) I just think I'm a miserable sod by nature and don't enjoy things like others do, I think I ended up just making peace with 'who I am' and leaving it there.

  
Anyways, last night, I did feel alarmingly down even for me, to a point I noticed it and felt it - I found the Citalopram, for a brief moment (I am honestly okay!) I thought about taking them all - but only took one just before bed in the end and decided to sleep it off.

I've woken up now, and I feel horrendously sick, and bloated, haven't thrown up but just can't seem to handle the thought of eating this morning and feel like I kinda wanna make myself throw up, really really tired and feel quite hot - it could be covid in all fairness as I am isolating after contact with someone, but then again, this is day 9 of isolation now, and haven't felt unwell up until I did that.

Does it make you feel like this? Should I ring 111? Not sure what to do, part of me feels paranoid that I've done some damage by just stopping and starting with them, which I admit, was stupid.

  
Thanks!"
1275,No right to feel tired,"Recently I am tired all the time. I suffer from headaches and irritability. I cannot concentrate. There is a lot going on in my life now - I am in the middle of flat renovation and I need to live with my parents for a time being. In my job it is a middle of a hot season (I am IT trainer - I conduct online trainings for things like Excel or Teams) and I often stay at work between 9am to 9pm - usually I have Excel training in the morning (about 6h) and Teams in the evening (4h). I cannot work from home. Also, of course, pandemic closed everything down and I haven't seen my friends in a long time.

BUT.

I have a nagging feeling that I have no right to feel tired. My fiance and parents also work full time, I am healthy and young (30). Other people have it worse, they work long shifts, have kids etc. and don't feel exhausted. And that feeling makes me feel even worse.

I know it may not sound like a big issue, I just wanted to get this of my chest.

Thanks for listening."
1276,Heavily contemplating arson as a coping method,"I (14f) have a lot of mental issues. I am mentally and physically exhausted. I also have a weird obsession with fire. I love the smell, the sight, and the sound of things burning. Candles aren't an option as my mom is uncomfortable around them, plus they don't satisfy anything. Recently there was a fire around my area. So now I keep wondering, if i start a fire to the already burnt building, wait a few minutes, then call 911, it would be fine. No one would catch me. I can't keep burning q-tips in my bathroom. I don't wanna hurt anyone though. Is this normal? I know I'm young but I'm seriously thinking about it. I almost overdoesed by just wondering how far I could go. I know for a fact I can do it. I just need a reason not to."
1277,Where can I learn about Arabic Mental Health?,I really want to learn about the nature of mental health in the Arab world. Literally ANYTHING and EVERYTHING on the topic. Any suggestions for reading material or podcats/videos/courses etc. is greatly appreciated!
1278,"Does anyone recognize these symptoms ? I don't think its autism or aspergers, but something ..","I've met two people recently that have very similar symptoms.  The most prominent is that when they are talking, .. it's almost like they are talking to themselves even when they are talking to you, in a low kind of rambling run on sentences strung together, .. kind of joking with themselves while they're doing it as if it is entertaining to them, or maybe a better way is almost like they are going through scripts in their heads, .. but then also interjecting interaction with you in the middle of it and having a conversation.  Seem to be somewhat oblivious to some social cues, but definitely the primary symptom I see in both was this kind of rambling speech pattern where it was almost like they were talking under their breath to themselves, even though it was clearly loud and they weren't trying to hide it ... I just mean the content was almost like they were talking to themselves, not the loudness.

Anyway, both were friendly, and I didn't even think anything of it for the first one until I met a second person who had the same kind of behavior and then I was like .. .oh, okay, that must be a thing then, I wonder what it is ?  So here I am wondering what it is."
1279,I feel like I'm getting worse.,"This is my first post in here. It is currently 4:02am on a Friday morning. I didn't sleep until 6am yesterday, and I didn't wake up until around 5:30pm when my roommate got home to wake me up and feed me. I've hardly been eating and havent been sleeping well like I use too. I've always had issues with my mental health, but i felt like I was always in control. Now I feel like I'm losing control of myself and my mental health. I've been heavily spacing out as of late as well. I lost my last job due to how bad my mental health is, the more I try to push through it, the harder it gets. I feel exhausted after getting up to feed myself. I feel like a freeloading burden that doesn't deserve the kindness I've been getting. There are times where I try and yell myself that there's nothing wrong with me, that I'm just doing it all for show, and attention. I use to be able to deal with it so well, but i don't know how I lost control so suddenly. I sleep my life away and I can hardly be bothered to eat even a sandwich. I feel so weak, like I just want to give up. I don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't want to be like this. It is now 4:14am. Thank you for taking your time to read this."
1280,Please help!!!!! Everything feels so good and I hate myself for liking it,"I don't even know where to begin.

I met this guy online three weeks ago and we just started vibing, we've both been through a lot and we're kinda pushing through and all and it works. If I'm having an episode or a mental breakdown, he knows just the right words and I feel a lot better after a while. 
We haven't met in person but we kinda have a connection,  we send snaps and all and it really does feel alright

And I guess we're moving into a relationship and tbh I am so fucking scared, I hate myself for getting caught in this, after my last horrible relationship I promised myself never to have feelings for another man again... and here I am lowkey drooling over him. Ugh I hate myself so much for this. I don't want to hurt him in any way but I also don't want him to be a part of my life anymore, he's a sweetheart and he's been through a lot... if I push him away I'd hurt him and I don't want to in any way, at the same time I can't continue this. I like him a lot but I don't want to loose myself in the process, I can't take that ever again. 

He sees perfection, I see imperfection, he sees beauty I see self harm scars, he sees a future and I see nothing. 

I don't want to hurt him but I'm so fucking scared of the aftermath.

I'd rather be alone for a thousand years than to get hurt by another person.  I'm sorry, he really does deserve better"

1282,REM few minutes before falling asleep,"Hi

I noticed that last few weeks I experience REM just a few minutes before I fall asleep. Like few years ago I experienced hypnagogic hallucinations too but just for short period of time. And sometimes I have sleep paralysis. Should I be concerned about it? Can it be something like first symptoms of developing narcolepsy? Also I have untreated depressions and untreated anxiety because I think that Im scared to see a psychiatrist:(...  maybe its related to those sleep problems?"

I am going destroy this relationship.  Once again I have to go do more therapy all because my parents decided to bring me up getting raped everyday and treat me like shit. THIS IS NOT FAIR!! I have put in so much hard work everyday for the past 10 years to get to where I am and I still have so much work to do. I honestly can't anymore, it's too much. I just think about dying everyday, I'm not strong enough to continue. I have so much trauma like legit every year of my life.

1287,Mental health - how to beat depression and a toxic lifestyle?,"  

Hello to everyone! this is my first post so please excuse if something went wrong. If it´s the wrong subreddit please excuse this as well but I´m new to reddit and I don´t know my way around yet.

I don´t know where to start but I´ll give my best to keep it as short as possible. 

I would appreciate any advice from you! 

So what is my life about at the moment? Obviously, it´s amazing. I have a loving and healthy family, the best boyfriend I could imagine, a stable job with a good income, friends and working colleagues with whom I can talk about everything. I have a nice flat, a car and I don´t have to think about health insurance because it´s obligatory in my country.

Maybe you´ll ask yourself now – where is the problem? Why is she so upset? 

Because I´ve been suffering from depression and massive anxiety for years. When the problems began, I saw a specialist and I still have appointments with him from time to time. The enormous panic attacs (5-6 times PER DAY) are much better now – just once or twice a month and nowhere near as bad as before. I´m working hard to make things better. 

But the main problem is the depression. I don´t have energy for anything. Getting up in the morning is nearly impossible. I´m tired all day. I don´t want to do anything. 

There would be so much time for me to have fun and meet people or do something interesting after work. I finish work before 5 pm, have every weekend and public holiday off. But I can´t. The only thing I do after work is dragging myself to the next store, buy something to eat, drive home and make dinner. That´s it. I don´t want to go outside. I don´t want to meet friends or family, I don´t want to go to the cinema, or anywhere else. I don´t want to do daily chores (except cooking). I just want to do nothing except lying on the couch and either sleep or scroll through social media. When I get up in the morning my first thought is “just stay alive during the day, 10 hours and you can lie on your couch again”. 

In addition, I´ve got used to different toxic and unhealthy patterns in my life. I´ve been smoking a pack a day for 10 years now. I skip breakfast or other meals for no reason. Just because I don´t see a sense to eat right now. I don´t do sports at all. I´m stressed and exhausted very easily. I have to overcome every single step of my life. I don´t feel joy or fun – no matter what I do. Everything is exhausting and I want to sleep or do nothing. I don´t have the energy, the motivation. 

I´m not even able to prepare something to eat in the morning, altough I know how important that is. 

I´m aware of the fact, that this are all things a depression causes. But how the hell do I come out here? What have you done? I need some ideas, some advice – anything you could give me please. 

I have to break through toxic patterns. I guess, if I can bring myself to a healthier lifestyle, other things would get better as well. But as much as I try, I don´t get my sh\*t together. It´s a vicious circle. I do harmful things to my body (like smoking, skipping meals, don’t go outside and so on). But I can´t make things better. It doesn´t matter how hard I try I simply don´t have the right attitude, the motivation and disclipline to go even outside and have a little walk. 

All in all, it’s a downward spiral. Due to depression I don´t want to do anything. Therefore, I sit at home and get even more depressed because I do nothing. I tried to force me to do something. But I simply can´t… 

Just for context: I know, during the pandemic nobody should meet friends or family or go outside and have some drinks. I don´t do that. But this problem lasts longer then the pandemic exists and I even don´t have the “motivation” to go for a short walk in the nature.."
1288,Blocked out emotions from childhood,"Hi,

I’ve developed a weird thinking pattern that I don’t really know how to break out of. It mostly relates to my feeling emotions. 

Basically - when I’m in a moment that should make me feel sad, I begin thinking about how im supposed to be sad in this moment and how it’s not happening. Basically I’m focusing on how im not feeling sad rather than the moment itself and feeling sad naturally. 
I don’t really know how to work around this

An example:

On my own, laying in bed or throughout the day I can get really anxious when I think about certain things. Anxious to where I don’t feel like I can do anything but distract myself and it’ll be hard to interact with anyone im not obligated to or do any work.
But later, when im in therapy, when I tell my therapist what bothers me, I basically feel absolutely nothing towards what im thinking about. This happens a lot.

Another example:
My dad died nearly three years ago. I only ever feel anything towards thinking about that if I think about it in a very specific way. The thought process has to be natural and I can’t be forcing myself to think about it in order to feel anything about it. It seems to have to be genuine. 

I just get in my own way of these things being genuine because whenever im in a situation where I would feel something, I start thinking “hey I should be sad” and block myself.

I had a pretty sucky childhood, but I used to be extremely emotional, I would feel sad and cry all the time but now it feels like it’s been sucked out of me. Sometime around 6th grade, 6 years ago, I think I blocked it out. All I know is, whenever Im in a situation where I think I should feel something, it feels wrong, I remember a time where my emotions ran naturally and now it feels like something is messed up and isn’t working properly. It’s really confusing to me.

I’m not sure how everything pieces together, but the overthinking thing comes into play here and also in situations like talking to people im not comfortable around or making music. I just feel like I’ve lost my ability to do things naturally and to feel things. The emotions I do feel very strongly are anxiety, frustration, anger and jealousy.

I remember a time where I would know what I wanted to do, I would know what I wanted to say to random people, I would know what things made me feel like. But the way I acted as a kid made everyone hate me and I think thats why I blocked all that out. I just wish I could regain my natural childlike instincts and combine them with the knowledge I have of the world now and just live a dope life.

Please let me know if you’ve experienced anything like this before or have any advice. I’d really appreciate some help on this.

Thanks,
Alex &lt;3"
1289,I have a weird obsession with killing people brutally and violently,"I can't explain why, but I have this obsession of using a blunt object to smash someone in the head repeatedly until their skull caves in and they die. I just really want to experience killing another human by brute strength. I want them to stare at me in fear and despair and then I want to make eye contact and kill those lights by beating in their skull. I want to know what it feels like to crush bones and end life by doing so. Its exciting and exhilarating. I know that makes me a psychopath and that's why I've made plans to kill myself. I have no plans to attack anyone else but this thing in me is so evil I have to destroy it before it overwhelms me and I hurt someone. I don't understand why I feel this way but I daydream all the time about people who've fucked me over and how good it would feel to beat them to death with my bare hands. I have to end it before that happens. I guess I'm posting here because there's no way I tell anyone else and don't immediately go to jail. Kinda makes me wonder if I'd still have ended up here typing this if I could have afforded health insurance and started treating my mental health disabilities when they first started years ago, or if I was always doomed to this path."
1290,Crossposting from AskDocs,
1291,Just called an emotional support hotline and the receptionist was so rude and unresponsive,I just had a mental breakdown and wanted someone to vent to. I called and told this woman what had happened and she was just quiet throughout the call. I had to say “hello?” and the she said “I’m still listening”. I told her I was finished and she stayed quiet again. I got fed up and said “k bye” and hung up on her. Like she just sat there the whole time not responding or giving me any reassurance. Worst hotline I’ve ever called. I feel even worse now.
1292,graduate/masters student with severe anxiety and stress. am I alone?,"Hi everyone! I’m writing here to ask for some advice or maybe a new perspective that could help me and people like me to deal with their anxiety. I’m writing here because I feel very lonely in my struggle and sharing it with my peers could make either them or myself feel even more anxious, also I live away from my family and well, we’re in a pandemic which is automatically a much lonelier time than normal. 

I’ve always been a pretty good student and I’ve always loved getting educated and finding out new things, but I have absolutely never enjoyed learning at school or university, I’ve just never dealt well with the pressure of expectations, deadlines, timeframes and just generally education institutions (even being in the building itself) as a whole but that’s the only way I’ve gotten my education and I’m just so so exhausted. 

It is the very final step in my education process, it’s my last year of my masters degree and I’m finding myself unable to cope with my anxiety. The workload has gotten much heavier since it’s the end of the semester and I cannot focus, or structure and plan my week, some assignments I find so overwhelming I’m even unable to start them, I cannot breathe when I think of my thesis or having to get in contact with my promoter. 

Of course I want to do well, I don’t have a benchmark or a strict rule but I just want to know I did as well as I could, and I do accept the possibility of failing, I think I am more accepting of failure than I have ever been. But what absolutely terrifies me is having to spend a day or month longer at university. I feel like I simply want it to end as soon as it can, and I’m terrified of failing only because that would mean I have to be a student longer and deal with the university longer. So, I just feel paralyzed by this anxiety and the desire to not be a student anymore, that is also paired with wanting to do well and actually wanting to study and learn new material. 

I don’t know how to cope with it, and what perspective to adapt, and switch to viewing the university in a way that would not make me wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. I really want to get my assignments done now, finish uni and be proud of myself without looking back at this year as torture. 

I would appreciate any new perspective, any tip or exercise, really anything. Thank you so much!"
1293,"Fear of being judged, but no social anxiety","I’ve had a fear of being judged for a long time. It happened around age 11-12. Became very anxious in middle school around others. Was screened for autism (they searched for high functioning) and found I was not autistic. I do have ADHD that’s pretty severe. But that just makes me into a chaotic person. My social anxiety from 11-18 was so bad I had but only 1 friend. I was a handholdless, hugless, kissless Virgin until 18. Then once I lost it I’ve had a shit ton of sex and flings with different women. I no longer feel the terror and panic feeling of mind blank when talking to people. I still however have nonstop thoughts in loops about how I think others are judging me. On the outside you’d see me as the most confident person there is. But on the inside. My fear of being judged and not rejected is eating me. Thoughts? Talking to my doc this week about it"
1294,allergic to fungus (as it relates to mental health),"i had seizures as a result of an allergy to candida.(unknown to me at the time)  so i started a medication they later offered brain surgery, i stuck with the medication that seemed to work on something else entirely.  i eventually outgrow the epilepsy, and in my 20's start to hear ""voices"" its more like someone is reading inside my head. this is a result of the slowly spreading fungus candida that i must be allergic to.  i was later prescribed meds that worked with stopping the voices for several months then it suddenly became ineffective one day. ten years go by of ineffective medication and mania, as a result of the medications that don't work.  this mania induced physical exercise in extreme proportions caused the candida fungus to grow stronger.  this caused me to start looking for a cure on my own.  i found that antihistamines' worked better at symptom medication than my psyche meds.(that not where i started ""curing myself"", long story that starts with magnets, lol.) then after doing research, while being aware of my body and mind i discovered my dad and sister were highly allergic.

there are lots of signs and indications that point to this allergy combine with a slow growing common fungus candida.  one is seizures, the other is skin conditions, the other is coughing up black stuff.  these conditions are not considered when doctors treat psychosis.  I now take 600 mg of NAC a day, that I got from vitamin shoppe.  i can hear/feel the fungus dyeing.  so i did find the cure for my sickness."
1295,Nearly 1 in 5 U.S adults experience a mental illness and yet we still lack support and resources for those struggling.,"I just read this article from NAMI 

https://www.nami.org/mhstats

Now I am in no way trying to lessen the impact of doctors and professionals in the field of psychology, sociology, and psychiatry. Especially those who really care, but is there really nothing else we can do? Mental Illness is a plague destroying this country faster than any other condition. It causes so much suffering and confusion and sadly that number is probably higher because many people don’t admit they are struggling or have a problem. 

I’m tired of seeing the homeless people that are lost and left on the street to wither away struggling with mental illness while people just walk past them like they’re a lazy piece of dirt. 

I’m tired of every doctor rushing to prescribe medication for every illness when some problems are caused by situational trauma and they just need support and to feel like someone genuinely cares and wants to help them. 

Why is it so expensive to get help for mental illness when it’s not even THAT effective? There’s no cure and varied success rates in treatment for many conditions such as depression but yet people are charged thousands of dollars just for that because of something they have no control over which might discourage them from even seeking treatment in the first place. 

This society and our economy would be so much better if we could focus on truly helping those with mental illness and not shunning them or invalidating their feelings. 

I really hate to see that statistic. 1 out of 5 is a huge a amount of people and if these people had support early on, imagine how much better they would be off. A healthy mind leads to a healthy life which leads to more productivity, which leads to a better economy."
1296,I've spent so much of my life hating myself,"I have suffered from a severe duality for a huge part of my life. One part of myself really loves life and finds beauty in the simple things, while the other side just wants to see me suffer. It's been torture, and exhausting. It finally came to a pretty severe crossroads for me and has led me to a new journey for myself. I wanted to share my story, and this journey so I laid it out in a 4 part podcast which can be linked below. I appreciate everyone on here sharing their stories. It takes so much strength to ask for help.

1297,Is it too late to apply for accommodations at school? I just started Prozac and it’s affecting my ability to complete schoolwork,"In October, I had a series of panic attacks and realized I had many symptoms of depression and anxiety. I’ve been seeing a counselor at my school’s psychological services  since then. I also made a telehealth appointment with my doctor discussing my symptoms. I scored very high on the screening tests for both depression and anxiety. I was prescribed Prozac. The first two weeks on Prozac, I didn’t have the motivation or energy to do anything after work. I mostly caught up in school after asking for extensions from my professors. At first, I started sleeping more but had to wake up 4-5 times to pee. And then my insomnia came back with the peeing interruptions. 

Since starting Prozac, I noticed my memory getting worse. The worst part has been the brain fog. The best way I can explain it is that I can’t think and my mind is blank. I had a speech outline due last week and now I’ve spent over a week working on it and I’m not even halfway done. I’ve been sitting at my desk scrolling through research articles and staring at the screen for hours. I can’t think clearly and I’m unable to process my thoughts into words. I’ve been doing this almost every day this week and I don’t know why I haven’t been able to finish it yet. It’s frustrating that I can’t even complete an outline and I’m feeling stressed and anxious because the actual speech was due a few days ago. My professor gave the class an extension after I asked for more time, and I still didn’t finish. 

I’m putting effort in but I’m not being productive because of the brain fog. I’m scared I am unconsciously looking for excuses to not complete work. I asked my cousin for advice since she’s a nurse and she pretty much said that I’m not trying hard enough and that I’m trying to blame it on the Prozac. But I didn’t have these symptoms until after Prozac. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I haven’t even done any work for my other class in almost two weeks because of this outline so I’m a few weeks behind on lecture videos for that class now. I’m not officially diagnosed but my counselor knows about my anxiety because that’s what we’ve been working on. I want to email her and ask about accommodations but I’m afraid I don’t qualify or what accommodations I can even get. I also feel like it’s pointless because the school year is practically over in a few weeks and it might take a while for the disability center to process anything. 

I want to reach out to my counselor for help but I honestly don’t know what to say or how to word it and it makes me really anxious just thinking about it."
1298,Need help for school project,"I'm doing a school research project on mental health issues. Here are the list of questions i would like ask!
- I am also someone who is still going through some mental health crisis (depression and anxiety) but i never really seek help for it - so i would like to also understand what others are going through too.

So firstly, would like ask what is the biggest challenge you’re facing as someone who is currently or having gone through mental health issues (or  tough times)

When was the last time you tried to solve the problem? (such as seeking help)

What made you want to seek help? If no, 
Is there a reason or something preventing you from seeking help?

Are you able to tell a story about the last time that you had this problem?

Do you find the current treatments effective or not? Is it affordable or expensive?

Did your condition improve after seeking help? Why or why not?

If you did not seek help, how did you manage to overcome these challenges/issues? 

What do you think of the social stigma on mental health?"
1299,My First,"In my early thirties, I find reflecting on my very first panic attack to be a grievous yet meaningful experience. It helps me understand my struggles with anxiety and grounds me when at a high. It also shows me where I was in my darkness and how I've grown. My first lasted days; I like studying where it took me and basking in the habits I've implemented to fight these attacks. It has been years since that night, and today attacks still come, but in much shorter bursts.

I hope sharing this experience is an exercise helpful to others. I hope it gives you hope that you too can grow and learn to control this deep-dive into an abyss. I hope sharing would encourage you to share your experience, we know opening up can help.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an excerpt detailing my first experience and the lead-up to it:

  

Was this it? Four years into my career as an engineer, I was enjoying my time, performing well, and making a name for myself. My ambition—or so I thought—was to be promoted to Chief Engineer. It was what I had worked for; it’s what everyone in my position strives for. One day, as I walked around one of our assembly plants, I noticed our Chief Engineer there, making himself useful in essentially the same manner I was. He and I are not so different after all; he just makes slightly bigger decisions and gets paid more doing so. Boil it down, and the day-to-day doesn’t differ much. The stubborn question was born: Is this it? Is this what I’ll be doing for the rest of my life? Is this the best I can hope for? And just like that, the vision shattered. For the first time, I had nothing to look forward to: no more hopes and dreams, no more thoughts of doing something meaningful for myself and others.

The question grew, forming trains of thought eventu­ally leading to an existential crisis. There were days I wished that thought never crossed my mind. I went from enjoying my day to dreading getting up for work. I questioned every task, every role and responsibility. My performance started to dwindle, and people were taking notice. The disdain spilled over the entirety of my life. All joy was sucked out of me. Everything seemed dull. The stress built up until it finally imploded into an anxiety attack. I was not prepared for it. It gripped me, then took the reins. Here’s a fragment of the email I wrote to my partner detailing the experience.

*“This panic/anxiety attack is literally the worst thing I’ve experienced (yes, it even tops my kidney stone episodes, and my broken jaw/mouth-wired-shut episode). During the night, while in bed, tossing and turning, every thought turned into an overwhelming feeling that took my heartbeat into overdrive. Even thoughts that weren’t really negative got me going. Literally, anything and everything turned into a tragedy–'I can’t sleep; oh crap, that means that I’m going to be too tired to get up right away, so I’ll be a few minutes late for work, and I won’t be able to prepare my file for the morning meeting presenta­tion.' My heart would be beating out of my chest. 'I texted Bilo, but he hasn’t replied for hours, is he okay?' My heart would pump blood like it was serving four bodies. 'I leave Louisville next week, and I have to pack and drive five and a half hours up to Detroit.' My heart sounded like the background beat to a techno song. You know how people claim they couldn’t sleep last night, but in reality, they just tossed and turned for a few extra minutes before falling asleep? I honestly did not sleep a minute that whole night. I got up in the middle of the night and took a cold shower because I thought it would help elevate my mood and make me sleepy; that didn’t work. I got up again and masturbated because I thought that would get me drowsy; nope. I got up and attempted to watch an episode of How to Get Away with Murder, but that didn’t last ten minutes because every scene got me anxious. I felt like I was going to get arrested for accessory to murder if any of them got caught. I ended up going back to bed and tossing and turning until 5:30 a.m.*

*The next day was a bit weird. My heart was no longer beating abnormally, but the overall feeling remained. I felt a cloud of uncertainty lingering over my head. Throughout the day, this cloud felt heavy—like it turned to fog and occupied my whole body. It’s hard to explain, but I could feel it. I didn’t want to get up because I felt like I was walking with a 150-pound weight hanging from my shoulders. I don’t know if you watched Spiderman (it’s in one of the movies; I’m unsure which one), but there was a scene where the black Spiderman (he’s supposed to be the Evil version of the blue-and-red Spiderman) took over some guy’s body and made him a villain. The good Spiderman hits a big church bell; the bell’s frequency is supposed to extract this black Spiderman virus from the poor dude, but this darkness would fight to get back into his body and stay. It was an epic battle…well, epic for a Spiderman movie. That is the best analogy I can think of. This darkness occupied me, and it was destroying me. No attempt to get rid of it worked. Even positive thoughts would turn gloomy and hit me like blocks of ice flying off a semitruck’s mud flaps on the highway.*

*But then you came along and mentioned meditation (among other things I didn’t care for), and I remembered how the Wim Hoff meditation and breathing exercise I do sporadically is de­signed to flood the brain with all the feel-good chemicals (Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin). I figured I’d give it a shot. I left work a bit early and went home, took all my clothes off, and lay in bed. I think I’ve already mentioned this meditation practice to you in the past, but in the exercise, you’re supposed to hold your breath for as long as you can after the breathing technique. While holding my breath, I imagined that I was by the docks outside my apartment with a big, one-way safe. I pictured the darkness coming out of me (kind of like that Spider-Man scene), and before it could fight and make its way back inside, I grabbed chunks of it and stuck them into this safe. I did this for five sets, with less and less darkness coming out of me in each set. The fifth set managed to eliminate all the darkness, and I stopped. I got up, and wow. This is not a joke or an exaggeration—I swear to you, the feeling was gone. Not only was I normal again, but I was in a wonderful mood. I had that extra confidence that others notice in us when we’re super happy. I just couldn’t believe it. I’m still in shock, actually.*

*I’m still trying to figure out why it happened in the first place, and I’m honestly a little concerned that I can’t find the cause. This is not something I want to deal with ever again, so finding the root cause is crucial. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be able to since this was a one-off. I recorded everything I could remember happening that day in the hopes that I’d find a pattern if this ever came up again. Let’s hope I don’t have to find this pattern.”*"
1300,Feeling very bad and disgusting about perverted things I've done when I was 15-16 (I'd appreciate advice/opinions),"I am 17 years old and I've been remembering some things I did when I was 15-16, which I deeply regret and am ashamed of. Often when I was ""horny"", I made an account on platforms such as Discord and Snapchat to specifically find people who would sext with me (also minors, 13-16). I would first talk with them and then and then sometimes become a bit more sexual and ask/persuade them to send me nude pictures of themselves. If they said no I either said it's no problem or asked a few more times (I said things like come on, please, you're just really pretty/hot, etc.), but after that I stopped. Also if they sent one picture I sometimes asked for more, but never blackmailed them by threatening to send these photos to others, and always also complemented them heavily. I always deleted these pictures afterwards too. They were always complete strangers. When I did it on Discord I joined some ""dating"" servers and messaged a lot of people at once to see who would respond. On Discord I almost never sent a picture of myself, unless I somewhat trusted the other person (was only face pictures, never nude from my side). When they also asked for nude pictures I used pictures from Google (which I know is also scummy). On Snapchat I sent my face pictures more often, as it was a bit more private in terms of images. However, sometimes people saved the picture of my face (for example once I sent as said some weird and creepy texts and the other person screenshotted everything, although I am not entirely sure if I sent a picture of myself in that case). I also sometimes chatted/looked for people to sext with on random chat apps (most people there weren't minors though). The creepy messages ranged from asking if they ever did some sexual acts like oral sex and if they would do it with me, if they can send nude pictures to roleplaying that we are having sex together. I usually first had a normal conversation though, such as what their hobbies are, where they're from, etc. I did all of this quite often too (in total I think I got nude pictures from over 10 people, maybe even more). Sometimes I even pretended to be the opposite sex to find women who are homosexual (rarely though) and get sexual images from them. The nude or sexual images were sometimes in underwear and/or in suggestive poses, but sometimes completely nude and focused on the genitals.

I am also worried and anxious that if anyone I know, like family members or friends, knew what I did and would see my texts they would be disgusted at me and not want to have anything to do with me anymore.

I've found out these things are illegal when I was 16 (as it can count as child pornography, solicitation of child pornography of a minor, grooming, sending pornography to minors, etc.). Before that I thought it was fine as long as the people involved had at maximum a three year age gap. I didn't feel bad about it either. When I found out it was illegal though, it made me think more about why it might be wrong. I started feeling extremely bad and was disgusted of myself (still am). I still am also worried that I might get into legal trouble because of it, because as said it is illegal, which could fuck my life up drastically. But even if nothing of that sort happens, I'll still feel bad and disgusted about what I did, and also still a bit worried because I shared photos of my face and some people saved/screenshotted them along with my creepy texts. I have deleted almost all of my social media and have almost no online presence anymore, as it always brings up these bad memories. I also feel like a predator/pedophile, because of being horny I pretended to be interested in these people when I actually just wanted fap material. I would never do anything like that again, am very ashamed and regret it deeply.

How can I get over this, and am I terrible and disgusting for doing this (please be honest) (I know this is a confessions sub but I'd greatly appreciate any opinions or avice too)?

P.S might edit to add more details if I forgot anything."
1301,Best way to attempt suicide to get pyschiatrist help,"I've been passed around by doctors for years, tried various different sorts of anti depressants and anti anxiety tablets none of it helped so I gave up seeking help from the gp and just got on with life. But now I'm sick of being miserable, I'm sick of ruining my relationships, I'm sick of not knowing what's wrong with me. I'm pretty sure I am bipolar or something similar as I have manic highs for months and crash into manic depression for months, if I'm lucky I get a few months in the year where I am semi-normal but even during that time I am depressed because I remember all the fucked up shit I did and the way I acted before. 

I haven't spoken to my current gp about mental health issues because they have just been so useless before and when I'm on an ""up"" I don't think I need help. I am not interested in CBT or talking therapy as I know that won't work for me. I just need a diagnosis and for my head to shut up! 

Recently I just can't take being like this anymore, I've lost my boyfriend, possibly the best thing that ever happened to me and I don't think I am capable of forming any meaningful lasting relationships because of how fucked my head is.

So I rang a local counseling group and completed and assessment and they told me that they can't diagnose me and I need to see a psychiatrist. I had a look online and I could not find any local ones apart from one that was £90 per session, which i can't afford. Another I spoke to told me I need a referral from my GP to see a psychiatrist. So I spoke to my GP who told me she could not refer me without me being on medication for two years first.... Even though I know the meds won't help because I'm not depressed all the time and I'll just stop taking them next time I'm on a high. She refused to refer me and tried to get me to go to talking space again which I tried to explain doesn't help me. So I can't afford to pay for the psychiatrist and my GP doesn't believe that my mental health is serious enough for her to refer me, which I guess is fair as I haven't spoken to her about it before but you can see from my medical history and previous suicide attempts that something has not been right for years.... I asked her how it could be considered normal for me to be bouncing off the walls, loving life and thinking I'm the most amazing person ever to literally spending all day thinking of ways to end my life. I haven't left my bed for a week. 

So I think my best option for them to take me seriously is to try and kill myself (again) but I don't want to die, but I need it to be bad enough that they actually listen to me! Anyone got any suggestions on the best way to do this?"

I dont make fights online but whatever you say someone else is bound to get irritated and mad at you about it and then my mood just worsens because of some stranger. 

Plus I thought talking to people online would help me relax but it just got worse because I always hear racial or sexist slurs and ""jokes"" .. it hurts so much I just want to feel good without having to endure all that. I know that people feel brave to spit horrible racist things or make dumb racist ""jokes"" over the internet but what about me? How do I take care of my mental health when it comes to that stuff, I have no answers except that I need time away from the internet and yet I cant. I have to work so I have to come online everyday

It's also that right now I'm so busy and overwhelmed with work that I dont know what to do. I know I have responsibilities but I'm so tired.. and when I cant meet those responsibilities I feel like my future is gone , that I'm a failure. 
Usually some time online with things I enjoy watching or reading about would help me relax but now I cant, everytime I take time for myself my head is filled with pressure about work, the only time I truly relax is when I'm asleep. I wish I could stop time and sleep as much as I want 

Maybe I seem like I'm whining, but please be kind or dont reply at all. Words that I couldnt care less about now just hurt me and I dont want any more of that, I just want to vent a bit"
1307,The rapper that saved my life (NF),"Let me preface this post by saying I am in a better place mentally. I am doing well, but my recovery I owe souly to NF and my therapist.

I remember vividly trudging from my apartment to the subway, feeling down on my self and the way my life was going. it was raining as I walked to the subway, but not enough that I was worried to wear my headphones for fear of them getting water logged and fizzing out. my phone was low on battery, but I kept the music playing. nothing mattered more - it was the only thing left holding me together. I had lost enjoyment in everything, making only the minimum to stay alive. for what I often asked myself, I considered taking my life multiple times, and the only person keeping me alive was NF. 

I have never been a rap fan, [sticking mostly to alternative](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2PwnlvN7XrC20Y1UxXEu4v), but as I feel into depression I lost interest in that too. I am not sure how I discovered NF, but when I did he was the only thing I listened to. I related to what he spoke about. his words hit a special part of me no song or artist has ever touched before. he felt real - like the only person who was going through what I was going to. it made me feel alright. safe.

NF kept me alive until I found a therapist. he stayed with me as I slowly recovered, rediscovered the things I enjoyed.

I am now in a place I am happy with. I still have work to do, but I am growing as a person so fast.

NF kept me alive until I could take care of myself. I now no longer need him, but he was truly the most important thing to me for months when I was at my lowest.

if you are feeling down or suicidal, please put on headphones - in both ears - close your eyes, rest, and play NF.

I recommend starting with ""mansion"", it was the first song of his I heard, and is the one that helped me the most (all are great though!)

love yall, stay safe"
1308,Why cant I comprehend that bad things happened to me?,"I’ve been trying to come to terms with my addiction , my mental illnesses  and my past but I can’t admit or at least admit that what I’m doing or what happened to me is bad even when everyone around me is telling me I need help- I just can’t seem to comprehend it that I do need help and downplay it.  I feel so lost and confused because people are starting to take actions for  me - sometimes I admit those things are awful when it happens to other people but not to me , everyone points it out and I still say it’s not bad. I’ve recently relapsed into my addiction and I’ve been doing it everyday, I can’t go more than two days and I just feel like a complete utter failure cause I keep calling for help but once people try to help I refuse— I feel like I’m being a toxic horrible person- I’m growing too codependent on my addiction , my mental health feels like it’s deteriorating by the day but somehow someway— I still can’t understand, at least my brain doesn’t want to understand or comprehend that what im doing is bad for me and so have the people that hurt me

I’m just rambling at this point I’ve just been such a mess , I just want to understand"
1309,"I have to quit Zoloft, it is destroying my brain.","I could go on a whole rant about my life right now, but fact is, its not bad, there is no reason why I can't at least enjoy my life for what it is right now, but I'm finding that none of my problems are actually real, they're brought upon by my medication wreaking absolute havoc on my brain.

To give you a timeline, I was first on zoloft and Risperdal when I was a kid, from 1999 to 2011, I ended up having tons of weird side effects, including but not limited to involuntary twitching. The years between 2012-2015 were the happiest of my entire life, I felt normal for the first time. People were surprised when I told them I was autistic. I ended up falling into a deep depression with insomnia between 2016-2017 due to a dopamine and serotonin deficiency thanks to smoking weed constantly and other things.

This led to me having horrible insomnia for months, losing touch with reality gradually and believing that I was being punished from on high. I was incredibly sleep deprived.

So unfortunately, my psychiatrists office was incredibly inept and negligent on a regular, and the guy put me on 75mg of zoloft, which would have done the trick, but he also put me on an antipsychotic without actually telling me what I was taking exactly.

I was just glad to sleep again, so i figured it was resolved. A year later, I could barely form complete sentences, I was saying things incredibly out of character and I developed a neck twitch which I still have today.

My original psychiatrist quit, so I had to pay $80 every month to see a nurse practitioner, who seemed to not give a shit and tried to keep me on the olanzapine pretty much indefinitely. So I tapered off of it myself, I felt much, MUCH better when it was done. I also quit smoking weed around that time as well, things were good. Until they weren't.

Starting back at work again in September was rough, all of my bad habits from when I was a teenager came back. I'm socially awkward, incredibly anxious and ridiculously paranoid. I ended up briefly hospitalized again due to an abnormal EKG from a panic attack, which happened in 2017 as well before I got on my meds. So clearly, this isn't working anymore.

Thing is, I still have my twitch and several more concerning symptoms. I seem to be suffering from some sort of dementia now. I straight up was convinced I was on 25mg of zoloft for the past month or so, I've been looking at the bottle and could have sworn it was 25mg. I've been researching how best to taper down from 25mg. So I go to resupply and completely out of character I get into an angry argument with the pharmacist because he said I was on 50mg. I went home, checked the bottle and sure enough, it was 50mg.

I was gobsmacked, but kind of relieved, because it means the withdrawal symptoms I had in the past weren't just from 25mg, and my issues make sense with a dosage like this.

Still, this also makes sense on another level, I don't remember much about my life before 1999. My brother describes things we both experienced regularly back then, conversations we had with our grandparents, I don't remember much of anything. I just have very vague images and feelings of a time, but it's like looking through a foggy window.

I need to get off this shit, I haven't been myself for longer than I am even comfortable thinking about. I hope this isn't permanent. I'm going to taper down very, very slowly, but I don't trust this shit at all. Thankfully hemp is legal now, so maybe I can mitigate the damage a bit more effectively with that."
1310,"[Long] I just don't fit in society, seriously...","You might think, this isn't too bad, except it causes me trouble; serious trouble.

Most people seem to hold a consensus, a set on ideas they agree on (and some that they might disagree), meanwhile I can't even seem to agree on the most basic of things, and I mean things like temperature, that human faces are supposedly very different from each other (people look all the damn same), the concept of names, even the emotions and what I should feel at a given moment.

The difficulty and procedure of a task seems to be something I deeply disagree with most people as well, I like machines, they make sense, I find joy designing my conceptions, what I do for a living is designing these devices, it's easy; but there's for example, things that seem to go over by feelings, or by some weird intuition, people would claim they are logical but they make no damn sense, things like paperwork, or legalese, they are just words with multiple interpretations, which I find incredibly inefficient and hard to understand or keep track of; and I find that quite hard as unpredictability frustrates me like the plague; if laws were truly well designed, lawyers wouldn't make a difference, paperwork isn't driven by logic, it's driven by feelings and subjective morals, and I can't handle that very well.

And if you think that people wouldn't take advantage of that, think again; I've been so many times in court, I am getting tired, for some breach of contract, patent infringement I didn't know existed, or some weird mistake; I get the blame because ""You couldn't possibly mess this up"", as much as my small inventions push me forward, society pushes me backwards. I am going to end up in jail one of these days, for, I don't know, wrongthink, doing something without a license I didn't know I needed or something on those lines; I just live by the code of not hurting anyone, it makes sense, but this stuff, makes no sense, it's made up, supposedly on the best interest of society, but only works for the best interests of a selected few that profit off the whole thing.

It gets me so fucking tired, I moved to the countryside to live alone, far away from any human, but it isn't enough... why society is so focused into labeling me a criminal; is that what society wants off me?... is it?... My own livelihood is threatened, I have lost jobs to this, I've hired lawyers with the little money I have and still things don't go well because I manage to mess it up anyway in some bizarre way I didn't think was even possible, but apparently it should've been intuitive, except, it's not, to me; why don't these fuckers try to create an algorithm for physical simulation overnight in 4 dimensions some of them which wrap between themselves, because hey, it's so easy; hold on, according to these kind of people, I can't do that because I didn't go to school so I don't have the qualifications.

Just end me, I am exhausted, I want to run away, society is just too complex, inconsistent and unpredictable, unlike machines and animals; I will never fall in love, or have any children, just let me get old and die in peace in the forest."
1311,[US-MA] How do I talk to my doctor without seeming like I'm faking?,"Hi all, I believe I am suffering/ahve been suffering from some form of mental/stress disorder most of my life but until recently have been able to hide/maintain it.  I've never had any help before, I'm not against it, I'm just terrified of telling my doctor ( wwhom I trust) straight out that I think I'm suffering something w/o him trying to commit me.  I know as I type this out he never would, but I want to prep myself, because the last two times I have tried, I just smiled and left.

Backstory time:  I'm nearly 40, I dropped out in the 7th grade to work full time as my mother was supporting me with my 4 siblings but was diagnosed with a neural disorder that took her out of work permanently.  She didn't ask me to drop out, I did it w/o her knowing.  I've never been able to share emotions etc, having only cried (until today) twice in my entire life that anyone can remember.  Trying to include all the important things, cause I'm sure people here see flags and can help me set myself up for the appointment.  

During this time period, I was working 60-80 hours a week if not more and don't really remember doing anything but walking home from work, sometimes having time for a video game, and walking to work.  I started having some issues that I thought might be OCD/compulsive, but assumed its just quirks everyone has.  I would lock the door to the house, walk 5 feet away, check the lock, check the handle.  Walk 10 feet away, and repeat.  There was a couple of times I did this or similar things (alignin the sink faucet for 10 minutes) but again, in my head, these are not life debilitating, its just small and doesn't add up.  I hate seeing people claim ""oh im so OCD cuz my pencils have to line up!"" but at the same time, I  was doing something very similar.  I should mention now, I've always been very particular to having my hands clean/fingernails clipped perfectly, to the point if my nails are ""uneven"" I will lose focus on everything until I've clipped them.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I worked under the table supporting my siblings/etc for 7 years until my other siblings were able to get into college,  or get FT jobs and start helping.  At this point I found a ""real"" job and was working FT not under the table, I met my  future wife and was finally able at 21 to move out and away from supporting everyone.    


Things go hunky dory the next few years, all of the patterns for locking the door, etc.  Gone.    


Cut to COVID, of course its tough.  Wife has lost her job, my job has required pay cuts.  It's stressful with everything going on for everyone.  At night, I notice I am washing my hands a bit longer, rewashing them if I think I missed a spot, rewashing them a fourth or fifth time because I think I can smell hand soap.  And I know these are probably signs of something, but they seem harmless.   I'm strugglign to sleep at night, which has not been an issue since I was younger.  I lay down, and I constantly think I hear people breaking in, or noises or movement on the other side of the house.   I live in a very quiet area, there are not a lot of neighbors, this has never been a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard mumbles, not voices, but noises when I'm laying in bed reading at night, or if I'm in the shower and I don't have music.  It's not anything I can hear, but sometimes a weird laugh, or a noise that sounds vaguely familiar, I'm not sure if this is normal like a hallucination etc, but they seem to be happening a bit more than I ever remember.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I find out that I made a mistake on my taxes a few years back after an audit email.  I'm not hiding anything fortunately, but it means I now owe a small chunk of money I wasn't prepared for.  Then my job notifies me that they'll be cutting positions or salaries, and unfortunately it looks like my 10% pay cut is going to 25% until end of January.    


I broke down this morning crying, I've spent 25 years telling myself I can get around this but even typing this all out I feel like I'm making it up to get people to feel sorry for myself.  I don't want pity I just want to know how to talk to my doctor, like what could I do to prep myself to not avoid talkign to him.  Sorry if it seems a bit jumbled, it does feel good to type it out and kinda see flags typed out instead of just thinking they were a one off thing."
1312,The Power of Letting Go," Can you ever really let go?

I watched the waves crash against the side of the ferry as it skirted between the two Thai islands that I had spent most of my summer. This trip must have been my fifth between the two islands. The sky was clear, but there was subtle violence to how the waves smacked the boat pushing it side to side as it jetted on the crystal blue ocean. I was seated on the second tier, alone, which had never happened before. And I stared out the window; I realized that all the pain, suffering, abuse, torment, and healing was me. I understood it, and maybe it was due to the moment of zen, but nonetheless, in this very moment, as tears streamed down my eyes, I felt that I had finally done it. I’d let go.

I spent most of my 32 years of life to that point being angry at the world. And why wouldn’t I be? Anyone who came from where I came from would be too. Not to mention that statistically, I should be dead or in jail. It’s mindboggling that a zip code can determine so much of your path in life. I sought refuge from myself more often than not, drinking and smoking myself numb. I rather enjoyed the nothingness that came from it, anything to not feel the torment. And that worked until it didn’t, and when it stopped, I understood that I would have to deal with some shit. 

Fast forward a lot of years, therapy, and money later. 

What did it mean to let go? To forgive? I read those words, I heard those words, and I wrote those words, but to what avail. What did they mean? I struggle to this day with the concept of forgiveness. People often say it’s for you, but I would argue that it’s for those that earn it. That, however, is another conversation altogether. What stuck with me the most through all the self-education, personal growth, and trauma healing is that if I was going to live my life on my terms that I was going to have to release the grip that I had on my trauma. As much as I was a part of it, it was a part of me. Which, of course, is understandable with an ACE score of ten. Everything I knew in life was childhood trauma, was abuse, but I understood that eventually, to move forward, I would have to let it go.

To be frank, I don’t know that I will ever forgive some of the people that hurt me; how does one forgive their mother for cutting off their finger or their white grandmother for calling them nigger? I’m not there, and honestly, I likely never will be, and that is my choice. Some say that you must forgive to heal, I don’t entirely agree, but then again, none of this trauma healing we put ourselves through is universal. I do know this; I no longer carry the weight of the experiences of my past. I made a declaration that *I don’t have to forgive, but I do have to release what I am holding.* I must have repeated those words to myself a thousand times, trying to define what they meant and how to allow them to hold space in my life. What I came to understand is that letting go means **letting go**, and it’s either all in or all out. 

As I sat on the ferry looking out onto the world around me, I finally got it. Letting go is about acknowledging that something terrible has happened to you, accepting that you can’t change the past, choosing to release the grip that you have around it, and making a decision to move forward on your terms. And it’s not that moment don’t come when I have to remind myself that I’ve let go. I carry the scars of abuse on my body and my soul. However, when I feel the anger, frustration, or sadness of my past, I take a look out the window and remind myself that I am living for me, not for them.

Until next time my friend…

1313,Am I just looking for attention...?,"I’ve passed out at work twice. I think both times due to a panic attack - since I felt and looked like I was having a heart attack. 

Am I subconsciously making myself do this..?"
1314,I hate myself. I hate everything I do but I can’t seem to stop myself.,"To keep everything short and sweet, basically I’ll talk to people, I’ll have them fall for me hoping that it’ll make me happy being in a relationship. I doesn’t. I don’t know how or why but to girls I guess I’m pretty attractive and %90 of the time when I talk to a girl they’ll “fall for me”. The truth is, I hate them, every single one of them. I hate being a lone so I compensate and have girls fall for me. I hate it. I don’t know what to do."

I overdosed and cut my arms really bad and she send an ambulance but i froze when she said do i need one to come and i ended up saying ok because i didn’t know what else to say. I muted myself because im panicking alot and crying. 
I can hardly move my arms without them hurting bad and bleeding more and my stomach really hurts and i’m going really dizzy and i feel like i’m going to pass out i don’t know what to do pls help"
1317,what to do if your parents don't appreciate you for anything,"I am 20 years old and am a  design student and yeah I don't have assignments related to studies and its more of creating and making and whatever I make I avoid showing my parents because they don't appreciate my work. I am not telling this just by the way I am saying this because I tried to show my mom something I created and her reaction to it was that it was just okay and that I had copied it from somewhere whereas It was my original. I don't get the love, the respect, the appreciation I wish my parents had given me. I am not asking for a lot just wished they sometimes appreciated me for atleast something in life... What do I do to feel less horrible about this situation..?"
1318,I'm probably gonna get medicated soon and I'm insanely scared about it.,"I've always been really introverted, kept to myself, and anxious about things I know I cant do anything about. So recently I've had a bit of a loss in appetite, been depressed randomly throughout the day, I've cried a bit more (I would like to cry more but some childhood trauma wont allow me to), and my sleep schedule is a little bit off. So my made me an appointment with my counselor who I havent seen since I finished a year in therapy. We didnt really talk about much but he gave me a test to take and said he would recommend me some antidepressants. But the thing is, while I go through a lot emotionally I dont think I'm depressed. I still look at memes and laugh a little and I'm a little bit happy around friends, I just dont feel like engaging with anything. Then I start thinking about how I dont really enjoy doing many things anymore and I just lay in bed watching YouTube which makes me think I'm just lazy. So I guess I'm just worried that I dont need these pills and that I'm just going through a tough time or maybe I'm not even in a tough time. I dont know Ive never really been able to process my emotions correctly so I dont know what's wrong or if anything is wrong at all."
1319,"I need help getting off a medication! Urgently, I’ve been trying for a long time but my psychiatrist is telling me different things and contradicting himself.","I have been taking lexapro for a couple years now.  The doctor that prescribed it was not a psychiatrist just my primary care physicians assistant or whatever it’s called.  The medication never helps but I kept taking it because all they said to me is that it would work, so I kept taking it.  Eventually I went to a psychiatrist and he told me that I should’ve stopped a looooong time ago if it had no effect, so he said he would ween me off. 
But then, he just prescribed other medications on top of that and never told me how to ween off, and he never prescribed me a lower dosage.  I had to remind him at least 5 different times that the medication wasn’t working and I wanted to get off of it.  He FINALLY told me to half the doseage for a week and then go cold turkey.  Then about halfway through the week he called and said forget it go cold turkey.  So I did, but of course I got withdrawal symptoms in the form of those electric shock feelings up and down my body starting at my head, as well as sleep issues, dizziness etc.  so then he told me to go back to half my doseage but I’m still getting these withdrawal symptoms.  He said they would be gone in a week but it’s been at least 3 and I still feel like shit.  Every time I tell my psychiatrist about this he just seems confused.  Now he just wants me to stay on it!!!  Should I just go to the hospital?  I don’t know what to do.  Please help this is getting really bad."
1320,I know I have anxiety and depression but how do I ask for a full evaluation of my problems?,"I have had anxiety and depression that I have always known and evaluated by therapists at my university’s counseling when I was a student. After seeking therapy post graduation, I’d always just tell my therapists my problems and they’d solve it without quite evaluating further. I’ve been wanting to know if I possibly have more issues: ive recently thought about the possibility of ADHD, but don’t know if other issues may also be a problem for me (OCD, etc.). In your experience, who’s the best person to approach? 

1. Psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, psych nurse (NP)
2. How does a full evaluation work?

Thanks and stay well and safe!"
1321,Somethings up with my sister.,"Not sure where to post this so here I am. I have a 17 year old younger sister whom I live with and she can never give a straight answer to questions. This morning my dad asked if one of us could go shopping and I asked her if she could go so I could catch up on my classes and she said “I don’t know”. That’s always the answer. I spent 30 mins asking her if she was going before I just gave up and went myself. I can never get a straight answer from her and when I ask her to please just give me one she just doesn’t answer and gets upset when I push her for one. Do you want to watch a movie, do you want something to eat,would you like anything from the store are a few examples Of some things recently and the answer is always I don’t know. I’m not sure if she’s just being a smart ass but she seems genuinely almost indecisive. I’m not sure if this can be caused by a personality or anxiety disorder or maybe it’s just a weird thing for her but I would like to figure it out Because it can be impossible to deal with sometimes."
1322,Someone with whom you can be open,"I'm 19, since recent 10 months, I've totally lost reason to live another day. Multiple failures in academics, overthinking, sleepless nights, resulting in oversleeping, complete absence of interest in sports, movies and hanging out with friends which I used to love before. The absence of interest being so dense, couldn't even think of leaving my room.
And since all these months, I'm keeping it all to myself without letting anyone know, fear of being judged. There is a little discord between my parents so couldn't approach to them either, later considered being open to my friends irl about it, although I know they are the ones who will be friendly and supportive from front but talk shit behind the back. Next option were those few friends I made on internet, they seem to have similar way of thinking as me but since our communication is only through texts, it would be tough to convey the feelings without being judged as seeker. 

Really looking forward to get any possible advice, thanks in advance :)"
1323,I just got a series of flashbacks of all the bad stuff that happened during high school.,"I recently got unfollowed and unfriended by an ex-classmate from high school, which I kinda expected to happen as she always seemed like she subconsciously held a grudge against me. Even so it still saddened me that it actually happened. 

She used to have a harsher-than-normal attitude towards my actions and words when I was in the wrong. I have well-imprinted memories of her (and not just her) being judgemental, and that was what triggered a series of flashbacks in my mind about all the times when I fucked up and felt like the most socially unadapted person. I started to think ""when did it all go wrong?"" as the timeline went more and more into the past and kept replacing that moment [when it all went wrong] with another one.

Now I'm ashamed of myself. I feel like I can't escape my past and I'm doomed to always return to the same mistakes and bad behaviours. I always fail to improve my mental health in the long run. In a few moments I basically reverted to my 2017-2018 self when I was always staying in bed depressed and suicidal and feeling like the only solution would be to start life over as another person (obviously impossible)."
1324,Space for My Body (39),"Space for My Body (39)

Everyday is Different. Every Sleep is Different.

Some days my Body Feels Rested from 6 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 7:30am, Some days my Body Feels Rested from 8 hours of sleep where I will Wake up at 9:15am and Some days My Body Needs 10 Hours of sleep and i'll wake up close to 11:00am.

This used to make me feel shitty to be honest, that I have wasted part of my day that I could have been spending time towards my craft, or simply going through my morning routines. I have come to realize that Yes, Opportunities are great to captivate on and we can catch up on Sleep, but Sleep is the only way we will be able to continue chugging along on the highway. 

I have come to learn to follow how my body feels and allow myself to sleep more if needed, start slower if needed &amp; go at my own pace. I have realized that in the past and still sometimes now, when I am beating myself up, dwelling, feeling down or trying to rush through something, then thats me subconsciously comparing myself to someone else that I have seen on Social Media or this day to day set of requirements I have for myself, that happens subconsciously without even realizing it.

I have come to learn and make peace with going at my own speed and releasing the need of comparing myself to others, that I am not going fast enough or that I haven't gotten an opportunity that I want. It took for me to go through anxiety attacks &amp; mental breakdowns to realize that instead of enjoying the moment and the process, I was creating more tension and battles with myself. It all takes time and I know that it was all meant to be.

Give yourself the time needed. Give yourself the space needed. Give yourself the rest needed. Give yourself the fresh air needed. Enjoy the process and journey, rather than being obsessed with the destination. God/Higher Power/The Universe always has more in store than we think, that happens organically and effortlessly through dedicated hard work.

I love you.

1327,I am feeling hopeless and depressed,"I (18M) have been having a depressive feeling since 3 years. Actually it has worsened during this year. I no longer have the will to do anything which I have interest in such as playing guitar. I stopped listening to music (not kidding). I literally feel that I have hit my lowest at times. I don't feel confident anymore. I also don't feel like attending college lectures as well. In other words, I have lost interest almost everything. I have become very hopeless.

Plus I also don't have a girlfriend and I am a failure in love life as I have been rejected many times. Any girl who I start liking is already taken.

I also don't get proper sleep at night these days.

In simpler words, I don't feel like fighting anymore. I am very weary. Plus I cannot visit a therapist as I don't have money nor do I want to alert my parents

How do I get out of this feeling? Is there any hope for me?"

The issue is I have no frame of reference for how depression actually affects someone, at least not internally. This leads to me thinking I am inventing issues or misjudging normal teenaged angst for something far greater. It doesn’t help that I have been raised in such a way that the response to me talking about this was ‘that’s normal’ or ‘toughen up’. Naturally, because of this, I always assumed that the way I was feeling WAS normal. However these emotions have intensified lately. On two separate days I have been completely consumed by the desire to end my life, granted I am not unfamiliar with suicidal thoughts and have no intention to actually cause myself any permanent harm. On most days it takes immense effort to fulfill any of my responsibilities. It scares me, yet I can’t bring myself to talk to anyone about it as I didn’t think it fully possible I had any depressive disorder as I was still happy most of the time. I don’t know what is wrong with me, IF anything is wrong with me at all. Is it normal to experience happiness with depression? Is there any resources where I could anonymously reach out to a professional just to affirm that I do or do not have something I need to deal with professionally?

Sorry for the long rant and thank you to anyone who responds."
1329,"I(M17 now) got involved in some sort of long distance relationship with a girl(F16 now) who I started love only in 3 days. Things didn't go according to the way we wanted due to circumstances but now she's moved on and I'm still sad and missing her. I don't know what to do, please give me some tips.","I know this may sound more like a relationship problem, it is maybe. But I am just looking for a way to get into the right state of mind. 

So we met in November 2019, at 3 day competition/event and we had an instant attraction, I asked her (lets call her MS) out on the 3rd day and we went for a walk and had a nice time, but then her tutor found out she was not with the rest of her group and she got scolded and that put an end to our beautiful evening. Next day all teams had to leave, her team had to leave earlier so I packed up my stuff and got ready to say goodbye, hoping we would stay in touch when her phone got fixed (yea, she had dropped it and broke it earlier). But her tutor was eyeing us, like she was trying to strange us with her eyes or just throw us apart with telekinesis or smth, so we couldn't even say goodbye properly. And btw, she lives about 1400km away.

I couldn't get back in touch with her that easily, somehow I got the contact info of her best friend (lets call her CB). Apparently me and CB had a lot in common so we became good friends. CB assured me she would talk to MS about me.

2 Days later when CB got to talk to MS, I was informed MS was not interested in me anymore but she was willing to be friends. CB told me MS was coming to her house that Saturday so we can have a call. I wrote a letter before that, thinking she was having doubts because of the distance between us and the duration for which we had known each other for, assuring her we can work it out whatever it was. This made MS think about not having the call and it didn't take place in the end.

A few days later, when she got a new phone we were able to text. I tried to accept her no and be her friend but I kind of didn't want to let her go like that, I had somehow gotten too much with her during the 3 day long competition. She said no, telling me the distance was too great and stuff. She even told me she had someone new she liked and he liked her back. I was devastated. I tried accepting it, but somewhere deep down I wasn't satisfied with the reasons, they felt forced, as if trying to cover up smth. In the end, her mum found out she was talking to me and she had to block me off. MS told me she was from an orthodox family (she's follows Islam) and her parents lectured her that she could only see Islamic guys.

I tried accepting my fate, I couldn't. I know some of you will say ""No Means No"", I get it but please listen to the whole thing. I mean, I regretted not quietly accepting her request to be friends.

We were gonna meat again in Jan 2020 for the next round of the competition. I knew I had to come up with a plan in order to reignite her feelings for me. I planned an evening which would have served that purpose and it included me apologizing for being so desperate before and telling her how really I feel. I had my plan run through multiple girls (both kinds, with or without dating experience), All of them said it was perfect. And when we met in Jan and I asked her if we could meet up she said we can't if it's about what we were arguing on. Something snapped inside me, so I just said I wanted to apologize and I could do it during lunch the next day, and I did it, I apologized to her the next day.

I then tried to distract myself away from her, I was able to maintain my grades (yes, I'm at the top of all my classes, except chem). I started working out and thus went from chubby to fit (yes, real abs and biceps). But, I couldn't forget her. I saw 2 or 3 other girls after her but I stopped most of them after just a single date.

In July 2020, I started to lose it, I felt I had wasted my time doing other stuff and an important examination was just 6 months away. I felt the need to fix myself, so I tried doing other stuff. Also, me and CB had become best friends at this point of time. AD told me that I should stop fixating on her, like I hadn't tried. I was thinking that maybe a talk with MS

I ran a memepage on instagram before so due to CB following it and stuff, MS came across it too, not knowing that it was me who owned that page. I saw her profile pic and i felt it was MS (it wasn't very clear and stuff and the tag and the name weren't informative). I texted her asking if she was a friend of CB, and we had a little conversation (I told her my name and stuff but she didn't tell me hers, but we were very friendly and had fun). A few hours later CB told me it was MS and I was a bit shocked (but yes, i suspected it was her).

I tried to act normal with her and she was just her cheerful and happy self. I told her how I was doing good and miserable at the same time, and how I should have handled our encounter with more maturity. But she started blaming herself, started feeling guilty, an effect which I didn't intend to produce. This happened on day 1 when we started talking again.

On day 2 morning, she told me she could only imagine the pain she caused me. I told her it wasn't her fault. And then she began questioning me, like why was I still interesting in talking with her and what is her role in my life, I understood she was hurt. See, I had chained myself to not get emotional and tell her everything, but when she asked, I couldn't hold back. I told her everything. She said she felt relieved, she said she used to think I hated her and she couldn't face me ever again if we met. She even said ""I could just hug you rn"". I had no expectations when I told her how I felt but this reaction of her maybe gave me a little hope. She went to sleep after saying that as it was getting late (not for me tho, I usually study till 2 or 3 and I was literally dancing at 3 AM writing trigonometric equations on my whiteboard lol)

On day 3 morning, she told me whatever I told her, whatever effort I put into getting us back together was very sweet and lovely, but we couldn't be possible. She told me she kept trying to push me away because she saw herself falling for me hard in the future, but that would get us nowhere as it was not possible due to her family rules (religion and stuff). She said if I was a follower of Islam, she would run straight to me. And here I was, a heartbroken atheist. I tried finding ways we could still work, but she said I needed to be born into Islamic, conversion wouldn't do. I tried accepting it and being her friend. I thought I could at least keep her close as a friend, if not as a love interest. But she was almost caught chatting with me by her mum and she got scared, thinking she'll break her trust. And she said that both of us got a closure so we can end on a good note now probably.

I didn't want her to go but I reluctantly agreed. I cried a lot after that. I told my guy best friend (lets call him SS) everything and I give him the account details of my page so that he could see what happened, he got angry after he read the whole thing and he scolded me for talking with her and stuff, he said he was gonna have the last word and texted her and he said one thing ""If you ever wanna to talk to him, you gotta go through me"". And that was the end of it.

I finally had a satisfying reason for her saying no, but I accepted it. But, MS was still in my head. I even took a therapy session but that only helped a little. My functioning became worse, like I could do all tasks but my focus was lost. I became reluctant towards hard work.

Now I've got about 2 months left for my big exam but I'm not doing things properly, most of them are to distract me from MS. And yesterday when I brought up MS while talking to CB, CB told me MS felt threatened by what SS said, and was hurt by what all I said. I feel like I'm a terrible person.

I am just so confused right now, I know I've got to study and work for things but my mental state is not up to the mark for me do it. I can even take a drop year and work for the exam but that won't assure success because a drop year can take a toll on my mental health, and of course I need to be free of my current worries that affect my state of mind.

I just need some tips that can help me push MS out of my head. I don't want my abilities to go to waste, I have got skills and I can do pretty much everything but I won't be as happy and successful if I don't take the path where I am able to clear that exam."
1330,I hear my mother screaming in my head.,"I've had this problem since December 17th, 2014 when my mother screamed about how I will never have a future, that I'll never get a job with my attitude. It traumatized me, especially since it was after a mental breakdown I had during an exam. Even now, when I'm under stress, I just rehear her screaming about the failure I am. The money I'm wasting, that she regrets raising me the way she did, that I should stop crying. I just want it to stop, but I just can't when I know she'll yell at me once finding out my grade for the class I hated once I come home for Winter Break."
1331,Had a panick attack starting because of the meeting where no one even saw me.,"To give a context, I am a master's student and I am 30. I wanted to do a PhD since my first year of undergrads, but  moving to a different country made it impossible. Now I have family and doing master's is hard, I had to switch to part-time when the pandemic started and I had issues with childcare. But I still managed to get good (top) grades so far. 

Had a meeting today, when I was without the camera and mic even and people were discussing their projects and ongoing things. 

And then it hit me.."" you are 30, you are an immigrant, you have a family. You'll never get there loser, you're freaking outcast.."" 

Why is it so hard to give up an old and useless dream?"
1332,Hyper Empathy,"Hi! I have been trying to find resources or a community of people with similar struggles as me, so I thought I would post here. 

I am a 26 year old female, and for as long as I remember, I have been highly sensitive and I think I have been experiencing hyper empathy. I struggle to separate my thoughts and emotions from the people around me. The first time I can remember this happening was when I was 6 or 7 years old, and saw a little boy crying at a gymnastics center for kids. I remember being so worried and sad, even though I had no idea who this boy was or why he was crying. I started crying along with him. Since then, I feel like my struggle with empathy has become almost debilitating and has kept me from living a normal life. 

My empathetic feelings extend to people I don't know at the grocery store, all of my friends and family members, families of people that have died that I have never met, animals, and even inanimate objects. I often have panic attacks when I hear about missing pets. 

I often assign emotions to inanimate objects - for example, one time my husband threw away a frozen dinner because it tasted bad. I immediately started to feel sad and nervous, thinking that the food felt sad and dejected to be thrown away and not eaten. I feel sad seeing shopping carts left out in the middle of nowhere, balloons flying away into the sky, and things like that. Last night while playing World of Warcraft with my husband, the sound of a creature dying in the game made me nauseous and sad, because it felt so real to me. 

I am seeing a therapist for anxiety and PTSD - however, he is unsure why I feel these extreme empathetic feelings and I think he is not sure how to help with it. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Are there ways to cope with it? I just feel like I absorb every emotion from everyone around me and I don't know where I end and where they begin. I know empathy is good, but I wish I was able to separate myself from people around me in a healthy way."
1333,I’m Not a Loser for Choosing Medication,"I’m tired of choosing medication being made to look like a regrettable choice. That somehow I’m not as “victorious” because I couldn’t make it without meds. Look, if someone can I think that’s great, but I don’t think they should be put on a pedestal as someone who made it. I’m a 46 year old mom and dammit I’m just as victorious. Yes I’m on medication for my OCD, depression, and schizophrenia. So what?! I’m still here, my kids still have their momma and to me a win is a win. I hope you don’t feel ashamed if you’re on meds. You shouldn’t."
1334,"Selflessness vs ""People pleasing""","Buddhist advice says:

""When we live a life of me first, then life will rarely go our way. But when we live a life of living for others, serving others, doing for others, then we receive a deeper sense of joy, a deeper sense of fulfillment.""

However, in psychology, caretaking is a symptom of codependency.

""If someone else has a problem, you want to help them to the point that you give up yourself. It’s natural to feel empathy and sympathy for someone, but codependents start putting other people ahead of themselves.""

Who is right and who is wrong? Or is there something I am not understanding here?

1335,Going no where in life,"Hey guys hows it going, this is my first time ever posting on this subreddit so let me know if I've used the wrong flair or some something wrong. Anyway, As the title says I just cant see a future for myself right now, to make a long story short I suffer with severe anxiety that has crippled me for the better part of almost 5 years now, I've seen many doctors and have exhausted all options but they still refuse to put me on medication becuase of my age. (19 male btw)
The worst of my anxiety is about working, I've been out of a job for well over a year now and whenever a new opportunity has come up I've made ways to get out of it. It's not just work though I have this anxiety for everything possible from a doctor appointment to just catching up with family or something. I've been in therapy and I thought that was going good (side note, I have a really big problem with plans being canceled at the last minute) but then at the last possible second my therapist canceled on me after I had already driven all the way to the clinic, after that something just broke in me, I was on centrelink until recently becuase they have canceled my plan for not reporting mine and my partners working hours on time but there are reasons for that which arent very important but I just cant bring myself to call them and fix it. Look I could go on for hours and hours and hours about everything going wrong in my life right now and the amount of stress I feel like I'm under but realistically I'm not. Honeslty I'm just a quitter and a loser, I dont deserve to be treated as amazinging as I am but I just have no where else to go or atleast I think I dont. I'm at the end of my rope here (not suicidal) I just dont know what to do. I cant break the cycle of this anxiety and I know the answer is just ""do it"" or ""get over it it's just a feeling itll pass"" it's just not that simple for me. I feel terror when I have this anxiety, absolute horror and its killing me. Anyways that's all I have time for right now haha, goodnight everyone. (If anyone has some advice for me itd be greatly appreciated!)"

1337,Pets and Psychiatric Stays,"Hello...

So I have recently realized I need to get help for my mental health due to some reoccurring thoughts. I want to get help, but I am scared how to without feeling a ton of worry about my pets. I don't work so I am home all day everyday. I have ten pets whom I care and love. They are my babies, but I don't know anyone who would be willing to help my significant other care for my pets while I am in the hospital. I have been trying to get into the outpatient treatments, but they all recommend I do impatient for better help faster. My pets range from an umbrella cockatoo to dogs, cats, rabbits, and reptiles so they have their own needs as well as individual attention needed. With the way life is now I can manage my pets by myself and my partner adds extra attention and love when they get off of work, but as time goes on I am not only neglecting myself, but my pets. I am not someone who wants to hurt my babies. I just can not bring myself to get out of bed to play with them or give them their proper attention. I DO NOT want to get rid or re-home my pets because they give me purpose and each help me in their own way. I just want to get some advice on how I can help my partner even though I will be in the hospital. I feel like giving up on treatment so I don't have to leave my pets."

&amp;#x200B;

My therapist just sent this to me, and it summed up things pretty well. You can overcome depression/ anxiety, etc, and it doesn't have to last a lifetime. Talk to someone that is safe, where you can feel you can be vulnerable with them and they can support you. It's amazing to me that this was 7 years ago; I feel like it's time the stigma really went away."
1342,i feel like im half asleep all the time and my memory sucks,"it's getting really hard to remember things now (im a teenager). like it's not only losing my train of thought when talking, i keep on forgetting what im thinking and saying for every single sentence. sometimes its hard to string sentences together in my head. its hard to remember what i did just ten minutes ago. its hard to remember what class i have next period even if its been a few months already. both my long term and short term memory suck ass. its not like im slow or dumb really. like im in the most challenging courses at school. but now, when i take tests, its hard to remember what the topic is on even if i studied a lot. and this happens every single hour or every day, its not like an occasional thing.

sometimes my brain feels all sluggish and floaty too. reality feels kinda warped and i feel half asleep. sometimes the whole day goes by and im unsure of what was going on and if my brain was even awake. I've been having a lot of sleep problems too so i feel like im half asleep whenever im not actually sleeping. sometimes i wonder if i should make an effort to focus on the reality around me because it doesn't even feel real."
1343,How can I help my cousin?,"Hello.

So my cousin recently moved back into my state with his mom. He was living with other family. We had been texting because he was looking for a job and my work is always hiring. He seemed interested but suddenly stopped responding. This worried me as he had told me he had been feeling depressed since moving back.

After maybe a month of texting him with no response and having other family members try with the same results I messaged his mom. She sent me a message that basically said he’s only depressed because he’s lazy and that she gets depressed to but she still goes to work. She told me he doesn’t leave his room and all he does is play video games.

The judgement shocked me. He’s depressed to the point he’s not leaving his room but she doesn’t seem to care. I’ve talked to my cousin and he has a lot of aspirations. I don’t see laziness in him, but I do see that he’s overwhelmed and depressed. He’s also living with his stepdad who he doesn’t like. I understand depression, I’ve been depressed, and I’m worried about him.

How can I help him? I don’t want him to feel so alone and I’m worried what spending all day in the house with his mom and stepdad must be doing to him."
1344,"Tearing off my hair, burning and bruising myself, help?","(I am copypasting this from a different sub) So, I have been tearing off chunks of my hair, scratching myself with knifes, gouges and even my own fingernails until my whole arm is covered with scratches, burning small patches of skin with ice and salt, punching myself with objects to cause bruises and forcing myself to puke. The only thing I haven't done yet is cutting myself because I'm afraid someone might notice.
What do I do? I think I deserve all of this but at the same time I don't think I can continue. I know I should talk to a therapist but I can't find one right now and I can't call emergency services or anything of the sort, I don't have anyone else to ask for help.
At this point I would gladly go into a psych ward but I doubt it would help and I can't go anywhere either way, any advice is appreciated."
1345,Guilt and shame over past mental illness,"I've been in a very good place for the past 1.5years now, almost feel like a healed person. I'm now 17, but all the way from early teenage years i suffered from depression, anxiety and just a really dark state of mind with very dark toughts. At the time it just felt like nothing when i tought of all this terrific stuff but now, the idea that it was normal to me at the time it freaks me out.

Whenever i think about this fact it gives me such an overwhelming rush of guilt and shame. This is really the ONLY factor preventing me from fully healing until further notice, i really hit a stop sign in my progress cause this is overwhelming. I know i'm not that person anymore but i still feel the constant guilt/shame. If anyone has some ideas i would appreciate so much."

Was told if it was refused I would have to do a resit (which I don't mind) but I haven't even been informed of whether it had been refused or not. I contacted the wellbeing team a few days back. No reply. I totally feel like giving up and focusing on getting better physically and mentally in my own time. I feel like a non entity at university right now and would rather just focus my time on volunteering and trying to help those who actually need it. I am so disillusioned with the whole system.

I haven’t self harmed in around 10 days. Last time was  from a 1.5 year ‘break’ from it. Apart from today, that is. At school. I went to the “toilet” at lunch and cut my arm. I’m fucked up. I’m sorry. 

I have been getting suicidle thoughts for a while now, probably 2 years. I am diagnosed (there is a few): ADHD, PTSD, Depression, Bipolar and Severe Anxiety. I am medicated.

1350,"worsening memory, not remembering whole periods","I’m 17F, used to have amazing memory, having only needing to pay attention in class to remember content. Of course, I still needed to study to get good grades, but I could think clearly and rationally. Recently though (around midway through age 16), I feel like my memory has been terrible and my head all cloudy. I started to lose motivation to do literally everything, and sometimes also struggle to get out of bed. Been almost a year since school started, and I find myself not being able to remember most of the first semester, along with a good deal of the second semester as well. I do take notes in class, and refering back to them just gets me even more confused because my brain just couldn’t process anything. I know i’m not dumb, I have had people tell me that I was fast and sharp in catching things (I doubted it though, only accepted it after arnd 5 people told me that). I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and I also feel like i’m tired all the time. Recently started drinking coffee too (never really did before), but it doesnt keep me awake. Talking to people is exhausting and so is going to school, so much so that I skipped a few days just to stay home and eat, sleep, game.

my brain doesn’t work. It doesn’t feel right. it feels like I can’t access anything past that wall of cloud and it’s bothering me so much because I know what’s behind and I know what I’m capable of and yet I can’t get there even though I have been there before. It sucks so much because I just can’t remember and can’t comprehend anything in my daily life. Important things like exam and presentation dates and content I can forget even right after I went through it or someone told me about it. I find troubles even stringing together basic sentences and I feel like my english and speaking capabilities are dropping rapidly. I’ve grown much more short tempered than I used to be, grown to be more emotion driven (I hate it, I hate how many things I do aren’t logical and even though I know, I can’t pull myself away from doing it), and been getting increasingly frequent bouts of headaches. 

I feel so tired and yet I can’t sleep...

Everything that’s happening with my head has also affected the people around me, especially the people I have to work with for projects because I constantly forget even the simplest things and things we have learnt ages ago and have been doing for months, and I also constantly have such bad headaches that I can’t actively take part in discussions. Many times I just zone out and lose focus, even though I have so much I want to say (but can’t). 

I need to know how to improve my memory back to where I was before, and how to start thinking more clearly, critically and rationally again. Maybe I should go see a pro, but idk, idh money and I hate going out so... also public transport is terrifying, especially during peak hours, how do y’all take it everyday without dying internally?"
1351,Anxiety - Celexa Buspirone,"Hello, I have had years of anxiety and occasional panic attacks.

1353,"I think I need therapy. Im sick and tired of living like this. DESCRIPTION IS A LONG READ, thank you for taking the time to read.","

I’m 22, male. I’ve been putting this off for a year. My grandma is the only person I tell everything to and she insists I need to go. I seem to have a problem with everything and it’s annoying. I have the best job in the world make incredible money and am unhappy here, I don’t like my coworkers but live my job and the facility. My sex life and dating life is non existent for reasons I won’t publicly announce. I struggle with my religion and faith in god which takes a toll on my mental state, I just can’t seem to drag myself into church knowing damn well I will feel much better if I do, but I don’t for some reason. My father is incredibly narccistic and manipulative  it’s so toxic. I’m stuck in a trap of constantly going to him for approval. My mom constantly asks me about girls and comments on my weight, it’s passive bullying so in return I rebel and am over weight, and push women away. I love my parents to death and they are great but god they can irritate me. I’m not even happy to receive a call from my mom anymore and I can’t stop calling my father for some reason I think I need to keep him updated on what I’m doing. I have so many issues that are all just crashing together and it’s enough. I have a good friend group but don’t see them much anymore out of fear of judgement even though I know inside they still like me because there’s nothing actually wrong with me. I want to be happy, because I live a damn good life, and should be living it to the fullest. I just have to get out of this slump. Is it time for me to see a therapist? I’ve always thought therapists were a sales pitch to keep you coming back so ive stayed away. And always sorta thought therapy was for girls. My father is a tough guy hard ass type, never let me get away with shit, always on my ass throughout school, now in adult life and financially still riding my ass about shit all the time,  so I was raised to suppress my emotions because I didn’t want him to think I was weak or couldn’t handle myself. He put me on adderall to focus in school and sent me to all these extra curricular classes in summer to help my brain which as a child didn’t help, it just made me feel different from the rest and hate school. I felt stupid as a kid because I couldn’t even do school right. But I’m now starting to see that if my father had not treated me that way and instead maybe found another way to get me motivated to learn rather than putting me on pills and extra classes that I could’ve actually did well in school. I’ve always thought there’s something wrong with me and never comfortable in my own skin. I’ve NEVER been able to be myself around a group of people, I’m always hiding my authentic self. I just want to wake up happy to be me for once I’m crying now as I write this of course.  I’m just a mess. Sorry for the long read I just don’t know where else to go"
1354,Is this normal? I feel like my reality changes often. I’m worried I’m delusional,"For example, if I’m watching a video of whales, it’s like I become a whale too, or I at least feel the environment and emotions of whatever I’m watching. When the video is over I have to remind myself that I am a human and never was a whale. Sometimes when I have a reality change like this I can breakdown. Whenever I force myself to come out of whatever imaginative world I’m in in my head, I breakdown/get depressed. I have a hard time accepting what is actually happening now and the only way to feel happy is to let myself live in my head"
1355,Anyway to get diagnosed?,"To start, im 16 and not in the position to see a psychiatrist. My parents just respond ""its just hormones"". I legitimately think i might be bipolar, or something similar. Is there any other way to get a diagnosis on this? My apologies if this isnt the correct place to ask. I live in America if thats important"
1356,Rape and the past,I’m not sure if this is the right place to post about this. If this isn’t please feel free to guide me to the right subreddit. Everyone who has been raped has a different rape experience. I was raped by someone I trusted. Someone who I thought I loved...my own boyfriend at the time 😔 I never got justice and his mother condoned the behavior. Has anyone ever questioned why in their head that happened to them? Wanted to personally ask that person why they did that to you? What was going through their head that made them feel like it was okay to do the disgusting things they did to you for months?
1357,.....,"i am 20 and i feel like im ruining my own life , i didnt manage to finish a university , i have a dead end job that i hate , recently i had a motorcycle accident that dislocated my shoulder last nightt i was hit with a baseball bat and might loose the vision in my left eye , i have abusive parents that were beating me up since i was a teen , i just feel like things are getting worse and worse for me like im just falling apart every time i make a step foward in myy life i end up making 2 steps backwords , i hate myself i know my mental health is really bad i know that becouse of my parents beating me up i have problems with memory but not only that i always get into trouble throue not my own fault i just dont know what to do .

1359,Help with eating and drinking when I get overwhelmed with depression/anxiety?,"A few days ago I left a 6+ year long abusive relationship.  One of the worst parts of what I’ve been going through is that when I’m not doing well, I feel like I physically can’t eat or drink anything.  
It makes me feel twice as bad when I go days with eating almost nothing and barely forcing a few sips of water here and there.  
I’m hoping to find some advice on how others deal with this."
1360,I hate withdrawal,"Sometimes when my friends are on call, I have to withdraw from it to cope with symptoms but when I withdraw I feel even worse as it feels like I’m missing out. Either way, it only gets worse."
1361,I need some help,"I'm a 15 year old living in Switzerland and I've been having suicidal thoughts and have been self harming for 4 years. I know I need help but my parents don't believe me. 

I think I need to be admitted to a mental hospital but I dont know how to do it and I'm scared. I don't know if I need a parents approval or if I can just go

I've finally recognized I need to seek treatment but I'm having a hard time finding the next step.
If you have any answer or information please tell me, I'm really lost about what to do"
1362,I'm having suicidal thoughts,"First off, let's be VERY clear. I (21M) am not having suicidal tendencies. I have no intention of killing myself. I live by a strict moral code to try to prevent harm to people (including myself).

Honestly, my life isn't even that bad. I have a pretty good family, I enjoy my evenings with my friends. Yeah work can be stressful (I work in fast food), but I love (most of) the crew there and consider them family.

However, occasionally the thought of suicide just creeps into my mind at the when I am having a bad time doing something. I keep trying to dismiss it because the thought of it is ridiculous. I would never attempt that. Usually, it lasts for a n hour at most, but I know that my mind shouldn't be dwelling on those thoughts.

I don't want to tell any of my friends or family because I know they will worry unnecessarily (my Dad might not even think I am serious) but I know that there are so many more things to experience in life (I am also a Christian, so I firmly believe that I have a purpose).

I don't know what to do, I am able to withstand the temptation, but I don't know how to stop the thoughts."
1363,Being held to impossible standards.,"I found myself in deep thought about the social constructs that inherently affect our behavior on a day to day. Social norms, cultural norms, financial frameworks, accepted behavior. All these preconceived notions about what face you should present to society as opposed to who you truly are. Now I understand there are exceptions to this in the extremes, but on a radar more closer to the mid left and right of a spectrum, this is a very common pressure on us as individuals. Especially in a world where actions are scrutinized to the niche detail. 

I found this train of thought somewhat of an epiphany. While I didn't immediately find myself disconnecting from such expectations, the very fact of self awareness has led me to see things in a different light and helped with mental stability when it comes to just being kind to myself.

I'm not always the best at ""speaking"" about these things that go on inside my brain. But I do write and compose about it. This is just something you can chose to listen to if you want. This is no marketing gimmick lol. Something I just wrote as ""self therapy"" and maybe it might resonate with someone out there. :)

1366,Somewhat of a hypocrisy,"Everyone is talking about Transgender day as well as other LGBT/Minority days yet it's funny how society also disregards those with mental disabilities. But I must admit there are a couple of fair points that make them do so. The main factor being that society tends to focus on the negatives, most prominent example is that a lot of mentally ill people do a lot of bad things as a result of their disabilities, unlike the LGBT community and minorities who are mentally stable. Though they overlook those who have disabilities but aren't as insane, such as myself. That's why nobody talks about or acknowledges us."
1367,Can u be depressed and not sad?,"I dont want to do anything, im unmotivated, im tired mentally and physically all the time for no reason, im always zoned out, distracted and in my own world. I dont care about anything, I wish i could delete myself from the planet sometimes temporarily, I fantasize about lifting the floors up and crawling under it and using the ground as a blanket to hide under. I dont clean, cook, or even make my own lunch for school.  
I have 2 friends, i only like talking to them, i can socialise like any normal person but i never click with anyone but my 2 best friends. 
Im so talented (genuinely not trying to brag) everywhere i go everyone says i have so much potential and im wasting it because im so careless. 
im not sad or anything, i have a great life and all, im just confused, is there something wrong with me or am i just lazy?"
1368,i don’t know what to do,"i feel like an alien in my own body, i’ve tried eating better and exercising more (like they tell you to in those mental health ads) but that didn’t change anything, it feels like i’m living in a world completely alone and i can’t fit in. i spend all my time complaining about how sad i am but i’m too scared to help myself because of what i will become if i get better. it’s like i’m bad at everything i try and i can’t get better. i’m incredibly paranoid and the littlest noice and movement can set me off into an hours long spiral of how i am going to die due to a mass murderer. I feel stupid and an outsider, i treat everyone angrily and aggressively for no reason because it’s how i feel, meaning i have little to no friends on top of just starting a new school  during  the global wide pandemic, i am always overthinking every little thing and i can’t get over the smallest things people say. when i bring it up to my parents that i can’t fit in they say because i  [16f] will grow out of it but i’ve been like this for as long as i can remember, i have the attention span of a fish that plus my dyslexia and i am terrible at school you get me who never won anything and the teachers didn’t know my name. i loose my temper so easily. i spend a lot of my time thinking about what would happen if i didn’t exist. although i’m too much of a pussy to kill myself i have  a too low pain threshold. i would like for the world to just stop for a minute i have a constant headache and i just wanna fit in."
1369,things are rough right now,"tw: s/h

my parents don’t believe in mental illness. i’ve struggled on and off for years. they let me get therapy for like a month after i did some stuff to myself. never anything super bad, but i felt i had to do it for them to take me seriously. 

im in a bad patch again right now, so much has happened to everyone this year, and on top of covid stress a lot has happened in my personal life. i’m about to shave my head, as an example, to get them to take me seriously once again. i really need therapy and maybe even a psychiatrist. 

just wanted to ask how to stay positive when i have no support system basically? my friends don’t really get my issues or offer the support i need, and i can’t talk to my family about it, so i’ve been slowly secluding myself from people, but like i really miss my friends and just wish somebody i knew in real life could help me out."
1370,Identity crisis and depression in a biracial kid,"I never would kill myself but I do wish i had just never been born. I wish every day I wake up I had been born differently.

My mom is white American and my dad is non white south Asian. Not American. I look mixed but my skin tone is more so tannish and I have dark hair and dark eyes. I grew up American and in a white family as I never really knew my dad. However to the world I’ll never be truly what I feel I am as a human. My identity and group belongingness will always be questioned by the world and I’ll always be tagged with stereotypes that I don’t associate with or cultural norms I don’t associate with.

I don’t live in the United States. I live in Europe. And I hate that I tell people I’m American and their first question is “but um what are your parents”. And I have to explain idk why that my mom is white and my dad is south Asian and from then on no matter who I am as an individual, my identity is just tagged as south Asian. I’ve never been to South Asia or know the language or culture or anything. I feel I am white because that is the only part of me I’ve ever associated with and while I may not 100% look it, it is what I feel I am. But I’m not, simply because I don’t 100% look it. 

I hate hate hate people who aren’t even white and look more white than I do. And this might partially be due to internalized racism with my white grandparents always hating and saying derogatory things about my brown paternal family, but also because I grew up a very white child and as I grew older, my skin started tanning more and my hair darkened and suddenly my identity and social belongingness were always a matter of question. 

I’m just in a huge state of identity crisis to the point where I just often wish I had never been born. I don’t have any culture or peoples. I just hate the world never letting me forget for even a moment that I am not fully a member of the group I feel I belong to."
1371,Can you please tell me what the hell is this??!,"Alright, so I've noticed very small and slight patterns of OCD in my personality since I was quite young. I've never really done anything about it since I was aware of the fact that it mostly had to do and was related to low self confidence that over time as I grew older thankfully got a lot better. However today still, whenever I have to present myself to the world let's say through pictures or even worse videos, something terrible kicks in, and takes over me. I'm writing this post after I had to complete an online job interview by submitting a 40 sec presentation of myself. 

When I read video submission of myself I knew right away. I thought though, alright let's give it a try maybe it'll be better this time maybe I'll manage, and I'll do this stupid thing in one take. Yeah right, sweet dreams. It took me almost 2 hours, 2 hours to finally say okay I think, with emphasize on I think I have it. In the making of my video I've bumped into the following issues : not liking my voice in one, not liking my face in the other, not liking the tone I was using to say words in another one, not liking the way I blink, not liking my side eye, not liking how I open my mouth and so on. Yes, I know how this sounds, these are not metaphors, these were all real reasons why I stopped and redid it again and again and again. At one point I thought okay I have it, then something deep inside compelled me so strongly to give it another take, and another and another, because it's not good enough, it can be better. This is why I'm linking this issue to OCD I believe. Because of that strong feeling of not being able to stop. Please be so kind to tell me and let me know what do you think this is?? It's killing me sometimes and makes me hate myself. It's unacceptable to literally loose 2 hrs of my life and my time over something so stupid and insignificant. I know that from the outside it looks like I have huge confidence issues, but generally speaking with people, friends, going out, I'm not shy, awkward or unsure at all. I love socializing and I generally have a good opinion of myself in healthy way so I don't struggle with it externally only internally and just when it comes to things like this - pictures, videos, projects etc. Anything through which I have to prove myself. I'm make a too big deal of it even though literally no one cares that much. I'm sickly harsh with myself and have a dose of perfectionism in personality that rockets through the sky sometimes as presented above. Sadly, whenever we send videos back and forth with my friend who knows me deeply and closely, I'm the same. Not as bad, but do so many takes, that that's why I generally and normally refuse to partake in things like that completely. Is it anxiety, is it OCD what the hell is this? Needless to say I'm terribly confused."
1372,Cptsd? Schizophrenia? Severe anxiety? What is wrong with me?,"Hi everyone! I know this isn't a diagnostic tool but I was hoping someone would help me shed some light with their experiences! 

For the last 6 years I have experienced auditory hallucinations as well as delusions, the behaviour that manifested from these was anxiety and ocd. I experience thought broadcasting and an intense fear I'm being watched my dead people.

I was referred under cmht 6 months ago when the delusions were quite bad. I had an initial assessment but they needed a more indepth one to determine that I am not suffering with psychosis. At this time I was told the working diagnosis was schizophrenia, which fits.

After my more indepth assessment they concluded I was not currently experiencing psychosis, which I agree, and have said they believe it may be cptsd.... which I don't agree? I've had traumatic life experiences but do not have flashbacks, do not avoid them, do not feel stressed when thinking about them. Also cptsd does not explain the hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. 

Could it be severe anxiety? 

I just don't want to do this eye movement therapy they want me to do if its not going to help. I want the fear to stop.

I'm currently on antipsychotics and they have told me to stay on them...
I just don't know what to do! 

Anyone here have cptsd but didn't think they had it? Is that what you were struggling with the whole time? If looking back on traumas is going to stop the paranoia I will absolutely do it! But it just doesn't feel right? 

Sorry in advance for the essay!"
1373,Can any of you recall specific MINOR events that are responsible for fears you currently have?,"I think I have identified the source of all mine. Most of my fears don't come from actual trauma, but minor events that occurred when I was extremely young. Apparently, when I was young enough that these seemingly insignificant events shaped my worldview.

1.  **Spiders** - when I was two, my mom brought out a large drum that contained our Christmas decorations. When she opened it, she yelled in a panic for me to step back. My little mind interpreted it as ""RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN"" and I ran outside screaming from the hundreds of baby spiders that crawled out of the drum as she opened it.
(note: I know most people can't remember that far back, but I do have brief images, probably due to my parents' ongoing divorce at the time)
2. **Roller coasters/maybe heights in general** - my dad took me on the Texas Giant roller coaster when I was six. It ruined roller coasters forever for me.

3. **Thalassaphobia - fear of large underwater expanses and the creatures that reside there.** - one day I had an epiphany and realized that the following scene in The Little Mermaid was probably responsible. It still gives me chills.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GlyhNjckOQ

4. **Childhood nightmares of people being crushed/inability to watch people be crushed in movies.**
The [Superman 3 junkyard fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ5sMUzf2bo) was pretty intense for someone as young as I was when I saw it. 


So what about you all? I'm interested to hear about minor childhood experiences that contributed to legitimate and longstanding fears."
1374,I really need help.,"Ever since I could remember I have had constant butterflies, as a child I was bullied and went through some extremely traumatic experiences, I get frequent panic attacks and eat my skin as a hoping mechanism. I have delusions sometimes and become so paranoid that I don't trust family members because I get worried that they will hurt me or they have alterior motives, I feel like that about random people too sometimes. my face looks emotionless and I feel numb if I don't feel anxious, when I have an anxiety breakout my emotions heighten extremely and i get very angry and then quickly very apologetic, it seems to be what damages most of my friendships and anything more than that. If i get too annoyed I scratch my face up and rip my hair apart, sometimes bite myself. I have tried telling my school but they blamed puberty despite me feeling like this before puberty, and my parents undermine how I feel about it a lot and refuse to get me help. I am extremely reliant on other people sometimes to the point I feel like my life is over if I lose them, and I don't know what to do with myself. Particularly a girl I have liked for 2 years. I just don't wanna lose anybody and become alone again. How do I get proper help as a 15 year old alone, I have tried the hotlines but they just dont help and school counselling didn't do much either. Does anybody know what I could be experiencing or how I could get help? It is worsening day by day now"
1375,I have five mental disorders and I’m surviving so can you...❤️,Love yourself
1376,It DOES get better,"So, it’s been a year since my complete breakdown, and I just wanted to share what were my thoughts then. I’m better, it still comes back the depression, anxiety and all but I learned to manage it. I’ve stopped seeing my psychiatrist in the summer and still going strong. No medication any more. 
So here are my thoughts exactly one year ago.  It’s very long so if you’re willing to read it prepare. 

Hi, my name is Vesta  and I’m 17years old

When I was a child I was thee happiest girl ever. I liked my curly hair, I liked my blue eyes, I liked everything about me. I loved myself. As I grew older my problems became bigger. What a shocker. I became depressed, I started fearing people and social events. I started seeing myself differently. Big nose, small lips, eyes, ears, chubby cheeks, weak jawline, yellow teeth, fat legs, arms, tummy, my stupid ugly hair. To add up to that my very own father called me names, yelled at me... sometimes punched me. He was raging sometimes so bad i couldn’t even explain. I tried to run away several times. After a while he acted like nothing happened. Like he didn’t call me a bitch, a slut, a dumb whore who will never find someone to love me. Imagine hearing that almost every day and much more. Because of him I fear men, I am afraid of love, even with close friends. I fear people, I cry for the smallest things. I flinch every time he raises his voice just a tiny bit. Every time a person raises their voice. Some  say I have to ignore what he does. And stay silent. But if I stay silent for one more day I’m gonna go insane. And ahh I don’t know. I get so emotional talking about this topic. I don’t know. Some people say I should love my dad still, no matter what he does. How can I do that? How can I forget everything he did? 

And yes maybe not all my problems are because of him. I would say around 80% are. 
I was always an outcast. Not gonna lie i am the same today. Tbh I don’t really know what I plan to do with this series. I just want to document my recovery road to better me I guess. The first step. Telling I love myself. I love everything about me. It’s that simple right? No. Iiit’s haaard. I doubt every time I do or say something. How can I believe that I love myself. Soo the first step is to say it more and try to believe my words. The next step is to locate a good psychiatrist to find my problems and decide what to do next. Then I want to be less dependent on my friends and people in general. I want to be able to be alone because i like being alone not gonna lie. The thing is I just can’t bear being with my own problems. I just can’t. My mind goes dark like really dark. Like suicidal bad. Yes I thought of doing bad things to myself, I thought of dying. To sum it up I want to change my life completely.

I always doubt if I’m a good person, a good friend. Maybe someone can be a better friend and they don’t need me. Maybe I’m to clingy. I act out on my feelings a lot, maybe I shouldn’t hug them maybe I shouldn’t say I care for them or love them. I should stay away. Yes that’s better for them. I never want to bother them. I always ask if they’re not bored of me or tired. I ask about that a lot. It’s really toxic. I hate that but I can’t help it. I try my best to control it but I need help. I lost several friends. I lost a lot of friends. I lost very close friends twice. The second time was recent. It’s not mostly my fault. Of course I can say I’m not always right and all that. Everyone is like that. 
It not about that tho. It’s about that feeling of not being loved. Like, I am friends with really cool people I trust them I call them my best friends, and they go on and turn their back on me. Then I come back to that one sentence my father always told me... no one will love you. No one will want you to be their friend. No. It not like that. My mind keeps telling me that. 

In fact my mind keeps telling me to stop this stupid thought of trying to change. To write my feelings out. To make a series out of it. I’m not able of doing that. It’s declining every thing I wanted to do.  

Even tho I had thoughts about death I am afraid of dying. When I was was younger I didn’t go to sleep because I thought I wouldn’t wake up. I kinda grew out of it. But till this day there were a few times where I cried my eyes out because I thought I was not going to wake up. One was very recent. Last night. I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. Why? Because I always try to find what’s wrong with me. My stomach hurts, it’s cancer need to go to the doctor and see if everything is alright. My head hurts, I have a tumour and so on. 

My emotions are... there. I get angry very easily. Sometimes for very very very stupid stuff. Then later one minute I can be really happy. Oh wait you’re happy? Now you’re sad. You want to cry your eyes out.  And it repeats and changed constantly. Sometimes I feel numb like there’s nothing in the world that can change it. I sometimes can’t get out of bed. School is a nightmare. I can’t concentrate. I’m afraid of being bullied. I have had several mental break downs there, panic attacks, anxiety attacks. You name it. Tbh I had them outside school too. At home, at parties. 

I love being reckless till I don’t. I sometimes drink till I black out. Smoke. It’s dumb I know. But sometimes that the only thing that brings me joy. It makes me feel happy. Like nothing is wrong. 

I think everything is wrong with me. But that’s not gonna stop me from being or at least trying to be happy."
1377,Can someone explain the differences?,"I've been looking up online and feel like I've been relating to alot of derealization. Is this a symptom or a whole thing on its own?

I went to a doctor yesterday to get a mental health plan and he has put down Adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety.

I understand that it is due to stress build up but I haven't found things saying part of the derealization is a symptom of it. I've also read that the doctors usually just put adjustment disorder as they aren't sure at first and would need to see you more to get a more precise diagnosis.

Wondering what the differences are of these things."
1378,Online therapy suggestions?,"Does anyone have any personal reccomendations for online therapy platforms? I've been browsing for a week and its really overwhelming. Most places make you sign up and and pay before you can even see what the platform is all about and what it offers.
I'm looking for text therapy, not videos or phone calls, probably a weekly session to start. 
Does anyone have any reccomendations that are affordable?"
1379,"I have been diagnosed with GAD 4 years ago. I have been on sertraline for 3 years now. However, I really hated the side effects. I could have sex for hours with no orgasm, insomnia, and weight gain.","I decide to taper off by myself to 50mg per week (I was prescribed 100mg daily). Thankfully, the side effects are still there but not as bad. I had gastrointestinal issues for years, but as soon as I got prescribed Xanax, those problems disappeared. I had an MRI, thought I had a liver problem, but it was purely associated with anxiety. I also have shaky hands, elevated heartrate, hypersudation, and difficulty concentrating. Once I take Xanax, all those things go away. Imagine having difficulty orgasming from ages 18-21. Would not wish GAD on my worst enemy honestly. I am a 3rd year med student and anxiety is badly impacting me. My question is should I continue using Xanax during my month of exam prep or not. The addiction part is the only thing scaring me."
1380,I’m too tired of getting attached to emotionally unavailable people,"I’ve always been attracted to or attached myself to emotionally unavailable people and it’s getting so exhausting. I honestly don’t know how to deal with it. I’m afraid I’ll end up ruining friendships because of this.

What should I do? Is there a way for me to slowly stop this habit ?"
1381,I’ve realised I can’t cry,"To put it shortly, I don’t remember exactly how we got on the topic, but we got onto the topic of mental health and shitty parents and self harm. I dont know why, but I told them everything. I’ve never been one to just straight up tell people I don’t talk to a lot about anything like that. Thankfully they knew how I felt- and asked me why I didn’t tell someone- or if I had anyone. I didn’t. And I told them that. After the conversation was over they kept asking me if I was okay- they were worried for me. But I just said yeah- I was. Of course I felts little sad, but it was nothing out of the usual- and now when I feel down, I can’t cry, I just change the subject- I act normal- like I’m completely fine with how my life is. It’s so shit- why can’t I cry- why can’t I just have a shred of emotion to show- I told them everything with almost no emotion- just a mocking tone- shouldn’t I feel more- knowing my family thinks I’m crazy, and that I have no one I can talk to. Shouldn’t I just be thinking I’m so hard done by? Maybe it’s because she’s told I’m not so many times, it’s finally kicked in, but either way, it’s shit, knowing I can’t feel anything- I can’t cry, so things just get worse, and I’m wondering when things will get better. But it’s just getting worse- and I can’t convey it, while I watch people with similar experiences break down, and I just can’t. I feel like a fraud. It’s just utter bullshit"
1382,Switching from propranolol PRN to sustained release?,"Hi everyone, 
I've been taking propranolol PRN 40mg up to three times a day for around a year now and feel as thought they never worked. I had a doctors appointment this morning and they have prescribed me propranolol 160mg slow release? How is this different? Will it affect me any differently? I'm not sure what to expect and I'm a bit worried about situations where I feel like I need PRN but obviously can't because this is a one dose a day tablet 
Thank you!"
1383,Can anyone please help me?,"I am like the living dead at this point, I don't get even the most basic things done. My depression has made me paralysed, just freaking bed-ridden. 

I just need advice, I don't know, a magical solution, to help me get up and just get the fucking things I have to do done. Ugh, someone who went through this recently but managed to get out of bed.. like seriously how did you do it? Consequences don't even phase me anymore.

 This is a literal cry for help."
1384,What do I do?,"So my boyfriend (29) suffered multiple intense seizures back in July. The experience was very traumatic for him (he had to get surgery to get his mouth wired shut because the seizures caused him break his jaw in 2 places). It caused him to question the idea of death and why people must die. He calls it an existentialist crisis. For the past 4 months, I have been trying to help him get back to a place where he is happy. During the first two months of recovery, his energy levels were low, he didn't eat much, and he could barely make it through the work day. Most days, he would barely make it to the car after work, and would automatically pass out in the car for the rest of the night. By mid-September, he called the suicide hotline because he had enough of how things were going with post-trauma. He met with a psychiatrist once after that. Within a week, his behavior changed. He was completely fine, his energy levels were up, and he was excited to get back to running again. The weekend of Halloween, I decided to go visit my parents (they live 2.5hours away). When I got home that Sunday morning, his behavior had changed yet again. He reverted back to low energy levels, passing out in the car, having difficulty communicating, and now sleeps over 12 hours each night. The only time he seems okay is in the mornings right when he wakes up...but by noon, I can hear the change in his tone that his energy and motivation has begun to diminish. This has been happening now for 3 weeks and I just don't know what to do. I'm starting to think everything he is experiencing has more to do with mental health than with health effects from his medical occurrence in July. Do you think I should call mental health services to get him evaluated?

Tl:Dr BF(29) suffered a traumatic medical experience, and now shows signs that point to mental health needs. Should I call mental health services to get him evaluated?"
1385,Potential trigger warning: self harm/suicide etc,"So recently I've started getting thoughts about cutting my wrists, which I don't want to do for several reasons, but mainly I don't want to think about it because it makes me feel super uncomfortable, normally when I think about self harm or suicide iit doesn't bother me at all, this just makes me feel weird like I can feel a sort of ""ache"" in my wrists.

This is probably the most incohesive thing I've ever written because I'm tired but still"
1386,It would help if people actually talked to me,I’m so tired of everyone asking for people who will talk to them and getting no response. I’m here. Talk.
1387,How do I help a friend with self esteem issues as someone with self esteem issues?,"It's like a dog that chases its tail.

When she's having a breakdown and says she's a horrible person I tell her that it's true, but she doesn't believe me;
when I'm having a breakdown and I tell her I'm a terrible person she says that it's not true, but I don't believe her.

So what do I do? I can't just say ""yeah you are"" but at the same time if I try to support her in any way she won't care."
1388,Can someone help? I keep blanking/blacking out and I don't know why.,"What is going on with me? Lately, I've been ""blanking out"" a lot and usually find myself doing/saying something I wasn't doing/talking about before and I have no memory of how I got to that point. I have no idea if this is some sort of mental problem( i.e. a disorder or something among those lines) or just my body giving up on me- I do have mental problems that I've been diagnosed with before (major anger issues along with a bit of anxiety and depression) but I haven't gone to therapy in a bout a year or two (since they let me go), however I have been planning on going back for other reasons that have nothing to do with this- I honestly just want an idea of what might be wrong just for a bit of relief because I genuinely don't know what's going on."
1389,I need to find a job but none work with my disorders,"I have been unable to work for over a year now due to my mental disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, and Bipolar). My fiance has been having to take all of the financial load, but we want to move into our own place soon. This means either I need to get a job or he needs to get a second one. I already feel so bad that he has to work so hard, so I want to get my own job. The problem is that every job I've had causes me extreme anxiety to the point where I start to vomit, or I get so depressed I can't get out of bed to go to work. This causes me to get in trouble for absences more than anything else. 

I want advice on what jobs I can do. I very badly want to help my fiance, but the mental load of most jobs is too much. If it helps, I have worked both customer service jobs and jobs with no real human interaction and both were very difficult. Ideally, I think I would want to work from home, but most remote jobs are call center jobs, and those require talking to people. 

Am I just being a baby? Like, using my disorders as an excuse to put all the financial burden on my fiance? I don't know."
1390,anyone else alternate between feeling exhilarated and happy to be alive and wanting do die several times a day?,like seriously i always switch between these two feelings. i have no sense of reality. i'm always just in flux
1391,I need help..,"So, in my last post, a lot of you have kind messages and I’m thankful for it. But, sadly I’ve reached another problem with my mental health.

For clarification, I’m an 18 year old girl who is a full time student. I’m overweight which has made me extremely self conscious of my body. But with me being overweight, my anxiety and demons run with the worries I have over it. 

Recently, a close aunt passed away. She had a hole in her heart (born with it) and had suffered from COVID a few weeks before she passed away. Since then, I’ve been in a horrible place mentally. 

It’s been two weeks since she passed away. And well, the first week, I was guilty for not speaking to her more in her life. But now, with the second week nearly gone, I’ve been nothing but terrified about my health. 

Usually I don’t think much or too heavily about my physical health. But recently, despite being a supposedly healthy teenage girl, I’ve been terrified I’ll die in my sleep from a heart attack. It’s a fear that I’ve had for years. Occasionally I get afraid I’m going to die in my sleep. 

The last time I went to the doctor was at least a year ago when I got my anxiety meds. But, I’ve become stubborn and stopped taking them because I thought I became too dependent on them. A thing about my anxiety is another part of my body hurts. Sometimes during a panic attack, my thighs, arms, or shoulders will hurt extremely. And each time, it makes a panic attack worse because it makes me think something worse is wrong with me. 

My grandpa had a heart attack when I was very young and I’ve been told the signs of heart attacks countless times. Recently, my right forearm has been hurting. And it always sparks my anxiety. My right arm will hurt in different spots and sometimes it’s my shoulder. 

I’ve gotten so paranoid that something is wrong with my heart that I actually downloaded a heart beat app to check my heartbeat to make sure it’s at least in a normal range. The highest it’s been was at 94 beats. 

I feel so scared that I’m at a loss of what to do. I have so many fears that plague my life and mind. Along with it, I get scared so easily. 

This has made me so scared that I honestly don’t know how to bring this up to my family. The only one I’ve actually vented to because I know I won’t be judged for it is my grandma. I’m terrified my struggles with my mental health will only piss my mom off. I’ve thought about telling her tonight but I’m still scared to say anything to her. 

Can anyone give me advice or reassurance...?"
1392,Emotional symptoms of an eating disorder but not really any physical symptoms ?,"I have had body dysmorphia for probably the last four years of my life. In the last few years I have had a difficult relationship with food both significantly restricting myself with food and I have also suffered from binge eating disorder too. Now I'm no longer binge eating or restricting I would say I just eat a healthy amount of food for my own needs and body. However the horrible negative thoughts about my body are very much still a problem . To highlight how severe the thoughts are, today it was raining and I refused to put my coat on because I thought it made me look a lot bigger than I am. Even when I know deep down that it doesn't and I'm not being rational or looking after myself really . I also often feel like I have to justify my food choices and eating patterns to other people  and I also hate eating in front of other people(strangers and friends I know that sounds bad because my friends aren't toxic and try to make me feel better about myself as opposed to putting me down all the time) as again I just feel like if I'm eating something which isn't a superfood that people will judge me. But I don't feel like I can tell someone that I think I might have disordered eating as I feel like even though I know that you can be any size and have an eating disorder I still have that fear in the back of my mind that people will just laugh in my face and tell me that I'm too fat to have an eating disorder. I have also had general anxiety since I was about 10 and I also have a diagnosis of depression. I'm really sorry if this is triggering."
1393,"One step forward, two steps back","I feel like the second my mental health starts to get better it slowly creeps back up to me. It makes me sabotage things without even realizing it until it’s too late. I just for once want to get out ahead of it. Fix it and make my life one worth living. 

As soon as I start feeling like I belong in the world, I do something that causes a chain reaction that ends in me wishing I didn't have to live this life anymore. 

Just for once, I want to feel good about who I am and what im doing. I want to feel successful. I want to feel happy. I want to feel complete."
1394,Information and recommendations for SSRIs,"Just so you know my situation: I'm currently on a low dosage of Wellbutrin to help treat depression and as a smoking cessation aid. I managed to quit smoking but 6 months after quitting, my depression and anxiety levels have worsened due to other things; PCOS, work and some things going on in my personal life. The anxiety and depression have seriously interrupted my ability to function; particularly at work. My anxiety gets so bad sometimes that I feel like I'm screaming in my head or feel like I am crawling out of my own skin. On top of all of this, when I am around other people other than my husband, I feel like I have to avoid them because of my problems. I am mostly anti-social with people now and while I was still an introvert, I used to be able to have small conversations sometimes with people. I feel like I'm about to lose or just outright quit my job due to my current issues. I feel like I can't take any additional anxiety or depression right now and in my head, I feel like everyone around me is just tired of having to deal with me while I'm going through this.

I think that I want to quit Wellbutrin and give an SSRI a go to see if it will help keep me stable while I work on the other things that I need to fix. What do you think about this? What SSRIs are you guys taking and has it helped you with any of your depression or anxiety? Right now, I feel like any kind of suggestion will be helpful right now."
1395,I get bored of everything no matter what it is,"I get bored of gaming, reading, eating junk food, eating healthy food, meditating. Literally everything. Does anyone else have this?"
1396,"I’ve kinda realized I don’t matter, there’s no point in anyone reading this, just kind of a life story of why I and many other people will probably commit suicide.","When I was 0-9 my dad used to constantly get into screaming matches with my mom (he had adhd and had numerous sociopathic tendencies) to the point where almost daily he would throw dishes or furniture in her direction (often times I’d be standing beside my mom to try and comfort her which meant the dishes would be flying right beside me). 

I remember one time where we were eating in the backyard at the outside table and he got mad so he threw a plastic pepper grinder at our kitchen window. It didn’t break and I laughed so he screamed at me and grabbed a plate with cutlery and threw it at the window shattering it and breaking the plate when it landed on the floor inside. There were lots of times where things like that happened. Which is why it didn’t really phase me. 

Me and my sister would often comfort eachother if I wasn’t trying to help my mom or help clean up. 

I’m not sure where to put this but when I was five he broke his back and got addicted to oxy contin. Which he remained addicted to for the remainder of time we lived with him (my mom left him when I was nine after I tried and tried to convince her to move out before my little sister had to go through what we did).

When I was 7 my little sister was born and things changed for me. My dad snored a lot and my mom couldn’t have him sleep because he kept waking up my sister so he took a single mattress and put it on the floor in my room, for the next two years we shared that room. He instantly started leaving all his pill bottles (empty and full) as well as old Copenhagen (tobacco chew) containers around my room. I couldn’t have friends over because of that. He spent most of the day lying in his bed in my room chewing Copenhagen and watching movies (often loud horror movies which would leave me with nightmares when I tried to go to sleep). 

After my sister was born one of my parents would usually be with my little sister, which meant a couple times a day when he would start yelling and throwing things she would be with my dad or my mom. (She was anywhere from 0-2 when this happened). I would always get super stressed out something would happen to her and run and beg whatever parent was holding her to give her to me so I could take her to my or my sisters room. When she was held by my mom she would often give her to me, but when it was my dad he’d keep holding her and yell at me for anything he could think of. 

One thing I remember is always making sure that whatever I said when I was near my dad would be something he agreed with or would make him laugh, because whenever I didn’t do that he would scream at me for something along the lines of being a fucking retard. 

When I was 9 my mom finally left my dad. He hacked her bank account and email and started to post horrendous things about her online. When we got our first house he showed up a few times after tracking down where we lived. Two times he threw rocks through our windows and at our door whilst screaming threats. He slashed our tires to our car and poured a still unknown liquid into our gas tank which ended up completely ruining our car. My mom had pretty much no money and three kids to look after, knowing this and knowing that it wasn’t cheap to repair these things I got insanely stressed out. (I kept my emotions to myself because there’s always more important things to worry about for my mom).

My older sister has had a lot of problems and has seen therapists and always gone to counselling, and my younger sister has always had to have things to do or be looked after. In the mix of all that I just accepted that I’m a helper, not a person. There’s lots more but that’s sort of the jist of it and I think that’s why I’m fucked up. I haven’t had any motivation for as long as I can remember. I got bullied really badly in middle school and have had fake friends for all of high school. I’ve never been the most important to anyone. I get into relation ships because I assure myself that’s what will make me and the girl happy, but it leaves me more stressed because I don’t actually have feelings and need to fake everything.

No one knows this about me, and I doubt anyone ever will, I just wanted to say it because it’s the truth of why I’ll never amount to anything, get good grades, have a relationship, and eventually, why I’ll kill myself. 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk."
1397,I think i’m dead in 30 mins. I guess can i talk to someone?,"Trigger warning//basically everything. I’m sorry.

Hi. Alt account because my other friend has been begging me not to be this fkn stupid. Milly if you ever read this, i’m so fkn sorry and i hate myself for doing this. You have been my best and only friend for ages. I fkn love you. I really do. You can have my favourite hoodie if you would like it. because i know you like it too. I wish i could give more but idk what. I’m sorry.
15 F.

I overdosed. Alot. And cut myself too much. I have fainted 2 times because i hate blood. I hate pain. I’m really not good with pain. I’m going kinda dizzy and i’m really tired because of the melatonin. Idk what to do anymore. 

I have anxiety ADD, BPD, Bipolar. I am medicated. I overdosed on Melatonin, zoloft, ritalin. I’m so fkn sorry. My legs hurt really fkn bad. (From the cuts and most likely something else) my stomach hurts. I feel tired i really want to go go sleep but idk. I’m probably gonna delete this. I’m sorry."
1398,Should I consider thearpy?,"I (20F) have been isolating myself from everyone I know . I stopped talking to anyone and putting effort into maintaining relationships as of June last year . I think the cause is feelings of neglect and not feeling like I'm cared about . Everyone I meet or try to be friends with and get close to , don't make an effort to get to know me and treat me like my feelings don't matter and I'm insignificant . Which has done wonders for my self esteem and insecurities.This has lead me to isolate myself and now I'm alone and It's hard for me to even message or call anyone anymore. 

No one really cared for me , my mom has been trying to pay attention me as she is retired and I'm really annoyed by it now . I hate it and I push her away . It's been so long and now she wants to be in my life but I just feel like it's too late and I don't trust her . 

What do I do? I feel so worthless and unhappy. I feel like there is no meaning to life except being the breadwinner for my family(the only reason I care about myself at all).  Yesterday I was crying in a taxi home because I don't know what to do with my life , there are so much I want to do but can't find the motivation to even try . There is no one I can share my situation with because everyone I know has broken my trust and disappointed me . I've never made any real friends and the few friends I made didn't really care about me . 

I feel like I might die alone at this point , considering I can't even make friends anymore . Thearpy is so expensive considering how I am the breadwinner and I want to cry because I'm out of options and no one seems to notive the pain and sadness I am experiencing . I don't even care for my appearnce anymore , I leave the home with my appearance looking  worn down , lazy ,with untidy hair and half dirty clothes and a few years ago I wouldn't be caught dead looking like that. 

What do I do now?"
1399,I don’t know if I might be experiencing hallucinations,"It kinda started I guess with seeing things in the corners of my eyes, like dark shadowy figures or cats, but I never really thought anything of it because I thought it was normal, and I was put on anti-psychotics for its mood stabilising effects cause I have BPD. These went away and I forgot about them. But tbh I’ve forgotten to take my meds for a few days and I thought that my phone was moving by itself, but I noticed it never moved from the same spot. It looked like it was sliding but it never moved if that makes any sense? Things that normally don’t move around on the screen had started to shift in the same way the phone was. I’ve been seeing this morphing everywhere (even while on meds) but I just kind of ignored it because it didn’t bother me and I felt like my mind could have just made it up, but this was the only instance where it was plain and obvious. The only way I can describe it is how people describe the morphing they see on LSD or them videos with the swirls which cause an optical illusion. I don’t know if it might be some kind of psychosis or maybe a health condition. I don’t feel paranoid and I’m aware that these things aren’t real so I’m not sure what to think of them and whether I should tell my doctor. I’m not sure if they would take me seriously since I don’t know if these are common types of hallucinations."
1400,I refuse to take those meds,"I have depression and anxiety. I have taken SSRI's for years and I think they help. But I refuse to take the benzodiazepines I have been prescribed for my anxiety.

The first time I was given one was in May when I went to hospital because my body was being fucky. I was not anxious. I was calm. They ignored my concerns and insisted it was anxiety, gave me a pill to calm me down. (Several months later I still am suffering with my symptoms almost daily and am having it checked out by a cardiologist).

The second time I was given a benzodiazapine (actually the one I have been prescribed now, lorazepam) was a couple weeks ago. I was taken to hospital as I was intent on ending my life. After a couple conversations with the mental health team they decided that although I had no interest in living and directly told them I would take my life if I went home to give me a lorazepam there in the waiting room and then send me home. Their genius plan was that I would be too tired to kill myself when I arrived home. Shocker that didn't work and the next morning when I disappointingly woke up I got myself to hospital.

These pills are just pills to shut me up and get rid of me. That's all they've been used for before. I don't want to use them again. I want to run away and keep running so bad.

Does anyone else have a bad experience with meds? And like how is coping without them?"
1401,Just had enough sometimes,"Like the title says, I feel like I have had enough. At times I can be on cloud 9, others I’m down in the dumps.

I don’t know what to do, and I’m just tired of it. Feel like I can’t accomplish anything until my mood settles or perk up. Anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? Please help"
1402,Am I a bad friend?,"Hi I have been a horrible friend by not messaging my best friends often or replying. I have been off and on social media and so self absorbed into my life with uni, work and family dramas I’ve gotten overwhelmed and just shut everyone out.

But this has come to the cost of my friends, I’ll drop messages every now and again to check up but I was awful last year and didn’t text until this summer we got back together. We had all been very busy and we are all at different stages of our lives. I promised I’d do better and stay I contact but I’ve been isolating weeks at a time cause of health and uni work. 

But I shouldn’t have been so self absorbed, my friend needs me and didn’t go see her. 

I ve asked to come over but I’ve either not been able to or they are busy or I don’t hear from them. I’ve given them space and didn’t want to overwhelm if they are busy with their uni work. 

I’ve gotten to speak to my mates as we are all for once free and I realised how much my friend hadn’t been coping. I  want to go comfort her but I’ve been drinking and new lockdown rules  

I hate myself for not seeing her like I had planned in my head to. I ve seen other friends in the meantime, I’ve been trying to give them at least all one visit before Christmas I’ve just not been able to arrange a good time with this friend who’s struggling more than I had realised

So I feel like I have to calm both of them. sometimes I dont have an answer. In my meditation, I am unable to get my feelings. When I sit, everything shuts up. Yet, I try to resolve these issues so I start to think about my problems and try to solve them in a clear mind. I recall memories and all. Now I am severely hurt from a previous break up. It was unjust by all means like I literally had to sit and cry with my little self while telling it to forgive and let go. every time I remember the two times my ex fought with me, cheated, broke up, and became really selfish. I had alot on my plate to deal with specially that I never hurt her ever. I keep asking myself ""How could she? and why?? just why?"" and it hurts even more its unfair. So I am trying to forgive and get out of the victim mentality. I am trying to reach the part of me that would allow that. The one that is holding on still. I need peace and relief. Please help

1409,I don't know what's going on with me lately.,"Greetings, name's Claudio, i'm 19. Lately i've lost lost any kind of motivation to do everything, even the things I love. It all has started around June, when I broke up after a 3 years relationship with this person I truly loved. Instead of taking my time to heal the injury like every normal person would do, i repressed every feeling I had and focused on my final high school exams and focusing to prove myself at my job. In the end u scored a 100/100 and still got my job, even became a sort of manager of resources and developing. But after this ""victories"" everything started to get darker and darker everyday. I started feeling that sense of emptiness that I've always feared, I can't feel any kind of affection, love or anything feeling of such, just hate, wrath and disgust. I feel so empty and constantly running away from something and I'm not sure for how long I can keep running away. I've lost motivation to do everything, i don't want to study for university and I have my exams in January, I don't want to work anymore, I don't want to play piano and chess, I don't literally want to do anything. I feel pathetic and pointless, I can't see any good thing in me anymore. What I see in the mirror everyday is this ugly grey stain unable to get on track anymore. All I do is hide all this ""sadness"" I feel and cry during the nights on my bed when anyone can't hear me or see me. I'm just alone, I don't have any particular friend, every person I do meet ends up being another average person that loses interesting easily, but I guess that it's my fault, I have nothing to offer lately. Frankly, this is the second time on my life that I've been truly scared. Since I was a kid, I've been diagnosed with depression, my whole life has been more downs than up even if many people consider me successful since my young age, but honestly, I just think that I'm an average, pathetic loser. I don't wanna seem like in need of charity or such, i just want to know how to get back on track, I've too many responsabilities over my shoulders and I'm scared I'm gonna lose everything. Thank you for the attention, have a good day."

1413,PTSD-Adjacent?,"I thought that I had PTSD due to some things that happened in my childhood, and separate things that happened in my young adulthood. However, when I looked up the diagnostic requirements for PTSD, none of it really fit. The thing is, when I am exposed to certain triggers, it absolutely sets me off. I freeze, shut down, cry, or all of the above. I always thought that those were signs of a trauma disorder, aside from your ""run of the mill"" anxiety. (Yes, I know, there's no such thing, but hear me out.) Maybe I was wrong? Maybe it IS just my Generalized Anxiety Disorder? I guess I just assumed that because I could connect these triggers to traumatic events in my life, it was PTSD. Now I have no clue what it is, or what to call it, other than PTSD-Adjacent. Any ideas?"
1414,I cut myself and instantly regretted it,"I cut my wrist wirh an eyebrow razor and when I looked away for a minute and then looked back, the scars started bleeding. I don’t want them to scar. I put on a ton of neosporin and wrapped them with medical tape but they still sting. will they scar??

I’m really nauseous rn bcs I hate blood and physically can’t handle them. please help me."
1415,"hazy, hazy cake day"," **It is my birthday today, I am turning 21 and I am stuck inside due to a lockdown. I am starting to feel as if nothing is ''real'' and I continually feel very abnormal. People seem weird and everything is a little hazy does anyone else feel like this or am I just depressed ???** 

I just feel like I've lost a year of my life and can barely remember anything or talk to people I feel like a ghost."
1416,Am I bipolar?,"I can’t stay in relationships too long, and I cut people out of my life. I suck at remembering things as well. And today, I cried about getting a C+ as a grade for no reason. But in the morning, I was super happy and got up at 5 AM, even though I went to sleep at 1. I’ll be super happy about something, then I’ll hate it. I also get really sad easily."
1417,Is social paralysis a thing?,"CW: Mention/description of anxiety &amp; panic attack (&amp; brief mention of trauma at the end)

I’ve been trying to understand this aspect of myself for the longest time. Idk how to explain it, but in the same way that in sleep paralysis, you’re mentally conscious but in a physical state of paralysis- right? And you may mentally recognize that you’re panicking but it feels distant because you’re not actually processing it necessarily. Does this exist, (but inversed), in a social sense?? 
For me, I have learned to recognize that my physical and mental state are not on the same page. Whenever I’m in social settings or interaction settings- or even just standing around, I’m in a constant null and I recognize that the behavior I display then isn’t normal to how I’d (want to) act. But I don’t mentally process it as me intentionally trying to restrict my behavior or anything- I just loose all impulse/desire to behave as I would and it isn’t processed as me acting differently (although I can recognize that it’s not how I’d “normally” be). 
I think my body is in a constant state of anxiety but my brain shuts itself into a state of “paralysis” whenever that happens, to avoid it.(???)
It took me a long time to recognize the cues or even come to this idea. What’ll usually happen, is I’ll feel/be really null until I start pushing against my “closed off” behavior, which’ll then trigger PHYSICAL anxiety symptoms, but w/o mental processing of anxiety. I’ve learned to understand that when I feel that way, it isn’t normal and I AM likely to be heading into an attack, but throughout, my brain never processes it(???) 
Eventually that anxiety will keep swelling despite my mind being composed. (At this point, it’s like social anxiety but just physical??) This leads to a “selective mutism-like experience” where my mind is pushing against my body to do things and I have to choose whether to try to do them and face triggers, or do nothing and hate myself for it.
It’s on such a severity that I usually HAVE TO push and risk those triggers just to live w/o people looking at me weirdly or thinking I’m rude for “not trying” “not responding” (f*ck ablism). Once I push myself, even slightly, it sends me into anxiety or panic attacks (I’ve only just recently learned to recognize that). My body will hyperventilate, shake, disassociate, get nauseous, my vision will blur, etc. But my mind will be composed throughout. Obviously i mentally process that something is happening, but it’s more like “wth...oh”/“hHhh.. not again..” instead of “WTFDJJDJDDK!1!”. 
If I then, don’t handle it properly, or something happens to interfere while I’m grounding myself while in that state, THAT WILL push me over the edge and I’m knocked out of “paralysis”. All the typical mental symptoms you’d expect start flooding in and I have a mental breakdown (just full-circle panic attack). It’s then like as if my mind is performing a catharsis, because it purges itself of all the hurt that it’s been resisting (so these attacks can be moderate or severe). After all that, it goes back to a state of null. Often times, my mind is SO null and SO composed, that I’ll forget about the experience of the hurt; my mind will force itself to forget how the hurt feels, what it’s like, &amp; what happens. (So every time i go through this, it’s like getting hurt again, for the first time, repeatedly, every time).
Extra:
This also applies in reverse; if I’m in a rare situation where I AM okay, it’s as if my body is held back and my mind is hyper. I had to learn so hard how to control and stop myself, because in those situations, id be extremely impulsive and irrational and say and do idiotic things that were embarrassing that I knew I didn’t want to do or shouldn’t do. And then after the good moment was over, I’d immediately return to that state of null and be hit w/ a wave of weird feelings of disappointment, regret, and anguish. 

Why am i like this? Is anyone else like this? Is this a thing?? What can I look into to understand it better? Is this a result of conditioning from trauma? Is my mental “paralysis” a product of reinforced traumatic ideas that im not allowed to process my emotions??? Does that then mean that my mental “hyper” is a product of my mind being boundless because it never properly developed an understanding of how to appropriately be happy? How do I concisely explain/express this to people in a way that’ll allow them to understand my situation?"
1418,My anxiety is making me miserable,"I know this isn’t the best place to post this, but I need to vent to some people who may understand. I have anxiety. I also have depression, but at the moment it’s my anxiety making my life tough. I have a habit of spiraling myself into these thoughts that are so beyond irrational and I KNOW IT. That’s the worst part, I rationally know that I’m being ridiculous but the little voice in my head can’t stop making up completely wild facts. 

For example, I’ve been talking to this guy for a year and we both really like each other. I’ve been trying to go visit him for weeks and each weekend something has come up which has prevented me from going. Normally, this may sound like a red flag, but he never cancels on me so I know (rationally) that he’s not being flakey. The world is tough rn with Covid and everything. So this weekend I was finally supposed to actually go see him and he texted me saying that he may have come in contact with someone who had covid and it was best if we just tried to hang out another time. In my head, I’m bummed because I was looking forward to seeing him, but I obviously understand the situation so I said yes let’s try another time. I was totally ok until I started overthinking and telling myself that he doesn’t actually want to see me and he just wanted to get me excited about plans just to cancel them on purpose. I know this isn’t true. I rationally know that because what kind of evil person would do something like that on purpose?? Literally nobody does that, especially not after having known someone for a year. So now I have myself convinced that he hates me, thinking i’m annoying, and has no desire to hang out with me. Yes I know this is all crazy, but this is the kind of shit I deal with in my head all day long. Ugh I’m exhausted of this please tell me someone else has experience this"
1419,"Seeing, hearing, and thinking things that aren’t happening and I don’t understand if it’s my mind tricking me","So recently I started having this strange anxiety and my mind started convincing me that I’m allergic to foods, dying, or like someone put drugs in my stuff. This past week I keep seeing things in the corner of my eye but then when I look at it it’s gone and then I also hear things too that aren’t happening like thunder or an earthquake. I’ve also been overly aggressive too and I don’t know why it’s happening because I have a healthy lifestyle. I can barely finish my foods because even made at home because I feel like someone is drugging me and I feel like someone is out to kill me and that has been happening for a while and I had to stop going to malls because I thought someone would come up behind me and kill me. Getting help really isn’t an option either and I’m so desperate to fix this feeling, is there any coping mechanisms or any ways to feel better?"
1420,Will I ever not feel tired?,"I'm 22, been living with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar type 1 for my whole life. I'm doing well mentally, have been for over 5 years thanks to my meds. One thing that has not changed has been my fatigue. I never feel rested. Best I get is sometimes waking up and not being groggy. I've tried sleeping pills, melatonin, weed, going to sleep early, you name it I've tried it. Will it ever end? Will I actually be able to say that I'm not tired when people ask how I am?"
1421,I just wanna feel happy,(18m)I have no friends. Thats it. I'm really damn sad because no one ever texts me or asks about my day. I don't feel like anything is worth it when no one talks to you. Whenever I try and text anybody I used to know pre covid. I just get left on opened. I can't deal with this constant loneliness. Its just to much
1422,"I already knew that I was in tough shape, but finding out this new diagnosis just last week really through me for a loop!","I knew that I had previously been diagnosed with being Bipolar, however I never really knew if I was Type 1 or 2. I eventually concluded that I was somehow type 2, even though I have never once experienced mania at all. I simply thought that my sudden mood swings was just part of being both Bipolar and depressed.

Then last week, I receive a release form to sign and discovered much to my surprise that I have been diagnosed as having Borderline Personality Disorder. This had apparently added by my former Psychiatrist who decided to stop seeing me because ""I wanted a Psych who was available 5 days a week."" 

I had been hospitalized last December, and had told her that I was not pleased on her not being available. Her response was something to the effect of ""what could she have done?"" I mean was she serious when she asked that?

I tried not to be transferred to another Psych, but with no success. Personally, I think that she saw that as being somehow clingy, and afraid of losing people. This new diagnosis had been added on March 23. Again, nobody even as much as hinted at this!

So, here it is, I knew that I was deeply depressed, and Covid-19 did not help things at all. So, about 1 to 2 weeks into the shutdown, that was added to my record!

Needless to say, this simply derailed me when I am already having a tough time. I looked up some stuff on Youtube, I guess that I technically have it, but not severely. I am not violent at all. Anyway, I do fit a few of the symptoms, and those I knew that I already had for a very long while now.

So, here I am, having yet another label added to my diagnosises and simply not knowing what to do or move on forward from here.

Thank you for reading."
1423,Anonymous Online Professional Evaluation / Support?,"If this is a common question then I apologize. Does anyone have any recommendations for online professional diagnosis and/or counselling/therapy that’s completely anonymous (as in won’t show up in a medical/health records check)?  

I’m not in a situation where I can reach out for professional support but I’d very much like to speak with someone qualified. If there’s a completely anonymous resource then I’d very much appreciate that.  

My best mode of communication is instant messaging/chat, I’ve tried talking it out to friends but don’t want to be a further burden and telling it to a notepad hasn’t helped at all, nor has talking to any AI yet (tried Wysa but it’s not adequate). I need it talk to another person.  

Not sure what else to say, I’ll reply to DMs with more specifics if you can recommend something for me, I’m not quite sure what to do so any tips would be appreciated, thanks!  

Also stay safe everyone x"
1424,I've Spent So Much Time Pretending to Be Someone I'm Not,"I can't take this anymore. I can't take despising every aspect of myself, down to what chromosomes I have in the nuclei in my cells. Down to what's between my legs.

I try so, so hard to pretend to be someone I'm not. I try so hard to act like I like who I am. But I despise every second pretending to be what everyone thinks I am.

I hate being a boy. I have having a penis. I'd give so much to have been born with a vagina and naturally develop breasts as a part of puberty. I want long hair and a plump butt. Every day when I put on sweatpants, Nikes shoes, t-shirts, etc., I look at myself in sadness and disappointment. Every day, as I watch my nascent beard continue to grow, I feel detached from my body. I want to be totally hairless aside from my eyebrows and the hair on my scalp, which I want more of.

I want to wear girls clothes. I want to burn every pair of boxers I own and replace them with tight, cute panties. I want to wear Vans, Converse shoes, boots, skinny jeans, leggings, denim shorts, overalls, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, tutus, etc.

I have a Sephardic Jewish/southern European skintone, and I hate it. I want southeast Asian skin. I don't know why, but I do.

I feel so ugly, and when everyone tells me a bunch of girls secretly are in love with me, and every says I look beautiful, I feel like I'm being lied too. I feel like I'm a goblin and everyone sees me as a phoenix. It's so bizarre.

I hate my face. I hate my small eyes, huge nose, tiny face, huge skull, large hands, and small mouth. I want the opposite of all of that. And I hate pretending to be content just so I don't look insecure and look like a pussy.

And I despise how everyone slams all these expectations on my shoulders. My family expects me to be the next intellectual. My father is trying to shove my name into the great scientists and philosophers of human history. When I told him I didn't want to be a well-known intellectual or activist, he seemed bemused.

I can name like one conversation in the last 5 years I had with my aunt that wasn't about ethical philosophy, psychology, or politics. Our relationship more closely resembles that of Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Ree and opposed to a boy and his aunt.

My family always tells me how proud they are of me. Every adult who interacts with me acts like I'm smarter than Einstein. But I don't want that. I just want to be a normal kid and have fun.

Halloween, video games, time with friends, etc. have all been taken from me because no, I have to write my next dissertation on the geopolitical background of the Franz Ferdinand assassination. I like these subjects, that's why I was pushed into them, but I don't want it to be my life.

I was pushed into maturity at such a young age. And now I want everything I didn't get then. Hoppity hop balls, bounce houses, video games, Pokemon cards, teddy bears, cartoons like Adventure Time and We Bare Bears.

But I worry that my family would think once I gain independence (I plan on being a history teacher as an adukt) and use it to become who I've wanted to be for years now.

What will they think when they come over to my home to be greeted by a woman who looks southeast Asian wearing leggings, a sweater, and lace-up boots - the person was once a Sephardic Jewish - Czech youth. Then as they walk into their small, split-level home to gaze upon Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears posters accompanied by a giant Snorlax beanbag, dozens of toys arranged on a shelf supporting a tv playing Gravity Falls. They look upon to see dozens of Pokemon plushies, teddy bears, a gumball machine, and cotton candy maker - what will they think?

When they were 14, they were discussing the economics of the post-Soviet world. Now they're lounging in a Snorlqx bean bag playing Scribblenauts and binging Adventure Time. What will they think?

I'm so scared."
1425,I cannot mentally handle another shutdown,"The possibility of second shutdown has been in the news, and I'm scared it could become a reality.

But I don't think I could handle another one. The first one wasn't too bad; I had a great job and great co-workers to interact with so it just felt like a lot of paid vacation.

Now, I don't have a job and have absolutely no friends. I feel like there is no hope to make friends or find a decent job if we're on lockdown. I feel like my life is stalled, I can't work towards any goals, and it's incredibly isolating.

Yes, I'm a woman but dating apps don't work. I live with family but it's not the same as having friends to really joke and connect with.

I just can't fathom going through this."
1426,Crying,"Hey yall,

 I have a question regarding why I feel so clear-minded with my thoughts being put into words when I very sad.

Usually, I'm very laughy and silly and with my normal personality, I struggle to put my thoughts into words. 

I noticed whenever I'm extremely saddened, I can finally focus and properly think clearly (able to pinpoint my thoughts/remember well/ calmer/ and overall a more gathered intelligent person. I even had a few people tell me ""You're really mature today"", ""I like the way you're speaking lately"". It would always be when I'm extremely sad on the inside. I even know how to speak properly socially when I'm sad. (social, but socially anxious person and overthink usually).

Currently, I'm sad due to sudden news, and I went to sit down in front of my laptop and remembered something almost immediately that I've been trying to remember all day. I texted someone and didn't overthink, but rather spoke clearly and properly. 

Why is it when I'm sad, I am able to relay my words in such a manner, but when I'm happy my mind is a mess?

ALSO: Random question with some association- Why do I shake and my teeth shatter when I talk about my emotions or talk to people with depth?

Thanks-"
1427,Payment Advice?,"I (20F), have the strong urge to see a therapist. Recently I have been noticing more and more that I don't have healthy relationship views. My boyfriend (20M) very much does. I want to have more similar thoughts to him in regards of not specifically needing someone to feel complete. Not having to cling to someone to feel okay. Not putting them over every single other thing in your life.

I have recently been thinking a lot about my childhood and the relationship rolemodels I had to look up to. They were not very good in all honesty, and I think they may have effected me more than I previously realized.

So my biggest question or advice I'd like is, I really want to talk to a professional, but I can't afford it. Not even an online one. I've looked into a ton of the ""free"" apps, and a ton of online therapists and it's very expensive. My insurance doesn't cover it. Is there any other help available?"

I watched a video that just hit me in a certain type of way and reminded me of all the good in life and the only way to describe it is like I was frozen in ice and it all just melted away. It gave me a bit of hope, and I just needed to share that."

We’ve genuinely been connecting amazingly but at the same time in the back of my mind I’m waiting for how I’m going to mess it up. This just doesn’t happen for relationships for me, it happens in every aspect of my life causing  unneeded awkward situations. I genuinely have made amazing friends throughout my life but in the back of my mind Social anxiety is still in control. I’m sick of living this way. It’s been such an impediment in what could be a great life for me.

I apologize if this post doesn’t make much sense. There was a lot pent up inside of me and I just needed to let this out somewhere"
1431,Body Focused Repetitive Behavior,"So I have been a chronic nail biter for ages due to stress and anxiety. I have recently broken myself of that habit (well about 98.9% if it) but I have recently started to chew the insides of my cheeks instead. If there is any loose tissue I have to chew it off, even if it comes to physically moving my cheek around so I can reach it. My mouth is always sore and I’ve bled more than once but I can’t seem to stop. I chew gum when I can and that helps to a degree but I can’t just chew gum all the time. 

Has anyone else had this issue? How did you stop?"
1432,Holding myself back from working,Ik this is pathetic but I'm at the age of being able to go into the work force. The issue is that I have really bad social anxiety.

1434,No one will ever want me,"Does anyone else believe that no one will actually truly love them. That you will never be someone's favorite person or someone that makes their heart ache just by the thought of not having you. 

That you'll never have someone that sees an object or a color and thinks of you. Or when they hear a song that makes their heart flutter they don't hesitate to send a link. 

No one will love every inch of your body. Every scar, every stretch mark, even every freckle. Their soul won't ache by catching a whiff of your scent on their pillows and they wouldn't wish you were there next to them. They won't take the time to learn your love languages or things that make you tick. 

I feel like I will never find the right one for me. My heart is taken advantage of. People who claim to love me only love to hurt me. 
No one will pick up all these broken pieces, put them back together and even though you can see the cracks think I'm the most amazing work they've ever seen."
1435,22m.Have been having intense chest pains thinking it might be anxiety related.,"So for the past couple of months almost I have been experiencing daily chest painsaccompanied by shortness of breath and slight aches in my arm. Tonight at work it got to a point where it was real intense and I actually started to think I was having a medical emergency. I texted my father who has chronic Anxiety (not sure if that's the proper terminology) ever since he was a young kid. He told me what I was experiencing was a panic attack and as I was talking to him I felt relief but overwhelmed at the same time and I began to mildly hyperventilate while on the phone. 

Like I said I was at work, I work at a library doing security and it came time to put the library signs back inside. I quickly hung up with my dad and as soon as I began to bring the signs in my symptoms instantly vanished and I felt a bit better although I still had minor symptoms. The issue is that I haven't been seen by a doctor in over a year now (last checkup was last November) and I am unsure weather or not it's a heart problem or just Anxiety. Hopefully it's just Anxiety and not something serious, either way I will be scheduling a checkup asap. What exactly do you guys think about this? Does this sound like something you have experienced?"

I want to gain weight but I feel like I am stuck in a body that doesn’t gain weight. I know I don’t motivate myself enough to eat more and do strength training and all of that. There are a number of things that get in the way like catching a cold (which happens often), increase in workload, increase in school work (i am in a phd program, just to give an idea of my workload) and other life responsibilities. I feel like I am starting to take good care of myself mentally but I feel like having a weak body that goes through to a lot of exhaustion can be mentally draining. Any recommendations or suggestions from you guys on the kind of support I should seek would be very helpful."
1437,"a few months ago my depression and alcohol use almost led to my death, but then something happened...","I had about 100 days clean just before the virus hit, once my sobriety system got disrupted I didn't know how to respond. So I started hanging with my buddies who party and they have a party house that is everything you want, karaoke, a casino room, a coke dealer who lived there, and girls. For about 7 weekends straight I would drink shots of vodka, chain smoke, do a few gs of cocaine, and pop trazodone to go to sleep.

It was like the sweetest nightmare with really high highs, and very very low hangover comedown days so dark that I thought of ending my life because I felt like I failed myself. Then something devastating happened, it was my birthday and I woke up to the news my good buddy Zach overdosed on heroin. I immediately started to cry and told myself I can't go on this way. Later that week I went to his funeral, and it was the saddest thing watching his parents and two kids having to say goodbye, I promised myself I wouldn't do that to my family and that I would be a recovery advocate from then on.

I got help, therapy read books, and got back into my fitness and health routine. And I also got back to my passion for music.  I am a singer/rapper similar to like Eminem or nf people say. I put my heart into my songs. I ended up making a very deep song where I came clean about everything that had been going on, and I released the music video on youtube. And it now has over 40k views with no label or help.

Then the Facebook version has 50k as well as over 800 shares and comments of people telling me they felt every word of my song and how they can relate. I have been humbled by the response.

It releases tonight on all digital music streaming services and I'm feeling a bit emotional. So I felt I would share with my fellow addicts. If you wanna listen to it google search Stylez Major -Lost in a High.

For those who took the time to read this, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Do you guys believe music can heal a heart?"

1440,How to Regain Control,"From the ages of 18-24, I’ve felt a large sense of agency. Freshly recovered from unipolar depression, I constantly felt in control of every situation I was in. I could anticipate problems and figure out creative solutions, which instilled a sense of confidence in myself.

When I was 25, I joined the military and now every little thing stresses me out immensely. I discovered at the age of twenty-fucking-five that suddenly I cry when I’m stressed. In front of my SUPERIORS. Today, I got chewed out by my platoon sergeant because the DMV sent my registration late (it was sent to the wrong address multiple times), and I cried right in front of him over it as I recounted calling the DMV every single day for hours trying to fix the situation.

I figured out the issue is that I just don’t feel in control anymore. My former coping mechanism of brainstorming creative solutions doesn’t work here because the game keeps changing and the players are cheating. It’s hard to explain. I used to have control of my environment but now it controls me.

A good example of this would be that I was instructed to complete a particular leave form so I could get Christmas off. I was told at 3pm that my leave packet was due at 5pm the same day, and that if my vacation was “local,” it needed to be signed by one person. If my vacation was in an “epidemic-level” location, it needed to be signed by someone else. My vacation is in both epidemic-level AND local, and nobody knew what signature I needed to get, but I had to figure it out in 2 hours. Then I found out neither of those two people were even at work and couldn’t be reached. Finally, I was called back into work at 9pm because apparently NEITHER of those people had to sign and the person who gave me my leave packet could sign it.

I feel like my environment is controlling me rather than me controlling the environment. I’m at the mercy of an illogical system and it’s making me cry instead of think.

Does anyone have any advice on how to fix this?"

1444,Chronic Indecision and Overthinking,"I don't know if it has to do with my ADD, Anxiety, or both but I have extremely severe issues related to making decisions, even very small ones. I overthink every single thing all day and I'm also a perfectionist to the point of it possibly being OCD. All of it started about 5 years ago and has been getting progressively worse every year. I have some other mental health issues but the things I described above are what bother me the most. 

I'm at the point where I can't function at all. I've given up on even trying to make small decisions throughout the day because I will often spent 10+ hours on a decision that should take a few minutes at most. I have this urge that things need to ""feel right"" and if they don't I am never satisfied with a decision I've made. It's hard to describe just how bad the indecision actually is. For example I've spent the last 4 months trying to decide if I should use subtitles when watching TV/Movies or playing video games. I keep going back and forth and it's completely ruined my ability to enjoy those activities. No matter what choice I make it ""feels"" like the wrong one. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. Should I seek therapy? 

Also just this year I've been going through an existential crisis and have possibly developed depression as well but I wanted to focus on the issues I've had for years that have been getting worse and worse."
1445,is it normal to not feel love for people when you know you love them?,"is it normal not to feel love or feel love for anyone when your emotionally numb? Or have poor mental health, like I know I love people but I just can't feel it. Is this normal?"
1446,Psychologist or psychiatrist - need help deciding,"So I basically need to talk to someone about the issues I’m having regarding to intense stress from work, much of it caused on my own because I constantly overthink and make myself worry. It’s something I can’t fully control and it is bringing me down. It also is a contributor to bouts of depression that I have, along with family issues. I need to know who to talk to. I know psychiatrists can prescribe medicine and psychologists can’t. I’m not necessarily looking for medicine but I’m not totally against it. First and foremost, I need someone smart and understanding to talk to and I’d like to see if things get better that way before I consider medication.

Any feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated"
1447,Is it normal to hear/ feel an internal screaming all the time?,"Ever since I can remember, even when I was still crib-age, I’ve just felt this internal screaming inside of me. I dont always notice it but I know it’s always been there because I’ve never really had it go away. It feels like I have this internal and eternal screaming inside me somewhere and I dont know why or what it is. Is this something everyone experiences? Is it normal?"
1448,"Trying to help a friend with mental illness, be a better friend...while trying to keep his MI in mind.","I don't know where to go here.

Both in our 30's, I have a daughter (almost 2) and a wife. He lives with his mother and a dog. He works from home. We game together, but obviously life changes and priorities shift.

He's always been very wishy-washy, and he basically says it's because of his depression. I respect that, I really do...but I can't plan around ""maybe"" anymore. 

I try encouraging him to give structure a chance and to try owning his lack of decisiveness. For example, I take wellbutrin for my poor memory, and my life depends on alarms and notifications. I can blame missing things on my forgetfulness...but if I'm actively silencing alarms and deleting notifications...I have to own those decisions. I really want him to try NOT blaming everything on his depression. 

I just want him to respect my time and stop preloading all the possible excuses he may see to bail on plans or give maybes. I'm trying to be as delicate as I can, but I've been through life without alot of friends...getting maybes that turn into no-shows just always makes me feel like shit.

This may seem childish. A man in his 30's wanting his friend to stick to gaming plans."
1449,Every time I tell someone how I feel I start shaking. (14f),"   I’m in a Discord server with some online friends, a small group, 7 people. I use the venting channel for advice because older members have gone through what I have. But every time they tell me something affirming or comforting I am the opposite of comfortable. I feel more on edge than before I sent the message. 

   Friend said “You’re too hard on yourself” and the conversation afterwards had me trembling. They told me it was panic but I didn’t feel as if it truly was. I have a hard time connecting with my emotions so fear is something I’m not adept in recognizing. Maybe they’re right? Why do I panic when I express my emotions?"
1450,What other ways could my SO going through a very rough patch?,"Long story short, her dreams of being a nurse are pretty much done. She got a Level 2 offense that she cant get rid of and it's pretty much ruined her dream of being able to become a nurse. The realization of it has hit her extremely hard. I was wondering what ways you've tried to help your SO going through an extremely hard time similar to this."
1451,On the brink of losing my mind after 14 years of success.,"I think we can all agree 2020 sucks. I want to start by saying I have been sober and mutilation free for 14 years. I have been properly medicated with zero major manic or depressive episodes. The years of therapy I went through along with my medications has helped me successfully function as an adult. Then 2020 happened. I got covid in July which sucked, but I didn’t have a whole ton of issues. I then started a job thinking it would make me happier because it would give me something to do since both my kids would be in school this year (I was a stay at home mom). Turns out I hate my job. Like totally miserable, but we kind of need the money so I can’t quit now. Turns out Covid likes to mess with your body even after your not contagious anymore. I started experiencing phantom smells that caused all food to smell and taste like rotting meat. Literally didn’t eat for two weeks. Finally learned how to get food in me, but it’s still not enjoyable and I’m still losing weight (I was already thin. This isn’t a good thing). I have just been chugging along the best I can and then my husband goes out of town on a hunting trip (my anniversary present to him) the same time my parent go out of town (my whole support system), and I literately come within inches of relapsing. I kept it together though. Seriously, therapy taught me some kick ass coping skills. Then my mom come home and gives me a cold. Also, Covid’s second wonderful after symptom of migraines has returned, and I just found out my kids are going to be doing staggered scheduling so I have to be teacher, mom, and work full-time while being on the brink of a mixed episode. Y’all, I honestly don’t know if I can do this without legit losing my mind again. I’m not one to usually rant. I know I have a team of family to support me which is better than most, so I will survive. But I’m terrified I’m going to relapse and end up in the hospital. The bills will be ridiculous and I know it’s going to be hard explaining it to my kids. I know I’m close because my mothers already asked me to quit working and I know she has told my husband. I feel if I do that I would be failing at life though. I need to prove to myself that my disability doesn’t mean I can’t be a fully functioning adult that can handle stress like a normal human being. I have been through hardships before that haven’t brought me this close. The home school 3 days a week thing is what is going to tip me over the edge. Are there anymore parents who have a mental disorder, been successful at managing it long term, and are struggling this year? What are you doing to survive/cope? Also, anyone that wants to share a happy thought or something awesome in there life please do. It sounds weird, but as an empath reading other people’s joy helps me. Oh, and the empath thing doesn’t help this whole situation. I use to be able to turn it off with most people, but it’s been hard recently since the feeling people are experiencing right now are so passionate they are hard to ignore."
1452,Why does my best days result in empty nights,"So I’ve been through A LOT let’s just say that. It’s nothing like my parents divorced or stuff like that. It’s like actual trauma that Litterly changed my whole personality like I am not that same person I was 4 years ago and people do not like it but like fuck dude I can’t go back to the old me because that person is gone. I go about my day alone and during my days alone I am totally fine with it, but at night I just get so deep in my head it gets really bad. I am currently in college and that’s what keeps me distracted. This was my first day of thanksgiving break, and since I had nothing to do I’ve been miserable. Then this local gas station is hiring for employees (which is a rare thing for company’s looking for people during the winter months) so I told them I will fill out a resume and bring it in, in the morning. 

The thing is I am relying on this job to get me out of the house and at least interact with people on a daily basis. But mentally I cannot do 9 hour shifts. It’s not due to lazy ness it’s due to thoughts that pop up in my head and my whole life my coping mechanism is to lock myself in my room and just calm down. How do I secure this job but work like 5 hour shifts like 5 days a week. 5 hours is the perfect amount of time when it comes to me and working. (So basically part time) 

I cannot go through life blaming everything on my mental health issues, but it’s the reason why I quit my last job. The long 9 hour shifts, and the frequent panic attacks caused by little things that either customers do or words i over hear. What do I do I am so lost. How will I survive after college? I’m so scared"
1453,"SSRI, Bupropion, and Amphetamine?","Does anyone have experience with the above concoction? I’m going to be starting adderall for my adhd soon, SSRI for my anxiety/depression, and possibly bupropion if the ssri diminishes my sex drive. It’s a little nerve-wracking reading about people’s negative experiences with SSRIs that I almost don’t want to give it a shot. 

I’ve been on bupropion for two months now and the only side effects I’ve experienced are occasional blurred vision and suppressed appetite (not enough to cause weight loss). I can’t say that it’s changed my mood much though, which is why I’m switching to an ssri.

I hate chemically altering my body without knowing if it will even work for me :c"
1454,“This Way Up” show triggered me but I don’t know why,"Has anyone watched “This Way Up” on Hulu? I watched the first 10 or so minutes of the first episode before I was extremely triggered and had to turn the tv off. I felt the side effects of feeling boiling up from deeply buried places for a few days after watching it. I want to know what was so triggering for me. 

The show’s premise is “a comedy drama about moving on, moving forward as trying to find happiness.” I’d like to understand what mental difficulties/illness the main character has so I can better understand why I resonated with it so much and was so triggered."
1455,im not getting better and i dont know what to do about it,"ive been lying about my improving mental health for 3 ish years now. in 2016, i overdosed and was sent inpatient and it traumatized my mom (understandably so) and since then ive just been bullshitting about how i “really think im getting better”. i attended multiple alternative needs high schools due to my mental health issues, and even when i was there, i lied about getting better. i feel stuck. ive dug myself too deep. if i try and be honest, ill traumatize my mom even more. i dont have a job, i dont have any friends, my grades are too shitty for me to get into any med schools, i dont have a steady source of income, i just feel stuck. my “dad” doesnt believe that im mentally ill, even though ive been going to therapy and on medication for almost a decade. all he does is drink and ignore us. the only times he talks to us is so he can blame things on us or to yell at us to be quiet. i hardly leave the house (even before covid19) and i dont have a drivers license (even though im 18) so i dont really have anywhere else to go. 

im not really suicidal? like im not gonna try and kill myself, but i really wouldnt mind if i did. i feel like a burden. my therapist is great and really kind, but i lie to her too because i dont want to disappoint her. i know shes there to help me, but im still terrified of being judged. i have so much trauma and i just bottle it all up. i dont believe anything people tell me, even if theyre trying to help me. i feel like im spiraling down a never ending staircase. how much worse can it get before i crack?? i feel like shit for reaching out for help. i feel like people dont believe me or maybe im just being over dramatic. maybe my life is perfectly fine and my stupid ass brain is just skewing it all. i just feel trapped in my own brain and body. im debilitatingly awkward when people talk to me. i can hardly form a fucking sentence without stuttering or repeating myself or pausing and getting distracted. i dont want to reach out to anyone because i feel like id seem like one of those people who pretends to be mentally ill for attention. whats wrong with me? why cant my brain just fucking work??

people say “itll get better eventually, but you need to try!!” ive been trying for 10 god damn years and its getting worse. for the first 4 or 5 years i was genuinely committed to getting better. i was eight when i started dealing with this shit and by the time i was 13, i just gave up. it still wasnt improving even though i went to therapy and i took my meds and i did everything they told me to do. i dont even know what im asking about at this point lmao. for help i guess? but even when people try to help, i still feel like its fake? its not that i think theyre faking being nice, its more like i feel that i dont deserve it. like “well its been 10 years and im only getting worse, so its gotta be my fault right?”. but i cant tell. 

sorry if this post doesnt fit this sub, i just dont really know where else to go :/"
1456,Not having a really good night,"Damn it. I just lied outright to my daughter, telling her that everything is going so well and that I feel stronger than I did when I had gone to prison, etc. etc.  


That isn't true...not totally. I am stronger, but my disorder is going in the OTHER direction. Not getting BETTER but getting stronger and more out of control. Why can't I tell her the truth? She is 10000000% supportive of me and does not ever judge.

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling like a horse's patoot right now. I am on the verge of cutting because I feel so badly. Fuck. I just want peace. For once. Please. The only way for me to get peace is to blow my fucking brains out---AND THAT IS NOT HAPPENING! Not even close! I have to see my daughter graduate and my little one go to high school and beyond (he is in 5th Grade now)...I have too much to do. I have tried to kill myself, but didn't work, so the Universe is keeping me here for a reason. I would miss my family too much and I couldn't ever hurt them again like I had when I had been away for a year (prison).   


Dammit. I need to...do something. Good night Reddit! I am going to bed."
1457,I Don't Know What's Wrong,"Since junior year of high school(I'm a freshman in college now), I've had this... feeling. Every morning when I wake up, I have a lot of trouble getting out of bed. It's not just being tired or something like that, its like this sense of dread or a weight sitting on my chest. Even if I'm need to do something or want to do something and I'm really enthusiastic about it, I still have trouble getting up. 

This feeling doesn't just occur when I'm getting out of bed, it happens periodically throughout the day. It's not constant, but it always comes back, even if it is gone for a little while. Sometimes it'll even disappear for days or a week, but it always comes back. 

I honestly don't know what's wrong. I know I probably need to go to a therapist, and my girlfriend has been urging me to do so. The problem is I have this stigma in my mind against therapy. I don't think it's bad to get mental help, hell I've even encouraged people to do so. I just don't have the willpower or ability to force myself to go. It's like something in my mind is telling me not to. I think this may have stemmed from my childhood. I grew up in the Southern US, where in a lot of instances boys are taught, whether through the actions or words of the men around them, that men don't cry or feel down or anything like that. So what do I do? I'm so lost and I know I need help, I just don't know where to get it or what to do."
1458,My Ex-Boyfriend said something to me while we were dating that I can't get over.,"this post might be triggering  (s/h)

Last year I started my freshman year of college and I completely fell in love with this guy. Let's call him Boy.  Boy and I were basically inseparable. He made me genuinely happy and I hadn't felt that in a long time. He even told me he was going to marry me, because I was naive and this was my first real relationship, I believed him. Everything was great for the first six months. Right before my school kicked us out for covid, a guy at my school killed himself. I was hospitalized for suicide a while ago, so I got really upset by it because hearing about that kind of stuff is a bad trigger for me. Boy asked me why I was so upset so I told him what had happened because I figured he had a right to know. About a week later, I went to his dorm room and he told me he had cut himself. He showed me and I asked him what happened? Why did he do it? He said he wanted scares like mine and I was the reason he hurt himself.

We broke up about three weeks ago. I've always had a hard time opening up to people and now I'm terrified if I do they are going to hurt themselves or something. After I broke up with him I was really scared he would do something to himself. I made sure our friends were checking in on him and that he wasn't alone, but he seems fine.

How do I get over this?"
1459,I want to commit suicide,What do i do?
1460,"I (19f) want to be honest with my therapist about my plan to kill myself, but I also don’t want her to stop me.","I want to get this off of my chest and be fully honest with her, but I also don’t want her to send me to a psych ward, so I’m a bit conflicted.

I’m at a point in my life where every day feels exhaustive and the only thing keeping me going is knowing that I am going to end my life soon. I know exactly how I’m going to die and because I don’t want to fail, it’s taken awhile to ensure that it will work, and this past week or so I’ve finally found the means to make it happen exactly as I want it to. I have everything I need in order for it to happen. 

I can’t stress enough how tired I am, and how much I loathe my life. It’s been difficult to hold all of this in because of how excited I am to be done with everything; so much so that I’ve recently found myself beginning to tell my therapist about it but caught myself before I was able to fully elaborate. 

I know that most people will tell me to let her know and to receive help, but honestly? What help is there? I’ve already been through the mental healthcare system many times before and they’ve done absolutely nothing. There is nothing left for me here. All she would do is have me taken under a 72-hour hold and then I’d be let out and feel the same exact way, if not worse. If I can’t find the will to live, then no one is ever going to be able to help me. I know there is a small part of me that might want the help, given the fact that I am even sharing this information right now, but I also am ready to die."

1462,Odd behaviors after rejecting; could it be a disorder? Or just obsession?,"Someone I only talked to on social media and I rejected a few months ago, refused to believe I simply didn’t see him (27) romantically. Since the conversation, he has struggled to go longer than 20 minutes without asking where I am or what I am doing, and lately I’ve been noticing he is “copying” me. He is liking everything I like, eating what I eat, doing hobbies I enjoy, agreeing with my every opinion, and other things that quite honestly worry me. It causes me panic attacks, as he is a bit aggressive, as well. He is angry if I don’t answer right away, and passive aggressive if he doesn’t like the length or depth of my texts. We have never met or even talked on the phone. 

My question isn’t about me; it’s about him. Could this be a sign of a mental health disorder? Or is it just obsession?

As I try to handle the situation without setting him off, I’m trying to understand if there is an underlying issue. I’ve never had this situation happen after rejecting someone. 

Thank you! :)"
1463,I just want to feel something other than sadness,"Hi, I’m a 19 year old female who lives in Ontario, Canada, who doesn’t really understand how Reddit works all that much. I was diagnosed with anxiety at age 14 and have been on different medications since. I was hospitalized two years ago but I’m not going to say why because i don’t want to trigger people. Things got better and i felt like i was on top of the world for a year and a half. Now for the past 5 months I’ve felt this depression I’ve never felt before. It’s stronger than it was back when i was hospitalized.

I feel no sense of self worth at all and i don’t enjoy doing anything alone. I’ve developed insomnia and can’t sleep when I’m alone so i was given a medication to help me deal with this. I started to smoke marijuana to help and after a few months it no longer keeps the thoughts away.

I just can’t take care of myself. I will let my meds all run out and go through severe withdrawal EVERY MONTH. I quit my job a few days ago because i can’t handle the stress of college and work even though i have accommodations at school and only have 3/6 classes. My room is a disaster, i more commonly stay in my Pajamas all day than get dressed, i do not maintain friendships other than the one i have with my partner because he is a strong support in my life, and i can smile and laugh but do not feel true happiness. I’m not sure how to stop this. My days consist of waking up at 1pm (or whenever class starts), doing homework until about 8pm, playing video games (the only thing that i enjoy but only if I’m playing with other people), staying up until 4am, sleeping, and repeat.

I want to feel self worth, i want to have friends, i don’t want to feel this way anymore. I’ve been in counselling on and off since i was 11 and have done CBT. Does anyone know of any resources in my province that can help me? I connected with my college’s counsellor and I’m hoping to get free counselling through that. I just want more help, i don’t want to feel this way because i know it’s not healthy to look at myself and not feel like it’s me in the mirror. Anyone have any suggestions?? Thank you!"
1464,Is this normal? What is wrong with me!?,"I have two different personalities that I switch from and I give them names. 

The first one her name is spirit. 
She believes she let go of her past &amp; already moved on from it. She’s Innocent. And she has already moved on from her past &amp; she’s blooming and doing better now. 

The second one her name is Lola. Lola is the girl who can’t let go of everything that has been thrown her way. She seeks revenge &amp; is very angry. She’s sad. She’s far from innocent. She wants to do stupid, reckless things. She’s very sexual &amp; promiscuous. 

Some days I’m Lola and others I’m spirit. Sometimes they collide and it’s a big mess."
1465,Is it really the drugs?,"I used to enjoy smoking weed, because it was something I’d do maybe twice a month at most.

Working a 9-5 was mentally draining and so I would really look forward to the weekend to get toasted with some friends.

However... 

I didn’t touch any of it for about 2 years and now with covid and everything else going on..

I can’t last a day... I can’t go more than 3 hours.

I’ve tried tethering myself off of it slowly but it’s working out no better than me simply going cold turkey. 

I do have depression, though it was manageable in the past.. just nowadays with this pandemic intertwined with my own personal demons has cooked up one disastrous meal... &amp; I’ve lost my appetite.

I’ve been forced to make a believable excuse to get some time off of work because come on.. whose going to believe me if I tell them I’m depressed? 

Anyways,

I want to take this time to get a grip on myself as I do believe I can come out of this bad habit.

I know my depression isn’t going anywhere but with my cannabis addiction, I feel I’m just going entirely downhill in terms of any feasible progress. 

Any tips or help would be helpful please and thank you 🙁"
1466,Has anyone else read their past diaries and realise they should have seen a mental health specialist earlier?,"I know I’d always been a very sensitive kid, but when I just read my diaries from when I was 16-19, now with a calmer, more mature and self-loving mindset... It sounds like I was also extremely lonely, pessimistic and hard on myself* (either that, or I was super melodramatic).

*in this period of time I was always either stressed out about keeping up my performance in school (my country in Asia is known to have one of the most stressful education systems in the world), or handling the diagnosis that I had a neurological congenital defect and having to have craniectomy + laminectomy, or handling the fact that my dad’s health was deteriorating, being his partial &amp; afterwards full time caregiver,  and ultimately him dying.. or more than one thing at the same time. Yet it was only 2 years after my dad died that I finally thought I needed to see a counsellor. Why did I wait for so long? 

Did anyone else also wait till you were at your breaking point before seeking professional heals?"
1467,How to help kid with psychosis make friends?,"This might not be the place for this

My sibling is in 8th grade and has had psychosis since early 2019. This entails him constantly talking to himself/ laughing when no-one is around, he sometimes hears things that aren't there, and  will hear (our family) say things when everyone isn't talking to him, in the same room as him, or is quiet. Many times, he doesn't pay attention to what's happening in his surroundings or when we talk to him. He gets extremely angry when we try to bring it up, and will deny it happening. It's gotten worse since his medication dropped, (as he was getting better they though they could drop the medication), but instead it got worse after the medication dropped. In class he isn't able to focus, but is able to stop the side talking to himself, but often disturbs his class to the point the teachers are getting upset. He has gotten instagram a few months ago, and has become kinda obsessed with it. He uses it like a messaging app, almost daily trying to message people he hasn't talked to in 2 years or classmates he doesn't know all to well but found the instagram of. I've always assumed he's been lonely in quarantine and have tried to get him into some of the hobbies I have but he isn't as interested. I recently decided to look through his instagram DMs when he was sleeping since I found his password (ik I won't do it again), and some of the messages kinda made me sad. Some of the kids, mostly boys, were messaging back as he often reached out to them to ask what's up or what they're doing. But some of the girls, seemed to be a bit meaner, as he would say hello and what's up and they would respond with ""Stop texting me it's annoying"" or ""im going to block you"". He'd reply with ""why not?"" or ""Do you still want to be friends"" and they'd start ignoring him from there. This made me extremely sad for the first time in a long time. He doesn't have too many friends anymore as they moved away or got busy, and he was always a social kid before. He gets to see one kid similar in age a bit more since we're family friends with me and his brother being friends, but I have a feeling when I move into college winter quarter he might meet them less, and with me being gone he'll be more lonely. Idk what to do to help him make friends or help him feel lonely. And also how long does childhood psychosis last, I know it'll go away but maybe if you have experience do you know how long? Any advice honestly helps."
1468,I think I have serious problems,"Writing this on a throwaway because, although I don’t really have much linking my to my identity on other reddit accounts, this is something I’ve kept very very hidden. To start with i’m a male. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything but I think I have serious problems. When I was in high school a lot of times I would stay inside all day and basically do nothing playing video games all day, I had no life. I didn’t realize I had problems until I was 16 and started becoming suicidal at a point because I thought I was a loser and worthless. The closest I ever got I held a knife to a throat in my bathroom contemplating it. I’d thought I recovered as senior year of high school and freshman year of college I’ve seriously been able to be in a much better place mentally and hide these problems. I started hanging out with friends a lot more, started drinking/smoking weed mildly, doing much better gradewise(3.8 gpa in stem field), joined a fraternity and was pretty content with my sex life. No one would really be able to tell I was ever depressed because I was always laughing and making jokes and just genuinely enjoying myself. Then come the start of confinement and shit hit the fan. Luckily my school had pass/fail but if not my GPA would have been a 2.9, I need a 3.5 to stay in an honors program which I am in. I was  in a horrible place mentally, extremely sad and bored out of my mind even though i tried to leave the house as much as possible to exercise. Although shit didn’t get as bad as before I developed a serious roblox and masturbation addiction. Then come this summer: I start doing a deliver job to make money, trying to learn a new language and using a dating app to meet with girls it helps me tremendously. I am doing much better this semester grade wise even though I am taking much harder courses than lastt"
1469,How do you hide SH?,"I don’t know what happened honestly I think I just lost my mind and hurt myself today. It’s stupid, but I used to have a history and knew a lot about SH but I guess after years I just forced myself to forget it all. It’s pretty deep, I’ve been trying to hold it with butterfly stitches. I remember trying superglue once but that didn’t really go the way I had planned. I’m just scared because my stupid ass decided why not put it right on the arm, not even look just swing for it, and now I’m risking my relationship with my s/o because he’s not a fan and over a year back told me if I ever hurt myself he’s break up with me... I don’t want him finding out to add any more stress to his life that I already give him, but I’m clueless as how to hide it. It’s probably gonna take a minute to heal, it’s above my elbow so I can’t really hide it with jewelry or something. And we live together so I’m doubtful long sleeves can last very long.. any advice would be super helpful."
1470,I don't think my mental health is bad enough.,"I have never made a suicide attempt, where I have landed in hospial. I have thought about suicide a lot, but I have never truely come to an end, where I was going to take my own life. I have swolled a load of tablets, and nothing has happened but that is it. I never used to think I would say this, but I am far more likely to hurt somebody else. I never think about hurting people, apart from recently. I just feel like I lack self control. Like, I can not control it. I think I have BPD, ADHD, and I am a little bit anti-social. I guess, I will just have to wai to see, what the doctors say. See, if they can actually help me."

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been in therapy for most of this year. I've had a hard time dealing with my emotions and just how I feel about things in general. I have ADHD and, though I speak to a therapist about it every two weeks, I don't feel like I'm ever going to get out of the hole I feel myself in. I believe that I have Tourette's as well, though I've never been diagnosed. I say the most awful things seemingly at random and it drives me mad. Violent, sexual, blasphemous, and just downright absurd things. Trying to manage it has had less than stellar results. I have no idea how to even begin addressing that. I've also dealt with emotional abuse and neglect from my parents growing up and generally, nobody in the family really seems to grasp the way that I feel. They seem unable to acknowledge or even understand how their actions have had a negative effect on my life. This frustrates me quite often, but I don't even know why, since every time I reflect on the issues and memories I just get angry and have an imaginary shouting match with them. I do it when I'm alone and when I'm at work. I work in a factory, so most people can't hear me when I do it there. My doctors and therapist have also diagnosed me with anxiety and depression, which are easy to believe, my mom used to make a mountain out of every molehill. ""Don't do that with your hands, if someone outside saw that, they could think it was gang signs and shoot you!"" or ""one of these days I'll be dead and gone and you'll regret not having spent time with me!"" If it wasn't some greatly exaggerated fear it was a guilt trip for something completely undeserving of such a thing. My dad wasn't much better. He was (still is) quick to anger and often times puts his own interests ahead of his kids, though he's been better with my brother, on both accounts. Dad tried to force his hobbies on me and when I would protest or fail at them, he'd get mad, so I've always had this belief that I am a failure. Like, ""You're gonna fail, why bother?"" It's emotionally exhausting. And that was before my step mom came into the picture. Don't get me wrong, without her I wouldn't have my brother or my step sister, both of whom I care for deeply, but she made my life hell when she moved in. I was told at the age of sixteen that I either needed a job or a new place to live, so I had to quit playing on the golf team in HS to work. All of my hobbies were ""unproductive"" or ""wastes of time"" so I just quit doing them. Even that didn't stop her from coming after me. She'd find something, anything, to yell at me or belittle me for and if I tried to stand up for myself, she'd text my dad so that he'd yell at or belittle me when he got home. I would show them things that I was proud of, something I learned to do or made myself, and they would obviously be uninterested or dismissive. At the time I was working at a pizza place in the next town over. More of the same there. There were few breaks from the stress. I slept at school because I was exhausted. I'd go to work, come home, do homework, go to bed for 2-3 hours, wake up and do it all again. My mom was living across the state line in Virginia at the time (we're from NC) with her boyfriend, who made it no secret that he disliked me for more of the same reasons. I was supposedly lazy, unproductive, unambitious, and ungrateful. Everything about their life up there was work. I was so tired of it. All the schoolwork, plus the job and the chores expected of me at my dad's place (all the more labor intensive ones, step-sister was expected to do the cleaning) and then having to deal with work from sun up to sun down on my only days away from the rest of that was exhausting and when I finally got my job at the factory, things seemed to calm down for a bit. Eventually, though, things went back to the way they were. My step sister went to college and I stayed with my dad. They were pressuring me to move out so my step sister could have my room when she got back from school, so I moved in with my grandma. That was early 2019, I had started school at the local CC for CNC machining during the Summer of 2018. I was enjoying it, but it was taxing on me with my full time job. I made some good friends and some fond memories while I was there and I did get a certificate of completion in manual machining, but I had to quit early this year because of the stress and COVID. Work is just monotonous and I am so tired that I have no idea what to do with my free time. Late last year, I started to get close to a coworker of mine. I hadn't felt this way about a girl since senior year of HS in 2015. Everything about her just made me happy. I told her how I felt and she initially responded positively, but with her having children and struggling financially it was difficult to make plans with her. As time went on I felt her growing more and more distant. Eventually, around July/August, she tells me that she wished that the circumstances were different around us. ""We're coworkers, I'm older than you, and I've got kids."" Ok, nbd, I've been rejected before. Then she tells me that she couldn't see herself dating me, or two of my other coworkers (let's call them B and N) by name. Said she saw us as brothers. Ok. Well fast forward to October and I'm talking with N and he shows me a message from another coworker on his phone and we're laughing about it, then he backs out and I see the girl's name (Y) in his contacts with hearts next to it. I knew what it meant, but I asked him, so he tells me everything. Says they have been together since August, started talking in July. Y asked him out and came onto him. They slept together a few times and she got pregnant and they were moving in together. She hadn't been to work in a few days and he told me it was because she miscarried. Now I had no idea how to take this because I considered them both close friends. Both of them were well aware of my feelings for Y. If they had told me from the start I think i wouldn't have been as upset, but to find out all of that at once was soul crushing. N and I are around the same age. We were in the same graduating class. I have known him for nearly ten years. I had the sudden realization that what she didn't like was me. It wasn't the circumstances because all of those she listed also exist between her and N. It was me. I felt so hurt and betrayed by two people that I considered close friends and I have no idea how to process it. I am constantly torn between hating them, trying to forgive them, wanting to still be their friend, wanting to never see them again. I don't want to be mad because she didn't want to be with me and I still want to be a good friend, but man, I am so hurt. My mind was already pretty haywire before all of this, but this just piled so much more on. Idk if they even value my friendship at all. or if I should care. They both apologized. They both explained their side of things to me. I got two different stories though. Not about how things happened, but how they see the relationship. N sees it as serious, but Y saw it as something fun to do that got out of hand. She was only moving in with him because she was pregnant with his kid, but then she lost it. She told me she doesn't want to break his heart, but she doesn't know what to do. I won't be helping them through it regardless of whether we stay friends or not. I don't have the energy for it. My other friends tell me to relish in his eventual heartbreak, but idk if I even want to do that. I don't want to be a vindictive person. I'm just tired. I feel like my mind is blocked and that I can't even think of a way out. I have no desire to hurt myself or others, but I just want all of this to stop and I don't know how or where to start."
1472,Should I just kill myself?,"I mean really. Wtf? I used to think about suicide, and think”I would never do that.”

I don’t feel that way anymore. I’m scared of myself."
1473,2020 but as a week,"So this year‘s been kind a terrible but I can assume that’s just the way 2020 is going. To start it off I am so close to finishing my degree and have no drive or idea what I’m doing with my life.  I feel so incredibly lost in the world and it doesn’t help that financially I’m not doing the greatest. A couple months ago I lost a close family friend due to Covid and that just kind of hit hard because I was moving and I hadn’t talk to her in a long time. As well as my s/o had decided to stop going to school and was going to be joining the Navy within the next few months and I was to be moving away from everyone and everything all alone.  They were supposed to spend the time they had left before basic down here with me helping me move and getting everything ready but due to Covid everyone felt it was better if he just stayed with his family. And it sucks because I really really love his family and they’re all I have and so now I am in this new place with a new job with no one for the holidays or my birthday.  To finish it all up I went to see all of them before he left and I let my roommate take care of all my fish and frogs. I came back to my apartment where I found all of my fish dead. The only living fish was my beta Germaine who I bought when I was unbelievably depressed. Now in a time filled with so much sadness and screaming my heart out and crying every single night I just got out of the shower to find my last and only fish dead.  I know I should be grateful that I have a roof over my head and I have a job and that I am still in a relationship and that I have his family to support me but this all kind of really sucks. Anytime I’m not doing something I feel empty and I cry and I break down and fall to the floor. This fish dying what is the last bit holding me together. I just cried for 20 minutes about a fish that I’ve only owned for about eight months.  


TLDR: I bought a fish when life sucked and now that life sucks even more he just died. What should I do?

Also bonus points if you know why his name is Germain

1474,I’ve suddenly been obsessing and dreaming about someone i used to have a crush on over 6 years ago and i don’t know why and i don’t like feeling like this,"Like a month ago i had a very weird experience where i had a vivid dream about a guy i had a huge crush on in high school. It was just a normal interaction in my dream. When i woke up i felt extremely sad that the dream wasn’t real and now i have these dreams more than a few times every week. I think about this guy on a daily basis now even though i don’t want to and i realize that this obsession is abnormal. 

I guess this wouldn’t be too weird if i was in highschool but i am a 24 year old adult. I did actually cross paths with him a few years back at a concert and he pulled me aside and asked if i had a crush on him and i confessed and said yes and it turns out the feeling was mutual. But that was it and at the time i really didn’t even think about it much after as he had already left my mind a long time ago. We never talked again after. He was (and is still) kind of a bummy guy now. I would never even date him so it makes no sense that i am obsessing over him now.

The main reason i don’t like this is because i have a boyfriend who I’ve been dating for almost 3 years now. I feel so disgusting having this obsession. I love my boyfriend so much and he’s great. We live together. Like all couples we’ve had our differences but we’ve been pretty good at solving our conflicts. I really do think he’s the one I’ll end up marrying. So WHY is my mind obsessing over a guy that doesn’t even compare to my boyfriend?

I feel like a psycho, honestly. When i think about this guy i also get the urge to look him up on social media and just creep on him for fun. I would absolutely never contact him. I want nothing more than this obsession to go away and to stop feeling crazy. 

Any input, options, or advice for my problem would help."
1475,I said something racist to my auntie and my mental health is in pieces!,"I am absolutely mortified by this and posting here because I can’t cope with how awful I feel.

My aunt and I were flicking through photos from a previous family holiday. My eldest child gets such a lovely tan. I’m very envious! When describing the colour, I said “she doesn’t go that golden brown colour, it’s more a dirty brown” what I meant is that it’s a really earthy tone of brown but the way it came out is just all sorts of wrong. I apologised to my aunt and explained what I had meant but it’s just really playing on my mind. I feel awful and think my auntie will have a horrible opinion of me now 😢

I have anxiety and depression and I’m starting to get really panicky because of what I’ve done! Please help!"
1476,"Finally seeking professional help , nervous as hell.","Finally after years of suffering in silence on my own I’ve finally gotten the courage to seek professional help. Ever since I was 14 I’ve had passive suicidal thoughts. I’m 22 now but all my life I felt like I was just being carried by the tide of time. Just wandering aimlessly. Doing things for the sake of doing things. I kept going carrying with me the tiny hope that maybe things will get better when I finish high school , or when I finish university or when I finally get a job. I thought if I start earning money and be able to do and get things I want life would feel more worthwhile. But here I am, unsure with the career path I chose. Always on edge before work and feeling so tired after work that I don’t really get to do anything for myself. Time’s just passing by again and i’m just going through it. Life is still feeing pointless. 

I found it hard to pursue things I want for myself because in the back of my mind I feel like I’m just going to kill myself anyway so what’s the point of trying. And this mentality has held me back so much.  Everybody around me has made me feel invalidated of my own emotions that even I started to question wether what I was thinking and feeling was real.  

Feeling so fucking confused all the time and the lingering suicidal ideation is so exhausting. It’s like i’m on my last straw. But I guess before I fully give up i’ll give hope one last shot. I don’t know where and how to begin to find help so I’ve just booked a GP appt and would try to get a referral and see how it goes from there. 

My appointment’s nearing and now i’m feeling unsure and I want to chicken out. I feel like i’m just lying to myself and that maybe I don’t need professional help since I made it out for years of struggling with my mental health idk idk i feel so weird I feel like I’ll just waste the doctor’s time because there’s nothing wrong with me and maybe I’ve just been overreacting my whole life."
1477,Confused about my career path due to mental health issues,"I am a student of Law from India. I have a problem that I have been facing for years. Loneliness. Firstly in the start I took therapy and it was all about my lack of self love that I found myself utterly miserable in college. Further, I live at home, so both parents, who are lawyers themselves, go out leaving me alone at home. After college ended I knew that now was not the time to sit and think about my situation and mental health. It would be better that I study and get admission for my post graduation and get out of my house so that I may find a new environment. This was the same thing my therapist advised me as well. But as well all know Corona happened. Entrance exams got postponed. So that time went well for me. I decided that it's a golden opportunity and I have now ample to study. Plus all my friends were free themselves. Therefore I didn't felt lonely at that time. I being overconfident that I only need to focus on a single entrance exam, didn't apply for other colleges which were less prestigious despite of the fact my friends suggested otherwise. I failed miserably.

My confidence was shattered. I had no idea what happened. It was probably my lack of preparation that ate me up. All of my batch mates also didn't make it but they had backups. Hence they went on. Demoralized, I said no, I cannot give up this easily. I then started to prepare for judicial services(It's like a Administrative service exam just for lawyers). The syllabus for that is bit easy than post graduate colleges. I decided to prepare at home and attempting for post graduation next year. The classes for this year will be online for post graduation. Hence my goal of getting out and making new friends or changing the environment would be defeated.

Now here comes the problem. I recruited a friend of mine along with who I study for judicial services. But she is a bit busy with her house chores but regardless she tries her best to keep up. Then there is another with whom I work on physical fitness. Some friends whom I kinda talk to but I hate bothering any one of them. I just hate being seen as needy. So basically, this is way I try to keep myself busy. But recently, people are getting busier, some have there classes starting. Hence I am left all alone in the end. And no doubt that as soon as my graduation completes, I have to work my ass off to keep up with my career. But although I am not bothered much when people don't talk or respond, it does hamper my ability to study efficiently. The thoughts of what they will think or say or anything else just eat me up while studying. I have improved my lifestyle and study routine. But it is not upto the mark.

You could say deep down I know that preparing for exams at home is not going as well as expected. The alternative to all this is me just getting inside litigation period. Litigation is a very hard field but as I have a family background, things are going to be a bit easier for me. But seriously saying, thinking about it scares the shit out of me. I just know that life will be very hard there in litigation. I would be treated like shit. Seniors would not even give the light of day for the first few months but still I would probably get out of the house. Now the thing is that I have been given the option to try whatever I want by my parents for 3 years or I could join litigation right now. But somewhere I know that preparation will pay off but at what cost. I am seriously confused as to what I should do?. I have this notion in my mind that if I am able to find a good friend circle, only then I would be able to prepare for judicial services properly for which I want to go in for post graduation. Is this thought process correct? Please help"
1478,Why can't I reach out,"Hi, first time posting here (and anywhere on reddit, actually). I just wanted to talk/vent, hope that's okay.

A few things about me, I'm 21 years old and I live in California. I'm a high functioning autistic with anxiety and I have had depressive episodes throughout my life, with the worst one being roughly two years ago. I've had a plan my entire life, to go to college, get my bachelor's, and get a degree that I can use in some nebulous future job. Things didn't exactly go according to plan, which is what I'm going to talk about.

I graduated from high school with decent grades in June of 2018 and began attending at UC Merced that fall. Started out great, made friends with a few hallmates, went to classes, played video games, typical college experience. But things started going wrong over time. A hard to understand concept here, a missed assignment there, things just kept adding up over time. Every time something went wrong was just another pang of depression and self-loathing. It was draining, which unfortunately made it harder to understand and harder to keep up, made it a vicious cycle.  It got to the point where I didn't go to classes, didn't do assignments because it was just too much effort to get out of bed. I could barely muster the energy to get up to go get something to eat. Obviously this wasn't sustainable.  I ended up on academic probation in December 2018, and fully dismissed from the University in May 2019. 

I took classes at my local community college after that. Just two classes, I didn't want to overexert myself after what happened at the four year. And I thought ""Yeah I can do this, I can handle this. This is nothing compared to a four year."" It wasn't, but that was the problem. I got lax, I got complacent, and I ended up failing both of those classes by the end of fall semester 2019. At least, I think I did. I was too ashamed to show my face there, or even log in to the portal and check. 

And that brings us basically up to the present. I have two part-time jobs right now, but I'm not taking classes, which honestly may be almost a good thing right now because I've heard from my friends and many others that zoom schooling during COVID sucks. But I don't think I can do school before I figure out what my problem is. The problem is, though, is that I need to reach out and ask for help to figure out exactly what my problem is. The past few years have taught me that that is exactly what I'm incapable of. It wasn't like I didn't know where or how to get help. There were plenty of times over the last couple years where it was clearly shown where to get academic help, where to get mental health support, at the four-year, at the community college, in general. Heck, after a disturbing social media post I made at my lowest point in UC Merced, I even had a couple police officers show up at my door to escort me to the school's mental health professional. I don't know if it's out of a sense of pride or sense of shame or whatever, but there's just something in my head that's keeping me from doing what I need to do.

I was never taught that getting help is a bad thing to do. My dad struggles with depression, and my parents weren't even angry after I was dismissed from my four year, even though it was planned so heavily that we've been saving up for me to go to college since I was born. They told me that there were other options, that I didn't have to go to a four year, but for me, that's still the plan. I want to go back, whether it's to UC Merced or somewhere else, and I want to get my bachelor's degree. But I don't know how to do that when I can't even ask for help now. I need to set up a therapist, I'm in the process of doing that, I think all that's left is making the phone call to schedule an appointment, but I can't do it because the same problems that have plagued me for the last couple years still bother me now. My mom made a comment tonight about how ""life is passing me by"", and it made me angry, but I can't even disagree with her because she is absolutely right. It's been almost a year since I've taken a class. My brother is 3 years younger and just started college, most of the people my age are about to get their bachelor's next year, but how the hell am I supposed to move forward, or even get back on the path I chose, when I can't even make a phone call to help myself?

Tl;dr My problem is that I don't ask for help, but in order to fix that problem I need to ask for help. See the catch-22?"
1479,I’m overwhelmed with College and may fail if I don’t fix myself,"Sorry, I kinda rambled an this ended up being way longer than I thought it would.
So I’m 19yrs old and am currently in a 2yr science program at a Canadian college. I’m roughly 3/4 done my 3rd semester and these past few weeks have honestly become extremely tough. I’ve never really had any serious concerns with my mental heath before but now I have no clue what I need to do to get myself back on track.

Originally, I felt as if I could thrive in the pandemic, I was really motivated to do well. I also worked pretty hard last year and was well on track to be an honour roll student. For the first 5ish weeks I was pretty motivated but I slowly started falling behind on assignments and since then, my grades have been dropping really fast.

In the past 3 or 4 weeks I’ve become super disorganized and have gotten little to no work done. As of right now, I have some huge assignments due, and most of which I haven’t even started. My professors has been super fair with the deadlines but honestly, I have no excuses for being late because I’ve had multiple weeks to work on them.

I’m honestly really concerned about even getting through the year at this point because I will fail if this continues any longer. The worst part is that I’m not panicking at all, I have had no emotion to this at all and feel like I’m walking around dead on the outside (if that makes any sense). However, Im extremely stressed all the time on the inside. My sleep schedule has also disappeared, Ill sleep 13hrs one day and 4 the next. I also feel like I get super tired whenever I try to sit down to work now and end up taking 2hr naps instead. On top of this, I haven’t had a real social life since March, I saw a couple friends over the summer and thought I’d be okay but in September they moved away to school so I’ve been alone since and it’s taking a pretty big toll as well. 

Main point of this is that my parents paid for most of my first year and I paid for my second, so I don’t want to disappoint them and waste their (and my) money by completely throwing away a semester. I’m honestly just confused and stressed and have no idea how to get out of this one. Any replies/advice from anyone is extremely appreciated, Thank you!"
1480,What do your maladaptive daydreams look like?,Mine always involve a stage. Not sure what that means exactly.
1481,How much of what chemical would kill me?,"I'm trying to kill myself, I am not looking for help, I want someone to give me an answer and that's it, I'm done with life, I've tried too much and so many bad things happened today, my dog got sick and my parents might be splitting. This both is tough, it's always one bad news after another, everyday, I can't take it. Just tell me okay. I have I think like bleach, windex, and that's it I think, I just want to know how much is lethal. Thank you."
1482,Everything is fine except for everything,"I have no motivation to do anything. I'm barely holding on. I really want to just end my shit, but I don't have life insurance to pay for my funeral expenses or to clean out my apartment. I feel so alone and empty even though I have friends and I'm talking to and hanging out with people. I care so little about myself and I feel like I'm practically screaming for help, but I keep getting turned away. I have to pretend like I'm fine in order for people to like being around me. I'm so freaking tired."
1483,How can i express myself?,"I am away from home and have to live with co-workers for about a year. It’s a job trip, so i am going to be here for awhile until i get back. I had bad history with some of my co-workers. I got to deal with it since im here now. I just don’t want to be screwed over like i did in the past. I thank God that i made some new friends while i been here who i can trust. I had a hard year last year and just don’t want to deal with any of the mistakes I encountered in the past. I just want to be a nice guy and don’t want any problems. 

Can anyone give me opinions?"

1485,Help me start a conversation?,"TW; depression

Hi :) 

I'm a 22 year old young woman who grew up in a family where I constantly felt like the black sheep.  I just recently discovered I have ADHD which has gone unnoticed my whole life (despite having every symptom lol).  This has lead to incredible social anxiety (especially throughout my childhood), depression, overall anxiety and extremely low self esteem... all of these things I'm still dealing with, and have only gotten worse during the pandemic.  My parents are loud trump supporters (I am so far from that) &amp; are not very sensitive to my mental health ... I don't think they believe me when I do tell them I'm depressed.  I've been in therapy for about a year now and started taking anti-depressants a few months ago ... my parent's response is that they don't like me going on meds... 

I am actively avoiding living at my parents house at the moment because having my depression invalidated is heart breaking and exhausting for me... When I *am* living with my parents, I just spiral into my depression and I don't feel like myself ... I feel like im hiding myself so I don't get picked on (they will get in fights with me about politics &amp; social justice issues).  I feel like I've been running a marathon and I just need a break.  My dad wants to help, but says he doesnt know how... is anyone familiar with a book, website, or article that might be helpful to send to my parents?  I need them to be able to have the information to help me so I can finally feel supported by them.

Thank you for reading this far, I'm currently typing through tears so I'm sorry if things sound jumbled here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I need help finding resources to give to my parents to help them understand im not making up my depression so I can finally receive the help I deserve.  (I'm 22 &amp; living with an aunt to avoid them)."
1486,I cannot imagine a life where I dont end up dead early,"Every year i think “it will get better”

It has only gotten incredibly worse every year. 

To be honest i think i am incapable of change. I dont think someone like me can be fixed. I can only see a life where i kill myself. I cannot see myself being capable of love, capable of making friends, capable of getting a job, capable of taking care of myself, capable of living a life worth living. It’s a disappointing reality but I feel like it would be easier for me to accept it at this point than to waste more time trying to fix things. Idk"
1487,"I know I'm hurting people because of my poor mental health, but I don't know how to make things better","So to start off, I haven't been clinically diagnosed with anything. I've been on-and-off seeing psychologists for many years but nothing has ever come of it because I've had issues with holding back information and not revealing the extent to which I'm suffering. 

Anyway, despite not being diagnosed with anything, it's clear that my mental health is poor. Something that's been an issue for a long time has been me lashing out at my family. Any little thing can trigger me and I can go from 0-100 in seconds for seemingly trivial things. From there things spiral and I dig myself into holes - spending weeks in my room not coming out because I've had a fight with a family member, etc. 

I know that my mental health is negatively affecting the people around me because I see how much it hurts my family when I lash out at them and when I'm just miserable all the time, as they like to put it. But I don't know how to 'get better'. During the times I've seen psychologists (COVID prevented me from having access to a psychologist this year), my family have expected me to simply get better, and have told me that I'm not trying hard enough when things don't go as quickly as they want. And I know I'm hurting them but at the same time I'm almost resentful of the fact that they have placed such pressure on me to get better. I have issues with apologising, but after a lot of work on this through therapy I'm now better able to apologise. So when I lash out, I apologise now, but my mum has taken to not accepting my apologises. She'll say stuff like 'whatever, until you do it again' or 'I'm done with you', etc. I just feel like I'm stuck in this place where I don't even know what to do to make things better. 

Sorry for this rant. I just don't know what to do and thought maybe somebody would be able to relate or give me some advice or support or anything."
1488,Consumed by Loneliness," 

Feel like I'm digging myself a hole, but I don't know what to do other than keep digging and hoping I come out the other side.  I'm not quite sure how to be concise with what is essentially a lifelong problem but here goes.  About 10 years ago now I had a pretty bad breakup with my then girlfriend, one which I have never really fully recovered from.  When we were together I promised her that I would always be there for her no matter what, and so when we broke up I made the very questionable decision of keeping her in my life.  


  Fast forward to now and she is my best friend, and really the only person IRL that I can talk to about anything I need to.  The problem is that every time I have to say goodbye to her it kills me a little more.  I know I should probably remove her from my life but it's far too late for that now as she needs me and I need her. I know for sure that there's no chance of us ever getting back together as she sees me more like a brother now, but I still can't figure out how to move on after 10 years.  I've talked to her about it but try to keep things fairly minimal because I know it makes her feel bad. She has said things like ""I wish I had feelings for you as well because your right we would be perfect for each other.""  


 Since we were together I've never dated anyone IRL but not for lack of trying. I have a lot of difficulties meeting people, and online dating has been a complete bust. A couple years ago i had a long distance online relationship with someone I met through a video game but that was just too difficult for both of us for many reasons and it ended mutually.  I just feel completely lost and hopeless.  All I ever really feel anymore is loneliness."
1489,Why me,"So where to start? Im not feeling depressed or anything. So i just got taken off my meds for depression. The only reason they did that was i was eating eddibles. The only reason i was eating them was it help me so much. I was able to do the things everyone recommends. My anxiety was super low while i was high. The only reason i choose the edibles is because i nearly hung my self. Like rope around my neck. I steped down. I went to my local dispensary and got some eddibles. I was so high it changed me or even saved me.

So ive stop my meds for about 4 days now really 5. Ive been feeling the withdrawal symptoms. A week or 2 before i stoped them i was not trusting anyone. I thought this was weird. Then a week after i returned yo work i started to see and hear things. I felt like someone or thing was after me. I was freaking out. I was barely able to make it through the night.(i work graveyard 12h shifts) i haven't felt like this sence high school. I kinda felt like they will come back. Im just super scard and afraid. I know i shouldn't tell anyone. Well at least that what the voices say. They say if i tell someone i will be punishment. Im risking my life by reaching out. To me life is hell."
1490,Last night was a very confusing night for me.,"I am 16 years old and live in England. I've had anxiety since I was very young. Certain things like my dad leaving before I was born and some darker stuff have caused my anxiety. This is my second time going to therapy. I suffered with intrusive thoughts which is why I went to therapy the first time. I felt like I was healed when I was finished. I started school after 6 months in lockdown. I felt confident after having a girlfriend for the first time, we did break up before school started again but we are great friends to this day. It all went down hill though. My mental health started to decline. I stopped concentrating in school and was just in constant confusion. I would come home and cry. I believe I have the best mother in the world. She has helped me through all of this. Everytime I cry, I cry in front of her. She always calms me down. She is the reoson I am still here. I have never been suicidal. My life is amazing. I live in a nice house, have family always by my side, go to a good school and live in a really good neighbourhood, but I feel so hopeless and lost.

I had helped a girl all throughout lockdown with her mental health (not my ex girlfriend). It was done over Snapchat, she was my friends friend and she turnt into my friend. I've never met her (she lives very close to me). She would tell me her problems everyday, this didnt bother me because I knew how to help her. And that's what I did, he boyfriend texted me thanking me for making her realise she wants to get better. I was overjoyed to hear this. I thought it was finished, I thought she wouldn't tell me her problems anymore. I was wrong. Everyday she would tell me the bad things in her life which started to effect me badly, I forgot how to help myself. Me and my ex girlfriend had a bit of a bump and this made me realise I needed a break from social media, I told all my friends and then deleted it all. I came back a week later, I started talking to my ex again and we became even better friends then before. But I didn't want to talk to the girl I was helping everyday. I was told to slowly remove her from my life. I was terrified of doing this but I knew I had to. I just told her i wasn't using social media that much anymore (this is completely true BTW). Didn't speak to her for a while until she asked me if my social media break was over, then she said she understands if not, it did feel kinda pushy and seemed like she needed someone to lay her problems on, sadly I couldn't handle it. I explained how I am struggling and can't help anyone anymore. Then we both wished each other well and I haven't spoken to her since. I always help people with a nice message when they are feeling low in life, they always said I help. But I am not a therapist, I cannot help someone to that extent. I feel terrible for it but it is something that had to be done. 

Fast forward to now and I feel hopeless. I don't have hope for the future. I don't like myself, I feel I am completely broken. I am going to a therapist in school but I don't think he is helping that much. I haven't done homework in a month, I can't do it. I feel anxious when I think of doing it. It feels like a mental block not allowing me to do it. The teachers know of my situation and are very supportive of it. I have tests coming up and I'm going to fail them. I have no idea what's happening in class and can't concentrate ever. My mind is constantly thinking, it just doesn't shut up. I don't know how I can't fix this. I feel terrible for not doing the homework and not studying. 

Last night, I was calling my ex because we are friends. We make each other happy and we laugh ourselves crazy when we speak. Im always making her laugh, but last night I couldn't do it. I was happy and all of a sudden I felt terrible. She noticed and asked me what's wrong. I had no idea what to say. She always helps me when I'm sad and won't leave until I'm happy. I started shaking and was just staring into the distance, I turned off my camera so she couldn't see me. I didn't know what to talk about or say to her. She told me everything is okay. Tears started coming out and I just lay there, I normally tell people when I cry and I'm always honest with how I'm feeling, this time I couldnt. I just stared at the ceiling crying, I felt like this was the end. I wasnt thinking of ways to kill myself,  for some reason it felt like the last time I was going to talk to her. I was going to call me other friend after her and just thought how sad it was going to be talking to him for the last time. I was overcome with the absolute feeling of hopelessness. But I knew if I was going to acctually kill myself I would make sure everyone knew how meaningful they are and I would make sure our goodbye was perfect. So I didn't do that, because I knew to myself that I was going to wake up in the morning to talk to these people again. My ex was showing me all her art she has done and it made me feel good, she helped me, like always. I left the call and went to play PlayStation with my friend. Speaking to him also helped. I felt a bit better. I went downstairs to my mom to watch a show and then go to bed. 

I would always tell my mom when something is the matter, but this time I didn't. Earlier in the day I told her something she doesn't have to worry about in me is suicide, this is completely true as I would never kill myself. But telling her would scare her so much. She is terrified of losing me. She isn't going to lose me, but she has doubt in that I believe. But last night was something else, that was such a low moment for me. I felt completely lost in the world. Just laying there. I feel lost and hopelessness a lot for the past month.

Who should I tell what happened to me last night first? 

I will tell my mom but I feel like I should tell someone else first, someone who won't be so scared. 

If anyone has any advice with the situation I'm in id really appreciate any help. I just feel so lost, and I don't know what to do."
1491,What’s the point?,"I failed. I failed at being human. People work 9 to 5 and are content and happy. Me on the other hand, I can’t tolerate it. It’s being an adult and making a living. But I guess I’m weaker and can’t handle the responsibility. The endless days just choke me. Am I supposed to be born, work to pay the bills, and die? Is that it? I’m not enjoying the middle part, in fact it’s torture to me, so why not just skip it? Get to the dying part already. 
Two years ago, I quit. I decided to chase after my dream (writing), but my saving are running out and reality is catching up... and I’m back in the bad space again. 
My family says that’s how life is and again, its part of being an adult. But really, whats the point? The only time I have fun is when I’m in some imaginary world and it’s maladaptive. I studied psychology so I should know, i’m just so miserable, always have been. Miserable and anxious. So even though I’m in my thirties, I don’t want to have kids just because I don’t want to be responsible for bringing a poor soul into this prison. 
I’m sick of my life sentence. Happy moments are so fleeting, they’re not enough to keep me going."
1492,Whats wrong with me? (Kinda long),"Im starting to become accustomed to sharing my past with random people, so why not reddit?

Dad was just another drunk pill junkie working for the sheriffs office as a jailer. Built like a grizzly bear and twice as mean. Mom was a kleptomaniac drill sargent with an incredible need to grind her children into the pavement. She always pawned my toys when i was young, put a scar in my head from a light switch, always verbally abusive until she became physical. Dad was too busy with my sister seeing her through. She got the best of his love. I got the discipline. And possibly stockholm syndrome from mom. Mom never let us eat. Only dinner. You faced a wrath most merciless and hateful if you got in the cupboards after school for a snack, even though we werent part of the school lunch program. I learned to be ok with being hungry. Mom and dad eventually got a divorce. Mom finally found someone she felt was worth more than fucking around on dad with. Dad drank himself to death. Died 9/10/01. One day before 9/11. The only time i cried. Since his death ive experienced over half my family die off from illness and stupid reasons. Mom paid no mind. Even when my grandparents died. Grandpa wanted me to excel in life. Had alot of things planned out for me. Mom made sure that didnt happen. She stole the college funds my grandfather left me to fuel her junky boyfriends habit. That and he was on probation at the time for sticking his dick where it shouldn't have been. Traded an addict for a convicted sex offender. Isnt this getting awesome? They ended up splitting up. Now she lives a block away, and i cant bring myself to help her in any way. Let alone myself. Born of a broken man. Child of a cheating, lying, thieving whore. And yet i am the kindest, level headed, and intelligent people you'll meet. Im sure you know where this is going. I too suffer from on and off addictions, was diagnosed with crohns disease in 2017, went through divorce, and nearing the point in life where the .40 cal in my dresser is becoming awfully friendly. I have a son, a girlfriend, a house, 2 paid off vehicles and a world of possiblity. So why do i feel like im still falling short? Why do i carry such enormous guilt when i do something for myself? Why do i battle myself to focus? Why do i feel like im obligated to help a woman who was so unfair and hateful towards me? Surely all of this is correlated. I just feel like a fuckup no matter what i do. I dont love myself like i should, and i sabotage myself often. I just left a 5k/month job to paint houses at 12/hr. No ambition, very indifferent to things that would make most people happy or content. I dont want to be around other people. Deal with alot of anxiety and depression. Im so very tired. I guess if i were to ask a question, it would be ""how does one change after so much trauma and childhood conditioning""?"
1493,I keep dreaming about my old military school and it hurts.,"I went there from 2011 to 2014, and I keep dreaming about it. It being somehow ""good"", and then it'll end up that I feel the ""trapped"" feeling thst place caused because of the fact I was a teen, and didn't have my own car, hence I could only leave when my family came to get me. 

I want this to stop. I want control, I don't want this shit plaguing my dreams, trying to paint a nice picture of a place that drove me to try and kill myself more than once due to the hazing."
1494,Medical Marijuana Vs. Traditional Medication?,"For those who have used marijuana for medical purposes, would you suggest it over “traditional” medication (pills, therapy, etc)? 

If so, for which conditions? If not, why?

How has medical marijuana positively impacted your condition/overall mental wellness? Was it difficult talking to your doctor about it?

This is something that I’ve been wanting to bring up to my doctor. I’ve read that it can help with PTSD and PTSD-induced insomnia, etc. Addiction runs in my family, which makes me somewhat nervous about pills. If the doctor thinks it’s what’s best, though, of course I’ll take whatever will help.

One of the biggest things I’m worried about is giving my doctor the impression that I just want to get high. I live in Arkansas, for context; medical marijuana is allowed, but probably discouraged by many."
1495,Adult child with mental illness,"I will try to keep this as short as I can. What I need is advice/suggestions/help/direction. I am at my wits end and I don’t know how much more I can take honestly. OK NOT SHORT ALL, SORRY

A bit of history. The child in question is now 21. He was born female and is now trans male. I have absolutely no problems with that, you did you Boo, be your best self. I probably worded that all wrong, it is a learning curve and I am trying my hardest to get it figured out. We will call aforementioned child Bear, for this post. 

So Bear was a bright, very high IQ child, straight As in school, not a lick of trouble, clean room, I mean great. The child potty trained himself, literally woke up one day around 2 and a few months and told me, I’m done with them (diapers), we put panties on, and had only one oops, and that was it. I mean dang. The only thing strange I noticed was if I was sick or I hurt myself, the same day or the next Bear would complain of having the same thing wrong with him. My throat hurt, Bears would hurt. My right knee hurt, he would come limping in. This still happens to this day, mind you. I tested this out a few weeks ago to see if he actually might be catching a bug from me. I faked, I know I am a terrible person, a sore throat an ear ache. Pfft, that child had it 2 days later. Whatever.

So here comes age 14. I don’t know if the world stopped turning in his brain, if someone exchanged my child for a pod child or what; but something happened. I understand that teenagers go through phases, I was a teen lol. Plus we have 2 other boys on the house. They stink, they are messy, they eat a lot and they are noisy. These are generalizations of course but you know what I mean. 

Ok so in the last 7 years, Bear has attempted suicide ( or has said he did), started cutting ( I don’t believe this to be true), went through the gambit of being a lesbian, bi sexual, pan sexual, asexual, then to telling me he is male and a gay male at that. Ok I have done a lot of reading, talking with parents of other Trans parents, and I have found that other kids have went through a few sexual identities, but whew.

When Bear said he tried to commit suicide we took him to the ER, they did an immediate hold and recommended a stay at a day center to help with crisis. Bear did want to stay the night, but was all for going every day for as long as he could because he hated going to school by this point and had missed more than half of his classes. 

We were told that they believed he was possibly had ASD but needed more testing. A week later we pick up Bear and he tells us that he as Autism and is getting IEP for school. He was able to wear sunglasses in the school because now the lights were to bright, and was able to sit out in the hallway if class got to loud. He could take his tests in a separate room, with notes and book. He had a new home room, with a special teacher to help him learn new ways to organize and study. If he felt overwhelmed he could just tell someone and go to the library. With this diagnosis of ASD, suddenly he couldn’t look us in the eyes when he spoke to us. This was brand new, but he said it was all part of being autistic. He was monotone when he spoke, unless he was so upset that he went into what I called his hyena mode, which was just higher and higher and higher.  Some fabrics didn’t feel right, clothes couldn’t be tight.

All very textbook things, except he didn’t have them growing up. He didn’t have them a month ago. I kept telling the therapist and the dr and anybody who would listen, that this was not right. But I had missed it, I didn’t know my child. 

He moved in with my parents for 4 months because he had quit one school, started another school, quit that school to go online and when that didn’t work and was not doing what he was supposed to at home and tension was high, I recommended taking a break and stay with my parents and go to school there until the end of the year. He agreed and finished the year there. This comes in play in a few.

We all move to another state when he is 17. Ok fresh start, thank god. On a coast, more people will accept his sexuality, he can go to school instead of this home schooling he was trying again and failing. He does, he goes back to school, and likes it. Doesn’t graduate on time, of course. Because why would he, he got lazy, blamed everyone else but himself for not following up or doing assignments or whatever his reasons were that week. But he did graduate the next year. My parents drive 2000 miles to see him graduate, they are elderly, in their 80s. He refuses to go to graduation. Great thanks kid. 

Now he is 18, he decides he wants to get fully mentally psych tested, because one Dr had told me when he was 15 to keep an eye out because Bear was borderline. Ugh, thanks but which kind dude.

He is an adult so I don’t have a right to those results, but I tell him what if you don’t like the results ? You might want your mama there, or someone to talk to the doc if they have questions. He agrees, so off we go. We go int9 the office and meet the dude who tested him. I am getting settled and the first thing I hear is “ Mrs Bear Mom, we are going to have to talk about the time your boyfriend shot at you and Bear, I do apologize about that in advance.” I’m putting my purse down, getting my coat off..sure, no pro...what?????

I married my husband a month before he turned 2, we are still married. There has never been a boyfriend. We have never been shot at. I was like, you got the correct report there doc? Yup, Bear told him some wild story. Also how we had lived in 16 states. Not true. How we were abusive and he was forced to live with my parents. We didn’t feed him. 16 pages of utter bullshit. 

Oh, the doc says, no ASD, might have a sensory disorder, however. Talked about how Bear made wonderful eye contact, was charming and a great conversationalist. Yeah I called Bear out on his bullshit in the dr office, Bear said he must have heard him wrong. I said they record your stuff, to transcribe, they don’t hear wrong. Doc agreed with me.

Flash forward to current times. Going to be 22 in a few months, we have lived in our home for going on 5 months. Has never fully unpacked his room. Has NEVER cleaned his room. Will not allow us in his room, and if we go in there to clean, you are just asking for one hell of a mental meltdown, arguments and a fight. No job, no drivers license, not going to college. Sits on the couch on his laptop when he is awake, sleeping the rest of the time. 

When he claimed he tried to commit suicide, the knife marks he had, were superficial and going way away from anything that would harm him. He knew how to do it, from my own scars. The cutting, he was on tumblr at the time, and saw some crap about how you would draw a butterfly over the scars or where it itches, and suddenly he was doing that. I told him to knock off his bullshit as he had zero cutting scars on his body. 

He lies about everything and anything. Small things, big things. Laughs when people get hurt. Used to pretend to not get social clues, the autistic parts, that is gone now. I went into that room when they were gone and there was a pair of dried crusty (sorry for this y’all ) bloody period panties stuffed under his pillow. I don’t even want to know what else is in there.

Two months ago I put the order down that his room had to be cleaned. Not even half way done and it stopped. My sunroom is full of clothes in bags of clothes, a 6 feet shoe rack, misc crap from the room. 

Besides the manipulation and lies, I worry about his future. My mother feels he would be best in a group home, or an assisted house of some sort because she doesn’t feel he can live on his own. I don’t know if he is mentally ill enough to qualify, his IQ is high, but it’s just like the ligHtbulb doesn’t reach some corners. I feel he has a BPD, but I don’t have a degree obviously.

I cannot make him take meds, which he doesn’t, for any of his issues (we haven’t been
even got into the voices), depression, anxiety, ptsd from an attack from a previous girlfriend (nope didn’t get into how that could have happened when we lived 40 minutes away and never let him go there but supposedly he was there all the time...but you know since I was gang raped at 14, I guess he had to raped too. And I was raped at 19, and well I think y’all see the pattern, so I’ll move on) 

He does go to a therapist,  but it’s more for trans therapy but they supposedly are hitting on other things now. He comes home some days and tells me we are abusive parents and his therapists says we are abusive according to him. I just tell him that the therapist only know what he tells him and I am willing to come talk to them both. They agreed but only about the subjects they want to talk about and if I had any questions or topics they had to see them first. I declined. 

I know I am angry sounding. I am frustrated at 7 years of getting no where and going backwards. I promise when I talk to Bear I don’t sound this angry. I worry about his future. I won’t be here forever. I am not in good health. His brothers won’t take care of him. He has made sure of that, he is not a pleasant person to live with and his mess follows him. 

What can I do? With his IQ being so high, but the rest of it, can I do anything? Am I screwed? Shit he talks about moving to the Netherlands because he feels he is a refugee here, or can get refugee status there due to his sexuality. 

Sorry for the length. I made a book. I really tried to hit the highlights. I missed some major ones. There are so many big ones and so much more, but I’m just overwhelmed. Help?"
1496,Why do parents get angry and defensive when you bring up mental health issues,Yeah basically what the total says
1497,I’m so fucking lonely,"i feel so shitty all the fucking time and i feel like i have no one to talk to. Like, there are people who say i can talk to them about stuff like that but in the end when i do i only feel more lonely and misunderstood. Also people say they are there for me but never ask me how i’m doing or check up on me once in a while. I feel like nobody actually cares and i’m all alone and i don’t know what to do because i can’t take this anymore."
1498,I Feel Incredibly Sad For The Single People Out There Who May Get COVID And Suffer Alone,"There are lots of people out there who don't have much support in life, and due to mental health reasons might not seek to go to a hospital if they get sick from COVID. This came up when I considered how I might react in that situation. I can see a part of me wanting to tough it out, and I think this is because I wouldn't want to burden anyone. I wouldn't want to be another patient for these over worked health workers. And I can also see myself feeling very guilty like I did something wrong. I have support in life, but I spend a lot of time alone so I know how guilt affects lonely people. It's often irrational and based solely out of fear. 

To many self supporting people, they might prefer to just hunker down at home, quarantine for two weeks and then be done with it. I feel terrible for the people who can't breath and are terrified to lose their life while they sit at home alone. Please go to a hospital if you are suffering. I know it might seem strange that anyone wouldn't seek out medical care, but I really think people would be surprised how common this is. Again, it comes down to fear of burdening others and admitting guilt. Making a lonely person even more fearful can lock them into a corner, and if anyone feels that way, reach out for help. 

Thank you"
1499,Coronavirus and mental health vent.,"I’m not one to talk about my mental health publicly, but I feel like now is the right time to let you all know that you’re not alone. Coronavirus isn’t the only pandemic that has affected our lives. Unfortunately, mental health issues are only getting worse because of the limited support available. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my early teens. I’ve taken medication before but I’d rather feel the full spectrum of happiness and sadness, and antidepressants don’t allow you to do that. A few years ago, my anxiety was at it’s lowest point. I would wake with a panic attack and continue having them throughout the day for years. Now I have some kind of control over it, it still rears it’s ugly head occasionally. And this year, it’s been tough to control it. I’m distancing myself from my friends because I’m used to being alone. I think my friends don’t even like me. I think I’m a constant bother to my boyfriend. I get sad and angry for no reason at all. I feel like my mind and my body is giving up because I haven’t taken care of myself. I hate the way I look. I hate how a tingle in my arm lets me believe I’m actually having a heart attack and I’m going to die. I’m constantly checking the news and wondering when this will be over. I’m becoming more antisocial because this year hasn’t allowed us to be around people. I’m wearing baggier clothing to hide myself, and I feel a sense of relief that my face is covered by a mask so no one can see my face. I hate sleep because I think too much, and can’t go to sleep without something to focus on. At the moment, I listen to Netflix and try to focus on that so it can send me off to sleep. If there is total silence, I can’t sleep because I’m thinking too much about sleep. Wild. I feel bad for just existing, because I know many people have it a lot worse than me. I think about these people and wonder how could it possibly be worse. This needs to change but I feel like there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. 

People brush off anxiety and depression and think it isn’t an actual mental illness. To be honest, I don’t think anyone has perfect mental health. Everyone has good days and bad days, that’s life. With people like us, we can have amazing days, amazing weeks even. Then there are days, or weeks, that we don’t want to get out of bed. We can’t sleep because our brains won’t turn off. We think people don’t like us and wonder why our friends favour other people. We wonder if our partners actually do love us for who we are, because we hate ourselves entirely.

With this all being said, I take some comfort in the fact that others are in the same headspace. We are not alone in this and we can all be here for each other. Be kind to one another and respect the walls that we’ve put up to protect ourselves. When this is over, we’ll break them down in our own time when we’re ready to bounce back from the shit bucket that is 2020. 

I envy the people who can’t wait for it to be over so you can see your family and friends. I envy people who miss going out drinking and being able to have a normal life. I have become used to being independent and alone, I’m worried for it to be over. I’m going to take this month to work on myself. If anyone is going through the same thing, don’t worry about keeping up appearances and don’t worry about losing your friends. That won’t happen. Please focus on yourself. I want to be stronger in my mind and in my body. This year has ruined the progress I have made with my mental health, and I want to get better. I don’t want to do this anymore. I want some self love. 

Please be safe and if you need an ear to listen to you vent, I’m your gal. I’ll give you compliments and advice that I wouldn’t accept myself because I’m a giant douche. Please be there for each other. It’ll all be over soon. ❤️"
1500,Lost Soul: Oh Mirror,"It all came about when I just wouldn't look in the mirror anymore, I just cant. Every time I do look at myself, I cant but see someone who is ugly, someone who is fat, someone who doesn't fit the standards. How can I expect someone to love me while I can barely look at myself? How can I expect to be loved when Im failing to love myself.

Sometime my imagination loathes and I picture my partner sitting me down and me vulnerable with nothing but my boxers on, my curves VISIBLE, my chest stretch marks VISIBLE, my large thighs VISIBLE and him just telling me that it will all be okay, just giving me a hug, telling me ""Your Okay"" but actually mean it, like say it to me many times till I believe it, keep saying it to me till I actually believe it, pretty please, you have no idea the night and day difference it will make.

 You want to know what the funny part is? Im actually just a normal guy, I stand 5 foot 10 inches tall and I weigh 185 pounds with a relatively okay physique, isn't it kind of funny how society today has made me feel so insecure, with everyone posting about their perfect moments. Those who take their pictures 10 times to find the right look where they look thin and happy and glamorous, is this real life? You create an unrealistic standard.

For the past 6 years growing up in the gay community it's been harsh, really really harsh, why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we have to be so judgmental to one another. As someone who is 25, I read about all the hardships and the inequality that LGBTQ people have had over the years and how those before me fought and sacrificed their lives and freedoms so that we can have what we have today, so that people like me would have hope of getting married, being loved, being able to hold hands in public, being able to be content, all this and we still manage to find a way to be so cruel to each other. If you don't fit some certain looks and profiles then you are no good. How can we judge a human being like this?

For the past 6 years I have been trying, I have been working out, I have been running till my legs cant take it anymore, but you know what happens? I lose some, then I gain it back, not everyone's genes are made so that we look like bodybuilders, nor do I want to take hundreds of dollars of supplements and hormones a day to look muscular or thin, why is it that we have these unrealistic standards?

We all say and pretend to one another that it's totally okay, ""just be who you are"" they say but does that really work ? One rejection after another you kind of wonder is this really true ? We say it, but do we really mean it? It's hard for someone who is like me to imagine I'll end up all alone.

Isn't it weird that the only time Im happy to look into the mirror is at the gym when Im running or after a workout? Is it because I get lost in my own imagination of what I might look like. Is the gym a fantasy place where my hopes rise and then they come back down when I go home?

I could live there, I mean, it's not hard being at the gym every day for two hours, but this isn't real life. I sometimes have to work for long long hours or I try to have a social life, or I try and prepare for the next day.

One thing about me is that Im stubborn, I don't give up, I haven't yet, but for the sake of everything thats holy, please be kind to one another, please be loving to one another, give people like me a chance, love us for who we are, we can be a fresh breath of air, we just feel insecure ALL THE TIME. Sometimes all we need is a hug and someone to come and tell us it will be okay, do it without us asking. Im too ashamed to ask for it, I grew up in a house where I was used to excelling in everything, asking for help is a sign of weakness, man up they will say to me. 

As gay people we go through shit ton of judgment and internal battles as we come out of the closet. I grew up with parents who are super christian and I have come to terms with having no support from them when it comes to anything about my LGBTQ life. For the sake of god, gay people, please be kind to one another.

1501,Social anxiety help,I feel so so sick from stress. I tried reaching out for help and feel like I got scammed for a text message. I stopped after 1 text but now my parents are onto me. I have a social anxiety problem and haven’t told anyone. I’m too scared to confront anyone. What should I do?

1503,If you use weed for self medication and start feeling weird/anxious..lay off. My advice,"I've smoked weed habitually for about 8 years, kinda used it to ease the pain of growing up and being a rather lost and confused kid. After becoming an adult I've noticed however especially when I quit for awhile I can have a lingering feeling of depersonalization, anxiety and blind anger in withdrawal, that only seems to be eased by smoking again, but I believe this is just because I've become accustomed to using weed to treat these symptoms. Schizophrenia runs in my family and because I've felt weird lately it's been enough to convince me to quit weed for the time being because I'm still trying to get on top of myself and my life. Can anyone relate?"
1504,I just called in sick for work today,"I’ve never done this before and I kept it short.
I kept saying “umm” a lot which concerns me that they think I’m being suspicious.
Oh my god I am freaking out, I hope I don’t get written up."
1505,Looking to get diagnosed,"I’m a minor but after a really bad past few months I’m thinking about telling a counselor. I’ve never had a regular therapist but my mom agreed to let me have a meeting with a counselor, so I’m considering telling them my symptoms and seeing what they think I have. Does anyone have any advice on this? I’m mostly nervous about them asking about past/childhood trauma, because if my mom is there I probably won’t be able to get anything out safely."

I really just messed up, my friend are interested in each other and I though I was helping by checking in on them and trying to get them to talk about it with each other but instead I just annoyed them and put them in a awkward situation, god I’m a terrible friend I’m always complaining and I don’t think thing through, I mess up my school work I hate myself when I do and I mess up a lot at work like today I accidentally server raw fries somehow why am I so dumb and useless

1508,Can someone explain what’s happening?,"I feel very disconnected from certain memories. Looking at photos or videos of those specific memories feels like watching a movie. I don’t recall any emotions in those memories. It’s like I know it’s me but at the same time it feels like it never actually happened and it’s more like remembering a dream I had ages ago. It’s the first time I’ve ever felt this way and it only happens with memories connected to one of my exes. Also when i see photos of him, it’s like staring at a stranger that looks very familiar. Almost like seeing a photo of a stranger from a dream. This doesn’t happen with my other exes.
(Ps. I am completely over all of my exes so it’s definitely not because i’m still not over that guy)"

1510,When should I really ask for help?,"I'm currently a university student who is stressed and burnt out because of course work, but not to the extent that I see other students are suffering. I feel depressed from time to time, and it can get severe to the point that I have zero motivation to work, but these feelings pass and eventually I find myself working again. I am aware that those feelings have some impact on my life, and I know that you don't have to be suicidal or at the brink of a crisis to ask for mental help. But some part of me can't help but feel like I don't qualify for that kind of help, and that I'd be taking away some resource that another person with a more severe situation would benefit from having. Even if I do get help, I feel like my case would be put at a lower priority, as mental health resources are limited. But I also know that I'm having a difficult time dealing with things by myself. I'm just having trouble deciding if I should push through this by myself or if I should seek help."
1511,What am I feeling?,"So I’ve had this problem for a couple of years, I can’t exactly pin point where it started and I have no idea what it is. It can happen during any day without any trigger that I all of a sudden just become “strange”.

 I become almost like a different person like other people have described it and you can see it in my eyes most people have said. I just become empty/numb and I almost feel like I just forgot how to act human. Does anyone know what this is? I do have a history of depression, stress, anxiety and panic disorder and am currently struggling with them still now (some milder than others). This feeling can last for 10min - 4hours at most and then bam I’m back to normal again, and to myself i go haha wtf was that and then I go on with my day. Could it be my brain just shutting off to protect me from feeling anything? Or something else?

Also I feel like I might need to add I’ve had it quite rough especially the past 2-3 years. 2 years ago my panic disorder was really bad and especially last year when I had over 10 panic attacks a day, couldn’t leave the house, I couldn’t sleep properly and I would wake up in panic several times a night resulting in me burning out and losing my memory from that entire year. The only thing I remember from last year was I burned out, everything else is a blur. And this year I lost contact with my entire family because they think I’m a disgrace/are ashamed of me and I have no friends. I have a boyfriend but he is not really someone I can talk to about this problem really, he has his own struggles as well so I don’t want to bother him. On top of everything I have no job because I can’t find one even if I try really hard, no income and I live off of my boyfriends small pay."
1512,"No physical contacts. ""No"" relationships. No friends/people to talk with at all, and can't talk without feel that you ruin they're mood. ""Work"" like ""psychotherapist"". Maybe have depression.","Long story short if you do not want to read it all and if you read title:

1. I've never been hugged for real in all my 16 years (Mother do not count, and i start avoiding it and completly block all physical contact)
2. My longest ""realtionship"" were 1 hour
3. All people that i talked to - ALWAYS, no matter what, lying to me and disappearing.
4. I do not feel attraction to human body at all, but still want have relationship even if i know that's impossible with my temper.

If you want to read full post, here it goes.

Hi, i do not want to reveal my name or so, only what i can say about my identity that i hate - i am 16 years old, live in russia (no stereotypes). Tou already can say its only hormones, but i think they do like \~5% of that

I would like to write all stories in order from title.

1. **No Physical Contacts (real ones)**

That's true, i've never been hugged or kissed (for real) in my life. I know that's okay and can happen, but anyway it feel like everyone avoiding contact with me.""For real"" - means that i've never been hugged or kissed with some emotions, all what i got is fake hug everytime when i go home and see off my schoolmate, and even then i know it was fake and she did it because she abuse me for her profit. How i knew it? Well, she find herself a boyfriend and still call me walk with them. No, it was fun, but when she broke up with him, she just asked her mother for 10k ""moral compensation"", and he got to hospital because of drugs (i need that detail later)

Also i have gratueted from school (now completly isolate my self from socium), like everyone, where i was bullied hard. They took my money, they punch me sometimes for fun, swearing of course, and so on. That continues before 9th grade, when we all suddenly team up to close this exams. It was good to, no problem, but first 8 years was NOT that good.

2. **""No"" relationships**

You can say that i am lying, because i've also say i've been in rs for 1 freaking hour. But i can't say it was rs at all. Like lol, we met up, go through shop, buy snacks, sit on concrete (my favorite place, hard to explain, imagine this like bench, but it square shaped) AND THEN HER BOYFRIEND APPEARED AND TOOK HER AWAY! I DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT HIM! She was not the same girl from #1, but also about her...

Dec 31. 2017 as i remember (yes, 12 years old) i typed her that i love and i want at least to try, FUCKING TRY, experience relationship and know what it is, but no, she blocked me, resend it to all my class and laugh at me.

3. **No friends/people to talk with at all, and can't talk without feel that you ruin they're mood.**

Everytime i say something about me, i try to lie and avoid it, because i do not want to ruin that funny mood and give saddness to people. Even this account, i think, need to be deleted after this post, to no one more saw this. No matter is that person my mom, friend (at the time), psychotherapist, that's my problem and only i need to find solution (self-contradiction, but yes.)

4. **Work like psychotherapist.**

Also a problem, because i have my problems, and i (without realizing or paying attention) help people to take they're problems away. I know about hitchhiker's syndrome, when you can say anything that bother you to unknown people, that's why i can type it all here, but still when you hear it all about someone being raped, someone have family cult (me too, lol), and in main time have problems with communicate or with understanding people... Oof. So many people just randomly find me in twitter or VK or so and our dialog goes to problems and bad stories, but ok, i do not mind it, type all your problems, i can answer and help, but please, **PLEASE,** can you NOT IGNORE and NOT THROW me to blocked list after you do that? I have so many stories... No, all people say that one thing:- You are wonderful person! Thank you for help! I really want to become like you and help other people!...

What do you think?

\- Stop message me, nerdor

\-Yea, yea, i am just busy, can you wait?  
\*after 2 months\*  
\- I AM SORRY PLS I STILL LIKE YOU OF COURSE I AM NOT LYING!  
\*completly wiped\*

I just do not understand, why can you say in my face that one phrase: ""Thank you for help, good luck in life"" and then leave, why you need to be rude?  
Because of that, now i can't normally talk and go to chats, even furry ones, i just can't say ""How's been your day?"" cuz they already talk on they're wave, about they're themes and about they're interest... They do not interest in me or what i can say and i just leave

And also in this section i can notice that for past 1,5 year i really, **really,** jump into ""dark"" telegram channels about pedophiels, gore and so, even if i ready to vomit. idk why, but that a thing for me (i am not a pedophile, i hate gore)

Okay, in conclussion: **I Maybe have depression.** or its selfblock, idk, but i want to see if here someone like me.

If you want to advise me, PLEASE, I BEG YOU, can you not write typical ones? Like try to sleep, workout, healthy food. I just do not want to hurt anyone and not be aggresive to someone here. And sorry for misspelling or mistakes, not my main language ::("
1513,Anyone else scared to talk to a therapist.,"I’m 25 and I really need to go talk to someone. I’m starting to damage my relationships and become self destructive, I’m just scared to tell someone what I’ve been through..."
1514,I’m in a “famous” fake relationship for views and it’s exhausting me.,"I don’t really know if I should say this here, but it’s whatever honestly I’m just trying to let the world know without letting the world know.

This has been on my head for a while, I’m currently in a fake relationship with a girl (we both know it’s fake)... I don’t want to sound corny, oh god I really don’t, but we both kinda famous and this “strategy” is “helping” our path, a musician (in my case).

I’ve been knowing this girl for just months and whenever there’s a party or a camera or literally any other person that knows us both we have to pretend we love each other and all of that. But how do you make a good job as a fake boyfriend? I know damn well how to make a good work as a LEGIT boyfriend, but this just feels weird... And she’s not ugly, I do actually feel kinda attracted to her, people consider her an attractive person and me too, but I’ve never saw me in a relationship with her, or anything close because it’s not my type of girl, or is she?

Last night we were in a party and I started to have all these questions right? Like am I being too cold in front of her friends when she tries to convince them we are something? Maybe I gotta do my job as a boyfriend, but how do you make a fake boyfriend job? Cause all of this is fake right? Or is it? Do I still believe it is? 

I’m just flooded with all these questions... Maybe I’m starting to like her for real but I know she only does it for the purpose we put at the beginning, or does she? Ah man...

I feel like I shouldn’t catch any true feelings. I barely even truly know her, I barely talk to her outside that “bubble” that we have. This situation is exhausting me. 

Posted on r/socialskills first. Thank you if you read, thank you if you decide to leave an advice. I just wanted to get it out in a public place."
1515,How to forgive myself or even live with myself for being an abusive to my (soon ex) wife.,"I'll try to give an unbiased brief history of us, i don't want to make excuses for what i did, but i will give my flawed reasoning at the time.

When we got together 9 years ago it was intense. It was the first real relationship either of us had been in. She ran away from home to be with me, she wanted to never speak to her family again but i saw that that her parents were well meaning and were certainly way better parents than mine. So i encouraged her to keep contact as she would come to regret it later if she didn't.

We both had our own troubled childhood and bonded well over similar experiences, this period was intense for both of us she even suggested a suicide pact at one point but i insisted that was a very bad idea. I was proud i was so mature and capable, i could take care of her. We could be together forever.

Within a year we were living together in some shitty studio flat and both on benefits looking for work. I got a temporary job sorting mail, i couldn't do it, i had multiple anxiety attacks while attempting to understand what task i had been given that day. I came home from work and she saw i had been crying and insisted i need more help with my mental state, and stop working there immediately.

I still didn't like talking to doctors but did my best to explain the ""others"" in my head, how they overwhelmed me with information, how they made it difficult to come to a decision on what i wanted. And what i now understand were blackouts in my memory. I couldn't find the right words, i didn't understand enough to explain.

I felt misdiagnosed as i was unable to properly explain myself, and wasn't given enough time to overcome my mistrust and articulate what i was struggling with. At subsequent appointments i was given less time and wasn't asked as much as they already had their diagnosis Borderline personality disorder.

I still have many gaps in my memory of that time, but remained vaguely aware of what i had been doing. We went onto benefits and moved into a better place. Our landlord was still shady but we managed.

Over the years i grew increasingly frustrated with the medical help i was receiving and the never ending waiting lists for therapy. And my wife had effectively become my carer, i was blind to the many options to recover and kept waiting for the next appointment when i could finally clear i what miscommunication i had caused and treatment could begin properly.

I should have realised how much my wife had matured over the years and was growing increasingly upset in our relationship. I was so self obsessed and fought her on every change she tried to make because ""i was scared"" i let my fear control our lives.

I am not sure exactly when, but i became increasingly distant emotionally and behaving more irratically. She had confronted me on several occasions about how she was feeling and how i was behaving. But i couldn't and still can't remember.

I remember some of the last time she confronted me but am missing some key bits. They got me to go to a temporary accommodation where i would have someone to talk to 24 7 and they (wife and a friend) would visit me after she had some time alone.

After a week i get a letter from the staff my wife had given them. She told me about the abuse she had suffered and the threats to her and our two dogs that i had made numerous times. I will not be allowed (court order) to return to the home we had or see her and the dogs again.
Even after all i put her through she still got me help and wished me well.

I am trying to build a new life but i am terrified of what i am. I don't want to hurt anyone. I miss her so much, she was the only person i ever trusted. How can i live with myself after what i did to her. How can i be certain i won't do it again if i still have no memory of threatening her.

The staff here keep trying to reassure me it was just misinterpreted something i said. But i know her, i know when she says i threatened her multiple times she means it."
1516,"Anxiety, panic attacks and depression is kicking my ass",It feels like I’m in a riptide about to be swallowed by the current. I fight it cause I know change isn’t easy but it’s so fucking hard in times like these and giving in is easier than fighting
1517,Do mood swings happen from triggers or are they random?,"To be honest, I’m not really sure how to ask this question. I’ve been thinking of a way to put it into words for days, and i finally found a way to express it the way I wanted to but then right as I starting typing all this I completely forgot how I wanted to say it lol. 

For context, I’ve been taking Wellbutrin for depression and ADHD for a few months now. After some talks with my psychiatrist, she thinks I may have bipolar disorder because i’ve been having lots of mood swings and displaying symptoms of mania.

Sometimes something sad or upsetting will come up in my head and my mind will linger on it for a little too long, and then I start to feel very sad and I get that feeling of my heart dropping to the bottom of my stomach. But other times, when I’m doing something that makes me feel good, I start to feel very happy before I even realize that I’m in this state of bliss. I laugh harder and a lot easier. I smile a lot. If I’m in this state of mind in a social context I feel lots of love for the people around me and I get very excited and talkative. It’s great. Eventually I reach a certain point of self-awareness and in my head I think “Oh, this has to be a mood swing or something because I’m WAY happier then usual.”

I think my question is, with bipolar disorder, do the mood swings happen at complete random, or does something trigger them? Maybe a little bit of both? 

I’m sorry, I feel like this post is a jumbled mess and nothing really makes sense. This is what my thoughts have felt like for months and it makes me feel really anxious. I was really close to not even posting this when I forgot what I wanted to say but I convinced myself to just type out my thoughts and maybe it’ll come to me so now I’m rambling. I’m sorry."
1518,I am slowly getting suicidal due to my sexual problems,"As weird and ridiculous as this may sound I am suffering from  Sexual Performance Anxiety for a while now and it's got me anxious about sex. This anxiety frustrates me to the point that I don't wanna live anymore and I just wanna take my own life.

I have developed this from a bad experience with my ex-partner and I have occasionally been suffering from Performance Anxiety with ED until now that I have a relationship. I have researched so many tips and treatments for this but I can't seem to overcome this and has led me to be completely anxious about sex. My partner understands but I am still frustrated with the fact that my anxiety has totally hi-jacked most of my life including my sex life. I am frustrated because no matter what solutions I think of, nothing seems to work. I just wanna die because I feel trapped in this ordeal. I feel lacking as a partner and my partner would be better off with someone else. I don't find any hope anymore. I tried everything to overcome this psychological torture."
1519,I have absolutely no idea what to do.,"I have severe intrusive thoughts and delusions. I convince myself of things that aren't true. About a year ago I looked up online that I was attracted to children (which I am not) and that I watched child porn (which I didn't) and that I molested someone (which I did not) I don't know why I felt the need to ""confess"" that way I just was looking for help and I have no idea why I took to the internet to do that. I was having a severe panic attack and I wasn't thinking. I watched porn since I was 7 and I've seen things when I was young that I shouldn't have it fucked me up so much. Can someone please give me some advice. I told my mom she doesn't seem to understand."
1520,Mental health and skin conditions,"Greetings from Cambridge,

We are a group of graduates from University of Cambridge.

We’ve been working on building a self-management platform for skin conditions. Drawing upon our personal experience as eczema sufferers, we’ve developed a platform that can help users (1) connect with other users who have similar condition and experiences for mental health support, (2) collect and share condition-based product reviews, and (3) log their skin condition. 

This platform is FREE and supported by the University. Our Open Beta is now live and to further improve the platform, we need valuable feedback. 

We're still at a very early stage and have a long way to go. But with your feedback/comment we can make this better. To check it out:

1521,How do I help myself,"Hi, so since covid started I've had a harder time controlling myself and I just have an attitude most days and I'm just....I'm so much more depressed and its taking a toll on my relationships (bf and friends, family was already messed up) 

I just get so stressed I can't control myself. I got diagnosed when I was a kid with severe anxiety and depression and they told me to come back later in life to see what diagnosis I can get to help me with medicine. I don't have money for this or a therapist and I just don't know what more to do or how to help myself. I want to be okay and every time I try I am fine for a week and then back down the rabbit hole of being depressed and moody. I just don't know what to do anymore"
1522,Bad dreams following anxiety attack,"Hi, Im new to this forum and want to share something I need to process. So two days ago, I got wasted with alcohol alone in my apartment. I have since decided to never drink alcohol again, and have also contacted the a-clinic for support. Alcohol has never been a problem for me, (I drink about once a month). But since I got diagnosed with OCD I have a fear that overwhelms me, the thought that Im becoming an alcoholic, which is why I reached out for help anyways. I get seriously depressed after drinking, and anxious, so I see it as a better option to just quit drinking.

Now to the real reason Im writing this: After that night, I've had nightmares about my grandpa sexually abusing me, and losing my mother in a foreign country, and I panic that I cannot find her anywhere. Also, these dreams do sometimes pop up without an anxiety attack, or hangover. Im starting to suspect that something traunatic has happened to me as a kid, that I simply don't remember.
How can I find out about this? Where should I start?"
1523,How to manage your fear?,[removed]
1524,"We're not always kind to ourselves - but you can let go of suffering by starting to look at yourself with fresh eyes, accepting what you see without judgement","If you have kids/nieces/nephews you might have seen a baby suddenly become aware of their hand. They look at the palm, they look at the fingers, then they turn it over and realise there’s a back of the hand. And if they tell the fingers to move, it they wiggle! They laugh and laugh until the next experience comes along.  That’s what beginners mind is - approaching the world without assumptions, without judgement, without an idea in our heads for how things ought to be - just observing, accepting, feeling gratitude and joy. When we apply beginners mind to our loved ones, our environment and our work/studies we have a deeper appreciation for what we have and can live happier lives.

Its also helpful to apply beginners mind to ourselves, particularly if we have problems with self esteem - we sometimes judge ourselves harshly and are not kind when we look in the mirror. By focusing our awareness in our body, noticing what we're experiencing, accepting ourselves and practicing non-judgement we can learn to appreciate what we have and be kind to ourselves.A body scan is a great way to do this, and it has the added bonus of releasing tension and giving us a sense of peace.

1525,How can I remove the importance something has?,"Hey, the title says it, I have to do something which makes me really nervous, and I think that if I could make it seem less important I'd be able to do it. I'm shaking rn just by thinking about it. It's something I've wanted to do for a very long time but now that the time is coming I'm shitting myself. I just want it to make it less of a deal if that's possible, just so I'm no so nervous when I have to do it. Has anyone experienced anything similar? thanks"

1527,What are your opinions/ experience on Lexapro and Abilify?,"I've been recently seeing a psychiatrist because of my depression and mood swings. At first she prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro; it didn't really make a difference so she increased it to 20mg (still little to no difference). On the last session we had, she told me that I should continue taking 20 mg Lexapro and that I should also start taking 5mg of Abilify. 

5mg isn't a lot, but I have read the prospect and it says that Abilify treats serious illnesses such as schizophrenia or autism rage. I'm not schizophrenic or autistic; my psychiatrist is still working on a diagnosis, but I'm 100% that I'm not schizophrenic.

I'm confused on her choice to prescribe me Abilify. Also the Lexapro doesn't seem to be working, even after 4 weeks of taking it. What are your experiences with these meds?

Thank you &lt;3"
1528,am i just lazy as hell or is it my mental health declining??,"so lately i've been having issues with doing things and i genuinely think i have a problem because i quite literally cannot force myself to do anything at all. currently i have probably over 7 overdue assignments with quite a few of them being weeks overdue. i also want to note that i'm known to be quite the procrastinator and get distracted by devices easily which is why i'm really confused as to what it is bc maybe it's just me being a lazy procrasinator and i'm looking too much into it. the main issue is, however, that even though i may be prone to procrastinating i usually always get stuff done and although sometimes i do miss the deadline, i usually get it done in 1-3 days after at most. but this time around, it's different. i really want to sit down and do my work but the moment i do, i look at the assignment, it feels off(?) (cant explain the feeling well my apologies) and i give up and i go back to bed. it's so frustrating because i really really know that i need to do it. hell, even my teacher has been nagging at me for weeks. yet, its like i have no sense of alertness and continue to put it off and not do it. it feels like someone could slap me in the face and tell me to do it yet i would still completely refuse. (maybe im just overreacting for this part but idk atp)
 another random note: i find this subject tough bc its a second language im not very good at, so maybe that might play a part in me not doing it bc i dont understand? im unsure.

anyway, so sorry for the long post but please do tell me ur opinions on this if u can ! thank uu"
1529,I’ve been at home since march. I can’t even go out to do groceries :/,"So i’ve been stuck at home ever since March and i haven’t been able to step foot outside of the house and i don’t know why that bothers me so much. I think my family is the only one in my city that hasn’t gone out since march. Everyone is already living their lives. I mean i’m 20 and a sophomore in college. I’m supposed to be enjoying this time while i can because once i graduate college, i’ll be living with my strict parents again. It also really sucks how everyone gets to go out and continue living their lives while i’m here drowning in the pressure of having to start a business for my majors. Is it possible that this could be affecting my mental health? I’ve lost motivation to work out, do schoolwork and wake up early in the morning. I’ve been oversleeping and crying most days and i don’t know what to do. I’m so tempted to just stop doing all my requirements because at this point, i don’t see the point in anything and at the same time i want to continue being productive because i know it will benefit me in the future. Can someone give me advice?"

1531,Need some help...,"I've dealt with mental health problems for most of my life because of the environment I grew up in. I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Also loud noises freak me out, i don't like being touched by people I dont trust, and there are certain words that if I say, will trigger an anxiety attack. Obviously I'm on a bunch of different meds, and they do help, but they can only do so much in my opinion. Ever since I can remember, I've been gathering up different coping skills to help me through the times when my meds aren't enough, and I'm always looking for more. Based on what I've told you about myself, does anyone have any coping skills I could use? I understand if no one does, but I thought I should try."
1532,How do I cope with mental and physical abuse?,"I'm 23 years old and today I realised that I was abused by my parents as a kid. I used to believe that this was normal growing up. The realisation hit me like a truck. It explains why I have anxiety. It explains why I'm non confrontational. It explains why I think everything that goes wrong is my fault.

Please help."
1533,"Numb, Healing, Release, Let Go (39)","Every so often I think about where I was 1 year ago. I think about how I felt, what I was doing (consciously and subconsciously), how I was Numb, how I was Hurt, Broken, Dedicated, Healing (without realizing).

In times that we can only live day to day with minor planning ahead, it allows me to realize how far I have come for myself in the past year. With my broken heart, my identity and who I am as a Human Being.

Starting my creative path over 2 and half years ago, my only intention was to create, as it is now. Through time, God and The Universe has guided me into different projects and different areas of my life that I never even knew existed back then. It all takes time, which is something I tell myself everyday. That the work being done right now is for something more than expected. Its about trying, everyday. Trying something new, progressing on work already started or simply changing up routines and habits that I can get stuck into if I allow myself.

Habits and Routines are needed, to some degree. The habits and routines that I try and break out of each day is my comfortability. I have learned that my body and mind will constantly try and trap me in my comfortability from things in the past that I was doing without realizing.

Identifying as a Trans Woman has been a rollercoaster. A rollercoaster of emotions, feelings and actions that have no end in sight, nor that I want it to. Every moment is new. Every moment I am changing, evolving, releasing, growing, healing and making peace with. I have come to learn that with my body dysphoria, gender dysphoria, those things will take time to change and it has allowed me to make peace with the present moment. Its only for a little while longer so I might as well enjoy while it lasts. Heck, its been 23 years, I know I can do a little bit more. Somedays are easy, Somedays are difficult, but it is all **worth** it.

Today: Enjoy the day that we have been given. The day that is New and that even in the present is passing by. Do something that makes you feel anxious inside, scared, its meant for your growth and who you are. I Believe in You.

I love you.

1534,My Mind's breaking down,[removed]
1535,I went from being emotionless to feeling everything and it is messing with my mind,"I’m a 27-year-old guy who went through a lot in life and now I feel like my mind is all messed up.

A bit of history about myself and what I went and still going through. When I was around 13 years old I was diagnosed with kyphosis. For those who don’t know what it is, it’s having a bent thoracic spine, more than usual. Before being diagnosed I was like everyone else just enjoying the childhood, going out with friends; in brief enjoying life. When the doctor told me that only surgery will help me, I was devastated. Not only it was really expensive but it could cost me my life if I did it. I was left to grow like that. My parents did take me to several doctors but no one could help me.

I was scared of how people would look at me, what they would say about me. I stopped going to the beach just for I was scared of my own back, like I was a monster and needed to hide. I tried to take my own life; I had everything prepared for it and had the noose around my neck, just had to jump to finish the all the pain. I thought about my mom, who was sick at the time, and what she would do without me and backed away. I hid that I tried to take my life from her for years but I had to recently tell her because I am afraid that I might try it again.

I grew up into an introvert. After class, I would just vanish, went straight home. I missed a lot of the “normal” life. Around 6 years ago when I was in university, I tried to change how I lived, and tried to be more extrovert than introvert. I did manage to go out with friends, talk to people (even if it is not much). All these years of keeping away from people got me into an emotionless guy. I remember when my grandfather passed away, I did not even cry (maybe there was a few tears but not like a normal person). I was like a stone, like nothing could hurt me.

Earlier this year, a girl started talking to me and she confessed that she liked me. In my mind I was like “she does not know what she is messing with”. I straight up told her about my back condition and she said she was ok with it and whatever happened she would not leave me. She gave me so much confidence that I trusted her, told her my darkest of secrets. She changed me. I was no longer the emotionless stone guy, I suddenly had emotions. I felt it when we went to the doctor to check on my back. What the doctor said was too much for her. She gradually changed and eventually left. I would cry a lot but I did try to get back to who I was before. I even found that what I had could be corrected to physical therapy (Damn those doctors for not pointing me in the right direction all these years!) even if with my age it will be hard.

Now come the hard part. After she left I felt like I went several years back where I would struggle to talk with people. I just kept to myself and would avoid any social interaction as far as possible. It has been a few months but she is always in my mind. I cannot do things like before. I can no longer take a lot of pressure and had to sacrifice a few things that I liked to do just to take the pressure away. I could not hear people taking to me, I would yell at them. I felt like if they did not shut up, I would just kill myself. After taking some pressure off my mind I felt a lot better and could get back to life. But what did I know that I would never be that emotionless guy like before.

If I listened to a sad song or sometimes a love song there would be some tears. And recently I watched the last episode of Supernatural and when Dean was dying I had to pause it. I cried a lot and my head started to hurt like a bad headache. I had to go and cry in bed. When I tried to resume, I would cry again and again. That would not have happened with my emotionless me. I feel like my mind is messed up and have no idea what would come next for me. I never knew that falling in love would mess up my mind like that.

I am trying to forget her but it is no easy task. Even going out and try and enjoy life seems like a temporary solution. When I am all alone with nothing to do, she is just here in my mind. I would sometime smile and other times just feel sad. All I want now is to forget her and give everything on my physical therapy.

I would appreciate any advice or help."
1536,Oh dear...,"So I posted on here 23 days ago about how I was so proud of myself for how far I have come and that I’m doing really well. 
Well... Boris Johnson put the UK into a second lockdown and my mental health dropped... 
I was on facetime to my partner the other night when I started having a panic attack for no reason. It was in the top 10 of the worst panic attacks I’ve had, it last over an hour and I passed out five times (only for a few seconds, the longest was 30 seconds). 

I’m so self conscious of my body I can’t even look myself in the mirror, I have gained so much weight it’s horrendous but my eating disorder is kicking in and I’m overeating, even when I feel full. (My eating disorder makes me over-eat or under-eat) 

I’m self harming, I’ve never self harmed before in my entire life, not once I was always so against it and now I’m doing it, sat in my room at 2-3am cutting my thigh because i can’t cope with the stress of life atm. 

I can’t see my partner either, I used to see him everyday. He was my support system, we FaceTime but it isn’t the same 😩. He’s my world and although i love him, I feel like I can’t tell him things as he suffers with anxiety himself and I don’t want to worry him. 
He always tells me “it’s okay not to be okay, I’m here for you always” and I know that, but I’m worried that if he sees me at my worse he will leave me because it will be too much. 

I’m gutted, I was doing so well and everyone else thinks I’m doing really really well yet I am struggling to find a purpose, or a reason to get out of bed in the morning. 

I don’t know why I came on here, I suppose I just wanted to vent a little, get some advice."
1537,My parents went bankrupt and broke and don’t do anything about it,"Hello there. So here’s my problem. My parents were always wealthy but ever since 2010 everything has turned into s***. I am 22 years old uneducated, can’t work at the moment because I have OCD, social anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Generalised anxiety disorder and borderline and my life because of my condition has been so hard. My parents have a hotel that only works during summertime and I work there because it’s the only place I can work and feel safe to work. My parents went broke after Greece was hit by the major comedown in 2010. Ever since their income was becoming less and less and since I’m dependent  on them because  I work for them I’m broke too. I didn’t study anything because of my severe social anxiety. So my parents now are totally comfortable with their bankruptcy and don’t care about it. My dad is sitting on the couch all day drinking alcohol taking xanax raging to my mom sometimes because of withdrawals and generally being a sore loser. I understand I am a loser too BUT I DIDNT CHOOSE MY CONDITION, but I accept it. Sometimes I worry I won’t have money for my therapist and medications. The only way to make life better again is to move to USA where we have a huge family empire and have their own businesses and we can work for them and maybe make things normal again. But my parents don’t want to do anything. They are sitting on the couch all day blaming each other and arguing. I have never seen such dump people. And everytime I pop up the question about USA a fight pops up as well. They don’t wanna do anything. What am I supposed to do having my control as well? I don’t feel comfortable going to US alone. What am I gonna do? The only way we get by is by the government that gives me some money every month (534€) to get by. But that’s not gonna be forever. And we owe the power bill and water bill in debt. They don’t pay the power and water bill and the debt keeps increasing dramatically. I’m so sick of this situation. They are taking my money, they are so negative, they keep me back from living a balanced life, I feel so disgusted. Please give me some advice. And the worst part? My problems are being caused by them. I am gay UNFORTUNATELY in Greece and they are homophobics. And I have to take medication to put up with them! Jesus Christ"
1538,Circumstance pulling me back down,"Close to three and a half years ago I was diagnosed with severe depression, severe amexieny and and severe rumination. Since then I have been on, and subsequently gone off strong SSRIs and gone through a lot of therapy. Now, I find myself moving back in with my parents, and find myself dreading it, as I know that my short term mechanisms for dealing with everything at the moment will be judged and found wanting. I've turned to alcohol and ignoring my problems and know that this is, and will continue to be not good enough for my parents when they find out, 
as is inevitable when I move back in with them. While I know and recognise that this is a situation entirely of my own making I just don't know what to do at this moment. I thought I'd moved beyond this and just feel stuck at this point. I know what I've learned but I just don't seem to be able to action it. What can I do?"
1539,Mental health with the COVID situation," Hi, redditors of mentalhealth. I am a grad student working with math. When the COVID measure began I thought working home will be fun and fine. After about 6 months of not going to the campus, I found myself slowly going crazy. I have more anger in me, stressed (even though there is nothing to worry about), drinking more alcohol, and today I almost self-injured. Is there anyone who experiences similar things?"
1540,I just want to cry,I hate my antidepressants. They make me want to not kill myself which is a positive I guess but I physically can’t cry anymore. I get to the point where I feel like I need to cry and then nothing happens. I get the runny nose and the shaking breath but my eyes just feel like they’re about to explode. This makes me want to cry more. I’m fed up now. I don’t want to be pregnant anymore. I want my baby here. I’m weeks away from being a mum and all I can think about is how I can’t cry or process my emotions. How am I going to cope with a small child. Life is getting me down. I just want to cry.
1541,What little things do you do to fall in love with life again?,"Hey guys :) This is something I’ve been struggling with a lot recently. I’m on a gap year rn so don’t really have a structure to my day and  it’s hard to find what things to do. If anyone has lil activities and stuff (to do at home cause of covid haha) y’all do to keep yourself busy or just boost your mood even a little bit, please let me know here! Any advice would he greatly appreciated."
1542,My brain is suddenly messing with me in new ways,"You know how some sensations or noises will make you cringe and shiver? Like the noise of a fork on a plate or nails on chalkboard etc...? Well for the past few weeks, no matter how busy I am or what I am doing I will randomly think of these sounds and have this unpleasant shivering sensation run through my body, the problem is that only a few noises actually made me react like this but it seems like more and more are being added to the list recently, since yesterday every action that I make will end up leading to this unpleasant sensation. 
I thought it was probably started by my anxiety but it has been going on like this for two or three weeks now and doesn’t seem to want to go away, it’s even getting worse as it’s happening more and more everyday. This never happened to me before and I never seen anyone talk about this either. Does it happen to anyone else? Any idea why my brain suddenly decided to mess with me now?"
1543,Serious question: What does happiness feel like?,"Is it like a neutral feeling? Like not really feeling sad or angry or excited or Idk?

Just curious."
1544,Differentiating unhealthy relationships and poor mental health,"My relationship for all intents and purposes has been rocky, and I’m fairly sure it’s over. It was a long distance relationship on top of that. It failed because of poor communication and a lack of trust. Me being the one that couldn’t trust. I know I have an unhealthy attachment style, avoidant; and it certainly helped to drag the relationship down. The other party isn’t entirely blameless, mistakes were made on both sides. 

What I would like to know is how people really work through poor attachment styles and recover to build healthy relationships. I feel like, to a degree I’m self sabotaging here, and given that I’ve built up a track record of being attracted to relationships that are bound to fail, I don’t know how to fix it. I can’t even fathom being in a situation where I would depend on another human being, but on the other hand I’m suffering from the oppressive loneliness my mistakes are creating."
1545,What's the difference between asserting what you want in a relationship and making your needs the other person's responsibility,"For reference, I don't ask for things from other people ever because that's ""making my happiness their responsibility"". If I want to practice self-care or do something for myself I do it alone."
1546,I Hate Myself More Than Ever,"I don't want to retype this and my hands will shake.

Let this be a lesson on road safety."
1547,My mental health is getting bad again and I genuinely feel like I’m not a capable adult,"2 years ago my mental health was at its absolute lowest. I ended up getting help and things slowly started getting better. I was going through therapy and counseling at least once a week and had a strong support system. I got out of the military earlier this year and started college. My classes aren’t super hard but I am struggling so much. I don’t understand why though, all I have to do is study and keep up with house work. Every time I start to feel overwhelmed and anxious it’s like I’m taken back to where I was 2 years ago, and it makes me feel worse. My partner works a lot and I’m home all the time. I feel like I shouldn’t feel the way I do, but the more I feel this way, the worse I end up feeling... if that makes sense. I cry all the time, I don’t know what to do to feel better. It’s so hard concentrating on my work, I feel like I can’t get anything done. I recently got another therapist but she’s backed up and I won’t be able to talk to her for another couple weeks. My psychiatrist only sees me every 3-6 months (thanks military VA). I feel embarrassed and I’m scared to talk to my partner about it because it just doesn’t make sense that I’m getting sick like this all over again, I should be better, I should be happy. He works so much and I don’t, so I just feel like I shouldn’t be as anxious as I am, but I just can’t help it. Last night while I was falling asleep I started crying and hitting myself, but I didn’t realize I was, like I was half asleep, my partner grabbed and asked if I was okay, and he kept saying he was worried about me, I felt like I couldn’t wake up or respond and I ended up falling asleep. I genuinely don’t understand what happened, but this morning he was messaging me asking if I was okay. I just feel like shit. I feel defective. how am I going to find a good job once I’m done with school if this is how I react to living in a low stress environment? All of my basic needs are being met, I don’t have a job that sucks the life out of me, I have a loving partner. And I’m scared that this’ll push him away, or scare him away, and it just adds to the anxiety. I’m sorry if this is all over the place, thanks for reading if you did."
1548,Being treated for anxiety and depression.,"( Excuse me for my English ) Hello I'm 21 M India and 3 or 4 days ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but doctor said that it's mild but it should not be overlooked.
I was gone to the doctor because I was getting the feeling of a attack when nervous. I also worry about little things a lot and take them very seriously and get tensed or stressed. So now the doctor has given me medication which is Rexipra 5 mg escitalopram once a day and propanolol Hydrochloride 20 mg twice a day and Clonazepam 0.25 mg twice a day. Since the day I have taken the doses I'm feeling pretty good and my head is clear never felt like it. But the main problem started when I looked into the drugs read the information about them and it says that some SSRI increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and depression and anxiety. Now I'm again worried about these effects it's been only 3 days and I'm feeling pretty good but I don't want to feel suicidal. The doctor also told me that the doses are minimal but I want help as I worry a lot as you can see I'm typing this. Please do help we with your opinion I need help. Hopefully you guys can give me some advice.❤️"
1549,I am just fucking exhausted,"I am so tired of everything, i feel literal physical pain from being so tired mentally. I wake up tired and go to sleep tired. I wish i could just push a restart button and begin my life again somewhere else."
1550,Need help please,"My now ex an I broke up last week , we were both very toxic for each other. we both know it’s better this way. But I need help getting over her an getting her out of my head , sleeping , eating, anything.... it’s all so hard . I just need help to mend myself . I’m gonna get a therapist but in the meantime I need help with this so I can live like a person"
1551,I ended a 4 year friendship,"Nine days ago I ended a 4 year friendship next month it would of been 5 years. I suffer from depression and anxiety and he knew about it but I was always there for him when things got tough for him and he's been there for me too I've never went behind his back. Before Halloween he pushed me away and said he was fine and i said okay and went back to carving my pumkin the second time he posted on his Facebook I comment if he's okay then an hour later he deletes the post I began to worry. I have problems of my own I've been dealing with the falling out with my family my mental health started to decline i became alone i reached out to other friends about my mental health and my falling out with my family but they left me on read. I started to feel like I was better off without friends. I reached out to my friend who pushed me away and the conversations I had with him felt different it felt like we were drifting apart and it made me sad I also found out he removed me on snapchat and it stung. He posted on his story about something and I messaged him saying I'm still here and hopes he gets better. The next day no reply I checked Facebook and it's hurts that he acknowledged his other friends thanking them. I knew that ment our friendship was ending I became so sad that I felt like I was pushed away and that I knew our friendship was coming to the end. I ended up blocking him on my phone number, Facebook, and instagram because it hurts and I didn't want to get hurt like my previous friendship. He was better off without me as his friend and that I was just another person who was temporary in his life ment to encourage him not to give up on life. Not long ago he made a new Facebook and this time he had me blocked on messenger, I blocked his new account because it hurts seeing a former bestfriend. 

To be honest I haven't been doing well and though I question if I made the right decision then again I have to remember that friendships come and go. Good or bad. There are times where I just don't want to do anything like my school work I feel like I can't go on then almost through the day I have to remind myself to move on. Even though I feel alone. I always wondered if I did something wrong when he was pushing me away."
1552,hi ive never been on here but i have some things i wanted opinions on,"hello, im an 18 year old. I always have thoughts that when I go outside someone will kill me. I'm really scared someone is going to kill me all the time, maybe family or someone outside or something. it makes me feel really sick thinking about this kind of stuff. i dont have anyone to tell this so thats why im making this post, i think it might not be normal to think about this. i cant explain it but my mom just went out and i am even scared she will die. im not sure what happens when i die but i hope god is there for me when it happens. oh thank you for any help or advice or anything too its much appreciated"
1553,can i get ptsd from an argument (tw: self harm),"this might not be the right sub. 

so it was about four years ago when i had a really big fight with my parents. it was probably the worst day of my life and i was only eleven and it was pretty traumatizing to me. it wasn’t a normal fight. i saw my whole world breaking down this day and it was like my childhood just ended. 

i’ve had a lot of really big fights with my parents. after one i got so angry that i cut myself without even knowing what i am doing. it just felt like i had to and it’s the only right thing to do in that moment. 

there are two specific fights that i think about a lot. i remember locking my door and hiding behind a shelf even though the door was locked. and i remember that i closed my blinds because i was so scared and feared that my parents would go on the roof and come through my window to kill me because the fights were so bad. 

it’s all okay now and me and my parents have a good relationship but i changed since these days. i’m not the same anymore and there are many things in my life that went downhill since then. 

so this is where my actual question starts. can i get ptsd from an argument? this sounds stupid, i know but every time someone brings up the topic of the fight it feels like someone punched a whole in me. it feels like someone rips out a part of me whenever i see/hear something that has to do with these fights. i can’t even explain what i feel in these moments. and it makes me mad that my parents think back to these fights as a funny family memory and i feel like this was the time i started to hate myself."
1554,I feel broken,"I'm 24 and I'm not a functional adult. I've only had a job once for one day (I had a panic attack on shift and quit). I have huge motivation issues and anxiety that prevent me from doing almost anything. I never did homework growing up and therefore didn't graduate high school (even though I knew all the subject matter and was smarter than the average kid). I'm scared to even make a doctor's appointment or see a therapist to get help. Phone calls and talking to receptionists is scary to me. Up until a few years ago I couldn't even order my own food at a restaurant. I don't have a driver's license. I don't know anything about credit cards or bank accounts or taxes. I feel like it's too late for me. I've been trying so hard to fight whatever is wrong with me and be productive my whole life but I just can't seem to fix myself. People say I'm just lazy but I can't control it, and I'm not content to just play video games all day. There are things I want to do with my life. I want to MAKE games, I want to play an instrument, maybe try writing a book. But I can't bring myself to try for more than a couple days before I get overwhelmed and give up. Sometimes I'm not even motivated to play a game that I like. I feel like I need something drastic to fix my brain, like TMS or those new drug trials with psilocybin or something. But like I said, I'm too scared to make a doctor's appointment. I don't know what to do anymore."
1555,"First Time At Mental Hospital, Please help !","i'm am currently in a regular hospital , I was admitted yesterday and placed on involuntary hold . they are sending off to a mental hospital once they find a place . what should I expect ? what meds will they give me (just antidepressants?, something to call me down?, will they give me something at night to help me sleep? any general information or tips will be greatly appreciated. for reference I am 19 and suicidal"
1556,Mental health and speaking to a GP,"Hey, so the past few months I feel like my mental health just keeps declining. I'm so exhausted all the time, i really feel like I can't do anything. I've started having panic attacks again (I presume that's what they are) which I haven't had in a couple of months and my anxiety is at an all time high and I can't really explain why. My heart just feels like it's pounding in my throat half the time.

So my question is, how do I speak to a GP about this? The thought of even going to the doctor's really makes me anxious and I end up talking myself out of it before I even phone for an appointment. I have been before a couple of years ago and they put me on sertraline but I just gave up and ended up not going back. How do you explain to your gp what's going on?"
1557,"I don't know how to ""do"" leisure time","So I am really feeling well during the work week. I generally enjoy what I'm doing there and it does give my life some structure and purpose (despite working from home all the time).

 However, once my work day is over I'm at a loss of what to spend my time with and I quickly despair and find everything dull and tiring. Saturday mornings seem to be the worst right now. I just feel exhausted and without direction during the weekends. 
I've tried drawing - but it frustrates me, because I don't draw well enough. I'm volunteering - but it feels too close to my job, so I'm not relaxing while doing it and it draws my energy. I'm meeting friends when possible but I don't enjoy it.

Do you have similar feelings? 
What do you recommend to structure your leisure time? 

Tldr: I'm really good and happy at work. I get depressed and tired as soon as leisure time comes."
1558,I need support and advices,"Idk how to start but I feel quite bad right now and need advices.

Since this summer, I’m in couple with a really nice person, that’s her first relationship and my third. I should mention that my last one was really traumatic for me ( suicide treats, manipulation, no communication and things that crossed my limits )

She’s really supportive and encourages me to grow as a better person. I try be as good she is to me to her but Idk if I’m satisfying her. 

We have a long distance relationship rn

We never had arguments for the moments but I think I did two mistakes with her for the moments and the last one was something like ten minutes ago. 

She had a bad day and I wanted to talk about it with her, it want well until the moment I realized I forgot about one issue she talked about in the past. That was her problem today. 

And now I feel like the worst, imagining the worsts scenarios and crying under my blanket. 

I apologized to her but I don’t know what to do to feel better and to make her happy."

1560,Accidently opened up some past wounds thanks to stupid social media,"I am almost 30 years old. However, I indirectly opened up some past wounds related to trauma from growing up.  The teenage years were rough on me. Bullying, excluded from things and people just weren't very nice to me. In fact, a lot of my depression and anxiety can be traced back to all this. And sadly, whenever I think about it, anger begins to arise. Anger because those who have wronged me are living happy successful lives and never once faced the repercussions for the damage they have caused. 

But today, I opened that wound back up on accident. I got so angry I broke a PS4 controller in half. For the last few hours I have been shaking and I can feel the anger just flowing all throughout my body. I really don't think I have experienced an anger like this before.

1562,Christmas Request Triggered Emotional Pain,"Last week I was visiting my parents and they asked me a pretty innocent question; what do I want for Christmas?

This time last year, I had a girlfriend who I loved and spent a lot of time with. My birthday is coming up and we not only spent a night together but she also helped me pick out my Christmas tree and came to a Christmas party I held. 

Unfortunately this year has been a complete 180. In March, she left me because of a bunch of personal problems I tried to help her with. Because of the pandemic, I haven’t been able to really recover and move on. 

Making this more complicated is I befriend a male friend of hers. He has a bit of a mental disability and doesn’t have many friends and considers me one of his closest. He reached out to me and we chat constantly. There have been times where he’s opened up to me and I’ve sort of played therapist to him. 

I don’t know how to tell my family I want my ex back. Thy know I’m hurting but don’t want to hear about me missing my ex. I have a therapist I talk to about but am almost out of ways to explain how I feel. 

I don’t know what to say or do anymore."

1566,"""Don't make other people responsible for your happiness""","I  don't understand the phrase ""making other people responsible for your  happiness"". This seems to be frowned upon but I am having trouble  understanding what that actually looks like.

What I interpret from this is:

\- Never ask anybody for anything under any circumstances ever

\- if something another person does supports me in meeting my goals, I should reject it.

\- if someone does something and I feel good afterwards,  I should either push them away or push away the good feeling

The  last one is the hardest because I understand the importance of doing  nice things for people and contributing to my community, but when I  contribute to someone, they tend to reciprocate and it's hard to  constantly come up with excuses to deflect their  attention/gifts/whatever.

Also it  seems to negate all romantic partnerships because if I am happy about  having a romantic partnership, then that person is contributing to my  quality of life so that means..... I should only have relationships if I  don't like them?

It seems to mean never spend time around anyone who improves your quality of life."
1567,"A person dear to me has a wrong image of me in her head, and I can't clear things up for her own sake. How do I move on?","Real ""quick"" rundown of the situation:  


My girlfriend broke up with me almost 3 months ago. We went out seperate ways with full intentions on both sides to stay connected afterwards. She wanted to go full no-contact, to which I didn't agree at first because I wanted more closure, but she wouldn't change her stance, so we didn't talk to eachother for some while.  


A week into that no-contact phase, I've had my very first panic attack. I was hyperventilating in my room, alone, trying to get a grip of myself, but I simply couldnt. My mind was racing with a lot of negative thought of how she maybe never loved me, how nothing I've done was of any worth, how she probably doesn't even miss me and so on... In my weakened state of mind I started drinking on top of it, which definitely didn't make anything better either.  


The thoughts became so bad and loud that I was searching for any kind of reaffirmation that it's not as bad as I'm making myself believe, so I made the mistake of messaging her best friend, asking how she's doing. I told him that I'm in an extremely bad state of mind and he shouldn't take anything I write seriously, and NEVER tell my ex of that conversation (but in the end he of course did tell her). Said friend told me that she's doing ""better than he's ever seen her do before"" and that she's ""very very happy rn"". Hearing that kicked me right back into panic-state and had me lose control of my every action the way I've never experienced before. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, believing all of my fears to have been confirmed, and started lashing out a bit. I wrote that friend that ""I've never felt so trampled on before"". That ""I don't understand how she could trade ALL of my happiness for a little bit extra for her"" and how ""she wouldn't be in such a good decision if it hadn't been for me"".  


I regret every writing anything like that, as I absolutely don't believe that she would have ""needed"" me to get where she is rn, nor that she did it out of ill-will. What I wrote that night was not okay. Neither was my mental state.   


A lot of time passed afterwards, and I hear from a mutual friend that she never wants to talk to me again, and doesn't want to have me as a friend anymore. That information went unexplained for a long while, until I reached out to her after I got wind of her having moved to another country (for family reasons), and just wanting to know what the hell is going on.  


She then explained to me that she can't be friends with someone who ""says these kind of things when he's in a bad mood"", and that I'm apparently talking completely differently about her behind her back then I did to her face. Second accusation is absolutely not true, as I've never ever talked her down in my life, only ever questioned her actions at best. She said she's seen the texts Ive sent her friend and she doesn't want me talking to her friends, hates me for talking that way about her and simply doesn't want me in her life anymore.   


I tried to salvage the situation as best I could, telling her that I never did these things, but she most likely didn't trust me anymore at this point. I never mentioned my panic attack (which I had 2 more of at a later time), I never mentioned my 10kg weight-loss in 2months, I never mentioned how miserable I truly felt, because I didn't want to put even more burden on her. She was going through a LOT of shit during the time we haven't been together, I knew of that much, and I still value this girl a lot. I don't want to hurt her unneccessarily. Yet I know that she's got the image of a jerk in her head when thinking about me rn. She thinks I've said these things in a rage, and ""finally showed my true colors"" that night, when in reality I've had my first panic attack of my life and was in no way, shape or form to be taken seriously.   


I have made relative peace with the fact that we won't be friends in the near future. Things need to heal before any contact can be established again. Yet it pains me to no end, that she now has this completely wrong image of me in her head, which probably slows down that healing process by a considerable margin, and overwrites all the good memories we've made together with a cloud of ""it was all a lie"" in her mind. I want to move on from this. I want to live my life. But I care way too much about what this girl thinks about me, and the fact that I am a jerk in her head that I'm not.   


I don't know how to fully move on. Any advice is appreciated."
1568,I need a new kind of help,"I’m dealing with alcohol abuse disorder, cannabis abuse disorder, adhd, anxiety, depression, the list probably goes on. 

I’ve been dealing with this stuff for years. I quit drinking and smoking and taking meds. I made it a good long time without doing any of it, but I guess I relapsed last night and I’m feeling really guilty about it. I just can’t control my impulses. I got to therapy and have been to rehab twice, but I feel like nothing is helping me. I just want to cry and shut myself off from the world because I don’t want to hurt anybody or cause anyone any pain or problems. I’ve been suicidal too. I don’t understand why this is all happening. I try to stick with the help and what people tell me to do, but it doesn’t feel like it works. I’m so tired of upsetting people and upsetting myself. I’m just disgusted with how I am. I’m so weird too. I feel like I should be doing great things, but I’m hindered by all this stuff. I just wish I had someone to talk to about it who’s going through the same thing as me. Trying to explain it just upsets me and makes my head hurt and not function the way I want it to be functioning.

And that's of my own doing - I push people away who I know would be willing to help because I just can't. I can't talk about this because it feels so pathetic and unjustified but I'm seriously at my breaking point. I've felt fine today but repressed emotion always finds its way back to me. I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid tonight and I just don't want to be alone. I don't even know what I want but I just don't want to sit here and do nothing.

I hate how she seems so chill all the time. I hate that I can't dress the same way as her. I hate that I could never befriend any of her friends (and you know what's worse? Is that she never do anything in particular for people to like her. People just loved to hang out with her).

And the funniest part is that she probably hates herself too. I remember all the times she talked about how bad of a person she is. How she'd protect anyone else from death because everyone's better than her. I guess the grass is always greener on the other side..."
1571,Removing the Dead Petals in Our Lives,"One hobby my parents have is gardening. I remember when I was in High School I saw my mom plucking petals off of some flowers and was shocked because I thought she was killing them!

When I asked her why she was doing that she said, “Because the flower will stop wasting energy on the dead petals. It’s better for it to create new ones.”

The same goes for [paying down](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-pay-down-emotional-debt) your [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and) and why sometimes things have to get worse before they get better.

# Addressing Emotional Debt is Painful

When you start focusing on your mental health, especially when you see a therapist, you might actually feel like things are getting worse. This letter is for you:

Don’t stop.

I know it doesn’t make sense. I know you want to feel better right away. But sometimes growth requires pain. It requires strength. And it requires faith.

The reason why getting better hurts is because you’ve got to remove the dead petals in your life so that new ones can grow.

Facing the pain we’ve been ignoring can be scary. There’s a reason why we’ve shoved it under the rug for so long. But we won’t be able to fully deal with it unless we address it head on.

The same goes with our maladaptive coping mechanisms. These are the things we do to make ourselves feel better temporarily…but they’re really hurting us. In other words, these are the dead petals of our lives.

We pour a ton of energy into them because it’s a part of who we are. It’s become a part of what we do. We think that they’re helping but really, we’re just wasting our time and energy.

# Examples of Dead Petal Behavior

Here are some examples of Dead Petal Behavior in order to make this concept more concrete:

* Drinking when you feel depressed to stop feeling sad. You might feel better that night, but you’re destroying your body and potentially feeding an addiction. I recently had a friend commit to not drinking any alcohol for over a month and one of the first things she said was that she never realized how much money she was spending on it. She’s using that money now to help pay for her college tuition.
* Pretending to be someone you’re not. You might avoid the shame of revealing your imperfections. And yes, the image of who you are that you present to your friends might get tarnished and your pride hurt if you show them who you really are. But you’re not letting your whole self be embraced, just what you want them to see.
* Self harm. This comes in many shapes and forms. At a physical level, it can look like cutting. It’s a way to remind yourself that you’re alive or to create pain to cover the deeper one you feel in your heart. But the underlying Emotional Debt never gets addressed. At a mental level, it’s self-criticism. You might think you deserve it and that it’ll help you not make the same mistake. But you’re just destroying your self image and confidence.

Breaking these Dead Petal Behaviors hurt because they bring us comfort. They are things that you can control. They’re reliable and ripping them off means that you have to try something new. And trying something new means you could fail or face more pain than you think you can handle.

But remember, sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. You’ve got to remove the dead petals to make way for new ones that can help you thrive.

1572,Haha saddness goes brrrr,"So this happened last night but what ever.
My mom has these like, wax melts, you out wax in them and they melt and become hot. I like to touch the wax, it's fun to play with, I don't make a mess, and put the wax on my fingers, back into the thing a second after I'm done. She has told me not to mess with this, and I honestly forget alot. Last night she confronted me and I told her I was sorry and forgot, she then started getting mad at me and when ppl get mad at me I Understandible tear up. She then said I had issues and that I needed to go to the doctors to get drugged up to fix me. It was a very good night :)"
1573,What’s the point,"What’s the point in living or trying to live a life when there is obviously something very wrong with my brain, am I just supposed to suffer the whole time and try to enjoy fleeting happiness which I’m not even guaranteed?

1577,Family hold past Mental Health issues against me,"A couple of years ago I started university and a year into it I had what I’d describe as a breakdown. I became severely depressed and anxious. I ended up seeing a doctor, got the diagnosis and decided to drop out of uni and go home. My family where very supportive of this and glad really to have me back.

I’m now in a steady job and I’m in a better place with my mental health. I’ve also decided I want to finish my degree and move away. This is in part because I want my degree and it’d be more practical where I live to move out. And because I want my independence back. 

But my family don’t trust me. Despite the medication, the therapy, getting a job and good progress all round they think I’ll revert to how I was. They’re saying I can’t make it on my own and should just stay home. My Farther has gone further to say he’s accepted his lot in life and I should just do the same and not aspire for more. 

How can I get across that I’ve dealt with my problems and will continue to as they arise?"
1578,Question- emotion and sex drive,"Can your brain shut down your emotions and sex drive as a form of defence to stress? 

Been living in my own head this lockdown and in the last few months, I have completely lost my emotions and sex drive."
1579,Diagnosis that went in a different direction,"So here’s a little background about me (21F). I go to college and I was having a tough time focusing considering it’s all online. I’ve never sought out accommodations before but the school I go to now is very expensive and I can’t afford to fail. Every point matters.

I decided to seek out ADHD testing. I have struggled with symptoms of ADHD for my entire life, along with symptoms of depression and anxiety. These main symptoms include restlessness, trouble focusing, feeling like I’m being run by a motor, disorganization, seeking attention and emotional outbursts. When I was young, I also had a lot of disciplinary issues in school but I’ve blocked a lot of it out so I wasn’t able to tell specifics. My entire life, I’ve blamed ADHD but I was never diagnosed even though I definitely should have been. My mother never sought it out for me. I come from a less than stereotypical family which has definitely contributed to my mental state. People have told me my entire life that I’m the poster child for ADHD.

I scheduled 3 sessions (2 therapy, 1 evaluation results) with a psychotherapist seeking out diagnosis. She called me after the second and said I needed a third therapy session. These sessions are really expensive and out-of-pocket but I said yes. I really needed help with my schoolwork issue.

Today, at the evaluation results session, she said I didn’t meet the mark for ADHD despite having all of the symptoms. I passed the TORA test too (something I told her that I knew I would pass as when I have to sit down and complete something with absolutely no choice, I will do and especially when it’s something as elementary as clicking a button). I checked 9 boxes of symptoms when I needed to check 12. This felt like an $800 slap in the face. She told me that if I was diagnosed at a younger age I would’ve probably met the mark. The problem wasn’t with my therapist, she is reputable and very nice and supportive.

She diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I said how do I have all of the symptoms of ADHD without having ADHD, and she then said that I fell under the criteria for “other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder” so she gave me that too.

I’ve lived my entire life thinking I had ADHD, so now I’m currently having an identity crisis. I feel extremely upset knowing that maybe what everyone told me for 21 years was true. Maybe I just haven’t been trying hard enough. Long story short, I broke down in tears sobbing at the session and she asked if I needed anything else and I basically said no and left early because I saw no further point.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I already take medication for anxiety. I knew I had that and it’s no surprise. Should I see a different psychotherapist and try again for an ADHD diagnosis? What should I do going forward? Has anyone else been through anything like this? In general, I’m just looking for support."
1580,Mental health revaluation,"I'll start from the beginning (a very good place to start). I have lived with my very abusive mentally unstable grandmother most of my life, it was very hard in my early teens to start changing and having a very very mean terrible manipulative person around. We had a lot of fights and her cruelness really killed my self esteem. I tried to kill myself and self harmed. I was in an out of psych wards for the better part of 2 years. Never once did they actually try and help me, they just did what they needed to do to please my grandmother who was paying for all of it. I was diagnosed with bipolar at age 12. In those early years they put me on a lot of meds that made me gain tons of weight, gave me bad tremors and starting to shut down my organs! 

I am now 22 and moving away from home was the best thing ever. 4 years away at college was great, I never have any fits of rage or highs of lows or anything really. I'm honestly a very relaxed responsible person. I manage my money well and almost nothing really makes me mad. I have some depression but don't we all, it isn't a big issue for me. I did really well in school and have even been able to be accepted to programs and lived abroad twice with no issues. Recently I moved away and live with a roommate 5 hours away. I feel stable and relaxed here, I can smoke freely here and because of that I no loner need to take my sleeping aid (Trazadone), and with that my nightly lithium. Right now I only take 300mg of lithium once a day, well below therapeutic levels and I honestly feel fine. I have a new boyfriend and making other friends, I exercise and I'm doing well at my job. I want to stop taking meds all together because I really feel I don't need them.

 I've thought about being reevaluated but because of how I feel the system failed me when I was younger I'm hesitant. My mental health doctor is honestly pretty useless but the only one covered by my insurance in my area so thats not an option. I just don't feel bipolar is what I have, I never have highs and lows, never ever have any sort of uncontrollable mania. If I ever do feel impulsive about anything I always sit down and hash out the reality of what I'm thinking about and take time before making a move. I'm afraid to tell my dr I want to stop my meds all together.

Anyone with bipolar that is willing to talk about how they feel and what they go through would be greatly appreciated. I've never had anyone with it to talk to.

TLDR; Mental health system failed me when I was younger. Recently,  Stopped taking meds and feelings fine. Unsure of how to move forward."
1581,How do stop being consumed by my want to die,"In school, at home, anywhere, all I can think about is I don’t want to be alive anymore and I don’t know how to stop thinking about it.
It almost came on out of nowhere.
I don’t to my knowledge even have a reason.
I feel empty inside, I don’t want anything anymore I’m just trying my best telling myself “just get through today” every day.
I’ve been getting headaches lately and the doctor suggested that I might have depression and referred me to a psychiatrist but that’s over two weeks away.
I can’t concentrate in school because my mind keeps telling me there’s no point.
I don’t want to talk to anyone or go out with my friends because my mind is telling me there’s no point.
I don’t do any of the things I used to enjoy.
I eat to fill the pit in my stomach.
And all I can think of is how much I want to kill myself so there’s no point in anything.
Until I go to that psychiatrist and get help I need some way to live normally.
I’m only 15 and have so many exams coming up that I just havnt had the energy to study for.
Please someone give me any sort of tips that will help, anything at all, I’m desperate."
1582,"Tl;dr my dad didn't cough, but I saw and heard him cough and now I'm coughing? Why am I misremembering events?","So my friend is a psych minor and when I told her about this story, she said that I was being gaslit because you don't misremember singular events, only things like task order, sentence wording, etc. and I don't know how to feel about it.

I (20m) have diagnosed though untreated ADHD (can't treat it because it could worsen my anxiety) and has caused me severe memory issues my whole life. I'll misremember dreams as reality or vice versa, forget everything I study before exams, forget entire days, forget to do important parts of my routine, etc.

So I've been super nervous about COVID because I already have health issues I'm working through and can't risk something so major. My dad is very indifferent about it: He'll wear masks in public and advocate that schools should still all be completely online, but never washes his hands, will cough/sneeze into his hands, and has been caught reaching his freshly coughed in hands into places we keep food (fruit drawer, open bag of chips, etc). Tbh, it really freaks me out because I can't tell if it's just something he's forgetting to do, or if he just doesn't care.

So yesterday evening I was walking by the kitchen and saw him turn his face into his elbow and heard him make the exact sound that people make when they have a sore throat and need to cough it out, but don't want anyone to know. I stopped and asked him: ""Was that a cough or were you just choking on something?""

Instead of admitting that he had choked on something, which is most often what it is, he started talking about something else (I think it was maybe star wars?)

So once he was done with his sentence, I asked him again, ""But wait, was that a cough or were you just choking?""

And he responded: ""No, I didn't cough."" Which I thought was weird and a  little suspicious. 

Now I've hallucinated before, but it's always been sleep paralysis or the odd minor auditory hallucination after he had berated me one time and scared the shit out of me for accidentally talking back (but correcting myself before he could get me in trouble). This didn't feel like a hallucination, but I've never misremembered something so close to when it happened.

I woke up this morning at 8, drank some water and stayed in bed napping and on my phone until about 11-12 because I was tired and usually use Saturday mornings to catch up on the sleep I lose during the week. I noticed that my throat was sore this morning, and had tried drinking water to get rid of it, thinking it might just be dry in the house, but then realized I was coughing in the exact same way that I had ""seen"" my dad do yesterday. I was terrified and booked myself a COVID test, then texted my mom to say that I couldn't visit her this week and explained why.

She told me to ask my dad if he was getting a covid test, because I still thought at this point that he had coughed, and so I did. He immediately got super pissed off, adamantly repeating that he never coughed before leaving. So I shrugged it off and texted my mom that he wasn't. Apparently she texted him, and he stormed back in fuming that I had lied to her, that he had never coughed, and that if I got up before 12 and drank water I wouldn't be coughing.

I know I remember waking up and drinking water before 12, even if I stayed in bed a little longer, but now I think I'm misremembering him coughing and that I messed everything up? That he's going to be mad at me for lying to my mom for the rest of the 10 days I have to remain isolated in his house even though I didn't know (and frankly still don't know) that I was lying?

For the record, he has been caught in a lie twice over the past two days, once when he left his dish out on the counter (he gets mad at my brother and I when the kitchen is dirty but we've been trying to get him to contribute by putting away the dishes that he uses) and tried to blame it on me to my brother, and this morning when my cat was throwing up and I noticed someone had given them tuna again (the cats aren't allowed tuna because it makes them sick) and he tried to pass it off on my brother even though my brother saw him do it and he was the only one who ate tuna yesterday.

So frankly I don't know what to believe at this point. He keeps coming back to shout at me and tell me that he never coughed and that I'm not sick, so it doesn't feel like he'd make that big of a deal out of it if he was just lying like he did before. But at the same time, he lies a lot and this feels like something he would lie about to keep his life as normal as he can. Why would I misremember something like that? And if I didn't, why would he lie over something like that?

I'm very anxious and confused and I feel like I'm losing my mind. Please help, I need to get my memory under control before it destroys every relationship I've ever made."
1583,Afraid that my friend might try to commit suicide again,"My friend is in a toxic relationship and it’s making her manic and depression worse. She says she loves him  and refuses to break up with him, and I’m worried she might try to attempt again because she’s isolating, etc. What can I do??"
1584,Will my online therapist report me for self harm?,"I don't do it often, I cut my forearm up pretty bad last night because I was frustrated and upset, my emotions have been very volatile this past week, not being able to deal with the lows. I think it's something I should bring up to my online counselor but I don't want to get in any trouble with the law. I'm not suicidal but I've been having some really negative thoughts I can't deal with."
1585,I hate my mom,I just started driving and I know the rules of the road (that’s how I passed the fucking test) and she keeps bitching to me over every little thing even if I have the right of way or do nothing wrong. She makes me hate life and I hope everyone else that sees this and also hates their mom knows they have one more person in their friend circle. I wish I had a mom that likes me more. I like my friend’s moms more than I like my own. She makes me feel like a shitty person and I hate it.
1586,Serious question,"Hi everyone i have a really serious question to ask and dont know where to go. Im bi and from the uk and im currently in a long distance relationship with another boy. The problem is im 16 and hes 14 and im scared that even though its such a small age difference this is really bad? Im just really worried so some feeback would be nice, thanks"
1587,When I get overwhelmed if I start smacking my head it soothes me?,Today I had a break down and I started smacking myself in the head not the first time I have done it. I did it after my son was born 13th September 2019 when I caught my husband cheating. 5 days after my son was born. I have postpartum depression and had 2 miscarriages July and 4 weeks ago. I have two children 2yrs and 1 yrs. Today my son kept yanking my hair and I  just lost it like a toddler I kicked around thrashed on the floor and started hitting myself. But once I hit myself a few times in the face and cried I felt instantly better. Like I just felt tranquil afterwards. Why is that ?
1588,I need help but nowhere to turn to,"I'm in my early 50s, been battling depression for over 10 years with so so success. I'm on snris which kept me afloat for the past 2 years.

After doing an online research survey someone posted on reddit, I came to the realization that I am terribly unhappy and lonely even though I've been married for over half my life.

My wife is a great woman, loving, caring. 

However we have nothing in common. I'm a cerebral person, and not the greatest communicator but other than day to day crap and the weather, we have nothing to say. I get irritated by everything and I don't want to make her life miserable.

I have unfortunately turned to various addictions to try and cope and I can't do this anymore. I don't know what kind of help I can get for the issues I have. I don't want to end up in trouble for seeking help but I want this to end one way or another. I feel so alone that all I have left is this place. Pathetic"
1589,Unusual Triggers,"does anyone else have ""small,"" odd or just unusual triggers? for example, a certain word/phrase that isn't usually associated with traumatic events, a certain food or a certain movie? because i do, and it makes me really insecure. mine are, like, the movies Borat and Frozen II and the monkey emojis. don't ask why, but yeah."
1590,On Intrusive Thoughts of Past Heartbreak,"You need to accept the fact that this person may be a presence within your inner being for a long time. If for no other reason than their significance as someone who shaped you into who you currently are. The thoughts will enter and you cannot stop this. What you can do, is stop letting them affect you. They are there. He is there. Think of him as a moving piece of furniture in your internal world. Eventually, it will affect you less and less. For this to be possible, a huge amount of honesty and kindness with yourself is needed."
1591,Possible PTSD or related symptoms?,"During a period of my youth I had 3 years of constant dread and severe depression and contemplated suicide, and managed to break free of it. But on very rare occasions when I experience deep sadness that is unrelated to what happened years ago my mind is put back during that 3 year period and I have feelings of what I would describe as terror. Is this normal or is something wrong with me?"
1592,Therapy can become like a religion,"I'm sure this will be a deeply unpopular sentiment, but have you ever notice how a lot of people approach therapy like a religion? Some people say their daily affirmations, preach therapy's virtues, and place blind faith in the process like religious people do. I don't mean region like Christianity, I mean religion more like Confucianism.It's an overarching worldview what takes hypotheses and transforms them into mantras. 

Science struggles to make sense of the brain, and can't do more than speculate about subjective consciousness. In practice, psychology often takes a vague hypothesis that is still under investigation, and turns it into complete world view.Sometimes I think it becomes a modern, science informed religion that draws deeply from the more Humanistic world view, and confuses theory for universal fact.

 I think that like any region it provides some people with solace, and it doesn't work for others. I wish I could get support with out being preached at.

I expect to be roundly criticized and hated on for saying this, but here it is."
1593,derealization / depersonalization,"ever since i can remember myself as a child i used to experience these “out-of-body” “i-dont-feel-attached-to-my-body” experiences 24/7, there wasn’t one moment in the day where i wouldn’t feel that way i just learned to ignore it if that makes sense?? cause i thought it was normal to feel like that, but then i’d start my friends (in elementary) if they feel the same way as way and they would all be like “no” and they genuinely got weirded out. that’s when i started realizing it wasn’t normal and be more aware of it, the more aware of it i was, the more terrified i got bc i was genuinely NOT there, my body was, i never was.

over the years i’ve learned to live with it and try to avoid being aware of it cause if i am it will cause a withdrawal. i also have had severe anxiety my entire life so maybe it has something to do with it.

do u guys know if it’s derealization or depersonalization? am i being dumb, are they both the same thing?"
1594,Trying to balance caring and work,"Hey guys, I’ve been with my partner for a little over a year and they’ve been struggling with their mental health for the past 6 months and I was put into a position of being the primary carer for them. I’m unsure what I am responsible for and when to draw the line for myself. 

There’s been an ongoing dilemma with when I go to work, I only work casually 2-3 days a week and I will be asked by my partner not to go to work when they’re having a bad day. I’ll be asked to stay home once or twice a week to support. Financially I’m in a really tough position recently and it’s very difficult to try and overcome that when I can’t work to earn money. 

I’m not sure where I should stand being a carer to my partner and also trying to find a balance between work and them. Any advice is appreciated, Thanks."
1595,am i ruined?,"i dont know, im kinda curious if im.. like.. ruined? i just feel weird. when i was 14 before my birthday, i talked someone out of suicide, they planned to do it  on my birthday that they forgot (they were my ibf of almost a year then).then a few months after i found a post of theirs on reddit saying they tried to do it again and failed, they didnt even tell me, i found out myself. ive never cried at a funeral or time after it, its just, what life is. i do care about people, but might come across as i dont. i mostly crack when im alone and have time to think about it, or one small comment can break me(like a very small comment about how I did something a bit wrong) , but not the big things. i feel so weird. i think i might have anxiety too. most of the time i cry if someone found something out about me that was negative. i also have an ed, which i dont really want to talk about, because im still very new to recovery. i feel so broken. anyone know what i can do?"
1596,Tips to get back into my old workout routine after a depressive episode?,"I started my fitness journey earlier this year around mid-February. My boyfriend helped me get my butt back into the gym and got me into a healthy workout and diet routine and it brought us closer together. After Covid happened, we started a garage gym and continued our routine.

We were doing well until about August. I picked up my nicotine habit again after quitting for 4 months, I was constantly stressed by work, and I started binge eating again. My mental health started falling apart again after a lot of personal circumstances happened to me and I felt no motivation to even get myself out of the house. I felt more joy being couped up with no responsibilities. But recently I looked at myself in the mirror, weighed myself, and broke down. I have a history of ED and I suffer from GAD and depression. I see my therapist every other week and she told me I need external motivation because I can’t seem to motivate myself. My boyfriend used to be my motivation but he’s been slacking as well due to school. Seeing the numbers on the scale gave me a tinge of motivation but I’m not sure if it’s the correct way to motivate myself. I really do want to be healthy again as I was so much happier when I was fit and eating well. It’s just hard to 1) find the time and 2) find it within myself to start a routine again.

Any tips on how to get myself back into a healthy routine again with a non-toxic mindset? I appreciate it."
1597,How do I become the person I want to meet in this world? How do I feel complete with myself while I feel lack love and intimacy?,I feel like lacking lots of self love and intimacy. I like cuddling and being intimate. But it seems hard to be single. I am 27F recently broken up with my lover.
1598,i haven’t felt most emotions even after being off antidepressants,antidepressants kinda majorly fucked me up emotion wise and it’s been years since i last took them so that’s cool.

1600,I don't know what's going on,"I really can not understand what's going on around me. How the people live, How the things happen. It's just like i'm in a tornado whirling with the wind and every thing hits me and i don't feel any of that.
I failed two semesters in college and if i fail this time i'll be fired. But i don't why i can't change anything. I don't feel anything. I'm literally numb."
1601,I have anger issues. I’m ready to heal... where do I begin?,"Hi internet. 

I’m finally ready to come to terms with my behavior and the affect I’ve had on those that I love and have loved. 

My anger. 

It seems to be a problem. I’m ready to take responsibility. 

How do I begin healing this aspect of my psyche? 

I am getting an appointment with a local therapist Monday, but I can’t wait. My heart is heavy and im tired of fucking up every relationship I get close to. 

I feel like they only surface after ive been with someone for some time.

I’m not sure if it is buried trauma, or if Im just crossing my own boundaries in/during the relationship and pissing my self off? (If that’s a thing) 


I spend a lot of my time in metacognition, and have recently considered a high level of autism, as I am a social recluse, capitalism makes me sick and angry, I have few friends that I am close too but I lot of people I know. 

I know that I have relationship issues and problems with letting people in....


Please be kind in your words if you choose to respond..I’m pretty fragile right now. 


TIA 

TL; DR: I’m ready to accept my anger issues. How do I resolve them?"
1602,abilify and ritalin,"so im on abilify and i feel like it isn’t helping much, i have adhd and i need 2 be diagnosed (my current therapist isn’t specialized in adhd and didn’t diagnose me with adhd), i wanna see another doctor for them to give me a ritalin prescription.

can i be on ritalin and abilify at the same time?? if not how long will i have 2 wait  after quitting abilify to be on ritalin??"
1603,My Anxiety,"My Anxiety just seems to get worse and worse again. It's been seven years I am wondering when I will get better. I's not just being a teenager I have had it for longer than 7 years.  The sycle has been the same, I get better go off pills, the next year it takes me down, over and over again, evrey day. I get it nothing gets better."
1604,why is it that everytime i get yelled at i feel super depressed?,"hi everyone! so basically i deal with depression and anxiety like it’s a thing yk? but something kind of odd is whenever i get yelled at even if it’s something minimal i feel as depressed as i do when i’m actually going through a depressive episode. like today my mom yelled at me and i consider relapsing after like 3 months being clean of self harm, i feel like reacting that way isn’t normal? idk. i also tend to cry really easily after i get yelled at. idk what the cause of it could be. also, added i get yelled at i suddenly feel like my mom just hates me and i have no purpose to her. can someone help me to tell me like why i’m like this or something ?"
1605,How do you forgive yourself and move forward when your mental health problems ruin things in your life?,"My anxiety and depression have lost me a lot of very important things in my life. Mostly due to disassociating and hurting people while having panic attacks. I’m medicated, seeing a therapist and have always sought out counselling in my adult life in an attempt to be better. It’s pretty clear that regardless of any of the hard work I do, that I will still always inevitably suck the life out of everything good in my life. I’ve hit a point I’m struggling to see any redemption in myself.

How do you move forward knowing that you and your mental health were the cause of something ending?"
1606,Occasional episodes of paranoia,"
I've been struggling a lot lately with anxiety, depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. And one thing that's been worrying me.

Occasionally I get really intense episodes of paranoia. I'll convince myself there's some sort of monster in my room or that, for whatever reason, I'm not safe in my room anymore. This happens a lot at night.

Is this a sign of anything? I'm pretty worried as I've felt really unstable lately. Any advice would be appreciated..."
1607,"Big 5, High neuroticism low everything else","I took Jordan Peterson's Psychology test. I got a super high score on neuroticism and a low score on everything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the whole thing said I was doomed, and it's a miracle that I'm not in prison.  Is there anything someone can tell me about what I should do.

I was wondering if there is any hope for me. I know it listed every trait one by one, but I don't really think it did a good job explaining what it mean as a larger picture as a whole. I did agree with many of it's statements, only disagreed with a few.

Does anyone have anything useful to say about what is going on with this."
1608,I really can't stand my life anymore,"Following the loss of all my friends in the February of thus year I've been feeling worse and worse every single day. The only person in my life is my girlfriend and i constantly feel terrible about it, because i don't know if I'm treating her well or am i just a burden. Many people started hating me because of some false rumors and now everyone seem to have a negative depiction of me. I've started going out less and less until one day about a month ago i realized that i haven't gone out for about two months. I've started feeling more comfortable not leaving my house and now i rarely leave my house at all. I've lost all the motivation and nothing gives my pleasure or happiness in this world. I just lay around all day and do nothing. There hasn't been a single day where i didn't think about my life or the whole situation and I've tried many many times to find happiness and each and every time I've failed miserably. How do i get thru this. Please anyone give me some advice."
1609,"Whats the point, Im so lost and I can 't start a fucking life","I spend my days dealing with the annoyance of coming of benzos and everything that entails amongst which I spend every hazy day trying to figure out what tf to do with my life. I  thought I still had my youth but it fell without me noticing; Im 6 months Opiod/alcohol sober now and I finally see all the oppurtunities I avoided over nothing. Im 19 but I still feel like the 12 year old I was picking up a joint only with with fucked lungs and liver; I thought I was still 17 till I got sober. Learn a trade? Work part time? Study? I can't, I'm frozen in fear at the prospect of wasting even more of the pathetic life I've put together. I don't know what to study or if I even can, It's hard atm to get work part time and I have no interest in learning a trade. The whole world suddenly feels so daunting and wobbly to me I seriously can't take a single step. And I have nobody left. I haven't connected with anyone on even a friendship level in a year. So whats the point? Im alone in the world and I feel like Ive woken from a 6 year coma. I see the people I could have been flashing through my mind, the oppurtunties I was awarded and I can't reach for the light anymore. I have no talents skills or degrees.

And yes I have tried cbt, various ssris and antidepressants, I eat and excercise well, I meditate and have tried all the advice you could through at me. Your ted talk or quote dosen't help. Im so alone. I wish that any imaginary person could see through my words and help me. But theres no point hoping for the impossible. Im a suicide case waiting to happen. So seriously how the fuck do you figure out what to do with life? How does anyone get up in the morning?"
1610,Feeling Perpetually Rushed/Lacking Free Time,"I'm 36 and have worked in financial services coming up on 10 years now and am frankly miserable. While I've always been great at what I do, held down a good job, have great finances, etc. etc. I find myself perpetually lacking free time which is really my only goal in life at this point- no interest in marriage/kids/etc. I just want to maximize time for my geeky hobbies (exploring new music, gaming, reading, watching documentaries/tv series, as well as a few others I'd like to get into like having a produce garden and maybe hunting?) and minimize time spent doing anything I don't explicitly enjoy. 

I've thought about a career change, but to be honest I don't know if there's anything I'd enjoy doing that is remotely productive. I've never gotten any satisfaction from professional or academic accomplishments, etc. despite everyone around me patting me on the back about them, etc. I just did it because it was required. My hobbies are all quite introverted (and cheap!) so I don't ever feel like I'm working towards any reward either. Colleagues at work talk about trips they have planned for their vacation or things they want to buy come pay day. I'm simply looking forward to shedding responsibility on weekends/vacation days so I can stay home and not being bothered by anything and just let my consciousness focus on things that make me happy. Retirement is my only real tangible long term goal.

To be frank, I feel like the world's most responsible man-child. Everything constructive I ever do is through sheer force of will from the responsibility itself rather than than any actual motivation or want to accomplish anything. I've thought about what may be wrong with me- it feels like it could be ADHD, but I'm able to (begrudgingly) focus on my work fine. I'm not depressed as I'm pretty damn happy on weekends, and if I'm on the spectrum it's exceedingly marginal as I'm perfectly able to communicate and interact with others. I'm just incredibly anxious/irritable when it comes to anything infringing on 'me time' - I'm a bit of a ragemonster when stuck in traffic and have gotten bratty with management in the past when asked to work overtime. I've even looked into the possibility of gaming addiction, but have taken weeks off before with no issues and am fine doing other things instead. Maybe it's a general dopamine issue? One common thread with my hobbies is they strictly are 'for fun' type activities which I 100% recognize don't have much intrinsic value outside of my own enjoyment. I'm starting to envy folks who enjoy doing constructive things! 

Anyway, I'd appreciate any guidance you could provide. Trying to specifically diagnose things is probably discouraged here, but wondered if anyone could point me in a helpful direction? Thanks!"

1613,Any anger management coping skills out there?,"I know I'm not the only one who feels this way right now, but with all thats going on in the world right now and many things ruined for me this year and even more, I find it quite hard to keep my cool lately. I've always have been a very patient person but these days got me feeling agro all the time. Does anyone have any coping mechanisms to practice or things I should try to do everyday to help me keep an eye on my stress? Thank you all."
1614,Could anyone help me? Please??,"Hey guys, I'm 18, and today as I was coming home from a walk, I felt really out of it, and generally not well. I haven't eaten all day, so I blamed it on that. But even after I've eaten some lunch, the feeling remained. That weird feeling converted to extreme anxiety to the point of a panic attack. Later on the day, I just felt completely confused to the point of depersonalization, and derealization. And as I'm writing this, I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If anyone can help, or has experienced anything similar, please respond.... Thanks a lot!"
1615,I think I've reached rock bottom.,"This year has really taken me for a ride. My mental health has gotten progressively worse. I've tried therapy twice before and it did not work, I tried the exercises and everything but I seemed to never make progress. They did diagnose me with anxiety and depression. 
My insecurities are worse, I give myself headaches from stressing so much, its killing my relationship and me at the same time. 
My mother has tried to make her way back into my life after being gone for 5 years. I am torn on that, because I have no idea how to feel. 

I just need someone or somewhere to turn, since therapy didn't work I need something else...anything else. 

Please give me suggestions if you can"
1616,I don’t feel anything...,"First of all. I’m just looking for advice. Honestly any advice I don’t even know what kind of advice I’m looking for. I am not perfect and I’m not here to get judged by my actions so please refrain from telling me how horrible I am that isn’t really useful to me thanks. Apologies if what I’m writing is incoherent I was writing things down as things were popping up in my head and not planning to proofread :)

I’m just really tired and bored. I don’t think I’ve ever been truly happy I can’t really remember to be honest. I don’t have anyone I love. I don’t care about family or friends as I don’t really put any effort in any type of relationship that I have. I’ve been sexually assaulted by my father and my mom never really protected me so I really don’t care about either of them. I still occasionally pick up the phone if my dad calls just so that I receive money and I live with my mom well because I don’t have anywhere else to go. I guess I do love my cat... but I think I loved my dog as well but I don’t care about that one anymore either I just think it smells bad. Hmm I like sex but I don’t need it I don’t see it as anything special I’m 22 right now and have slept with around 30+ people. I’m a female as well before someone asks. At this point I really don’t know what to do and everything seems so uncertain. In both my previous relationships I’ve cheated on my exes and made sure that they thought it was fully their faults the relationship didn’t work. Most of the time I believe what I’m lying about as well. I’m not a compulsive liar tho. I only lie when it benefits the situation for myself otherwise I’m an open book. At work I don’t like to join in on conversations as I just really don’t care how they are doing or what is going on in their lives. I’ve always been quite impartial. In high school I did really want to fit in I guess. I get obsessed with the smallest things, I get so insanely fixated and it just hurts my brain. I have to have it and when I have it I don’t care anymore. There is literally nothing that I’ve ever been consistent with. I go to uni as well but I just really don’t care about a degree I just do it because... I don’t know. The only thing I know for certain is that I love money. Nothing has ever made me happy so maybe that’s why I love money as it gives me a temporary illusion of being happy on demand when I want something. I mostly laugh and cry when I’m watching something. If something happens with real people I don’t care I don’t feel sorry I just feel awkward. I also like to cry to selfmade scenarios in my head just like I’m the showrunner of the scenes. I think about death alot only I don’t deem it necessary to kill myself unless I become homeless or disfigured I could never life with that. For the rest I’ve had an alright life before I turned 10 I guess. Maybe only abnormality would be me crushing bugs but I don’t know that seems like something every kid would do. My mom did always tell me that I’ve always loved myself the most. 

I also have a therapist for my ptsd? The trauma from being assaulted. Of course I’m traumatized I guess but honestly I’m only going to get my moneys worth (pls don’t ask me why or how) I honestly first hoped that I could get some money out of it all but you know rapists easily get away with shit while victims have to heal the scars with mudwater (just a figure of speech)"
1617,From my childhood,"Hi all, I’d love someone with experience or expertise to help me with understanding my teenage “freak outs”. 

I’ll leave out the traumatic life scenarios but picture this, I lay in bed and as I drift off to sleep - in that part between sleep and awake, I start to become afraid and disoriented. For whatever reason I think the world is ending, I scream and cry and run around the house trying to collect my family. 

Eventually I calm down and am able to go back to sleep. In the morning I think what happened was a dream and I never got out of bed, but mum had told me I got up and screamed around the house. 

It had happened a few times and one day vanished completely. Now I’m an adult and still don’t understand what it was, I’ve talked to doctors, mental health professionals and they won’t tell me or have no idea."
