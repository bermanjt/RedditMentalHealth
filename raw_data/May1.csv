0,Student loan for that?,"Hey,

It’s been in my head for a few years, but now i’m able to make it in reality. I try to be positive about things and life at all, but when it’s all together in my head i just look into the mirror and it all falls apart cuz of my look. I think i have an okay face overall, but my nose is too big.
I think i need to fix it for my mental health, but it’s expensive.It’s around 3500$. Should i get student loan for that? Or should i wait till i get my own salary? I’m 21 now having the time of my life, but this thing is just in my way to be truly happy in my life.

Thanks for your help."
1,anyone else emotionally chill but your body isnt?,"i like to think im a rational person. ive never had a traditional panic attack where you gasp for air hugging your knees. but i keep having stress related symptoms?? chronic inflammation, nausea, sleepwalking/dissociative fugue, swallowing air, tiny muscle twitches/ticks, etc.. its like when i get one thing under control it manifests as something else. has anyone else experienced this?

im so tired of fighting this body. once it was the only thing i felt i could trust and now its like a poison i have to spare the world from seeing"
2,Any ADHD/PMDD peeps take Wellbutrin?,Hi. I've been up and down my entire life but I notice a change in me a couple weeks before my period. I just got diagnosed with ADHD last year and Vyvanse has helped immensely. My psychiatrist is recommending Wellbutrin to help with my mood as it gets especially bad the weeks leading up to my period. I'm wondering if anyone else has gone this route. I have tried taking magnesium bisglycinate and calcium citrate to help but I might need some extra help with managing my moods. Does anyone else have a similar experience that can tell me if it helped to take an anti depressant for PMDD?
3,How to improve a feeling of self worth,"This post isn't just meant for me but for everyone else who struggles with not feeling good enough or like they are chasing the feeling of perfection. I want everyone who suffers from this, gotten over it and those who have never experienced to respond to this with either your story of what you went through or are going through, or to give helpful advice to not only myself but others. 

Right now for me and my journey with this, I'm slowly getting better with seeing my self as average now. I'm lucky enough to have a really supportive girlfriend who helps me feel amazing. I'm not sure when the general age is for when people develop their self worth but I can say mine was destroyed by constant bullying in my first and second year of kindergarten and past relationships. I really just want to be able to create a space for people to speak up about this and to share life experiences. Everyone should see themselves as they are good enough, i say good enough because nobody is perfect. We may place certain people on pedestals weather they be celebrities or people in our lives and see them as perfect. I tend to this far more than I care to admit, but besides that its okay to recognize where we fall short. We can always improve and build apon what we know, but you'll go mad and down a dark rabbit hole if you chase perfection. 

Its okay to not be perfect, just be who you are, because there is no one else in the world like. They may talk like you and act like you, but deep down you have your own unique side, let out into the light. Don't be afraid to be you, because you are amazing....  Unless your killer in which case dm you got some work to be doing."
4,"I still feel the urge to want to be sad (even on my good days), but I am on meds and in therapy to try to be happy again. Does anyone feel this way?","This isn’t me saying “Oh, I’m sad because I want attention”, I’m genuinely sad and a sensitive person. I’m diagnosed with 4 mental health conditions and they severely effect me. My friends and family want me to do well but I just keep doing down the rabbit hole. Sometimes it feels better to me to be sad and anxious and depressed - which is weird because I hate the feeling. Any advice? Don’t know if this is just me but I consciously want to be happy but my mind tell me it’s sad and wants to be sad."
5,Isolation and Anger?,"Is this common?

How do you treat it?

I have been self isolated for months, as I was hit by a car just before COVID19 hit.  As a result, I am a few months ahead of most people when it comes to this COVID isolation thing, as I have bee the only person in my house - with no pets - for what feels like months now.

I mean I know other people exist but they don't seem real anymore, either, because I haven't interacted with one in person in months.  I feel like the world just died and I'm the only survivor, as dumb and inaccurate as I know hat statement really is."
6,I'm 32 and never been proposed to.,"Like the title says. I'm 32, female. Pretty attractive and somewhat fit. I've had lots of boyfriends, but most of my relationships have been unhealthy, so it's a good thing I never married them, but it still makes me kind of sad. I don't know where else to post this. There's probably a better subreddit, but I felt like I might get more understanding here. 

My boyfriend of almost 3 years has been divorced twice and marriage is not something he wants to do again. I'm not even sure if I actually WANT to get married. I feel like having a day be all about me would really fuck with my anxiety. It's like, I don't really want to get married... Maybe, but I want someone to WANT to marry me. I definitely want someone to propose to me. I love watching proposal videos on YouTube. I can't imagine what that would feel like. Great, now I'm crying. 

Anyway, please don't blow up my inbox trying to date me. I'm very happy with my relationship. It's my longest one ever and I'm very proud of myself for it lasting this long. I hope out lasts a lot longer too. Thanks for letting me vent."
7,How different do people act when they are alone compared to with friends/other people,"I have been thinking about this for quite a while. Because of how socially anxious I get, I almost feel like not even my closest friends properly know me and my personality because of how different my more reserved I act when I am with them compared to when I'm by myself. Sometimes I almost feel like when I'm by myself I'm an entirely different person. It also gets quite tiring not being able to just be myself but at the same time I let that wall down because of how anxious I get. I know there is probably always an aspect of people that doesn't come out unless they are alone but I feel like for most people it surely wouldn't be much different. At least, that's where I hope I will get to be some day."
8,I'm failing my classes in college and I don't know how to cope anymore,"I'm a graduating student so this last semester is kinda critical for me. But then coronavirus happened and now all sense of stability over built has completely fallen apart. Given the lockdown and quarantine stuff, our uni had to adjust some things in order to give us a grade.

Apparently if we scored 56% or higher on our first exam, we'll automatically be passed. If not, then we might possibly fail. The thing is, I got 55% on the exam. I was actually quite proudly of myself back then, given that it is a hard subject. I also knew that it might still catch up because it was only the start of the semester. Oh boy I was wrong.

Aside from this predicament, I also haven't touched my thesis since quarantine started because i couldn't function well. Now the semester is ending, and I cant even do anything about it.

I haven't been feeling too well those past few days because I was fighting off a depressive episode and a possible meltdown. But now I think I might as well just drop everything and give up."
9,Rant: Do not talk to me about my self harm unless I bring it up first.,"I haven't self harmed in about 6 years and even when I was self harming I only did it a few times over a short few months.

It was such a short part of my life and I hate being fucking defined by it. Do not fucking ask me if ive self harmed because I'm upset. Do not bring it up in conversation, even of mental health comes up. Don't look at me like I'm a weak little fucking victim and don't act like I'm constantly at risk of self harming when I haven't for literal years.

It happened, its part of my life I cant take back. I don't want to pretend it never happened but if I want to talk about it I'll be the one to bring it up. It don't use this word lightly but it is ""triggering"" for me when people I know being it up, especially when they act all ""oh you poor little fucked up child"" about it. Even after years it still a sensetive subject. I am so much more than somebody who selfed harmed a little in high-school."
10,Somethings wrong with me and I don't know what,"Hey, so first at all that's the first time I talk about it and I'm not a native speaker so I apologize if I sound strange or make mistakes.
I don't know where to start, I need help and wanna know why I'm so tired of everything in my life lately. So I guess I start with my story.

I'm 22 y/o and have girlfriend since I was 16 and We are in a very happy relationship.
I'm working in a quiet boring but very good payd job, so when we where 19 my gf and I bought a house. Basically my life couldn't be better, cause when you look at what I've achieved in just 22 years I really shouldn't have any reason to feel so bad. And that's why I hate to talk about my feelings, because I don't think that my problems are that important, compared to others.
So when I was 19 my mum tried to attempt suicide and I found her bleeding out on the bathroom floor. I had to call my dad and the ambulance and my mum got put into a psychic rehabilitation center.
Eben though we talked a lot about why she did it, I never really felt the same way about my mum. Both my parents call me every week and want to visit me,, but I'm never really in the mood for it. But every time I say no I have a really bad conscience.
2 years ago my grandpa and last year my grandma died and I never really was that sad about it but now and then it really hits me in the face and I just want to be a kid again, playing at their house.

I don't know if some of you could do something with that information but I just needed to let that out.

You see, I basically should have the perfect life and shouldn't be sad at all, but some times I feel like I'm missing something, like I don't have something to look forward to. Some days I don't even see a reason to get out of bed. If I didn't have to go to work I would probably lay in my bed the whole day.
Maybe some of you have some tips for me on how to handle my situation.

Thank you for your time! &lt;3"
11,None of us are doing well,"My grandpa was temporarily let go from his job until the quarantine is lifted. He’s just used up the last of his vacation time and was just denied his unemployment claim. Seeing him and my grandma struggle financially makes my heart ache for them, and it makes me feel like an even bigger leech than I already do. Job hunting before the lockdown was hard, but now it’s a total nightmare. I don’t know what to do, none of us do. I don’t think any of us are ok."
12,I feel like I don’t deserve friends,"I’ve got trust issues, paranoia, and ADHD. I value my self worth close to zero. I don’t feel like I deserve friends, or other’s attention in general, and yet, I crave it to an obsessive amount. I’m also very shy. I’m really nervous typing this, but know that when I refer to a game or a project in this post, I’m talking about a custom tabletop roleplay, made from scratch. Please don’t make fun of me. I am also very dramatic, but it’s just who I am, I apologize. This is all on discord too, I realize this after writing it that I never specify it.

In high school, I got in an argument with some online friends that resulted in them cutting connection with me entirely. I was devastated beyond any other time prior in life, more so than my parent’s divorce. I’d rather not explain the whole story, but it mostly came down to me being a paranoid, manipulative, control freak who only wanted things my way. We were working on a sort of game together, and I was the one who started it and was in charge of it. I lost everything when they kicked me out, hundreds of hours. I believe this incident started my inability to trust people.

2 years pass and I’m in college. On a whim, I decide that I want to try something similar again. I gather new people and miraculously build the courage to try again. A couple months pass and the thing collapses, but unlike last time, these people don’t leave me. They feel bad that it failed, and stick by me. In the summer we try again, this time with more people. The new people are people I’ve known for years outside of these games, from other corners of the internet. I decided that I would get everyone I knew in one place (excluding the people that abandoned me). To this day I still regret this.

We start again and it lasts longer this time before collapsing again. Again, these people sympathize with me, and most of them stick around. As we approach the end of the year I decide to try again, and this one only lasts around 3 weeks before collapsing. Dejected, I start acting similarly to how I did years prior, angering some people. It reaches the tipping point in the second week of the new year (this year), where some people agree to leave together if I don’t do something. This breaks me, so I close everything and leave the Internet. This would be another decision I regret.

I return 3 months later, about 2 weeks before today. I resolved not to give up while I was away to think, and return, ready to start anew with my friends. They said they missed me, some even felt bad because they thought they were the reason I ran away. I thought I was ready to move on with my life, so I even invited the people who abandoned me back into my life. This would be a good decision, but only as a scapegoat.

A week later I am a mess. I’ve been caught up to speed on what happened while I was gone. After I left, the friends started their own thing, led by a friend that I am very paranoid will cause everyone to abandon me one day. Additionally, some of them joined another friend’s game. I quickly start to doubt my worth. They all have somewhere else to go now, why am I even needed? Before I left, they used the server as a place to chat. Now that they have another place to talk, they do it there instead, somewhere I am not. They have other people for these games, they don’t need me. After venting to one of them over the course of 3 days, I just flat out tell the whole group how I am feeling. My paranoia, my fear, my loneliness. And they’re all really nice. They apologize for making me scared, making me run, they missed me and felt bad for me the whole time. Despite all of this, I can’t bring myself to accept that they care about me.

The middle of the night comes, and I, once again, resolve to not give up. I cut out the people who abandoned me year prior completely, leaving no way for them to contact me ever again. I take a few days off the internet and return again, this time not making a dramatic scene, which is atypical for me. They still treat me well, and I have no reason to think they’ll ever abandon me, and yet I can’t bring myself to trust any of them. I’m not in the other servers, I constantly fear them talking about me behind my back. I’ve cut off the ability to DM me, so I can’t talk to anyone directly. I’m scared. I act confident while I work on the game’s mechanics, but I’m terrified to actually carry it out. I’m supposed to start in 2 days. I half just want to run away again and delete my account so I have no way of returning, but I’m too lonely without it. The only reason I came back is because I’m stuck at home with nobody to talk to since school was moved online. The server is a shell of it’s former self, people talk in the other ones, I’m sure of it. They only use mine to talk about stuff directly related to the game, where as they used to have casual conversations too. I know it’s my fault, I ran away, which gave them the need to go somewhere else. I messed up, and I’m scared of being alone again. I can’t bring myself to open up to any of them anymore, I’m just pretending to be confident, when in reality I’m always a few seconds from running again. Since I brought every friend I’ve ever known, I have nobody to turn to, since almost all of them are in the other servers, and I know whatever I say will end up be spread to others, since it already happened last week, even if the person had good intentions. I can’t trust that they won’t talk behind my back, I know they already do. I’m terrified, I’m no leader, and I have no confidence. I want to trust them, they all have good intentions and really do care for me, but I can’t bring myself to do it. I don’t deserve them.

I know this post is a mess, cringey, and immature. It’s just the stream of thoughts of a 19 year old boy who can’t deal with emotions well. Please don’t make fun of me, I’m just trying to live my life."
13,"My sister, a licensed therapist, needs help.","She currently works for the suicide hotline and we believe she needs help very badly. With all of her knowledge of the mental health field, she seems to see no way out of her pain and frustration with the world. She has mentioned suicide several times in the last week and won’t listen to anybody. 

We are keeping watch over her tonight, but she won’t let us get her help from anybody. She thinks she needs to keep working and that work is the only thing keeping her sane. 

My parents are considering calling the police to take her in if she won’t go voluntarily. I’ve never posted or even read this subreddit before so I don’t know if this is the right place for it, but I just need an opinion of how to treat the situation of a mental health professional who is in this position."
14,I don't know where look for help ADHD OCPD," I have ADHD, BUT I also have OCPD ( probably) and I have been trying to get professional help but it didn't go well so far, I have been told by various psychologists that ADHD doesn't exist, and only one knew about OCPD... I don't know if I'm just having bad luck finding professional help or is just like that in my country?? 

How can I find a professional that could treat me with these two mental dissorders, I live in Europe. I don't mind traveling to seek help.

Where can I find an expert/center in ADHD+OCPD?"
15,Lack of Excitement,"Anyone else feel a complete lack of excitement when something great happens in your life? On my 17th birthday, my parents bought me a car. It was awesome, everything I wanted at the time. They were taking pics of me with it and what not but I couldn’t feel that “holy shit I have a car now!” I just felt like nothing happened. Some might say I’m spoiled, but far from it. (Parents are very old fashioned) It’s almost as if I don’t know how to express happiness to other people. I like to dig into things like this bc there is a meaning for everything. Anyone else feel this way?"
16,CAN I VENT 2 SOMEONE,"

Gosh I feel like I have a huge cloud that reads “ANXIETY” above me everywhere I go. It’s confirmed I’m a hypochondria sufferer at 17, but I’ve been since I was a child though not as severe . There’s like almost no time of the day that I’m not thinking about my health to prevent dying or being seriously ill/disabled. I went to the ER yesterday, Seen cardiologists and had bloodwork on different occasions and I’m sure they missed something. I’m at my sisters birthday party full of my siblings and nieces and I can’t stop thinking about my heart/circulatory system/ cancer/ deadly infections. House full of pizza, wings, cake and family and I can’t come out of my anxiety shell. I haven’t said a word since I’ve been here for an hour because my personality before my life was consumed by anxiety is gone. It’s an ongoing cycle.  

Anxious thoughts ~ Depression from “being so ill at my age” ~ I eat for temporary happiness then Anxiety and depression again."
17,Stopped Lexapro Cold Turkey,"So as the title suggests I stopped taking my lexapro cold turkey. The reason doing so is that I wanted to experience psychedelics (shrooms to be specific) anyways, I decided I was going to not take them for a day to allow myself to be able to trip (SSRI’s tend to block or mute the effects of a trip). I was able to get some mushrooms (haven’t tripped yet) and a few days went by and I realized I was starting to feel good, i was feeling more emotion, my penis is once again finally working overtime hallelujah (ssri make your pp soft and sex less enjoyable) the best part is I’m starting to feel a real sense of happiness it’s like I would hear jokes before and laugh because logical I knew it was funny but now it gets me to legitimately laugh and feel good. Anyways, I’ve been reading up on ssri discontinuation syndrome and am curious as to whether it doesn’t effect some people at all, I’ve noticed I’m slightly more anxious lately but that’s probably because lexapro does help with generalized anxiety and since I’ve stopped taking it that might explain. I’ve heard of people getting brain zaps, irritability, nausea, headaches, you name it, yet it’s been 144 hrs (6 days) and I feel completely fine I notice they occasionally shift in my mood but it’s not by any means uncontrollable, so one of my questions is has anyone else quit cold turkey and had success, the second question is since lexapro is 99% out of your body in 72 hrs and I’m feeling fine do you think I’m in the clear? Is it possible I’m just some lucky ass dude who gets a free pass back to feeling life again without any shitty consequences? Also forgot to mention I was on 20mg lexapro the highest dose. 

TL;DR 
I stopped taking lexapro 20mg cold turkey and it’s been six days, I haven’t experienced any ssri discontinuation syndrome symptoms and am wondering if I’m out of the clear"
18,Sister (F22) with depression is dating a meth addict. She is very secretive and I am the only one she tells things to in my family. How do I respectfully tell her she needs to get out while still getting my point across and keeping her trust?," 

I should start this off by saying I have a close family. My parents, sister, brothers and I all remain pretty close despite us growing up. My sister is really the only one that keeps things regarding her personal life somewhat of a secret. She has depression and at one point told my mom that she was suicidal. Reasonably, my mom went into helicopter parent mode pretty quickly. Ever since then she has been even more guarded and secretive.

She started dating this guy, lets call him Brad, about 8 months ago and at first it was great. I liked the fact that she wasn't alone anymore and felt I didn't have to worry about her mental health as much anymore. They spent a lot of time together and ended up moving in together pretty quickly.

On Valentine's Day she called me very upset and told me she needed to talk to someone. She said he had been acting increasingly obsessive with things like religion and conspiracy theories over the last couple weeks and contributed this to him casually using Adderall.

She hadn't heard from him all day or the night before and was worried so she called his best friend. The friend had his location and turns out Brad was high out of his mind in his car in a parking lot a few cities over. She drove his car back to their place with him and went to pick up his car the next day. He told her he went to meet his dealer to try and score some Adderall but he didn't have enough money on him so he settled with the next best thing the dealer had, meth. He claims this was the first time he tried meth, but has told her he has been in rehab (not sure for what) once before.

She told him he had to go to rehab right away or else the relationship was over. He checked into a 30 day program, but only because she wanted him to.

Once he got out everything seemed to be going fine. A week and a half later, she calls me, again, upset. She woke up from a nap to him gone without a trace. When she asked him where he was, he lied about getting his car fixed and going to an AA meeting (during Coronavirus). I hadn't been able to talk to her to follow up because every time I called, he was around and would interject into our phone conversations.

Today, she tells my whole family that she is pregnant. The baby was conceived before she caught him high on meth and she was torn about whether or not to keep it. She had an abortion appointment scheduled for early March (when he was in rehab), but he convinced her to wait. Due to Coronavirus, everything was shut down by the time he got out (late March). She said they just recently decided to keep it and this is her reason for telling my family so late (she is 15 weeks).

She says she told him if she catches him using any type of substance (even alcohol) that he will not see the baby and their relationship is over. I find this hard to believe as she still has not left, even after his sketchy stint 2 weeks after rehab. I followed up about it and she claims that he wasn't out doing drugs, because she drug tested him when he got back. The fact that she even has to have drug tests laying around the house ""just in case"" is beyond me.

I know she desperately needs out of this relationship before this kid is born and I don't want my niece or nephew to have an addict father and that kind of lifestyle. I'm worried about her mental health if she leaves, but I'm sick of walking on eggshells and acting like I like this guy. I am the only person in my family who she feels she can confide in about her personal relationship with Brad (the bad parts at least). How can I convince her to leave while keeping her trust and without sounding condescending?

TLDR; Sister (F22) with depression is dating a meth addict and she just told me she is pregnant. How can I tell her she needs to get out of the relationship and is ruining her life (and unborn baby's) without breaking her trust?"
19,Drunken clarity ?,"I've had one of the worst years of my life since this time last May. I went through a very rough breakup earlier that year, which I blame my mental health (anxiety, stress, depression, and eventual burnout after completing two minors on top of my major) for causing, while I still managed to graduate from university at the top of my class with a stellar resumè, but after me and my friends spread across the globe I became extreme depressed. I began having regular panic attacks that were what I call severe, as my eyes would begin to shake and quiver, my hands would lock up to the point I couldn't dial the phone to call my mom (my main support), and it was a struggle to even drive myself to my local counselor from my parents house. I took a semester off because my anxiety was so bad before returning to grad school, then once I started I had to take medical leave because I couldn't balance two jobs and school at once (one job I hated but it paid for school and my tuition, one job I loved and paid for my rent and introduced me to a new group of people that I fit in with). Idk why this took me so long to get to the point, but sometimes when I drink, I can pin point the exact moment that I broke down completely, but when I'm sober, I can't make sense of it as if I can't remember it. This happens with other situations too. If I get in big fights with my parents, which has happened a lot during quarantine, I go to my room, have a few glasses of wine and can make complete sense of why I'm upset or why I'm triggered to be, but the next morning, I can't make any sense of why I felt that way or what I wanted to even say to my parents to convey how I feel or felt. It's like a subconscious block of my emotions. Is this normal?"
20,I'm not sure what's real,I always have this feeling that I'm lying to myself about having certain symptoms of mental disorders just for attention and just to make myself feel better about being a failure but I also feel like I'm lying about lying to myself and it just doesn't stop. I feel manipulative saying anything about how I feel and it even feels weird typing this out what he hell is wrong with me
21,Identify my father’s issues :( help,"My father fell from a height while working at a construction site about 25 years ago, breaking his legs. He could walk again after surgery and a month of treatment in hospital. However, ever since then he has been getting what I believe to be panic attacks. He described it as a tightening feeling in the chest, coupled with breathlessness and a feeling of wanting to escape and jump off the window. He said these didn’t happen as often before but now these episodes can come about a few times a week, usually as he is going to bed/asleep and triggered by frustration about not being able to remember a person’s name in his memory. 

My father had an angioplasty and stent insertion surgery 3 years ago and he is diabetic. I don’t know if these can be the culprits. I feel overwhelmed and helpless - he seems averse to going to a psychiatrist and google symptoms research hasn’t been helpful either.

Really appreciate it if someone can tell me what is it that has been plaguing him...😕❤️"
22,I don’t feel anything.,"I’ve (29/F) been stuck in the house with my younger brother (24/M) during this quarantine and it’s apparent now more than ever how different we are. He feels everything so loudly and is constantly in tune with exactly how he’s feels. We got into a fight the other day and I just turned off afterward. He wanted to talk, wanted to know how I felt. I didn’t know how to explain to him that I didn’t feel anything. I don’t even know how to explain it to myself, honestly. Whenever I get overwhelmed, it’s like my brain completely disconnects. My past therapists would always ask what I was thinking when I zoned out and I would tell them “nothing.” Not as avoidance, but because there was literally nothing in my head. No thoughts. No monologues. Nothing. 

I’m not off like that all the time, but I never feel fully “on” either. My brother keeps telling me to look inward and work on whatever is wrong, but I don’t know what’s wrong. I didn’t even know my mother had been emotionally abusing me until I saw my first therapist at 26. I don’t know how to translate that knowledge into fixing my brain. I haven’t found a therapist that understands. I don’t know what to do."
23,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but here goes. I’ve been feeling worthless lately and feel like I don’t deserve the life I have at all.","I feel like I am pretty worthless. And don’t really deserve the life I have.

I don’t really know where to start, I’m on the younger end (15) and feel as though everything I have and have gotten throughout my life I feel like I just, don’t deserve it.

 I feel as though i am lazy and tired all the time and it makes me feel like  I have had so many opportunities to do good things but I just can’t seem not to screw everything up. I’m not that social and whenever I am in a social situation (school etc.) I find that I accidentally always make or say the wrong thing and manage to mess the conversation up.

 I just can’t seem to get many things right in my life and feel worthless as a result, I just can’t be bothered man, this life really fucking sucks and even though I can have my good days I always seem to end back up here, at square one, feeling like trash.

I feel as though I have all these things, these opportunities and yet, I still can’t find motivation or reason to pursue, anything really. I feel as if as soon as I try to climb out of this whole of worthlessness i always seem to fall back down and end up here, over, and over again. 

So I’ve come to here, to see if anyone has been through this and can help me maybe find my way back out of this, for real, and to find new reason to pursue things.

So reddit, how does one get out of this hole and how does one stay out of it? I just can’t find a way to do it, and always end up back at square one. 

Apologies for the wall of text, just felt like I needed to find someone else to talk to about this. I’m scared someday it’ll happen and I’ll never be able to get out of the hole ever again."
24,I have no clue what to do,"Sorry this is going to be long but I just REALLY need to vent. Hears some background information your going to need to know for the story to make sense. I have a younger brother age 17. When he was in the 6th grade he would cry for my mother to take him out of school so she homeschooled him. It turns out a teacher punished the whole class for something only a couple of students did and he took it really personally. When he was 13 we moved across the country from where we were born the place where all our family and friends live. When he was 14 he was diagnosed with general anxiety and was put on medicine and got therapy. He stopped going to therapy because she only would play uno with him and practice breathing techniques. Since we moved to a new state my mother thought it would great for him to try and go back to school but ot was a huge mistake he came home yelled at her and cried because he had no where to sit in the cafeteria. Two years later we got him into one of those Waldorf private schools but he refused to go. During this time he cut off all his friends from back home and stopped playing online games with him and instead replaced them with a girl from a different country. They sent packages to each other. Met in person 3 times very thing seemed to be going good. He stopped talking his medicine, was starting to talk to the fish store workers, and was even planning on getting a job there. He seemed to be doing really good. Then one day in Dec he spent the hole day sobbing like violently. We knew it had to do with the girl. I had assumed shs died because of the way he was acting. He wouldn't tell us what was going on but just kept telling my mom to call her parents. So she did but her parents didn't want to get into their teenage daughters business. This went on for a week him sobbing all day until my mom came home and then would bother her until she called the girls parents. Then we found out the reason he was acting like this is because the girl blocked him on snapchat. We thought after Dec it would all be over but no in Jan she unblocked him but would not talk to him a lot and he got worse. He got violent. He would yell at my mom telling her that if she doesn't make her come back he'll kill himself, he hits and throughs stuff around. We took him to a new doctor and he's on knew medicine but no other places take his insurance for therapy except for the old one. This really didn't do much. Two months ago he tried to fist fight my father because he stepped in and yelled at him because he was calling my mom stupid and breaking stuff. Last month he said that he'd kill us all if she doesn't come back. He blames us for him not having friends even though we encourage him to go out and try to make friends even if its only baby steps but he refuses. He told me that if someone had a gun to my head and the girls he would choose me to die. Two weeks ago he a 17 almost 18 year old MAN punched our younger 14 year old little sister in the face because she told him there is nothing we can do to get the girl back. He left her slightly brusied almost broked her glasses. He only said sorry because our mother forced him to. Last week he lightly knocked on my bedroom door at 3am opened it saw I was asleep stood there for a second then left. So I wmet to his room to see whats up but all he said was never mind but I cant shake the feeling he was going to try to kill me or rape me. I told my mother and even it creeped her out. Idk what to do but this whole mess is stressing me out!! We called a local mental hospital but all the youth spots were all filled up."
25,"Ex-Boyfriend with Depression, trying to find the answers he couldn't give me (r.i.p. my virginity) Coming of age. Interesting read (I'd say)","Hi guys, how are you? I hope everyone is doing well with the covid situation

So in November, I met this guy(20) in my uni(famous art uni). I'm 18. We were friends and I loved spending time with him, he was hilarious. He was a massive dork, awkward, but also was able to assert respect and amazing at speaking in public etc. Also, amazing, incredible artist, like truly. He was the class technician because he was so good at computer stuff and blender n stuff (he would love to help people) I found that endearing. Physically, he was not the usual guy I go for, he was, in a way, hypnotizing. He would walk hunched over, scruffy hair, really deep set green eyes, angled eyebrows, **beautiful** lips, just honestly different than anything you have ever seen. A strange, special beauty, but much more profound in my opinion than your typical run of the mill handsome guy, you know? I don't think I'll ever find someone so special like that

After a week or so of being friends, Uni assessment came along and he told me that he was going to fail, due to his depression. At this point I had some feelings for him, not too much. I decided to help him, and spent 2 days in the library etc helping him. (it took me to have to go physically to his house to get him to go to the library) He just never was able to properly accept help. He passes and we continue being friends, not long until we were involved romantically. 

**Things he did that affected me:** In the beginning, he was more attentive about my feelings, but it didn't take long for me to feel that he couldn't empathise with me at all. He would talk a lot about his exes, when confronted about this, he would get mad and say that ""I want a partner who I can talk about my life with, I don't want to feel like I have to censor myself"" which made me feel completely invalidated. I developed anxiety, partially because Uni was stressful, mostly because subconsciously, I knew that he wasn't right for me and it was manifesting in panic attacks. One time, Ieft class, in front of everyone, and was obviously having a panic episode because my friend was helping me. At lunch, I went to him for comfort, and he pushed me back saying that he had left a project to last minute and had to finish it then ""sorry haha"". I felt so terrible, he was the only person who could have made me feel better (apart from myself I guess) (I'm studying in foreign country to mine so I am alone). He would constantly call me a Bitch jokingly, I told him that I didn't like that and he never completely stopped doing it. We did a class project together, and when we presented it, he completely monopolized the conversation and did not let me speak at all, even if I was part of the project too. This made me feel so useless and insecure, men always talk over me and I hate it, so this made me feel so powerless. Looong rants about weird things were common in him. In the end stages, when I would try to have a conversation with him, he would open his laptop and play minecraft.  I felt like if I wanted him to do something caring, I would have to **heavily** imply it, if it wasn't for me doing so, he would rarely do anything out of the normal to make me feel loved. 

**Why did I keep going out with him after all this? It took me a while, but I realized that I was the scapegoat child in a very mentally unstable family.** I received abuse on most levels. In a weird way I guess I kinda saw my dad in him, and wanted to help him and try to avoid him turning out like my dad. I would tidy his room, cook for him, do his laundry, try to get him to stop smoking, etc, but he would just push me further away if I tried to help him. 

Oh, also, I lost my virginity to him, something very sacred to me, as I thought that we would last for long. Really early on he would talk about wanting to spend ""forever"" with me, discussing baby names lol. **I was used to dealing my whole life with people with mental health issues so I figured that I could just do the same.** Problem: **he said that he was taking the highest dose of antidepressants he had ever taken, so the side effect to that was problems in bed. I knew it wasn't me, but these were my first serious sexual experiences so I couldn't help to feel insecure. To keep him ""interested"" I started pushing him to be more and more aggressive, which ended up with me having loads of bruises**. I am a ""giver"" in bed, so I just accepted it and wanted him to be happy. After a while he said that he didn't like that kind of stuff anymore, so I just was lost and didn't know what to do anymore. I guess I just felt like we had to have sex, and give him my virginity because if I didn't then he wouldn't ever finish and I'd feel like a failure. 

So I lost myself, would stop doing things I loved, slept at his place for way too many nights, got burned out, **constantly trying to help him, clean for him etc, giving him everything I could give and I started to become bitter at this because he would not give a shit, or couldn't give a shit. He didn't just not care, but get pissed at me** if I tidied his cave of a room etc. I kept thinking that everyone deserves love, and that I just couldn't quit on him because he had a mental illness that made him act certain ways. But I don't know to what extent it was depression and to what extent just not liking me enough.

**His weird emotional situation:** So he stated many times weird things, **like he had not cried in years,** he calls his parents by their first name, not being to express/explain his feelings. **Watching other people to understand their emotions**, thinking he wasn't an emotional person. I found this weird because he had many old self harm scars, so he obviously did feel stuff deeply, not to mention, his drawings were full of deep, dark emotion. **TLDR he took a bunch of LSD and ""realized"" he was an emotional person, and that he was convinced up until then that he wasn't.** I think that that really affected him, but never really told anyone because he was scared to be judged/assume he's a psychopath or something. **I honestly think that he suffered from some sort of Alexithymia. Not just induced by maybe Emotional Blunting due to his antidepressants.** If you read the 3rd paragraph, you could see some things that happened due to this tha affected our relationship.

**How did it. end?** **He broke up with me. The day before my most important uni interview**, late at night, forcing me to spend 150pounds on supermarket clothes/shoes etc for my interview and having to sleep at a friends place (I lived really far away). I was so hurt. He did not give a shit about me.

Few days later I go to his to pick up my stuff, I try to get some closure, he talks in circles, doesn't look at me in the eye, said time and time again that he loved me, but he couldn't be with me. Randomly mentions his ex visiting him? Idk if it was true, but really fucking inconsiderate while you other exgf is crying in front of you trying to understand wtf happened. Days before he was talking about baby names, and suddenly, boom, Bye bye. He would constantly throughout the relationship say/imply that I was better than him because (sounds cocky idk but can't put it any other way) I am out of his league. On paper, maybe yeah superficially, but I hate jocks, I like different people, unique people, and he was so special, I'd never met someone like him. I'm another pretty blonde, there are billions of those. He was a force to be reckoned with, an artist, a true artist. So no, *he* was out of my league. But I'm saying this because in part, I feel like he just observed me in his life. Like I was there, he knew he was gonna lose me, so why try. He would say that he loved me a lot, that he had been in relationships where he loved the person and not, and that he certainly loved me, but his actions went the other direction. 

He was completely unable to explain his emotions on **ANY** level, nor explain to me why he had broken up with me. He told me ""you need to find closure on your own"". He kicked me out. So pissed, I sent him a bitchy message saying along the lines of ""You know what? well your loss, you should be grateful to be with me ANYWAY""  ugh, I am so petty sometimes, I am disgusted by that message, but I was so confused, he was so inconsiderate. 

A few weeks later, he's failing uni, gonna get kicked out, I talk to my tutor, explain the situation, which he had no idea about, and urges me to get him to send x emails to x people and do stuff so he didn't fail. I felt guilty that he was failing because maybe he was doing so because I was shit and affected his life. I gathered some friends and goto his place, they do the talking, help him send the stuff, which ended with him having more time to finish his projects (which he never did) and got kicked out

**FINAL DRAMA some time later after**  I'm at a uni interview for a scholarship. I'm sitting in the canteen for a while making time to see a Tinder date later. **I'm on IG, and on his private account he posts a picture of 2 nooses with the caption ""just can't decide which one would look better on me"" and a poll for people to vote.** **I. FREAKED. THE FUCK. OUT.** I message all our friends and everyone is concerned, I start having a mega panic attack, in public, I wonder my way with no direction, trying to find a nurse or something. **I somehow find the student union and talk to a mental health advisor as I could. She advises me to contact my university to call him or email him concerning his post. In part, I felt guilty because of the nasty message I sent him after the break up.** I ask him if he's okay, just replies with ""yh"" so I freak even more, he doesn't respond to anyone in 24+ hours. I was convinced that he had done something. I cried that whole night. Imagining where in his house he'd do it, his dad walking in, fuck man. It was hell. I thought that I could have had something to do with it, and that he did anything it was my fault. 

HURRAY! He hasn't done anything.... I figure this out because when I check, he had blocked me. I think he was pissed at me because I contacted the university regarding his post. 

What now? idk he's always the first checking my social media. I never got closure, I felt like I was giving him everything, he gave me so little, (as much as he could maybe) and *he* still broke up with me. I may have been too intense for him. Other girls would let him take drugs, be self deprecating etc, but I would call him out on this and he got pissed at me. What have I done wrong? How can I avoid this in the future? How do you think he was feeling? Why did he break up with me?.... :,("
26,I am not my childhood trauma (making improvements),"So, it's taken me years to finally understand this. I used to let it pull me down, I used to let it define who I am, but now I'm making it into why I want to be better.

So, to put it simply, I grew up in a home where apparently it was fine to degrade your children mentally and emotionally, and almost killing your child results in no punishment. (I was that child)

I used to let that define me. I was afraid of becoming like my parents, I was afraid of even being myself because I was belittled for that as I was growing up. I began having issues with my identity (I still struggle with that, though) and I would mope about, feeling sorry for myself and wanting others to also feel sorry for me. Now, I want to show off what I can be. 

Lots of people have helped me along the way to make this possible. Now, I'm not fully healed and I don't think I ever will be, but I'm currently at my best mentally and I've never thought I could feel...proud of myself? I'm starting to grow into my own person even though that should have been happening years ago. 

I'm currently 19 years old, it's been about 10 years since the worst of the issues have happened, and now I'm looking forward to the 10 years ahead of me. I never thought I would ever be able to say that.

I might update this in some way if this gets enough people asking, I guess."
27,Something on my mind,"I dont really know how else to say it without sounding like some pitiful guy with some parental issues, which i dont doubt i have parental issues ive been in cps 2 times already, not anymore since im an adult now, basically my parents, more specifically my mother has not taught me a damn thing about life, everything i do know has been either my dad a little bit but mostly google, me and my mother have argued non stop since i was 10, my sister is actually more of a friend or mom to me than my mom ever was, when i was sick it was my sister who put herself at risk to take care of me, but my mom, she fights with me or did fight with me since im finally out of the house now, its just, my mom thought about me as nothing but an annoyance, every time i desperately tried getting some attention from her it was just a ""uh-huh"" or she interrupted me to talk to someone else, it makes me feel worthless, though i know im not worthless and dont have any intentions or thoughts of suicide i dont know why its on my mind, im a grown ass man and dont even have to worry about dealing with her every day anymore, what was it that made her hate me so god damn much, was it the 6 packs of cigarettes she smoked a day? Was it that now i existed she had to deal with the teachers questioning why i smelled so deeply of tobacco? Was it because my existence is based entirely on my dad being too shy to grab a condom in front of the baby sitter? I don't know, i guess not having my own mother be the one to nurse me back to health or to be a shoulder to cry on kind of fucked me up, not only that but the access i had to gore as a kid? I dont know how else to end the post so ill just stop here."
28,I really want perspective on what it feels like to fall under this,What is it like to fall under psychosis. How does it happen. What are obvious signs that you are falling into it?
29,Money worries,"Im 17 and I don’t have any money. Should I be worried? Do most people have thousands saved already? I feel really terrified about it and I feel like I should make the most money possible to be able to feel safe or ill panic. Is money more important than happiness? How can I feel comfortable? I think that if I have a job that pays under 80k a year, id always feel so scared. I dont know how to find a job that makes me happy and pays enough."
30,"My life is a russian roulette, but six bullets are loaded.","Literally everything bad that can happen to someone happens to me and my Mother, Abusive husband? Check. Losing your job? Check. Both of us get Chronic illnesses? Check. Depression? Check. No money to buy medications that my mom needs to take? Check. Suicidal thoughts? Check.
And guess what happens the one day she's feeling better? Today my mom was feeling good, ""happy"" you could say, but a friend of hers needed help to get her husband to a hospital, since he was infected with the Covid-19. And my Mother did not think twice she got up 05:00 am got dressed and called a car from one these famous private driver apps. The car arrived they got in and went to the hospital, when they arrived at their destination my mom and her friend rushed to get the man inside. The driver seeing they were distracted and in panic mode, stole my Mother's cellphone and drove away. Her cellphone was the only source of entertainment she had and the asshole stole it. 
And since we have no money she can't buy another not only that, that cellphone contained the dates to appointments with judges and documents she needed to finnaly get retired something that in my country, is absurdly hard and bureaucratic. It also contained dates to important medical appointments and all sorts of medical documents that she needed, medical referrals, biopsy exams and many more. 
Nothing we try to build in our lives lasts, everything crumbles to the ground before we even finish and it's  so painful, and frustrating because we have no one to rely upon other than ourselves, no one's here to tell us things are gonna be ok and It doesn't matter how much we try to fix our lives it just doesn't work. And the worst of all? My Mother did not deserve this life at all maybe i did but not her, she's kind and caring does her best to help other people without wanting anything in return, she doesn't deserve this and i feel so guilty because i can't do anything to help her feel better. My father used to say i was useless and he was completely right, she's probably going to kill herself before i can make her proud of me.
Does this sound like a life worth living to you?"
31,"Has anybody experienced going from a very patient, gentle person, to an angry person with a short fuse?","Depression, anxiety, ADD. Adult male in my 40's.

I've always kind of prided myself on self-control. I've always been the guy to stop fights. I'm not meek, but I've always been pretty gentle. I've never been the type to lose my temper. But for the past couple of months, that's been changing. 

A few weeks ago I tried to squeeze past a couple in a store. They said ""excuse me!"" so I turned around. When I saw that they weren't wearing masks I absolutely went off on them in the middle of a store. Cussing, you name it. The guy was considerably bigger than me but part of me really wanted to tear into him. If my wife hadn't been there I almost certainly would have pushed it farther. 

My wife has been dealing with her own mental health issues, along with menopause. It's been rough. About every four days or so she'll just start picking at me. Eventually I'll get angry and usually go outside to cool off. But the other night she followed me out and I lost it. I got in her face and dared, no, begged her to hit me. I had no intention of hitting her back but I was fired up. I chucked my glasses into the street and just started pacing. Almost hyperventilating. It took a lot to calm myself down and eventually I ended up in tears. 

These are just two examples but there are others. I find myself wishing for a physical altercation with somebody. That's not like me at all. 

I'm not feeling homicidal but I am feeling violent. I don't know where this is coming from and I have no insurance or money to see a doctor. I do take anti-depressants and a few other meds but I've been taking them for years and never felt like this. There haven't been any changes to my prescriptions and no changes to my diet that I can think of. 

I don't like who I'm becoming."
32,Why is it so hard to cut out a toxic person from your life?,"I've recently decided to rid my life of a pretty toxic person. I've been somewhat blind to the red flags, but I see them clearly now, and i think it's time for this to happen.

I've tried talking to my father about his behavior, but he seems unable, or unwilling, to change his ways
Yesterday, after him not speaking to us for about 3 weeks, I tried once more to calmly reason with him, but to no avail.

Both my mom and my little brother also suffer from his noxious character, and ive risen to the ocasion, and have sort of become the leader of our little liberation. I'm finally being a man. Finally saving her from him, like I always said I would. We're now packing things to move out. They are just as, if not more, relieved than I am about this. Finally, peace.

We've had this idea on our minds for quite a while now, and have almost come close to doing it a few times before. But while every day I get more hyped about it, at night I get my doubts. It's mostly pity for him. What is he gonna do without us? Am I being a terrible son? What if we try just one more time? I hate to see him sad, even just the though of it gives me grief. I still love him, he's my Dad. But he doesn't treat us like family, calls us ungrateful bums, has never supported us, only beaten us down. It has to happen, we have to leave, or he will just consume us.

But it's just so hard.

Why is it so freaking difficult!? Why do I feel sorry for this retched man? Am I doing the right thing, starting a new family without him?"
33,dealing with random anxiety,"i’m normally a nervous person if i don’t have a plan or things are out of my control, but i wouldn’t label myself as someone with anxiety all the time or thought about having to go to a doctor or get a therapist. recently i’ve been freaking out about everything i (F21) am currently a college student so beside being stressed and anxious about school and my studies all the time i find myself freaking out about my parents or people i love. for example my parents came to visit but i was in my room all day due to class and multiple projects due tonight and i barely spoke to them. as they were driving away i got so overwhelmed with the thought of them getting into a bad accident or some trouble while i’m not with them (and i haven’t really lived with them since i was 18) and i find this happens very often now. any tips dealing with moments like these ? i get so overwhelmed i start to cry and need to catch my breath and need to remind myself that i’m just thinking about the worst case scenario and i want to stop 
sorry this is weird and long !
any comments welcome !"
34,Do I really have Social Anxiety? What do I tell my Doctor?,"14F
I just got diagnosed with Social Anxiety and Severe Episodic Depression today, and I can definetly see why but not everything is clicking for me.  I'm reading the triggers for Social Anxiety and almost none of these apply to me, I like being the center of attention, I like having people call me, I raise my hand constantly in class, I dont sweat, I dont have panic attacks, and I don't tremble. If anything, if I'm not called or I'm not a major part of the conversation I get kind of pissed and really sad, it feels like the people hate my guts, and that they find me boring and extremely annoying, so I cut that person off before they leave me. I don't self isolate cause I'm scared of embarassing myself, I self isolate so I dont ruin my friendships with being annoying. I hate my guts, and I can't feel good about myself without having people like me, whether it be them letting me have a sip of their coffee, walking with me to school, I feel great about the relationship until they give me a wrong look, or I think they're talking aboht me, or they don't agree to a plan, and I start sobbing my eyes out. Im playing mental gymnastics feeling good one day cause it feels like someone wants to be my friend, and contemplating suicide the next hour cause I feel worthless. Am I just a extroverted person with Social Anxiety? Is that even possible? I dont mean to offend anyone I'm still really new to this, and I'm not looking for a diagnosis on here, but is it worth telling my psychiatrist I dont think she got the mark? I can feel severely depressed for a couple days sure but the moment someone tells me that I'm a good friend of theirs I feel great. How do I tell her respectfully in two weeks that I think she's not exact, I know the treatment is what matters, but I dont want to have the wrong problems helped with, I dont need to really manage my need to calm down in social situations, I need someone to help me stop jumping from furious anger one hour cussing someone out, to being clingy or suicidal the next. I just need someone to tell me if they can relate to this and if it is all just symptoms of Social Anxiety and just push me to some guidance on what I should tell my psychiatrist in two weeks. I feel frustrated cause she only  heard suicidal ideaition and self isolation and anger and didn't listen to anything else I had to say"
35,How to act normal in public when you're feeling very much not normal?,"I've also shared this to r/Advice to see if anyone there had any help to offer.

In the past 6 months I started going to therapy and we're working with the current diagnosis of depression and maybe some sort of OCD. I've always gotten into moods where I don't want people looking at me or otherwise acting like they're aware of my presence, and it's gotten worse lately. It's almost like when I'm alone I feel like I need to be around others to know I'm real, but as soon as another person is present the last thing I want is to be acknowledged by them. I've chewed some of my fingers raw. I keep biting my lip. I'm picking at my skin again and it's made scars on my legs. My whole body feels weird. I'm not sure I can describe what I mean by ""weird"" except that I feel physically fundamentally put together wrong. I keep thinking about breaking my teeth or biting my fingers off. My fingers and teeth feel wrong. I'm not as much worried about me being contaminated (though I am because I've had sex) as I am about every other person and every other thing I encounter being contaminated. It stresses me out so much when people don't follow the arrows on the floor in the supermarket it makes me want to scream. How hard is it to follow an arrow? I want to stop taking all my meds, but last time I stopped taking something it was when my PCP told me it was safe to stop taking gabapentin cold turkey and I experienced pretty bad withdrawal symptoms for 3 days before she put me back on it. I'm just tired of needing medications to not be in pain. I want to have a body that functions normally.

How, when you're feeling all of this, do you behave normally in public? I feel like people can tell there's something fundamentally wrong with me just by looking."
36,Stopping Medication,I talked to my doctor about tapering off my depression/anxiety medication. Now that I've been off of it for a couple weeks I have pretty bad lows...even contemplated suicide. I don't want my mental health to be defined by medication but I also can't keep on feeling this way... I decided to stop taking my medication because I felt robotic and it played a role in my break up (me being emotionless). I guess I'm just wanting some advice or if anyone else has been through this? The medication was Paroxetine if that helps at all.
37,Nocturnal Panic Attacks?,"Hi! I have suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for a long time now including nocturnal panic attacks. It was way less before and they even stopped for a little while, but now they’re back. As I’m falling asleep I wake up panicking and feeling super unreal/detached so I involuntarily start scratching my face to “feel real” as I can feel the scratches burning. I went to therapy and I can control my anxiety and panic attacks during the day, but when I have to go to sleep at any time of the day (I’ve always avoided taking naps due to this reason, I can’t sleep when it’s bright outside anyway it gives me anxiety). I have no idea what to do! I’m so tired and sleepless, I just wanna sleep in peace. I feel so alone. :("
38,Antidepressant/Mood stabilizer alternatives?,"I’ve been depressed since the start of puberty, and I’m also one of those people who get shitty side effects from medication, but Prozac makes me uplifted and sociable. Is there anything else that can make me more high energy that isn’t a prescribed pill?"
39,Am I just freaking out or I might really have BPD?,"I love reading about mental illnesses(don't ask me why, but I litterally read the whole DSM-5 for fun?) and a few weeks ago, I realised that I have quite a lot of symptoms for BPD (I already have ADHD with impulsivity and ODD,anxiety and depression). I wana know also if it's possible for me to get this diagnosis even though I'm not an adult? Can I have a psychologist or something to DM me just so I can be certain that I'm not freaking out for nothing."
40,I'm spiraling,"I'm getting so depressed. My anxiety, my PTSD, and my autism is all just overwhelming. I relapsed into cutting again. My self-esteem is at a top 3 low. I'm having suicidal thoughts. I just don't want to make this difficult situation harder on my family by bringing my mental issues into this. I just don't want to be a burden"
41,please just leave a comment,just please let me know someone is there and I'm not completely alone let me know I'm not drowning by myself
42,"I don't know if depression is real. I don't enjoy existing for tangible reasons,","I don't understand how someone can have their depression treated if they can't change the circumstances that make them depressed. I went to a therapist for a couple of visits, complete waste of time. I hate myself because I'm worth hating. I look forward to dying because living sucks. How is medicine or talking going to change that."
43,memory issues?? please help,"so please let me know if there's a better place for this, but here goes (TW for mentions of suicidal ideation and mental hospitals)

(disclaimer: I know that it takes more than just some people talking on the internet and speculating things is not the same as a diagnosis, I just wanted to ask this because I don't know how I'd even begin to try and find out what's going on, and due to everything that's happening right now, I don't want to swamp my doctor any more than she already is.)

so basically I was having a conversation recently that reminded me of this, and after essentially word vomiting to a close friend about it, I figured that I should actually probably look into what's going on (if there is anything that I don't already know)

ever since I was young (like, 5th grade, so when I was around 9 or 10) I would have these moments where things would be normal and fine and dandy, but then the next thing I knew, I had either missed half of the lesson or I would be in a different place with no memory of what happened in between. for these times I only really remember it happening in school – I assume that's because our brains (iirc) tend to remember the bad memories more than the good or neutral ones, and I was severely bullied during this time, and can easily say that it has been the most miserable, scared, and hopeless I've ever felt before or since then. my grandmother, whom I was extremely connected to, also passed away around these years, which led to me falling into a deep depressive spiral and told my parents about the thoughts I was having at night involving things like my dad's BB(?) gun, kitchen knives, etc. I was admitted to a mental hospital for a few weeks, and iirc started taking antidepressants and/or anti-anxiety medications.

this is also around the time where I remember time being really weird pretty often. like it was either much slower or much faster than normal. this still often happens to me as well as the missing parts of my memory, and the latter concerns me because it occasionally happens while I'm driving, and I have no idea when it'll happen. nothing bad has come of it yet (no crashes or traffic pictures, etc have come up related to those moments), but there's a small part of me that worries that something might happen eventually.

another thing that happens that I think may be related is that very often, I'll be in the middle of a conversation, and I'll just forget what I was saying, or even what the entire conversation was about, and it happens even when there's nothing there to distract me. it's like a sort of fog just passes through my head and it's all just... gone. sometimes if I ask what we were talking about I'll end up remembering, but more often than not, I just can't remember.

now, I know that there are times where there are parts of different mental disorders that may overlap with each other, so here are some things that I have been clinically diagnosed with that I believe may possibly play a role in this: depression (I don't remember if the doctor said it was genetic or if it was due to my biological mother abusing substances while she was pregnant with me, but he said I'll always have it to some degree for the rest of my life), seasonal affective disorder, anxiety (includes panic attacks), ADHD (diagnosed as ADD at the time, but the DSM has changed and doctors consider it an outdated term) 

**TLDR:** I regularly experience what I would describe as time distortion, bursts of amnesia, and brain fog, all possibly related to or stemming from childhood emotional trauma

I really appreciate any feedback, and thank you for taking the time of your day to read this mess \^\^"""
44,Ever Tried Psilocybin? *NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO TRY* My Experience Trying,"So I'll give some context. I'm clinically diagnosed as schizoaffective bipolar type 1 and have been on meds for the past 5 years stable. Have seen the psych every 3 months for 5 years, have never missed a dose, have never experienced a symptom since getting on meds, and have been on 10mg of olanzapine for the duration of the 5 years. Until recently, about 2 months ago the doctor wanted me to lower the dose by half so now I'm on 5mg. 

The difference is astonishing and I'm a believer in minimal meds so this works out for me. The effects of lowering the doses are as follows: 

\-Not tired all day 

\-need less sleep 

\-less foggy 

\-mentally sharper and more alert 

\-etc. (if you want more details let me know)

\*NOT A RECOMENDATION TO TRY PSILOCYBIN BELOW!\*

This post is about psilocybin so I'm not gonna go too much into detail about the meds. So recently I've been microdosing 0.5-1.5 grams of Psilocybin every 3-4 days. Mind you the doctors or anyone else will tell you if you consume this stuff you're going to relapse and have every symptom, delusion, and voice come back to you all at once.

My experience is that after my first time trying, I'm happier, more appreciative of life, more clear and concise, better self image, and did I mention I'm happier? Lol. Anyway, no symptoms of a relapse or delusion or Mania after trying. Mind you I've taken them at least 30 or more times at this point. 

However, what I do experience is that when I stare at non moving objects for a certain period of time the visuals that you get while on psilocybin have remained. Such as that objects appear to breath and are distorted slightly. Don't read this post and think that is my schizo- acting up because anyone that takes psilocybin experiences that. I just thought I'd share my experience if this post doesn't get removed. 

I'd love for anyone curious to ask me more questions so I can elaborate more. Thanks for reading!"
45,i just want someone to love my body.,"i’m skinny but at the same time, i feel so insecure and like my body is nothing. i always want to be skinnier no matter what."
46,Work Related Anxiety,"I work at a bank as a teller, and it's the hardest job I've had. I've only worked as a teller for a little over 2 months and I make so many mistakes everyday that my anxiety gets worse and worse. I make the same mistakes a lot, which makes me feel like crap all day. My issue is that the worse my anxiety gets, the more simple mistakes I make since I'm in a constant state of fear. I don't know how to calm it down and I don't know if it's the right job for me. But I know for a fact that its 70% me and 30% the job thats causing the issue. I've already gotten in trouble for some mistakes I've made which makes me feel even worse. It's a sick cycle. It's a hard freaking job and the stress is unbelievable. I come home and think about how I forgot to verify this person or ""what if"" I did this wrong and blah blah. Its horrible. I need some advice on how to shake this because it's driving me to the point where I don't want to go to work or even just hope I get fired from making a mistake. Of course, deep down, I do not want this to occur. My anxiety just tells me otherwise. If someone who has endured this but has gotten through it please tell me how."
47,Hate the sound of consuming to an extreme level,"So I’ve been having this issue for a while but it recently has gotten worse. I hate the sound of chewing/drinking. If I can hear it, I go through this weird range of emotions. I either want to run out the door, punch you in the face, or burst out in tears. I have no idea why. My own chewing doesn’t bother me. It’s so weird. Is there a diagnosis for this, and has anyone else had it?"
48,Voice in my head,So I used to have a voice in my head telling me “it’s not real” Over and over and I was wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else? Or what it means? I usually would sing or talk to myself to block it out but it was never much of an issue.
49,how to bring up possible diagnosis with a doctor,i’ve suspected i have boarderline personality disorder for 2 years now. however last time i brought it up with a different doctor she said i definitely didn’t without me telling her why i believed i did. i’m nervous of getting written off again but i fit the criteria. how should i approach it

Here's the recent one . I'm still not sure weather to go or not because 

1 I believe my fears might be real 

2 I  think won't be understood by a psychiatrist 

3 my psychiatrist would  label me as a threat....

4 i have so many other worries and other deep and silent worries on top of those that it's killing me.... 

5 how will I express everything that's worrying me ? I really want to express everything but I doubt I can and because of other personal issues ... I don't want to ...



I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do ..."
51,Need a distraction,At the back of my mind I have another personality and I’m really good at keeping it at bay. But I saw something today that has really brought it out. I need a distraction; I don’t want it to overcome me and lose myself.

54,"Can’t find someone to help me, and I’m getting angry","I try to reach out, find someone to help. They turn me down, refer to another, who refers me to another. In the end, I get more angry, they can’t handle us."

56,Im sick mentally and it got me physically sick,So a family member of mine is dying and it’s gotten me physically sick... I need to go back to work to financially survive but won’t and I dont want to go back... I am sad and messed up mentally. I talked to my therapist and she said this part of depression is normal but I feel like it’s wrong for me to go back to work but wrong to my family to not be working... a part of me wants to call in one more day than go back on Monday and act like everything is fine although nothing is... yeah it’s weird...
57,QUITE OFTEN MY VOICES TELL ME TO KILL EVERYONE.,"everything around me feels dull,  I have no motivation to do anything.

If you have a hobby I hate you, I physically  can't get through reading, gaming or writing. 

If you have friends, I hate you. I physically have no drive or motivation to seek friends. 

I was force fed at the hospital Tuesday i don't remember anything. I dissociated and I didn't eat or drink water. They said I said everything was bland, life, food, drink, and existence itself was bland.

Now my voices say kill, because everyone else functions normally in this prison. I feel sluggish. Tired, anxious and dead while alive."
58,Severe Agitation? Help,"Hi, I have PTSD/ANXIETY/ DEPRESSION. I take Trileptal and ativan as needed. Being furloughed and being in my head has made things much worse. I'm med sensitive. I've had agitation since I'm around 13ish ....do you think I should ask my NP to switch me from ativan to valium ? Wondering if Trileptal or ativan are making me worse. I have agitation regardless if I take ativan and it usually relieves it but things like PMS will make it come back. I know valium is longer acting. All betal blockers, bp meds, SSRIS and most antipsychotics make me very agitated...also adhd meds too like strattera...tired of feeling agitated even if I sleep well, exercise, listen to music, distract myself etc...I've struggled with agitation for 16 years now and tired of it.

59,I know the difference between good and bad. I choose bad mentally but good verbally does anyone know what's wrong with me?,"Every time I think it's the complete opposite of what I say the things I say are happy and kind no body suspects a thing, but in my mind I call people names, I occasional racial slur, i will commit crimes if i have to. I actually have stolen a shirt from someone before. And I want to know what's wrong with me because I'm very young and I dont want to tell my parents to take me to a therapist just in case it's something serious."
60,I can't find joy or excitement or almost anything anymore?,"So this issue  has been slowly creeping up on me for some time, and I know I have pretty sever depression. (I've had suicidal ideations before, even so far as to having plans. I just never enacted them)

Before this whole lockdown, I couldn't really find a place where I fit in. I feel like an alien wherever I am. Work, friends, family. Everywhere. I don't feel like I belong. I've tried several times to reach out to various sources. 

Friends - in hopes that board games or social times would cheer me up.

Family - Just to talk or visit

Internet - Such as here, to vent and hope that I'm not alone.

Even now, I'm at work trying to keep my shit together, just to look normal. I know this whole covid thing has made the whole feeling like I'm on an island much worse, but I sometimes feel like I'm a step beyond that. Right now, I feel like I'm drowning, and no one cares to save me. My wife tries her damndest, and most days, does a good job. But sometimes, my brain is just better at keeping me down.

I'm afraid that I won't make it through the lockdown..."
61,Partner walked out on me... (20 male),"Hey guys - i’m new to this sub. I need help, i’m feeling mentally unwell and extremely sad right now. I need people’s opinions, and hopefully someone can point me in the right path to feel better.

On Saturday, I had a small (verbal) disagreement with my partner of 2 years. We ended up mutually apologizing and we had both “moved on”. The next morning comes and he’s packing his clothes into duffle bags and tells me he’s staying in a hotel. At first I brushed it off and wanted to give him some space. This was very out of the blue, but we’ve both had some stress on our backs lately but nothing major.

He hasn’t said a word to me since, we share an apartment together and he still hasn’t been back home. We rely on each other to survive (especially now due to COVID) and I know for a fact that I won’t be able to pay rent tomorrow. Hydro is in his name, although I pay it, rent is what I am scared to get behind on. 

It seems like my whole life is crashing down on me, my anxiety is playing games with my head and I keep telling myself i’m not good enough etc. I am slowly getting worse, each day this progresses.

While driving today I had a vision of me crashing my car into a tree, just to end it. It was scary - it was very real, terrifying, and immediately made me burst into tears. I ended up pulling off into a parking lot and had a full on panic attack. New to me... never had experienced that before.

I’ve spoken with a couple of supportive friends about this, but I really don’t feel like anything is helping and i’m getting scared for my next episode. 

He is reading my messages but is not replying - he is however talking to my friend’s saying to “make sure i’m ok”. All I want from him is to talk, a hug even... instead i’m getting ignored for 5 day straight now and it’s driving me crazy. I’ve given him space. I don’t know what he wants and there is no communication from him.

I really need support here and some guidance on what to do next. I wasn’t expecting this, we were fine up until this point and don’t fight often. Sorry if this post was **all over the place**, i’m not thinking very well right now and just need help :("
62,What is going on with my BiL?,"My brother in law is sending my wife weird texts.. I guess you could call them philosophies? They weird ones always come late at night. Here is an example of the most recent:

""It is as though we are presented as the greatest catastrophe of ourselves but also the greatest and truest escape of ourselves superficially and the reconciliation of either extreme the means of our salvation. Essentially the later being truly revisited when tired of returning to a fractal, but ultimately true, source of imminent conscious presence.
The entirety of ultimate consciousness continually told itself problem and predicament of present reality. When so far removed from ultimate truth as reminder of self existence. All expression of reality is to be a reminder of misconstrued reality has redirected but never lost of it's initial path.""

It goes on and on like this for pages. Has anyone seen anything like this and know what might be wrong?"
63,Strange attraction to watching small animals get tortured? Someone help.,"I know I can’t be the only one, and no this is not a fetish, I do not get sexual gratification out this. Whenever I see a small cute or adorable animal I get a strange impulse to watch it get hurt and tortured slowly for some reason, I’m not psychotic nor trying to be I just get a strange satisfaction and small rush of adrenaline out of watching this happen. Can someone tell me what’s going on? It would be very much appreciated."
64,How to convince someone to take their antipsychotics when they are convinced they're not sick?,"My sister believes she is a targeted individual and that she is gang stalked and victim of mind control and psychotropic torture, we convinced her to go see a psychiatrist in February and she was prescribed antipsychotics, she was doing better : no more insomnia, regained her appetite and started to work on a study project, even though she said that she still heard voices but she wasn't obsessed with the targeted individuals subject anymore. Now, she stopped her medication about two weeks ago and even before she stopped taking it every day because she thinks she isn't sick, she is validated by forum groups of those targeted individuals who says to people that have the same symptoms to not go to the psychiatrist and to not take any medication. Yesterday, she sent me some videos about T.I and mind control, I'm afraid she'll get worse. What can I do to convince her to take her medication? Thank you"
65,Help me understand why sexual assault affects peoples self esteem,"(Trigger warning)
Please read this background on me before responding to the question:
 23f. Been raped so many times between 17 and 21 i lost count. Maybe about 10x. It was never super violent,  but sometimes it hurt. I remember crying begging guys to stop and they wouldnt. Id be upset and shaken maybe a day or so after, but then id be fine. In my experience, rape is super annoying. And thats it. Nothing to be traumatized about. 
What does traumatize me, however, is being bullied in school and called ugly. Everyone says i should get over this but should be traumatized by rape. That makes no sense.  The bullying says ""youre unworthy. Youre disgusting. No one will ever want to touch you."" The rape says ""youre perfectly desirable and im just a shitty person who cant control myself.""

What i cannot comprehend on any level is why people get low self esteem from rape,  even want to kill themselves. If anything i see being raped as a compliment, as it shows people just wanted me that badly. 
My boyfriend felt suicidal after being raped once (nonviolently) and im so sad that i want to empathize and just dont get it. Im supportive and nice of course, but i just dont inherently understand. My boyfriend is also deeply upset i was raped and i wish hed stop making such a big deal about it because it doesn't bother me. Weve had a lot of frustrating disagreements over this. I wish we were on the same page.

I feel like maybe i just wasnt raped violantly enough. I hate myself and think i deserve to have experienced more violent rape.  Maybe then id get it? But i doubt it. No matter what, i dont think ill understand why anyone would hate themselves because of something someone else did that has no reflection on them  (the victim) as a person (besides being someone that someone wants to fuck). 

I must be not right in the head. Having low self esteem from rape is something everyone else seems to naturally understand. It bothers me so much i dont get it, especially because i cant empathize with my boyfriend. I think im just a sick person maybe? This whole thing makes me want to hurt myself. I should get it. I was a rape victim myself many times and still dont get it. Im a mental health professional and Im supposed to be empathetic as a profession. Im naturally extremely empathetic on every issue but this. 
So incredibly frustrated i dont get it. 

--
Can someone please (politely) explain why rape lowers peoples self esteem? Im so sorry if i offended anyone. This is just how i feel. Im making this post because i want to understand others.

Also...how messed up am i for my attitude on this? Are there any other rape victims out there who honestly didnt care? Even viewed it as a compliment? Am i alone?
 I feel alone."
66,I just wanted to be treated equally.,"I have been in a relationship with my SO for almost 6 years. I have always tried to give him everything he asks and ask for nothing in return. I have always struggled with depression since I was 15 I am almost 30 now. I feel like I am finally at a place where I can get a puppy that I have always wanted and I feel like taking care of something would also go along way to help with my depression but my SO just yells at me and tells me that he will resent me if I get one. But he wants to take my money and get himself a laptop. He has also not worked in a few years. So everything has always been on me to provide for us. 
I just wanted to do something that would make me happy for once."
67,I’m apparently desperate for help!,
68,Strange Quirks,"Hi there. I just discovered this subreddit and I'm not sure if it's the right place to post this. If not then feel free to suggest a place please :)

All my life I have had small quirks that I never really thought too deeply about, my family were not to educated on mental health and so only much later did we discover that my mom was dealing with depression and so on. 

The last two years have been a bit rough and I have noticed my quirks have gotten a bit worse. Some of them are: not being able to sleep in silence because I get super anxious, memory loss, having to touch things the same amount of times with both hands or feet.. little things like that. 

Are these just a result of anxiety issues? Do you think they will go away in time? 

I've never seen a therapist and it would be hard to find one since I live in a foreign country and many people here do not understand westerners. I'm sorry, this probably doesn't even make sense, I'm not really sure what I'm trying to ask even."
69,Is there any means of persuading a person with BPD into therapy after a discard?,"This person I was involved with for six rocky years. It started out as solid dating, and eventually turned into an on-again / off-again thing. The boundaries were extremely confusing, with her cuddling, and occasionally flirting. Us even making out at times.

After being discarded and the occasional attempt at reconciliation I eventually came to realize she most likely has BPD. I want to help her, but no matter what I say it has no effect. I'm one of ""the bad people,"" now. It basically feels like I went through a divorce without being married, with the biggest sin I committed being interest in a long term relationship.

She won't speak to me no matter how hard I try to persuade her or make up. I just know she's going to end up like her dad, alone and friendless. I only have one mutual friend left that she might be willing to speak with. (she dropped everyone else for various reasons) What are my best options for persuading her to attend treatment? Ideally, with someone specializing in personality disorders. 

I don't even really care about getting back in touch. I just wish she'd go to treatment, and if afterwords she decides to speak with me I'll speak to her, and keep very clear boundaries up.

We're in the US. I believe she is on the East coast."
70,Is this love?,"I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 years, and throughout the 6 years he has not really worked which was always fine with me. But he loves to buy himself things and sometimes he just does. he's always spending money and when I try to confront him or talk to him about anything he goes on the defensive and tells me in only acting this way because of my mental health and asked if I've taken my medication. Makes me feel like I'm crazy and threatens to leave me that he can't handle me. 

This year I was hospitalized for trying to take my life because I felt like it was my only way out. While I was in the hospital for almost a month he did not come to visit me and he was still buying himself things. He said he didn't want to see me like that. 

The last little while I have been doing good, I have enrolled myself into school and starting to look forward to things. I have always wanted a puppy and I feel like I'm at a place in my life where I could provide a loving and caring home but my boyfriend just yells at me and tells me that he will resent me if I get one. He wants me to pay for a new computer for him instead. 

I want to leave him but I feel stupid for leaving over him telling me I can't get something. Maybe I am just crazy."
71,Does anyone else get convinced they are part of the universe of some show or book that the saw?,"I don't really know how to explain it but there are times when I start thinking as if I'm part of the galactic rebublic from star wars or something. For example one time I was sitting around my room and starting thinking about some job I had to do the next day for the son's of anarchy gang, and was convinced I was part of the. I usually realize what's happening fairly quickly but even then it's really hard to snap back to reality and can be kinda scary.
The worst one was when I was basically imaginarily living the life of some streamer I used to watch, and for TWO WEEKS was just on auto pilot thinking I was this other person on the otherside of the world and playing it all out on my head.
I dunno what's going on but yeah, anyone else experience things like this."
72,How do I help my friend?,"I've known her for a few months now. In that time period she's had affairs with several guys. Usually it'll last a month or two. After they leave she self harms and gets extremely depressed. 

I don't know how to help her. I care about her but I can't empathise with how close she becomes to people after a small time frame. How can I support her?"
73,I think I’ve been having hallucinations but I’m not sure what to do,"I have a long history with depression and OCD, but since about November I’ve been seeing things. It started out only being like once in a week, I remember at first I would just see stuff out of the corner of my eye but it was larger shadows, it was mostly movement really but I ignored it because I thought it was normal, in January I was driving home from school and I saw an woman floating into the road towards my car for a split second and then she disappeared, this week I saw a bat fly into the bathroom from the window, and today I saw a roach scurry across my geckos cage, and then later I saw big white eyes in my wall staring at me in bed from my closet. They’re all brief and kind of shadowy I guess? 

Along with seeing things, I’ve also been hearing things sometimes when I’m alone in the house, like foot steps or banging of cupboards in the kitchen. I’ve been becoming way more paranoid since this has been going on, I check my whole room before I go to bed and sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and check it again with a flashlight, somedays I stay in bed until 3 o’clock because I feel like I just expect something bad to be on the other side of the door or a person to be downstairs. 

I honestly don’t know what’s going on, but I’ve been freaking out and I don’t know what to do. Any advice or insight is appreciated. I’ve been trying to get a hold of my therapist but I had been doing well so I stopped going and now with everything going on she’s having a hard time scheduling me so I feel like I don’t really have any resources to turn to. 

TLDR; been having steadily increasing hallucinations since November and don’t know that to do"
74,Phobia of bath tubs,"Hello , 
I’m usually a lurker, but this group seemed like a good place  to maybe get some... clarity, I guess ?
I guess I’ll just dive right in: does anyone else have an intense fear of bath tubs? Like, just the idea of sitting in a tub (especially an empty tub) makes you shudder, feel anxious/ uncomfortable, or make your skin crawl? 
Because I do. Ever since I can remember I’ve felt nauseous/anxious/ horrified when having to clean dirty bath tubs, sit in them, or even look at them too closely . I’ve been showering since I was old enough to bath by myself . 
I remember a scene in the Ant Man movie where Paul Rudd is tiny and running around a tub and I had to look away from the screen and think about something else until the scene was over , I was that uncomfortable. 
My ex even used to get mad at me and brought it up in a few fights about my mental health; how annoying and stupid it was that I couldn’t just  be romantic and take bathes with them, that I couldn’t just get over such a stupid fear. 
I can’t explain what it is specifically or why, but it bothers me. Does anyone else have this weird fear ? Has it affected you ? Am I just an anxious freak who needs to up their dose of meds ? Are rubber ducks in the bath really that fun ? I’ve always been so envious of bubble baths in movies, I hope to one day enjoy baths."
75,Why do I only lash out on my family?,"I’m 17 and I have depression and anxiety. I think I may have some sort of behavior issue or anger issue. Whenever something trivial occurs that one of my family members did, I lash out on them and argue with them. Deep down I know most of the times I’m in the wrong, but I can’t help to get mad and yell. Evidently mental health has taken a toll on my relationship with my family. However, whenever my friends or someone else does something trivial, I don’t lash out. I never do. 

EXCEPT this one time when I lashed out on this DD worker for giving my order to this girl and saying that I didn’t order anything which I’ve never lashed out on anyone in public before, but that is besides the point (or maybe it is)

However, it’s actually only my family when I lash out on them. I don’t know why. I can get mad for hours on end after such trivial things that they’ve done.

For example, today I put a refund package in my mailbox for the delivery person to take a ship out. Then I realized my dad took it out, thinking it was for us. I then lashed out on my parents because they took it out. I did that because I had very little time to return it, and if I didn’t return it in this set amount of days, I don’t get my refund. ($100). They said they didn’t know, and deep down I genuinely knew I was in the wrong, but still couldn’t help but blamed them."
76,[M27] How to seek Borderline Personality Disorder Diagnosis.,"I'm [M27] and have had a few people tell me that only women are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I've read the symptoms and have them all. I really want to talk to someone about it but I don't want to be dismissed.

I'll also admit I don't have like any money as my wife and I just had a baby and I work for a non-profit as the sole breadwinner in the family. And if I get diagnosed what does that mean for me?"
77,My brother is in his late 20s and solve problems through threats and aggression.,"For instance he moved out of the house we’re renting, moved back in abruptly, kicked me out of the room I was staying in, claimed it was okay because he bought me a bed, then is just an asshat in general.

Claims I’m an asshole though he’s the only person I know who’d say that about me.

I can’t move out right now but down the line. What can I do?"
78,What does your OCD convince you of that makes it difficult to get better?,"I have pretty bad ocd, lately since ive been trying to get better my ocd has convinced me that if I dont do my ocd then I'll have a seizure. Well this has led to me feeling physically sick and getting weird feelings in my head if I dont do my ocd. I'm worried at this point that i will convince myself I can think myself into a seizure that i actually will. Do you guys ever experience anything like this?"
79,How I learned to move pass the things that I cannot control. I want to help people with my story.,"
This is not a throwaway (obviously. look at my karma) because I don’t care if people I know see this. Maybe it will help them too. I (m,20) have had severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder since the age of 7. I developed it as a result of childhood trauma along with other psychiatric disorders. I won’t go into detail here, as I have on old posts that were made on throwaways. Sorry. Anyway, I have posted on here several times in the past back when I was struggling, but not since I have reached the end of the tunnel. Anyway, for years I struggled with OCD. I shook doorknobs for 5 or more minutes, I counted things, I checked things, I scrubbed my hands too much, and did several other things. I literally had hundreds of obsessions that ruled my life. On top of that, I had to deal with other disorders. I then decided to go to the doctor because I couldn’t take it anymore. Little did I know, I was approaching one of the toughest times in my life. For two years I had to play musical chairs with meds and therapy. Towards the end of the two years, I was practically suicidal. I stayed in my dark room only emerging to eat and shit. I looked for ways to die. I would be somewhat negligent with my life. Then one day, I decided to once again, for the millionth time and with the advice of my therapist, to get a med change. This med change may have been the best thing that has happened to my life. With these meds and therapy, I no longer shake door knobs more then a few times. It takes more than a month to empty a GermX bottle that used to take me less than a week to empty. I’m not overly afraid to shake hands with people (before Covid) and my other compulsive symptoms became irrelevant. I went from a very severe life to a normal life. Of course, OCD will always be there because it is permanent. But it stays in the shadows much more than it used to. You might ask how I did this. The first thing I did was stop obsessing over my OCD. I used to think about it constantly. I used to make it who I am. I talked about it all the time. But it didn’t stop until I got the right meds, talked to the therapist, and stopped thinking about OCD. (In they order of course. It’s impossible to do it in another order at least for me). Instead of loathing about it, I took action. Now I live a normal life. My final words for this is: whatever you do, don’t make yourself a victims as many of us have a habit  of doing. This doesn’t accomplish anything. Stand up, get meds, talk to someone, and quit thinking about it. Don’t make yourself a victim. Because if you continue to, as I used to, you will ALWAYS be OCDs victim."
80,How do I get a FULL mental health evaluation? I've been to multiple psychs/doctors over the years and I can't seem to get any help. I want to find out exactly what I have and none of them do any types of tests. Do not they exist? Please.,How do I get a FULL mental health evaluation?

81,How do I explain why I failed the military?,"A month ago I got separated from my division in the navy, I didn't get to ship out over seas, I didn't really serve. I got sent home because of mental health reasons, I have an RE8 code so I could reenlist, but I don't every recruiter Ive talked to has said km I'm pretty in a no due to mental health issues. With quarantine going on I dont know how to get help. I told my family a bullshit story because I couldn't handle the shame. Any suggestions as to how I can tell them?"
82,Suicidal thoughts and Ritalin,"I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while, but they were mostly passive until my psychiatrist prescribed me Ritalin. I even went as far as looking for a gun to buy, and fortunately I stopped myself. I have an upcoming appointment and I'll be fine in the mean time. 

The problem is that the Ritalin is *really effective*: prior to taking it I wasn't doing schoolwork, exercise, and I was barely showering. I'm like a completely different person now."
83,Why do I often feel like me and someone I love are the same person?,"It’s a feeling of...oneness, no boundaries. Like there’s no end of me or start of them. That I exist in both ways, or that our existence is the same. 

It doesn’t make me do anything. But it’s just a weird feeling that legitimately has me questioning the bounds of my identity at times. It doesn’t feel bad, I just know that we are taught to perceive ourselves as individuals."
84,How to live with a SO that has multiple mental health issues.," Maybe some might think  Be dragged dowby somebody elses drama like this, but aslong a she is a good person, as long as she fights for me I will fight for her, where else can she go?"
85,How to live with a SO that has multiple mental health issues.,"I (M, 27) live with my SO (F, 25) in a small apartment, I am in the process of starting my own company and I need to spend quite a bit of time on that. For months (years actually) I have been living with money problems, I have kept myself afloat but my bank account is always close to zero. It seems financially I will be doing better as I expect my company to grow in the oncoming month, so there is that. I had a job last year that earned me just enough to stay afloat but would get me nowhere in life, so I took the deep dive and turned my hobbies into my work...then Corona happened.

My GF suffers from a long lasting depression, anxiety attacks, social anxiety, anger attacks, childhood trauma and more. She most likely has an extreme variant of PMS or PMDD and maybe other mental issues like add/bipolar or some other condition. She lost her job due to corona, she doesn't speak the local language yet and therefore cannot find a job, all the shitty jobs have been taken by schoolkids that have nothing to do. She is forced to work with me, this means I have to take care of her during work and at home. At work she has regular panic attacks or she collapses to the floor crying due to other reasons, you can imagine this is hindering my ability to work. Also she has attacks in the morning, leaving her (and me) emotionally exhausted even before going to work, I missed three days of work in a row because of her current state of mind, I will go bankrupt like this. Sometimes she goes to a different place and she loses control, starts throwing a breaking stuff, she starts hitting herself in the face...I hate that demon because it is hitting my girlfriend. At home we go to bed late, I wake up in the middle of the night to her crying, mornings are a fine balance between good and chaos, I need a rest from all this.

She is a beautiful women, I love her to death, our brains connect so well with each other. I want to see her flourish in live, I have faith she will eventually recover. She deserves somebody loving her and taking care of her as nobody else did before, not even her mother when she was young. She doesn't realize it but she is really smart, she just never had somebody guide that intelligence in the right direction. She has lived in many places, always on the move, she needs to stay put now and stick to something, you can't heal if you keep running.

My country has a system that might be able to help her, unlike the one where she comes from. Psychiatric help is on the way but the Corona crisis is fucking everything up.

I realize I just need to vent all this, I don't know what I am asking here. I live this everyday and it is starting to take it's toll. I am emotionally stable, I am not depressed, but I need to take a break from all this. When I leave her alone she goes bad quickly, I fear she will hurt herself, or worse. So I can't really take a break.

I just need to say this."
86,Screamed at and threatened to be kicked out of house for not taking meds. Opinions on what to say?,"I plan to say this to him tomorrow. 24m. Add or subtract anything?

Could you address them point by point?

I am referring to imaginary earthly, present day, situations relating to the Holy Bible. They are the worst case scenarios.

2 Timothy 4:16-17
At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.

Is this whole situation partly caused by thinking I'm not serious about getting a job or going back to school? You feel like the medications will give me more motivation? I can prove my level of motivation. 

Psalm 41:1-13
Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him; the Lord protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies. The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health. As for me, I said, “O Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!” My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die, and his name perish?

Doesn't this mean the Lord will heal you or prolong life if you take care of the poor like you currently are (referring to me, I do plan to get a job though)? Are there verses about those who don't take care about the poor (just out of curiosity)? I don't think I have yet donated, but plan to when I get a real job.

The amount of pills I have taken (started 2 days ago) is small enough to count this as almost 4 weeks taking only parnate and nothing dangerous happening. Zyprexa takes about 8 days to reach peak concentration.

Isaiah 49:15 
Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.

I cannot begin to explain how much worse emotional numbness (numbness is better than depression by far) is compared to being happy. Just because I liked it the time we saw Dr. Espinosa doesn't mean I want to spend my life in this state. Happiness is one of my top priorities. For months, I had completely forgotten how it felt to be happy (like in high school) so I thought numbess was normal. If my short term memory continues to deteriorate incrementally, I'll be below average IQ.

Psalm 31:22
I had said in my alarm, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.

I do not understand how mental hospital patients are allowed to choose what medication to take, yet are not abandoned, put in solitary confinement, or punished in any way if they don't take the medication. Patients who are deemed a danger to themselves or society are forced to take medication, however. Joe has autonomy to choose what prescriptions he takes and he's 3 years younger than me. You said, ""I have no right to know what medications he takes.""

If I truly am mentally ill (which is true) wouldn't a person feel guilty for abandonment (kind of like abandoning a dog) in their time of need.

Psalm 27:10 
Though my father and my mother abandoned me, the LORD gathers me up.

This is a very tough decision for me to make because of the frustration it causes you and Dr. Espinosa's intelligence.

Colossians 3:21
Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become disheartened.

I'm going to find a doctor who doesn't treat me like a baby who cannot make my own decision. I'm going to listen to a new doctor's advice exactly this time.

I am NOT saying this about you. I'm guessing Adolf Hitler was a good example of this:

1 Timothy 5:8
But if someone does not provide for his own, especially his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

If I cannot stay here, can you give me Mom's, Granny's and Papa's, Uncle Mark's (he sent me a card), and Aunt Cindy's phone numbers? I would ask if I could live with them. Otherwise I would have to live alone.

I am NOT saying this about you. I'm thinking Adolf Hitler was a good example of this:

1 John 4:20
If anyone says 'I love God,' and yet hates his fellow Christian, he is a liar, because the one who does not love his fellow Christian whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.

Is there a compromise we could make with me only taking parnate and a sleep drug? I'm going to have to move out if you don't want me here because I cannot take the medication. I would prefer to stay here to talk with you and Joe everyday and save more money from working. 

I was referring to imaginary earthly, present day, situations relating to the Holy Bible."
87,Weird issue where I can't focus on repetitive tasks?,"To start off, I know I have pretty bad anxiety and probably depression, but I've never been diagnosed. I can't sit still when I'm anxious, I pace a lot, tap my knee or fingers, talk quickly until I'm out of breath on the phone etc. 

A while ago I noticed I couldn't focus on ""aim training"" on video games. This sounds silly, but after maybe 30 seconds of training I feel my body physically get tense and stressed. It's so bothering that I can't physically handle doing it for more than 2-3 minutes. It drives me INSANE. The best example of how bad it is I can give; If someone offered me a million dollars to do aim training for 1 hour, I'd lose my mind about 15 minutes in and physically not be able to continue.

It sounded stupid when that was the only example I had, but I realized I experienced the same thing earlier in my life in welding class. In class, we had to do these repetitive circles/triangles/movements every 1 second or so while welding and it would drive me crazy mentally, to the point that I'd experience it physically in my body and have to take breaks often.

I've never really thought about it being a mental health issue until recently. I plan to go to a doctor or something and figure things out soon, but I just wanted to hear opinions on this for now."
88,I just wanted to say that- I tried.,I really did.
89,"little rant, sorry for posting this i just needed to put it out somewhere. sorry, again."," 

Today has been so fucking rough. i don't know how i've done it's just... depressing. i've realized i'm not enough and i never will to myself, and others. i've literally done so many small tasks and have gone out of my way to do stuff just to feel as if i was productive, as if i served a purpose. and i don't, i never will, life is essentially one big show. and i'm a minor character. i'm an extra in my own movie. thats so fucking depressing. its painful. and i still cant let it out!! I CANT FUCKING CRY!! NOT AS A ""IM A MAN"" OR ""PUSSIES CRY"" BUT I  CANNOT AND I WANT TO!! I WANT TO RELEASE MY EMOTIONS IN ONE BURST BUT I CANT. I WANT TO BREAK SOMETHING! I WANT TO BE A NORMAL CHILD WITH NORMAL EXPECTATIONS. it hurts. it hurts so bad. i need a meaning i need a task. i need an assignment.i am co-dependent i see that. i'm not stupid. i know i'm co-dependent and i need directions. i need someone to tell me if i was good. cuz i cant... i haven't had an actually reward to any good action i've done in so long, ofc i get a ""thx ben for being such a good son"". i know this is going to sound spoiled, but thats not enough, i need actual affection i need actual love. i cant continue living like this. living in a meaningless life. in a life where all assignments in school are finished in seconds just like water evaporates in the sun, just as quick. i cant. I NEED A MEANING.I NEED AN END GOAL. AND IM FUCKING GAY TOO. DEAL WITH IT AMERICA. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK. IM MY OWN FUCKING PERSON. but a meaningless person. a useless person. a damaged person...why?why? why is life so confusing. why cant i just please others,THATS THE ONLY THING THAT IM USEFUL FOR. FOR OTHERS. i honestly COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.I'D RATHER HURT MYSELF THAN HURT A RANDOM STRANGER. i don't deserve what i have, i don't, i really don't. but i cant say that without feeling like a total piece of shit. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF I SOUND LIKE A TOTAL ASSHOLE THOSE ARE MYYYY FUCKING EMOTIONS AND I HAVE THEM ON MY SLEAVE.

Im lost.Im confused.Im frustrated.Worst of all i'm me. Im a totally selfish arrogant,""weak little bitch"",needy, piece of shit. i'm not the only one that thinks that. Almost all of those have been said by my parents.

i've literally been gaslighted by my parents so many times. for example me and my mom were having a discussion about idk i think school and my grades, keep in mined i have almost all A+ except for a B, my mom told me to get that grade up or ill get punished i told her "" Its a B its honestly a good grade, ma"" my mom then told me ""NO!! not for me"" i was pretty weirded out that a b was a bad grade for her and i said under my breath ""why do you expect so much of me, it's almost impossible to keep up."" INSTEAD OF HER JUST SAYING SORRY SHE STARTS CRYING AND SAID "" i'm such a bad mother, i failed as a parent"" WHO THE FUCK TELLS THEIR CHILD THAT THEY ARE BAD PARENTS, SHE WANTED ME TO FEEL BAD. and i did.I SHOULD FEEL BAD. I TRY AND I TRY TO BRING OTHERS JOY BUT IVE NEVER ACCOMPLISHED THAT.why?why? why cant i fulfill my purpose. i know i'm useless. i'm accustomed to those words. i believe them. THATS SO FUCKED IN EVERY WAY.

i'm disassociating i think i haven't ""felt"" an actual emotion except for frustration and sadness in a long time.

i'm not going to lie i've thought about killing myself a lot. not recently, except for today. but i could never do that, to my family, or friends. plus i deserve the pain of staying alive for being useless, unproductive apathetic, and numb.

i don’t wanna eat. it’ll be a wast of food. i don’t like my body, especially with the surgery, i haven’t genuinely, like honestly, thought i was attractive in a long time.i always have questions either people don’t have the answers or people don’t want to answer.

but… why? whats wrong with me?"
90,I haven't been passionate about anything in months.. maybe longer.,"I get bursts of motivation to do stuff but that doesn't really count as passion because it never lasts long. I used to love philosophy, reading, mythology and everything in between but it feels like ever since my first breakdown, I haven't had a true passion for something. I haven't has a passion that hasn't been filled by Mania or psychosis. I don't know how long its been. But trust me when I say, you're never the same after your first breakdown."
91,"I dislike the term ""binge watching"" television because of eating disorders.",Does it disturb anyone? That this term is used so often with streaming TV being so popular? I've always correlated it in my mind with purging. And thus it feels like they are throwing around the word and turning it into something positive.  I've even mentioned this to certain people and they don't give a shit. Maybe I'm being too sensitive.
92,Am I a sociopath?,"I'm a compulsive liar, I know how to get my way through manipulation to People I know well. I'm very monotonous and feel almost numb 24/7 unless I'm overwhelming with anxiety or saddness. Sometimes I start conflict for my own entertainment. Fighting with people is just more entertaining to me and I normally get my way in the end anyways, it's never over anything super bad though I have morals and I know when it's getting to be too much. I normally don't pick fights unless it naturally starts up but is I don't want to fight I won't bother. Anytime I feel emotional it only feels like a lead ball in the pit of my stomach. It's hard for me to convey when I'm joking and being sarcastic and it often gets me in trouble. 

I don't know if any of this information is even helpful but I'm just curious because a lot of people think I'm a sociopath."
93,Hello,"Just want someone to tell me life is gonna be okay, i tried calling the suicidal hotline but that was really horrible seemed like they don’t care at all, then i tried doing chat sites to connect with people but they are obsessed with sex, makes me really question the worth of humans. But yeah just tell me its all gonna be good and feel better because i would like that :)"
94,concerned sister,"i know my brother has a mental disorder but i'm not really sure what. he's always had low self esteem but his depression and anxiety got worse when he traveled the country with his manipulative ex who turned out to be gay. they dated for almost 2 years. lately he's been really depressed and anxious not letting anyone talk to him. its not like him. tonight i heard a scream that sounded like a demon and made me really scared. later i found out it was my brother. my brother is an atheist and does not believe in god. i'm not religious myself, but for some reason i feel a demon may be manifesting itself in there. He has also been experiencing night sweats. I'm a concerned sister!!"
95,Is anyone else infuriated by how limited help there is out there?,"I’m so tired of there being minimal resources to help people who are truly suffering. Maybe you’re suffering because you have experienced trauma. Maybe you feel a certain type of way, but you just don’t know why. There’s quite literally 2 options:

Medication or Therapy.

Medication isn’t necessary for everyone and it costs money.
Therapy I think should be available to everyone who is suffering in some way. But it’s costs money - a hell of a lot of money! 

I’m tired of people making money off of our suffering. Someone I know who has suffered sexual abuse wants some advice on where to go next. How do they deal with all of those feelings? The way there body reacts? The triggers? It’s affecting their life, their relationships, how they see themselves. There isn’t a drug for that and they don’t have the answer for therapy. So what is the help for them? There isn’t any! And leaving feelings like the shame, the guilt, the self hate, the regret turn into even bigger problems. I’m in the same situation, but I can afford therapy (only just). Without it I think I may have just continued using substances do drawn it out, continued cutting my arms, maybe even killed myself. 

And it’s not just trauma like that - there’s so many issues, so many complex struggles that we all are facing and we need help with it. It’s literally costing people their lives.  

Reading books and online forums only helps so much - most of the time you really do need some help from someone who knows what they’re talking about. 

It absolutely enrages me that if you haven’t the got money you’re not entitled to any help. There are long waiting lists where you might be able to get some free help for a short amount of time - but they are long waiting lists and we don’t always have time on our side. Especially not when in serious emotional turmoil and pain. 

For how far ahead we are with certain things in society, it angers me how we are still in the baby stages when it comes to treating mental health."
96,help please by spreading some kind words?,i’m likely going to hit 300 or more pounds by the end of quarantine. i’m kinda trapped inside and have been getting more and more stressed and i tend to stress eat a lot. idk what to do :(
97,Was I traumatized??,"     Ever since a couple months ago I started to think about something that happened to me...I asked my mom about it and I asked her if she thinks this experience is something that might have had an impact on my mental health (which is not very good). 

     Here’s what happened: 
It was probably about 1-4 am...i was scrolling on my phone, as happy as ever, I get this FaceTime call from my best friend back 5 years ago (at the time I was 8-9). I answered the call to see her sobbing...(not that long ago we were as happy as ever, joking around, and having fun playing Minecraft. 

She lived a few towns away from me so we FaceTimed almost every single day, all day and night) At first I though she was joking because not that long ago she was fake crying and laughing about it, but something was off...she genuinely seemed so, so, so stressed. Which made me realize it wasn’t a joke and something was wrong. She ended up telling me that she wanted to take her own life...I told her to go tell her parents...she said that they would get mad at her for waking them up. I told her they wouldn’t and she just had to go and wake them up to talk to them. 

My phone cut us off from talking because my phone died in the middle of the conversation. (Mind you I was terrified at this moment...I thought that she might take her life any second now.) so I ran upstairs to my mom and dads room, crying and telling them to call her parents. Since it was 3 o’clock in the morning my parents can’t just wake up and fully take in what was happening. I’m not exactly sure what happened after, but I do remember my mom calling my friends mom for my friends mom not to answer. 

So my mom went onto say, “We’ll call tomorrow.” I was so sad and confused as to why she would say something so absurd like that...she wasn’t one of those people to just let someone go when they wanted to take their life. I told my mom (when we were talking about it) that she said that and she swears she never said that, but I really remember her saying that...which makes me believe I was hallucinating (which is beside the point). 

I’m not one to ask my therapist or my parents about certain things if it would make it seem like I was self diagnosing or something like that or if it’s completely stupid. So PLEASEEEE I need Answers!! TvT THANK YOU!! (Sorry if the story doesn’t make since I tend to ramble on when I tell a story)"

99,I need to know what to do next please help,"Hello! So i need to vent &amp; if anyone knows anything about what i’m expressing any kind of help would mean so much. 

So i used to go to a psychologist a 2 years back, and got diagnosed with depression and OCD (though i was not open to her at all and we really only scratched the tip of what i felt), I was going through self harm &amp; feeling completely hopeless in life, then after about seven months I stopped going to my psychologist, I felt as if she wasn't offering any valid help and seemed to downplay my feelings but the main reason i stopped going is because my parents decided it was no longer needed, and stoping led me to believe i didn't need therapy and my whole diagnose wasn't even needed.

I’m writing this now a 2 years later because i am starting to question my whole experience in this mental health journey. 

When i stopped therapy i thought i was in a better head space then before, but my moods are extremely unreliable, and it didn't take long for me to slump into a depression, and when i feel depressed, I want to harm myself, I feel like life has always been this way, and I completely lose hope, But then at times I completely flip and i start to believe my life is perfect, i’m an amazing human, I feel like the life of the party, and i do reckless things like drugs, drink, I also feel happy and inspired, i’ll clean, pick up hobbies, do art and i have no regard for tomorrow, Then before I know it i slump back into an intense depression. I also have intense moments of rage i can’t explain. (i’ve had these feelings for as long as i can remember, for example when i was younger, i’d have moments of having many friends and being reckless then i’d cut them all out week or two later and have no desire to talk to anyone) These moods do effect my life as when i’m depressed I cut people off, I feel like harming myself &amp; have no desire to do anything and when i’m happy i become a whole new person and do things i regret later. 

What i cannot tell is if these emotions are normal? I cannot tell if switching between such intense depression to such extreme highs is common in people my age (17) or if it’s related to my old diagnosis of depression or something new, I can’t tell if it would be worth it to go to a psychologist again and see whats up (since my parents are so unaccepting going to a psychologist is kinda a big deal so if what i’m going through is normal i don’t want to go through it) 

Any insight? please"
100,Anxious about work!,"Is anybody else feeling anxious to return to work when lockdown and isolation is lifted?

101,WHY DOES MY DAD WAKE UP THINKING HES CHOKING ON STUFF? WHY DOES MY DAD GO TO BED PERFECTLY NORMAL THEN WAKE UP CHOKING AND LITERALLY STARTS A FIGHT WITH MY MOM?,"For as long as I can remember my dad has always done this, he wakes up choking then will like spit up stuff &amp; and that’s all, or he’ll wake up and I’ll literally hear him sounding scared out of his mind thinking they’re is toothpicks inside his throat, or a whole orange, a dog chain, dog collar and Ect? or hell wake up and clearly be asleep still cause I know now when he’s not fully awake He’s like “take me to the hospital” and grab his chest and think he’s I guess dying? Like I need to know, because imagine going to sleep every night going through this. MUST BE MISERABLE?? 

Next question, WHY does he go to sleep fine and wake up choking/coughing bad and my mom be asleep and he acts mad and she says what did I do and he like flips a switch and “hates her” and Ect like he wakes up MAD? Like how?

I never believe these thoughts. They don't represent my reality. I understand they are just thoughts, but for whatever reason I still feel like this is abnormal. 

Should I be worried?"
104,What's going on with me?,"So I've never been one to struggle with my mental health that bad at least depression and adhd had a therapists she was amazing on medication getting better but I dont want to go into detail cause I'm here for an answer not pity. I'm 15 male a little on the skinny side if that helps. So anyways recently I've started getting these moods where I do and say things that arnt like I normally am I'm a really sympathetic and carefree person domt really hate anyone or anything up until now or at least I like to think so, so during these moods I kind of lose control of myself like I'm in control but I'm not it's like I'm only 50% there my mind feels foggy and I cant think straight it's so surreal and it sounds crazy, ever since I remember I've always gotten urges to say a do stuff I shouldn't but when I go through with the urges the amazing feeling of pleasure one could say is amazing it's like almost a drug. a lot of the time a can ignore it and push it back it can be horrible things or stuff like make your dog go outside for no reason I think most people have these right? But theres more when I'm in these moods it feels like I cant control these urges its ridiculously hard to control the urges in these moods and some of the thoughts are absolutely disturbing and disgusting it's like my mind and body actively reward me and encourage me to do shameful disgusting things.

If you think that's horrible theres more.

Over the past few days I've developed an odd obsession with death and blood, theres something so taboo about watching someones entire life existence come to a violent end seeing as the life fades from there eyes and the river of blood flows from out of them everything they could've been snuffed out in an instant. 

Is it a morbid curiosity? Or is it a fascination I dont know really. Either way it's something I haven't told anyone close to me I dont want them thinking I'm crazy right?

I have no clue why I'm like this I'm reaching out for help I cant get therapy because of the situation the world is in and I dont want to freak out my parents by telling them this, usually I'm a really happy kid I've never even told someone that I dislike them like seriously that's impressive I think for a teenager, but lately thought I've been become very irritable not violent just irritable but I'm scared because the urges dont go away I cant sleep with the thought it's like a sound slowly getting louder and I need your help please dont leave me like this please I dont want to kill them I'm serious it's harder to ignore the thought when I'm sleep deprived I've thought about suicide just to keep my family safe from me but in the end I stay because it gets better that's what they say at least but it's horrible I dont want to die I dont want to kill I'm so alone I haven't told anyone I'm just a freak it's not normal ik not insane Ime normal please believe me I just need help what is wrong with me? Why cant I be normal? Please help I'm begging you."
105,How to tell someone who is verbally/ emotionally abusive to get help? They won't listen,"Throwaway

I'm sorry if this is long but want to give context...

This person I am really close to is emotionally and verbally abusive. I personally think he also displays narcissistic traits. 

He rants all the time, has a really bad temper, uses horrible language every day and swears at everyone, calls everyone names over the smallest things. He then turns it around and tries to victimise himself and points out everything wrong with you and explains why it's all your fault. He is also controlling and often takes it upon himself to ""teach lessons"" to people and even orders us to go to our rooms when we're the same age? I notice he even looks in the mirror when ranting and raging, which has always bothered me. He invades your space and comes into your room to push a point even if you ask him to leave. Arguments and rants never seem to end unless you grovel or apologise or say ""you're right"". He always has to be right and everyone always has to agree. But he also says ""I always admit when I'm wrong"" but I don't think he ever does? 

He seems to lose friends a lot or end up being in the middle of drama. He continuously admits to having a ""potty mouth"" and using excessive bad language but always says it's nowhere near as harmful as how everyone around him treats him. He puts me down all the time but is also one of my best friends.

Sometimes I worry he is on the verge of getting physical. Constantly describes ""smashing your teeth in"" or ""beating you to a pulp"". He doesn't understand when I tell him that this isn't appropriate? He instead brushes it off and tells me why I'm the reason he feels like this and says those things. He always accuses me of liking the sound of my own voice when I honestly have not met someone that rants more or for longer than him. 

I'm not perfect and tend to fight back a lot and refuse to say sorry. But I am really worried about him. He has so many wonderful things about his personality, is very loving and ambitious and funny and charming but he needs to address his horrible anger issues but I don't know how to make him? He is in complete denial about all these negative, abusive traits and if I ever suggested a therapist I know he would laugh or just scream at me. 

So many people in his life have told him how out of line his behaviour is and that he speaks to people atrociously. He just will not listen or self reflect... 

Even if he did get a therapist I doubt he would have anything to say? Because he doesn't see anything he does as wrong."
106,I survived. Do you have questions?,"Hey there. I tried replying to each and every post on here as a way of saying thank you to this community, but I almost immediately got depressed. I am not a licensed therapist, nor an expert in any way- I just feel like something in my core changed, and my new bottomline is: I’m staying here."
107,Self Esteem Help,"I am working on my mental health or at least trying and I think the way I am talking to myself, viewing myself and just overall being negative on myself all the time is taking a huge toll on my ability to cope with anxiety and even affecting my interactions with other people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in treatment that in the past has been nearly all medication based. I am currently only on Lexapro. I am looking for self-help ways to increase confidence and also build coping skills for ""thicker"" skin.

Any advice?"
108,My sister changed last year...,"Hello, 

Im a 16-year-old boy living in east London, this is what's been going on in my life for the past year...

So, last year I attended school as usual, wasn't the best kid but wasn't the worse my attendance was quite bad and probably missed more than 2 of the 5 years of secondary school. Anyways, I have two sisters one 18 and one 20, this is about my 20-year-old sister who was 19 at the time of this happening. I was the first person to notice her change and it was pretty strange and scary, my mum got me up that morning to tell me to get ready for school but I ended up waiting for her to leave and going back to Asleep to have the day off. When I woke up I came out of my room and heard a scream in the room next to me \[both my sister's room\] I opened the door and asked ""what are you doing?"" and got told to ""shut the door and fuck off"" which I did and then she screamed again, it was strange that she told me to ""Fuck off"" as at this point we no longer had the sibling rivalry we used to have when we were younger. Straight after this happened I text my mum and told her that something was wrong with her. In the following weeks, I withdrew from school in February roughly 5-6 months into year 10 and begun doing homeschool \[which i never done one lesson in the past 1 year+ which is all my fault really\] as the school kept threatening me with fines as my attendance was bad so it was easier for my mum to care for my sister and teach me.

Over the next few weeks things got very bad, she started hearing voices and arguing with everyone which at this point was very unusual, she had all different names for the voices and my other sister had to move out of the room which they both shared as we were all pretty scared and we had not experienced anything like this. She would stay up all night and all day and say that the devil won't let her sleep and that the devil won't let her go to the toilet. Lots of family members came round to try to talk to her as she was very selective who she wanted to talk to, before this happened she was very close with two of my aunts which at that time she suddenly hated them. One of my 3 aunts was able to talk with her and my sister gave her a kill list of all the people in the family she wanted to kill and I'm pretty sure I was within the top 5 or 10 for some reason which is unknown to me. Thinking back quite a lot is a blur but it was pretty much like living with a stranger for a few weeks until one day she decided to walk out the house, I told my mum and my mum figured she would walk back soon after but something wasn't right so I started following her. We walked about 3 miles and the whole time she was she was zoned out in her head just nodding yes and no repeatedly and many times crossing the road without looking and nearly getting hit by a car. Shortly after leaving the house, my mum caught up with me and we followed her about 20 meters behind to make sure nothing happened, about 2 miles down a family friend who is a social worker showed to help out, for some reason she really hated my mum and was very delusional saying how my mum used to starve and abuse us \[which was very untrue\] so knowing this, our family friend/god mum approached her to try and talk to her to see what she was doing but she kept walking and was in her own world just nodding her head to the voices. As we got further a motorway was coming up and we agreed that if she tried to cross we would have to grab her and call the police, well she tried crossing and we all had to grab her and stop her from trying to cross the motorway she struggled a bit but walked with us for the most part. Police arrived a few minutes later and myself and our family friend followed behind as we drove to the hospital ward about 10 minutes away, luckily there was a room and she was admitted to the ward the same day. 

I don't remember how long she was in there but it wasn't longer than a month, she came out and was a lot better than when she went in and to this day it has never been as bad as the start, but anyways she came out and was a lot better and was on her meds which she stopped taking on and off. After the first admission to the ward, she was put back in on two occasions most recently in December just before Christmas, we had police and ambulance come round which handled it very well but there was one lady who was trying to get them to force her out the door but the ambulance man basically told this lady to fuck off which was nice of him, they were trained in these sort of situations so they knew how to handle it and they were also both in the army previously. It took them over an hour to talk her to come out the door and into the ambulance as for some reason she was convinced they were trying to take her to do surgery on her which made no sense but in the end, they got her out without force. We managed to get her out for Christmas as it was no longer a safe option for her to be inside this ward as in a week she got into two fights \[she wasn't the instigator\] and lost a big chunk of hair in one of them also one of the staff got booted in the head and got rushed to the hospital which was luckily 200 meters away. The staff in here were very rude African ladies \[sorry if its racist but that's what happened\] who don't really care what the patients get up they don't supervise at all which led to a number of complaints by my mum which led to a few being sacked and many more cameras being installed. My mum would visit her every day without fail and was basically turned into the staff member which was supervising all the patients, she would bring in activities for my sister to do and then all the others would get involved which was fine, following this my mum was offered a job to work in the ward which she didn't accept as there was way too much going on with my sister and my homeschooling to take up a job. \[Forgot to mention, this event led to my mum having to leave work\] 

Fast-forwarding to now things are starting to get bad again, we have tried looking into getting her a private bed in a ward in London which isn't an option with Coronavirus, we have looked at her getting her own place with doctors who check up on her multiple times a day which also wasn't an option as she is refusing to take meds which puts the doctors at risk. So long story short as of now things are getting bad again she is laughing very loud at ridiculous times 2,3,4,5,6am waking everybody up, arguing with everyone, slamming doors as hard as she can. At one point which I also forgot to mention back in December, she pushed my other 18-year-old sister headfirst into a wall which did nothing wrong to her and this pissed me off a lot so i grabbed her and pinned her to the floor and told my mum to call the police which didn't happen but I got off her and sort of went back about our days but I ended up with some pretty deep scratches, I think this may have been a reason for her last admission as well. 

The effects of all this happening has made all the other 3 people in this houses lives flip upside down, as our mum has quite work which she had a good job which she worked hard to get, having 3 kids and going to university to get a degree, so now we are on benefits. This is also causing a strain on my mum's mental health as she is caring for someone who is delusional and hates her for a reason which no one knows, my other sister and her became very close up until this happened they both learned piano together, they both loved books they eventually shared a room which is no longer the case. Im not really sure whats going on in my head I've had people try to talk to me and ask me how I feel about the situation Im not really the one to open up so I just kinda just tell them that I get on with it which I do but I know it's having an effect on me but I don't know what depression or anxiety feels like which I don't know if it makes any sense but I just generally have no clue and if I did feel it I wouldn't be able to put a finger on what it and say im depressed so if I am I wouldn't even know. At the start of this all happening I started getting into trouble and got into a bit of a bad crowd and would meet them often and there would be like 10 of us making big fires in parks and prank calling police saying someones got a gun or a machete just stupid dumb shit, but within 1 month I had stopped meeting them as all of them have criminal records and id rather not get one and fuck up the rest of my life.

A few months back I started smoking weed quite a bit which made me feel good i could go on my ps4 and have a laugh which helped from escaping reality for a few hours it helped me sleep which I've always had trouble with, id go into school with 2 hours sleep every day up until leaving. At one point I was doing it every day but realized if I carry on im going to end up like my sister or addicted, she smoked weed prior to this happening and was also given PIP money about 6 months ago which is basically disability money which only enables her to buy £800 worth of weed a month which is crazy and isn't helping her one bit but my mum can't stop her as she's legally an adult and calling the police will only make matter worse, she gives no money to my mum for food or anything, my mum had the option of the money going in her account which she didnt do as she felt bad and she would never take money from any of us even if she had no money, so currently my sister gets more money to spend on weed than my mum has to feed 4 people and pay rent and other costs.

Not really sure why im making this post but this is how my life has changed in a year, sorry for shit grammar."

110,I've gone a whole calendar month without any suicidal thoughts,"I'm so pleased. I tried to kill myself on the 8th of March. I'd go up and down every 2 weeks from insanely happy to incredibly low. I've managed to stabilise and I'm feeling a lot better.

112,Please help me diagnose/explain what's wrong with me.,"I always just don't feel ok
, I  dread talking to others about most things,
 I've received some occasional bullying and name calling, mostly being called gay or stupid and it doesn't help that my mum is a teacher at the school I go to, as then if a talk about it it'll eventually get into my home life and that'll make it worse.
I always feel angry or like I want to hurt or harm some one, and 2 of my 3 brothers always gang up on me torment and annoy me.
I just want to go and curl up and cry in a corner some times, I need some sort of help but I want to know what I'm dealing with.
Any advice will help me."
113,Is it depression or am I still grieving?,"I guess the title is somewhat rhetorical. I’m putting this out there mainly to vent as I don’t have anyone to talk to, but if anyone feels like commenting then I’ll do my best to get back to you!

5 years ago I lost my mum. She had fought a battle with various for well over 10 years, but when she went it was kind of suddenly? She was deteriorating but she literally went from laughing and chatty one night to a zombie the next, and died a day later. 

I was really  close to my mum. Being her only daughter, I feel we had a special relationship. If I’m honest, though, I didn’t give myself much time to grieve. My way of handling the death was to keep myself busy and surrounded by people, be it family or friends. For whatever reason, friends fell away and I speak to my immediate family maybe once fortnightly. So the only person I have at the moment is my boyfriend. We have been living together for 4 years. 

Recently, I’ve been on my own a lot more. While my boyfriend has to work, I’m at home trying to finish the last bits of my uni assignments. As soon as he leaves, though, I’m struck with this sudden depression, and it happens any time I am alone. I’m not going to lie - I have thought about harming myself to try and channel my negative energy into one area (I have never admitted this to my boyfriend). My thoughts scare me, sometimes. I’m too afraid to seek professional help, though (I’m studying psychology and wish to be a counsellor so how stupid is it for me to want to help people when I can’t even help myself?).

I feel like I put unnecessary pressure on my boyfriend to always let me tag along, which is unfair to him. He needs his space, I understand that, but I simply cannot be left on my own. I never used to be like this. 

Is this depression I’m experiencing? Or am I still grieving the loss of my mum?

TLDR: Whenever I’m left alone, even for an hour, I am suddenly hit with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts. I never used to be like this, it’s only been since my mum died 5 years ago. 

Edit: Reading this back I recognise how rambling it is. Apologies for that, I can’t seem to make it any more coherent."
114,I think that i'm losing my mind,"Hello there. TLDR i've become kinda paranoide and i always have this feeling that somebody is watching. I have memory loss. Like i don't remember what happend two days ago. I don't want to call it anxiety, but i fear being robbed when im outside.

My sleep is relativly good.
I'm located in germany.
I didn't endure any childhood trauma.
I'm in my teens."

116,Sometimes you don’t have the privilege to not be okay.,"I know this sounds like an odd thing to say (how is not being okay a privilege if it’s a shitty feeling obviously) but I really think it’s true. Sometimes you don’t have freedom to be not okay. Sometimes you have no choice but to be okay, because if you’re not, then you will break those who love you. Sometimes you need to be okay because there isn’t any other choice."
117,Birthday,"It's my birthday today. I have a wonderful boyfriend and great friends. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm worthless, get in the way and I just want to die. I really want to but I know how much pain it would cause everyone and I can't bring myself to do it, I don't want to suffer anymore"
118,Deep/negative thoughts keeps coming at night,"
Hey guys, my closest uncle passed away on valentines day. Since that day, I couldn’t sleep at night. My uncle lived oversea and I haven’t seen him since I left to America (14 years ago) Story short, I knew he was battling tuberculosis and diabetes and the doctor told us to prepare for the worse. One night I received a phone call at 4AM, and I knew something bad is coming. I was right, my cousin called and told me “he’s about to die, and he wanted to see our family one last time before he passed away” quoted the exact words she said. We face-timed to see each other one last time and tears just rushed down my face after seeing him. Ten minutes later I received a text message from my cousin that said “he died.” 

I never felt like this my entire life. Since he passed away, every night I couldn’t sleep, the feeling of that night just keep on coming back to me. I could still feel the phone calls, I could hear the cries and the scream. Every time I closed my eyes, I could see him and the memories of him. I am okay during the day, but when night time hit, it kept me up sometimes til 6-7 in the morning. Sometimes I will be talking to myself and It changes my sleep patterns, and negative thoughts just keep coming in when im about to sleep I know its part of grieving, but it is affecting my sleep a lot. Any suggestions on how to handle this?"
119,"Performing your own trigger? (content trigger warning, just in case)","Is it normal for someone to do the exact same thing that triggers them when you're still hurt and haven't moved on? For instance, when in conversation you would have a breakdown when the topic suddenly discusses cheating in a relationship. However, other times, there's a part of you that just wants to let loose and cheat on your current partner because you're so mad at how this exact thing destroyed your life.

I know it's definitely not a healthy way to cope with your emotions nor should it ever be done, but I'm just wondering if feeling that way is normal? Is it normal to feel that way but still have the humane part of you stop you from doing that exact thing that hurt you in the past? How can you deal with that?"
120,[tw suicidal thoughts] Practical advice needed- Zoloft has stopped working on me but I don't want to up my dosage-feeling really suicidal,"I \[25f\] started taking it around a year and a half ago, 50mg a day. I have struggled consistently with depression since 13. For a year or so it really worked, and now it's wearing off. Not only am I now in one of the most destabilizing depressions I've ever had, but I also don't feel totally like myself (Zoloft seems to alter your sense of self slightly- at least if you are a chronically depressed person, as obviously the depression becomes such a significant aspect of how you move through life) so I have this added anxiety of not being sure if I can steer myself through this one. I have suicidal thoughts constantly- not just 'every day',constantly throughout the day, each day- and I just don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy (I did used to go and it really helped, but it's out of the question now) and during these incredibly crazy times I'm cut off from friends and family, plus everyone is kind of struggling to some degree or another and it seems tone deaf to talk people's ears off about my sadness atm. I really need help though, or to find the strength within myself to persevere. I exercise every day, I cook healthy meals, I talk to friends as often as possible, I keep a diary, I try and read to keep my brain engaged (though it's become pretty much impossible in the past few weeks with such poor cognitive functioning as the depression feels very overwhelming). If anyone has any advice on things beyond that I can do to try and push through it I would really appreciate it"

122,I'm the only good thing in my mother's life,My mother told me recently that i'm the only good thing left in her life and I dont know if I can handle it. I have severe mental illnesses and I'm hardly managing as it is without having the pressure of this. Plus I'm a minor and the weight of that statement from her mouth is dragging me down more and more and I don't know how long I'll be able go on like this. On the other hand she's my mother I can't not do anything and I can't tell her to find someone else. I know this is supposed to even give me a purpose in life to live for her but it's making me more and more suicidal and I have no idea how to talk with her about it.
123,My mother’s mental health is deteriorating and I don’t know what to do.,"So this is my first post, and I’m not sure if I’m asking the right sub, but I’m at my wits end, so here it goes.

My mom has a condition known as paranoia schizophrenia, which means that she hears voices that she can’t determine aren’t real, she was diagnosed 12 years ago, when I was in high school, went through a period of denial where she wouldn’t take her medicine, was sent to a medical hospital, and has been good ever since. When I say good, my mom is the nicest woman in the entire world, but she had a lot of lethargic behavior from what I can assume was the medicine, but she was loving by herself just fine.

Fast forward to a few months ago, somehow my over bearing aunt took over giving her her medicine. Don’t know why, because my mom has always taken her own medicine, but my aunt had been hinting at wanting to get more involved in my moms medical and mental health, but I just brushed it off because she says a lot of things....I shouldn’t have. My mom is prescribed several different medicines, but what we’ve recently found out is that my mom wasn’t taking all of her prescribed medicine and was doing just fine. The only medicine my mom was taking were her two psych medicines to treat schizophrenia (Ziprasidone and Haloperidol), this medince called topiramate (which we just found out that none of her doctors knew why she was even taking this and it was contributing to her lethargic behavior and memory problems), blood thinners and cholesterol medicine. What she wasn’t taking was a antidepressant called bupropion that she had been prescribed for years. Here’s where it goes to shit. I’ve never known my mom to be depressed, but my aunt sat in on a meeting with her doctor and case worker (mom is a vet) and pushed the fact that she was depressed. Remind you, no one, including me, knows that my mom isn’t taking her current antidepressant, so they prescribe her another antidepressant called sertraline.

After this is prescribed, my aunt starts administering my moms medicine as prescribed, this includes introducing 250 mg of antidepressants (200 of bupropion and 50 of setraline) into her system, along with doubling up her other medicines because my mom only took her evening doses of the medicines (ex. 60 mg of ziprasidone twice a day she would only take once a day). This started in February, I didn’t notice any thing until late March because I don’t live near my mom so we generally only talk on the phone.

 Come late March, I get a call from her and I can tell something is seriously wrong. She has become delusional and obsessed about things. She fell one time and couldn’t get up while I was on the phone so I had to drive 2 hours from where I live to her house since no one else has a key and  that’s when I found out how deep the issue is. It’s like my moms entire personality has changed. She’s obsessed with time, for a while she would go to the bathroom and sit for hours trying to take a poop (that has stopped here recently), she refuses to listen to reason, she doesn’t sleep and keeps getting up to clean no matter what time, she has become extremely needy, the voices have come back and are talking about depressing things like death, she tried to fake a stroke, she doesn’t eat, she’s started cursing( never heard her do it, didn’t even know if she knew curse words), and she’s started talking about and performing masturbation. The list goes on and me not my brother know what to do anymore.

My brothers friend is a psychiatrist, and she believes that the added medicine has taken her into a state of mania, so we’ve started tapering her off some medicines (her actual doctors actually started the tapering of the topiramate since they had no idea why she was taking it, that’s going down 25 mgs a week from two hundred until it’s gone and we have taken the sertraline back down to 50 mg after it was increased to 100 mg for some reason). In some aspects it feels like my mom has improved as far as her thinking and not being as foggy minded, but her personality still isn’t the same. It’s like she’s given up on life and independent living, she just wants to go to a psyche ward or nursing home, but I know that’s because she thinks that she’s a burden on me and my brother ( even now she says to just keep on living my life and don’t let her disturb it) which is how I know my kind hearted mother is still in there. I can’t give up on her but I just don’t know what to do. Does tapering of the medicine take a while to take effect? Is there permanent damage? Please help me.

TL;DR: I believe that my mom has been over medicated on anti depressants and possibly psych medicine, her personality has changed drastically and it seems like she’s given up on life. How can I fix this?"
124,What do you guys actually think of BetterHelp?,"So I have OCD and I can't afford to go to therapy. Although my OCD is not the most severe, it can really be draining to repeatedly manage the thoughts on your own. People have mixed feelings with BetterHelp because there are people saying it's irrelevant and a scam, but then there are people that actively use the app.
So I wanna know what you guys think, and if you are doing therapy while in quarantine, can you maybe give some tips?

Today I interview Mel Jang. Mel talks about meditation and when and how his spiritual journey all started. Why he started meditation and how it has significantly changed his life. We also discuss how the mind, body, and spirit are all interconnected and also the importance of a clean diet - not just the food that we eat, but also what we consume through our senses. We talk about 432hz, the frequency of the universe, and how it can make us feel at peace when we are exposed to it. Mel defines what spirituality means to him, he speaks how spirituality is having an awareness of the interconnectedness between everything and having the utmost respect for all living beings and that compassion, respect, and authenticity to be the 3 most important things that he has learned during his spiritual path.

126,I have to face that there’s still something wrong but don’t know where to begin,"(Trigger warning: suicide) Here’s a quick little rundown: Horrible anxiety all through high school, shortly after got extremely depressed and nearly ended my life. I made it through that, and thought I had it all figured out. But now I’m getting panic attacks again. Waking up anxious. I feel this constant need to prove everything to myself. At this point I don’t even know what to do about it. Today I sat down and faced it: I still have a mental health problem. Something, deep down, isn’t right up there and it’s throwing me off. But I have no goddamn clue what else I can possibly do and I can’t help but be afraid of this going on forever."
127,"Please help me: I cannot shake the shame of having had a breakdown, how can I move on?","I'll keep it as short as possible: 7 years ago I left a group that was violating my privacy online and spent 6 months with an emotional terror that they were after me. Then I recovered and started my life again, a year after leaving them. I never had trust issues before, never been paranoid, and have being doing fine since then. But I have this shame that I am not a normal mentally health person or that wouldn't have happened.

The longer version: I tried hard for 3 years to be part of that group even if I didn't believe their religion and didn't wanted truly to become a scholar, I was ""just"" after my emotional needs. After a while they hacked my gmail account and continued to be informed on everything I was doing (reading, mails, music, tastes, sexuality, everything) until I closed it. They commented on a regular basis about me, in my face, with oblique comments. I pleaded with them a lot to stop it or to understand me, because in reality I was a very different person than the one I tried to portray in that environment and they had ""found out"". I felt exposed and shamed about everything I love, from books to songs to fantasy characters, everything. Then I left, calling it quit and breaking contact with them. They let me go without trying at all to stop me.

The problem: even if it was a clean break I experienced months of a very strong irrational fear, I intellectually knew that they were gone and done but emotionally I was terrified that they were still spying on me, monitoring me through possible common acquaintances and my computer and phone, hounding me, I felt incredibly unsafe and lacking privacy on a fundamental level. I had my mother, sibling and best friend with whom I talked a lot and helped me, and those feelings subsided after a few moths and I was able to resume a regular life. Part of my torment is that when I confronted those people before living, about the privacy violation, they denied it and accused me of being paranoid and having a disturbed personality. My family and friend believed me and later I talked with a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist who fully believed me.

The reason why a psychiatrist was involved is that one person from that environment gave me the contact of another psychiatrist who during the first session said I was paranoid and put me on an anti-psychotic medication. Two months later, after many side effects like no periods, I went to another psychiatrist who was senior and had trained the previous one: he did extensive tests and said I don't have any trace of psychosis and informed me he would reproach the other psychiatrist when they meet. He took me off that medication and referred me to talk therapy, which is what I did: this therapist said that having being put on that medication traumatised me. Many years later I had talking therapy with another psychologist about a grief in my family and told her about this experience, and she confirmed that if it was a personality disorder it wouldn't have disappeared after few months from appearing. She said that what I did was to project on those abusive people, who reminded me of my abusive father, my fears about what my father was capable of doing to me (monitoring, judging, punishing me for disentangling myself from his clutch). 

And still... normal people don't have breakdowns. They never taste mental health medications. They don't get labeled, or mislabeled, with being mentally crazy and problematic. I worked so hard not to be like my parents, who had serious mental problems, and yet I fell into that category. I cannot really accept what qualified professionals and all of my relatives said, that I am not like them and mentally healthy. That shameful breakdown would have never happened. Do I have a chance to be ever normal again? I dearly want my life and my confidence back."

129,Why can’t I cry?,"Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but here we go lol!

I think the last time I (21m) cried was when I was 10/11. It’s not that I don’t get sad, but whenever I feel as though I could cry, all of my attention begins to focus on trying to cry, which obviously isn’t normal.

I was watching videos of me as a young kid yesterday (5-10), and I noticed that even then, I was very reserved around me family. I rarely seemed to show any intense emotion like extreme happiness or sadness. When opening gifts for my birthday, I have always been so focused on looking interested in the gift, that I am unable to have an actual reaction.

The more I think about it all, the more I feel like a sociopath lol. I know I’m not tho, because I’m a very sensitive, overly caring person, which is why I come off so reserved.

It is worth mentioning that I have  really bad pure-ocd, and I can definitely see how it could affect this.

I’m unsure if they are related, but how can I cry? And why can’t I cry? I want to be able to express my emotions to the fullest, without focusing on the aspect of actually doing it.

Thanks!"
130,No ability to concentrate and not understanding things that I already know,"Hey everyone, my brain is frustrating me. 

It feels like I just suddenly turn stupid and can't do things that I am normally capable to do. This shows itself when I am studying, usually I study X pages in X minutes and understand it but then in my stupid-phase I can barely read a page, because of my poor focus. I have to restart a sentence multiple times and all the words don't make sense to me. I look at things I have already learned and barley remember them. (For example, homework that is only 1 or 2 days old... I have no clue how I did it) My memory is very bad as well; so bad that I can't follow a conversation, because I forget what the other person or me said 2 sentences ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 2 years ago I have been diagnosed with depression. I have been taking anti-depressants for 1,5 years while also going to therapy. Since two months I have stopped taking the medication because I felt a lot better and I was able to sleep normally, thanks to the therapy. In the morning I am able to get out of bed without issuse, I work out for 15 min and take care of myself ect. ... Beeing able to sleep for 8 hours, getting out of bed with no problem in the morning and neither feeling down nor suicidal proofes to me that I am not depressed anymore. So why is my brain still broken and how can I fix it?"
131,I cant stop crying,not having a great time lately and right now I have been crying for 30+ mins can someone talk to me please
132,"Sometimes things just get so bad, that one day you snap out of it...","I grew up a happy kid. It wasn't until high school that I started pretending to be depressed for attention, as I was always in the lower tier of school popularity anyway, but after high school, that facade slowly ended up not being one at all.

Fast forward to just this year. Things were starting to look up for me, employment wise, and I was starting to get a stable mindset again. Then out of nowhere, I was fired for what I consider an unjustified reason (asking for advice on using my health benefits for therapy), and since I was let go right in the middle of the seasonal period, it was several months before I found another job. However, by this point, my mental health had reached a low it had never been before.

My best friend several states over noticed this and offered to have me move in with her and her fiance. And I obliged. It was okay at first, but as the days went on, I got more and more discouraged that I'd be left homeless in the middle of the COVID outbreak due to job opportunities being limited, and the apartment would not be willing to house me if I stayed unemployed. It got so bad that my room mates would stay cooped up in their room, afraid to even talk to me, because my cursing and hitting myself at night gave them major PTSD flashbacks.

Then, one night, after the very worst of it, I wrote down all my confusions on a piece of paper, only for myself to read, and went to sleep. The next morning, I woke up feeling completely refreshed, because now I understood all the miscommunication, what I was doing wrong, and how I could fix it. Room mates have already left the house to avoid me, and I got a text An hour later giving me an ultimatum to get better or I need to leave. I replied saying I actually already was and would life to discuss it with them later that night.

Several hours later, in the dead of night, they returned. And I could tell they didn't believe me at first. But once I looked directly into my best friend's eyes and outright told her that I'm done screwing things up and am unwilling to let this spiral continue, she changed her tune. She held that stare with me for several seconds, saw there was not a single ounce of doubt in my eyes, and knew that I was not making an empty promise. It's only been 3 days since then, but I've honestly never felt better. Not a worry or care in the world.

I believe what triggered this snap out of the darkness was me stopping to care about feeling like I belonged, and realizing what my behavior has been doing to those around me. Ever since then, the tension in the house has completely disappeared. It seems only after you stop worrying about how others see you, are you truly committed to fixing yourself."
133,It's time we admit work doesn't make us happy,"‘Workplace happiness’ is an elaborate charade. The reality is that for billions of people across the world, work is a tightrope walk between indignity and survival. There are seven ways we can rid ourselves of our obsession with happiness at work and focus on humanity instead.

134,I keep having this thought and I don't know it's been weird,"Science and advancement do bring depression, like if science is telling me that there's an infinite universe in which my life won't matter because it won't be noticeable so it takes out the motivation to live out of human beings because I'm the long run nothing will matter it's all just meaningless"
135,I miss having hobbies,"Every day is just so slow and boring. I try to sleep more to avoid being awake for many reasons. It’s a piss take I have lost all the passion I use to have as it’s all boring or I don’t see a point in it because I’m so crap at everything. 

I try anything and when I look it up there is always someone better at it. Just makes me feel inferior and worthless. I want to be decent at something and no matter how long I practice it is never enough. 

What the fuck can you do to pass the time quicker? I can’t get a job because I don’t have enough real world experience even with years of volunteering, going to college and university. No one is ever proud of me because there is nothing to be proud of. It’s disgusting how much of a waste I am....

I can’t provide anything for anyone. I have nothing to show or be proud off. Damn I’m not even pretty or good to look at. I look like a freak from the circus with everything to match. 

Before anyone says “talk to a friend or something” I literally have zero friends. They all left after realising how shitty I am. I have a partner yeah but I just make them depressed and miserable. I’m sure they just stick around because I’m a person to be with till they can find the right one. Even my family have turned their backs on me after seeing that I’m a failure."

137,Do I have a mental disorder?,So a couple of my friends have recently pointed out I listen to music non-stop and that they have never seen me not listening to music which I self reflected on and it's true. For reference just last year I clocked in 2000 hours of listening to music on spotify and even when im not listening to music I tend to put on podcasts 90% of the time when Im going to sleep. Could this be a sign of a mental disorder?

142,Depression/bipolar help in China,"Hello all!

I have a question related to mental health treatment in China. My friends mother has been clinically depressed and has been diagnosed with bipolar for the past 15 years now.

They have seen various doctors all of over China (mostly around Wuhan and Shanghai where they live). The drugs they give her only seem to make her be sedated all day long and when they wear off she is worse than before. And none of the therapists work (over 10 different therapists so far). She seems to be able to handle a therapist for just a couple of months until she absolutely refuses to keep seeing them and doesn't feel safe with anyone anymore.

There are periods when things get better, but for the most part she is scared to live even with her family, mostly traveling between her husband in Shanghai and her parents near Wuhan, each time growing more sick of staying with either one of them. The problem is she has no one else to stay with or to take care of her and she is afraid of people she doesn't know even more so than her own family.

With all of this said, if anyone has any suggestions towards online forums where Chinese people deal with and share this kind of stuff (that I could use to ask for more detailed help and opinions); doctor recommendations (only Chinese speaking though) or anything else at all, that would be greatly appreciated.

I understand the mental health system in China is not the best, but unfortunately for her, she can't speak any other language, so she can't really see any doctors outside of china, so any help and or advice is welcome."
143,Support for an emotionally available friend,"Hello guys! Would just like to ask for advices om how to deal with an emotionally distant friend. I have been friends with her for a long time now and it hurts to see her emotionally disconnected especially when she's stressed (which happens pretty frequently). She recognizes her emptiness and she's been really honest with me (especially when I try to confront her), but she still has her walls up, and I feel really bad that I can't do anything about it. For a person who feels like they need a private corner in their heart, how would you suggest helping my friend? Or how I do ask if she needs help especially if she doesn't want to speak about it sometimes? Thank you so much!"
144,My dad only hates me and i dont love him,"When i was a teen, he used to hit me if i didnt get good grades. He would sit next to me while i was studying to see if i was texting or not. And if i got a single text from my friend, he just took my phone away and didnt give it back to me.

I thought i didnt have any freedom back then. When i told my parents that i wanted to do music, my dad said you are too ugly and not talented for that. I wanted to kill myself just to show how much i hated my dad. I thought that was a temporary thought, but it turned out, it wasnt.


My sister was a weak girl when she was young. (She wasnt ill or anything she was really skinny and eaily got cold) So my parents didnt really care about her grades or anything. They wanted her to be happy. Thats it.

When we have a fight, my dad only yells at me. He never yelled at my sister. NEVER.

When i turned 18, i thought my dad realized that he made a mistake by being emotionally abusive to me. He started telling me how nice and loving he is to us. He said something like ""but we have a very nice family right? I mean we are like friends"" but it was never true. I shared nothing with him, and eventho he took us to other countries to travel, i always felt like he wanted to do that so he can feel better about himself. He still brings up how we enjoyed our family trips. He says theres no dad like him who takes children to travel. I doubt that.


Today i had a fight with my sister cuz we share a room, and my sister was calling with her bf in our room. I just walked in to the room to get my clothings and my sister yelled at me to get out of the room.(she always wants privacy) I got mad and i said i just wanna get my clothings. And i walked out of the room. I said what a bitch.

And my parents were so angry at me for calling my sister a bitch. They said i was the problem in this house and i am selfish. I said when i call with my friends i always go somewhere else and i didnt even know she was calling with her bf. And they talked shit about me like how selfish and inconsiderate i was. And now i have to sleep in the living room because i was being selfish. My sister yelled at me so i yelled back, and my dad only called my name. He said i need to shut the fuck up and control my emotion. While my sister did the exact same thing.


I've tried so hard but he is just disgusting to me. He called me ugly and weird my entire life. I dont want anything to do with him. Am i bad? I dont love him even a little"
145,Why do I keep thinking I have a mental illness?,"I keep somehow convincing myself I have some mental illness. I brush it off, telling myself I’m overreacting but the thought always returns. It’s been affecting my relationships with friends and family. I’ve been withdrawing from them all sitting in my room for hours going through articles and articles, Quora posts and reddit posts. I’m not sure how to deal with this obsession of mine. I’m sorry if this is offensive or something."
146,Is anyone else scared of their face being seen by other people?,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I have huge anxiety when people look at my face. I avoid eye contact so I can’t see them looking at me. I like to wear masks if I can and if not I’ll use my hair or scarf. I also like hiding behind my glasses, without my glasses I feel insecure and need to cover my face."
147,I finally figured out a schedule that doesn't overwhelm my ADHD!!!,"I've been struggling so hard with burning out at 3pm and not feeling like I've done enough. I was so happy when I found this post by ADHD SAHM. 10 minutes of work with at least 20 minutes of rest between each activity and the goal isn't ""done"" anymore. It's just to get through the 10 minutes. I can handle that. I had to modify it a bit (she doesn't have dishes specifically on her schedule) but on day 3 my house finally isn't destroyed, and I'm not spending 4 hours cleaning the family room only to have it destroyed. I've finally found ""enough"".

148,Is this normal for a teen?,"I was playing hide and seek with my little sister, and hid under a blanket. When she noticed me I was pretending to be our cat and accidentally hit her. I punched myself, slammed the door to my room and threw things around. Then my mom came in and shouted at me for what I did. I’m starting to ask is this normal for a teen? I’m 13. I felt so overwhelmed that I had no choise but to got to my room and get out the rage there."
149,"Sometimes I will have a ""risky wank"" in my home. I've read that this could be due to stress, but is there a deeper reason for this?","A risky wank is when you masturbate in an area where you run the risk of being caught by someone. Like masturbating with your bedroom door open, or in a library, or in the park. 

I do this at home (where it's not illegal, but potentially embarrassing). I do it because it makes the orgasm feel much more intense. I've never been caught, but there's a chance I may have been seen once or twice and my family just hasn't said anything because they don't want to embarrass me.

When I looked this up, I came across something called exhibitionism. But the definition doesn't quite fit what I'm doing. I don't *want* to get caught. I don't *want* anyone to see me. It's the risk that does it. Upon further investigation I found that some people may do this because they're stressed and this is a way to relieve that stress. That may be it, but I feel like maybe something deeper may be going on here."
150,Brain Injury/Mental Illness,"I've heard of numerous cases of people dealing with mental problems due to traumatic brain injuries, but have there been any cases that you guys know of that started with a mental illness that ceased after a brain injury? I know the brain works in very meticulous ways that even experts dont understand to some points. Any links/articles you guys could post would be helpful. Thanks in advance! 

PS. This is purely from a curiosity standpoint. I am fine and I hope you all are as well!"
151,Having a rough day today...,"I’ve been feeling great for the last few days but today I’m just feeling a bit rough. I’ve sat scrolling through twitter and seen everyone interacting with each other, seeing girls saying they have crushes on guys and I don’t know why I know it’s stupid but I just feel hopeless. I don’t think it helps that I was dumped only a couple of months ago, I’ve spent a lot of time on personal growth and trying to become a better me but it seems like I only have one close friend as I’ve had to cut a lot of friends off for being two faced and chatting shit behind my back. I’ve taken up new hobbies and stuff, but I don’t know it’s just one of them days"
152,Did i just have a mental breakdown?,"So a few minutes ago i was feeling really stressed and then i started to cry for no reason, shake and sweat. I have no idea what happened and it feels like its going to happen again. This has never happened before. Any advice?"
153,What can I do to help myself?,"(23 M // England) I’m really stuck, I’ve had really bad mood swings for the past couple of years, and they’ve become much worse the past 6 months or so, I’ve been having really bad problems at work because of it and the last time I had an outburst my manager told me to contact a GP for some help which I did last week.. 

So I spoke to the GP (over the phone) and she referred me to multiple websites and information pages and I’m currently waiting for someone to get back to me, but I don’t know how long it’s going to take and I’m having a really bad day today. She offered me antidepressants but I only feel like this maybe 30% of the time, so I declined, as they haven’t really helped me in the past, she said that she thinks I definitely have an underlying mood condition but now I can’t help but read shit online about it while I’m just sat here waiting 

One of my close family members says that she thinks I might be ‘manic depressive’ but I’m not really sure what that means, and I really don’t like to self diagnose myself but I do have a lot of time where I am uncontrollably happy and full of confidence and energy, which is the opposite of how I’m feeling right now

I really don’t know what direction to go in next but I really need some advice on where to go next please, I just need any advice and this is probably not the best place to post but I’m honestly out of ideas and can’t calm myself down please anyone I don’t know what to do"
154,How has crisis intervention succeeded &amp; failed culturally?,"Hello

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is currently working on a project for the city due to the coronavirus.   
we are looking for ways that crisis prevention has taken place from a culturally specific aspect. What were the actions that were put in place? What was the outcome? 

We are also looking for which ways it has failed from that aspect. Specific examples would be much appreciated. 

Any examples or resources provided will help immensely and will ultimately go on a document that will be sent throughout the entire state of California. Potentially sent on a larger scale as well.   


Thank you.

* I got pregnant
* We got married
* Took a break from therapy (therapist suggested it)

* My mother in law passed away
* Pandemic
* Taking care of a newborn
* A lot less contact with the outer world

157,Learning difficulties after childhood concussions?,"
Hello I have been knocked out (put to sleep) multiple times before around elementary and middle school. I was knocked out cold 3 times. I'm in my early 30s now and I've always struggled in acedemia and got held back in grade school. In college I couldn't pay attention and just barely got by with a mediocre trade school certification. I worked in the field but I wasn't very good and I was dreading the job everyday. I am looking to learn a new career but I cannot motivate myself to do so and when I do motivate myself to study I get distracted and when I fight off the distraction and try to focus I fatigue mentally really quickly. Can concussions affect my learning ability? Maybe my prefrontal cortex was damage. Can I see if I have brain damage or any ways I can help myself focus and concentrate better so I can absorb information better? I am also very impulsive and get distracted easily and often depressed with my accomplishments, work ethic, social economic status and cognitive capacity."
158,Mental health atm,"Hi 

so since quarantine started over a month ago, my mental health has been going downhill. Of course there are good days, but then also the bad. I know I'm not the only one struggling with this, but I still feel incredibly lonely at times. I feel like It'll never get better (not necessarily corona, but the way I feel). The reason why I feel so lonely is because in January I left home to go to boarding school in Eswatini (Swaziland). I absolutely loved it there. I finally felt at ease with myself. I was surrounded by the most amazing people. But then of course Corona came along and I had to come home after 2 months there. It's not been easy, what with online school and not even being able to see my friends here at home again.  What makes it even harder is that I'm in a LDR. He lives 9000km away:( 

What really messes with my head, is that I don't know when this will be over, I don't know when I'll be able to go back and I don't know when I'll see my boyfriend again. I'm scared that better times won't come back.

Any advice? Any tips to help me document my feelings or to turn them into something productive? Or do you know about any mental health programs/plans I can participate in?

Thank you for listening/reading:)"
159,At least it was easier back then...,I've been weirdly nostalgic over times that weren't so great. Things are much worse now than they used to be. I guess I just miss the optimistic hope I had that things would be better. Things were simpler back then and I had friends. I miss the days were I was just anxious. I wasnt suicidal or had to deal with intrusive thoughts and depression all the time. I guess I feel guilty for squandering those years and I feel hopless. My future just feels so bleak.
160,I need help diffusing anger,"I don't know what to do about this in the moment. It's easy to say ""stay calm"" but in the moment you're not thinking clear. I always end up saying or doing something I regret and I immediately regret it. It's beginning to effect my relationships"
161,Support groups?,"So I was attending in person bipolar/depression support groups but with corona they have ended. The only option that my local hospital where the meetings were is a site (dbsalliance) but you have to pay for it. Does anyone know of any free groups? I'd be looking for ones about depression, anxiety, or I was thinking of maybe a book club one where you read and discuss self improvement books. Really any help or recommendations would be highly appreciated"

164,Ive been made to feel worthless by my peers but i will not except that as the truth,"I was not the best child( not the most social) but people would go out the way to show that they hated me. Many of my memorys are repressed because of this but what do remember consists of bullying and being indirectly told i was hated. It was the little things that got me like how if they were handing out books they would never hand it to me but slam it on the table infront of me and if i tried to join a conversation they would start shutting me down saying that i wasnt invited or that no one cared about what i had to say.The feelings of worthlessness made occasionlly brake down in class and this made it worse. I have just had another brake down today, years later, because i realised most of my insucuritys stem from these neglected years. I am at better place mentaly now but how can i undo years of being programed to feel worthless"
165,Can someone tell me what I’m experiencing,"Basically I’ve been through a lot of emotional abuse and stress growing up.

Now I just kinda sit blankly and my mind wanders to think of different events and things. Like I could be sitting down and I would not be “present”  I don’t hear voices or anything it’s just my mind wanders off and thinks off a memory or I imagine myself doing some things in certain scenarios. Otherwise than that I also feel numb emotionally. I have a lot of problems and I feel as if my mind wants to escape it. I also don’t do anything and hate going outside. I hate other people seeing me for some reason. I smoked weed and I felt all the emotion and problems come back but then I zone back out. Btw I’ve been off drugs for like a year now.  Other than that my diet is terrible, I just stare at a computer all day .

166,My passion is my depression,"I've had long-term depression since I was 5. I lost a parent and was introduced to death/depression very early. I am content with it and received the correct care to cope with death. But as my life progressed, I dealt with exceeding mental issues and now I'm almost done with my first year of college and I have no idea what I'm doing. I don't want people to tell me ""you're not supposed to know what you're doing right now"" I know that. But I'm still searching for SOME sense of direction, even just wanting to work with animals or go into a healthcare job or something that involves writing or plants I have no clue. I'm not looking for the whole answer just SOMETHING to get direction. I try and try something I like then eventually let it go because I don't want to do it anymore. You name it, I've tried it. And I give it my best shot because I truly do not want to be in this state forever. It seems so easy for me to eliminate what I don't like instead of finding what I do like. The only constant in my life has been depression and anxiety with a new family member called PTSD. I've been in therapy since I was 6, I'm almost 20, and I feel like the only thing I'm good at is being depressed. At most, I'll have a 4-6 month period where I feel okay, but I always return back to my depressed state. I am in therapy and my family is aware of my issues, but it feels like there's nothing out there for me. I know there is, but I don't have the drive to do anything but lay in bed."
167,What's your guy's experience with lithium,I've been put on it 2 weeks ago and I am wondering how it's been for you guys. I haven't noticed any side effects except constipation
168,Out of place / true calling,"Hello, I'm 26, male and currently living in Ireland for the past 6 months now. I am originally from Greece and I wanted to move out to make a new beginning, start my journey of self discovery.

A little bit about me. If you're familiar with the 16 personalities and enneagram, I am an INFP and type 4w5. They sum up a good amount of my personality and values.
I am an artsy person, love music, I play the guitar, I love photography, movies that touch me, paintings, some literature, video games and of course the brilliance of nature.

Currently working in a big pizza chain, making pizzas in a small town in South Kerry. Ireland was always a part of my heart because of the vast landscapes and music. I made that small dream true by coming here at last.

I can say that I am the best of myself nowadays, I have accepted who I am and understood of my potential. I became very close with the philosophy of the Stoics and that really helps me stay healthy in the mind. Like, come what may, I will embrace it and surpass it. I don't mind the hardships in life. I wouldn't be the same if not for them.

The help that I need now and almost always needed is finding my calling. Professionally speaking in a sense. A workplace for me really means more than doing it just for the money. I want to wake up and know that the thing I'm doing is worthwhile for me and for the people around me.
I am trying to find my Ikigai. Something I love doing, something I'm good at, something that pays and something the world needs.

I have a strong desire to help people, in any sense, be it physically or mentally. I would like to combine art with helping people and somehow be close to nature as well.
I simply cannot find, decide, don't know where to look, where to start, how do I surround myself with the right people for me. I'm feeling stuck and out place, unmotivated, no drive, even though I want to do so much.

Some of my strengths, values and things I love I've written down are :
Photography
Travelling
Foreign languages
Nature
Hiking
Arts
Music
Meeting authentic people
Cultures
Honesty
Good listener
Great intuition
Observer
Appreciation of beauty and excellence
Environmental awareness
Forgiveness
Helping others
Mental health awareness

I just can't find out where to start or what things I can do, what is available out there. If I just work to have money and survive it has no meaning to me. I'll feel empty my whole life.
Thanks for the read, I don't expect any magic reply but anything could be helpful. I hope you have a good day"
169,I think I'm broken,"Today has been a rollercoaster. I normally feel down and am always thinking self deprecating thoughts. But today has been something else and I feel broken.

My mind has been a foggy mess today. I feel overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings and emotion. To the point where I don't even know what I feel. I normally feel empty but today I feel on fire.

Normally in the morning I feel okay and happy. But nothing has made me happy today. Not even that first sip of tea or pizza. This morning I went to brush my teeth and I sat down on the floor and then couldn't get up. After a ten hour sleep I was so exhausted I couldn't even walk to the sink. 

Then I started to shake uncontrollably and I went into the shower (fully clothed without turning it on) and continued to shake until I calmed myself down.

I've also felt sick today and I am constantly panicking. Shaking, nausea, fatigue idk what IS WRONG WITH ME. 

I feel as if something bad is going to happen really soon. Nothing has helped today, not even cutting."
170,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"

If you’ll allow me I think it’s easier for me to describe how I feel and how I think I got here. 

When I was 17, I had all the energy in the world. I was a crackhead. Not actually though metaphorically speaking. I had enough energy to do everything and anything i put my mind to. The people I surrounded myself with were toxic, yet I would go to unbelievable lengths to feel validated by my peers. Yet, the only validation i ever got was being at the butt end of every joke. I would never let it get to me though. School was almost equally as funny. I would skate through classes with little to no effort. Wouldn’t do homework or class work would just send it for the tests and get lucky. Part of the reason why I think I did so good is, I’m told I can be very perceptive. It was hard to think there was a problem back then but the way i feel. In that aspect at least I’m confident, it was always there. 
Over time things changed though, my crackhead energy went from being a constant  force that I could pick up on and used to own advantage, which slowly turned into random/rare sudden outbursts of energy. I had mellowed out and had become lazy. Sluggish and tired.  Part of the reason could be because I felt crippled from an injury I never got over, another reason is probably the marijuana. After smoking straight for two years I can see how that can effect someone. My social life hit its “peak” in my freshman year of college. My unhealthy friend group was exchanged for people that I actually wanted to be around. That valued me. And I ruined everything. That’s when things turned on me. That’s when I had this decline. My ability to focus or stay motivated evaporated. I had no drive or energy to care about school work. My thoughts were starting to trip over themselves. I found it hard to concentrate but I expected that things would be fine like in high school so I didn’t feel the need to concern myself or try. I would get lost in distractions, Netflix, partying, video games. I wasted an entire year at school $70000 of my dads money and did not pass one class. I was forced to come home. Lost all my new friends, my old ones had their own lives where I was of little interest. I spent my first year home struggling. Unable to help but feel lesser, like an idiot, and defeated. I also felt this unbelievable wave of guilt. No matter how hard I tried for the next 2 years nothing would get better. My grades were a roller coaster and despite my intentions I would always skate by doing the minimum. I’m in a 2 year college and I might graduate after 5. My ability to think clearly deteriorated. Stress and what I presume to be ADHD clouded my every thought. All my sentences became run ons. All my thoughts were incomplete and my inner voice was like a gps that has 6 different destinations set at the same time. That’s when I started smoking a lot. I had convinced myself that being high helped. Helped me think and stay concentrated. But eventually that slipped out of existence but I kept smoking because it was all I knew. My inability to focus kept getting worse. My mood started changing. 
I think what put me over the edge was moving out. My relationship with my family had fallen on hard times because i was feeling misunderstood. Now, I’m living with one of the only good friends I had left and his girlfriend. I was renting a room. Bouncing from job to job and could barely afford to eat. It’s only been 4 months and I have seen my personality make some sharp turns. I don’t eat. Don’t leave my room. I am scared to even try to do school work because if history has taught me anything is that I’m meant to fail. My life is becoming as cluttered and chaotic as my thoughts. I’ve lost interest in everything. My hygiene tanked and my sex drive disappeared almost completely. I feel cornered now because I have no idea what to do. I am convinced that there is a reason I am like this. Mental disorders / a brain injury. Something. And I’m scared because I don’t know what I’ll do if it isn’t. And If it is true what if I’ll never be normal again."
171,Reality is boring.,"I think I've built a barrier between me and reality. I believe it is very unhealthy &amp; it's getting problematic.
But, did anyone else notice how boring this reality is? It's always about work, money &amp; what everyone else expects you to do. I wish I could live in wonderland with Alice. I don't want this anymore."
172,How to get over habits from depression and anxiety.,"I’ve developed a really bad habit of being lazy. It came from dealing with depression as a child and having no one to reach out to. I would spend hours on technology like my phone or television because there was nothing else for me to do and now I feel like I am addicted to it and cannot stop. I have times where I have a week where I work hard toward something and really apply myself , but it seems like I always have a week or two after that I’m extremely lazy. I’ve tried to help out books and lots of other things but it’s hard for me to get started with the task and to finish that task out without giving up. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions?"
173,I feel trapped and I need help..,"Hello, fellow redditors! 
I am writing this post seeking help for my anxiety and depressive episodes. I am a 22 y/o computer science student, bald headed scarred mf. 
 Unluckly, my financial state won't allow me to pay for a face-to-face therapy so yeah..I'll take it out here.
Right now I find myself to be in a difficult position regarding my mental health and I find it really difficult to put it into words. I had a brief experience involving cancer and tumours (one of my testicles was extracted) which gave me a lot of trust issues regarding my sexual performances. In the process, my girlfriend cheated on me (about one year ago) and I've been single since. I wasn't able to connect with anyone since and my crippling depression is starting to show its claws. It's ripping my insides when I get rejected and to be honest with you, I can count on one hand the times I've been accepted for anything in the last two years.
My parents wouldn't understand my inner pain and also my friends tend to not care at all. 
Right now I genuinely like a girl (first one in a very long time) but I fear of what rejection aftermath may wake up inside me, so I won't let her know about my feelings. 
I am at the lowest and loneliest point of my life and I have no fkin idea how to cope with it."
174,I don’t know if my feeling is warranted,"I am in treatment right now, and on leave from work. Due to COVID I was allowed to keep my device in the facility. I just saw a text from my work line where my boss told a guest that I was in hospital so she cannot leave her desk due to being on call. This resulted in the sweet guest inquiring about my status (if I was ok). 

I would be livid but I did do readings today on anger and I recognize my boss was probably (irresponsibly) providing the guest with a reason why she couldn’t tend to them herself. Okay, understandable, but is there a violation of privacy here? Or am I just over-reacting?

I know I am prone to (what I now understand is “splitting”) but I don’t know if this is a proper emotion to have as having people know what is happening in any form does not make me comfortable. 

I was hesitant on returning to work due to the amount of stress and pressure put on me and this makes me even more hesitant and anxious. 

Any advice or insight?

Also on my alt. because well nature of the post."
175,Has anyone had a good experience with online therapy?,"I finally am ready to start seeing a therapist but because of everything going on, it’s not possible to speak to someone in person. Has anyone found apps like BetterHelp and TalkSpace helpful? I guess I feel awkward about video chatting but maybe it’s not so bad?"
176,I think my brother is mentally ill please help,"Hello, so my brother is 15, he’s always had anger issues years ago, but as he’s gotten older it has gotten worse. He can never be in the wrong in situations, he’s always verbally attacking others, he’s physically attacked me and my family by pushing, while we got in an argument because we came across a disagreement. Ever since Quarantine, he hasn’t done any online school, when my parents bring it up to him, he flips out and says horrific things to my parents. He was on medicine which was Zoloft, and while on that medicine he still suffered with anger issues, but it was a lot better. Through the years he’s lost friends, and seems to be depressed. We thought it would’ve been a good idea since he kept asking to get off of it for Quarantine since he wouldn’t be in school. Bad idea. He’s changed so much and refuses to get help or take any medicine. I don’t know if he has bipolar issues, I thought it could be Schizophrenia, but from what i know he does not get any hallucinations. Someone please help and try to identify with what this is or what we can do. He freaks out on us, and doesn’t want to get help. Thank you for anyone to who read this. 
Disclaimer: I know it was wrong for us to take him off the medication but he would’ve stopped taking it either way, and now when we ask him to take the medicine, he refuses and flips out on us. Living with him is like walking on egg shells, we feel like we have to be careful with everything we have to say. Or he will freak out on us. It’s like he wants to keep making our lives miserable and doesn’t want to get help. Thank you for reading."
177,Struggling a bit/need to vent some thoughts.,"I don't really know where to start, I've been struggling a bit lately. I'm also sorry for any errors in formatting, I'm sorta new to making reddit posts.

I started in some group therapy in january, for other people with anxious/evasive personality structures. It was put on hold after the whole pandemic started, but this week it started up again (though with some new restrictions, not bad ones) and I don't know if that's what brought all this on, or if I'm just going through another sorta rough period. And I don't know if I just need to vent my thoughts, or if I want advise, or what is going on... And it sucks not knowing, and not feeling like I have anyone I can turn to for help. Most, if not all, of my friends and family all have their own problems, and I don't want to burden them with my thoughts and feelings. 

I've also been struggling with not really knowing, it came up slightly in therapy, I mentioned I felt a bit ashamed for everything being sort of ""paused"", because it feels like my whole life has been on pause for such a long time. I'm almost 25, I don't have any education other than the standard one that stops at 16 here, I'm supposed to know what I want to do, and every time someone asks I tell them some kind of lie like ""Oh I want to be... something"" or I tell them I'm not sure but I have some idea of what to do. But I really don't.. And I feel so ashamed of it. Like I'm wasting peoples time and attention. 

I don't have a job, I get by on this money from a sort of government assistance that we have here, and there's this sort of contact person through that, that I have to talk to every couple of months. She's pushing me to start this thing, that's supposed to be like a school but not really, and it's supposed to help with figuring out what I want to do. The problem is I've done something like it three times already, and she refuses to listen when I tell her I don't think it'll work, or that it's not what I need. I don't know what I need, or want, but I really don't think it's that. She also seems really condescending when she speaks to me, I used to think that was all just something I imagined, but I got it confirmed when I brought it up with another social worker I mentioned that to, that I was far from the only one who thought that. 

I've tried to do some kind of further education, you really need to do that here to get any kind of job, and I've tried a lot of different things, some of them more than once, but every time there's something that goes wrong. I keep telling myself, and other people, a lot of excuses. But I'm not sure they're valid excuses anymore. But if they're not, then I don't know what it is that happens that makes me feel like I have to drop out, that I can't keep going. Last year I was going to an online school, and it went amazingly well at first and I felt like I was happy, but then I missed one assignment, and I kept pushing it out of my mind, and then I kept missing assignments. And then at the end, right before the final tests, instead of going and taking the tests I panicked and left. I still don't know what went wrong. The social worker I talk to weekly (different from the contact person I have to talk to every couple of months) said she was sure it was because it was online school, and I was at home and not seeing a lot of people. But I don't feel like that's right, I've never really had an issue with not physically seeing a lot of people. 

But I don't know what's wrong, or why I keep failing at things. I guess it's something new I should bring up in the group I go to, it is sorta the point of me being there. 

I hope this isn't too long, and if you read all of it, thank you for listening to my thoughts. I know they're a bit of a mess, and I'm sorry for that, but thank you for letting me vent here."
178,People as Objects,"Is there a correlation between seeing people as objects and mental illness? If so, what do you think spurs this view point? I had an episode of psychosis and had a lot of anxiety..I believe I am healing..my ego is shrinking (went through a stage of feeling grandiose) and it hit me that people are REAL and are not for use and our disposal. It was kind of a brilliant moment..but what do you think this was caused by? What makes people think other people are objects?"

Are there any ways for me to help them? Activities/olans is greatly appreciated. Thanks"
180,Help with regaining weight quickly? I've been (unintentionally) starving myself,"I feel like I just woke up today. I've dealt with OCD since I was a kid (diagnosed and seeing a psychiatrist) and bouts of depression and anxiety that come and go. When I'm depressed it's really easy for me to not eat. It's hard to describe but its almost like I don't feel hunger. I also just forget to eat all day. It's really easy for the whole day to pass with me having eaten nothing. 

I guess I thought the little snacks and meals with my entire family were keeping me at my current weight, but I looked at myself in the bathroom today and feel like I finally saw my body. I can count all my ribs very easily. I can't extend my stomach at all, it's literally like fucking concave. I look like skin and bones and its disgusting. I've never thought of myself as having an eating disorder and I still don't, but I'm finding it really difficult to put on weight and I desperately want to get back to a healthy body. Does anyone here have any tips in regards to keeping track of eating to gain weight, and maybe some foods and supplements that are really good for gaining weight?"
181,I've recently been diagnosed with TLP and I'm having a lot of suicidal thoughts.,I've never posted on here. It's my first time in my subreddit but I don't know where else to ask for help. My family is supportive but I'm too ashamed to go tell them that I'm thinking about re-atempting. Please leave some tips for coping with tlp and these thoughts. Thanks.
182,Does anyone else have this problem?,"I’ve always struggled with anxiety, and I’ve never been able to trust people very easily. I attribute that to a couple of toxic friendships that I had when I was younger. I am wondering if maybe this is a symptom of all of that, or maybe a different problem. Or maybe I’m just making it all up. I don’t know but I was wondering if any of y’all have any similar problems to this. 

Sometimes, I feel like I am physically incapable of sharing (or sometimes even forming) opinions. Especially when it comes to small things like where to eat or what movie to watch while hanging out with other people, I have difficulty voicing an opinion. Usually with that, people will ask me to say what I want and when I say I don’t know, they act like I’m just being accommodating but I really truly don’t know what I want. 

Then there’s times where I want to say something about something someone has done that bothers me, something I’ve decided I want to do, or something that I’m feeling and I physically can’t. I’ll have it all worked out while I’m alone, exactly what I want to say and how I want to say it, but when I try to say it, I end up just staring at a wall trying to will the words to come out. This even happens with people I really trust, like my close friends, my sister, or my parents. 

This extends even to major life decisions, where I physically cannot bring myself to make a choice and when I finally do, I absolutely refuse to change it until it becomes completely obvious that it’s not going to work because I’m so sure I won’t be able to make another choice. 

It’s getting to the point where I am realizing my friends really don’t know me at all. I put up this fake exterior of confidence and sarcasm, determined to protect myself from whatever perceived dangers lie in actually telling them what I want. I don’t think they really know the real me and I am incapable of letting them see it. 

Does anyone else understand what I’m talking about or have a similar experience? Does anyone know how to fix it other than just to force myself to say it?"
183,Some questions about DID,"I've tried researching about DID (dissociative identity disorder), and I have some basic questions if anyone can answer them. My girlfriend has DID and I'm trying to learn and understand all I can.

1. When the alter that is out goes to sleep, do they all sleep at the same time? Also, why is it that any one of them can come out when they wake up?

2. The protector alter comes out most out of all of the others. There are about 10 total now that we are aware of. The protector alter is also a child, age 6. Do you have some tips on how to properly deal with that? She has become very trusting of me, and I want it to keep it that way, so any tips are appreciated. 

Thanks in advance for any responses to this."
184,What’s happening to me?,"I have always had a bit of OCD but this is nothing like it.. Starting around Christmas 2018 I stared to have minor fear of ruining special events. For the next few months during special events i would get anxious about if I made the most of it. It really tipped during a trip to Europe, where after getting stressed about something irrational I began worrying if I had ruined my vacation by this. No matter how irrational I knew it was I couldn’t break this constant rumination. This has ruined several special events where leading up to it I will get nervous I will ruin another fun time with my irrational thoughts and this fear always ends up ruining it. Now I am just so depressed over the fear that I will never be able to experience the joy of these events ever again. This isn’t something I can snap out of either. It’s a cycle and I want to know what you guys think is wrong with me."

186,I need someone to talk to.,"I know it's not good to get armchair diagnoses but my parents won't let me see a therapist, so I have no one to talk to.

This morning I woke up, I made myself breakfast, I took a shower then I walked for 3 miles. I felt good, happy, i felt like i had a purpose and goal. I came home and decided to take a nap, I woke up and I couldn't get out of bed not out of exhaustion but my brain wouldn't let me. Thoughts of suicide kept coming, thoughts about how useless I am, how i don't deserve to live. So all I could do was curl up and cry. It's an everyday occurrence, in the mornings I can talk and laugh to strangers, bur later in the day I feel nauseous and panicked when I see a stranger. I've tried to explain this to my parents, it doesn't make sense to me so how can they understand. 
Most of my mornings are spent doing a day's work cause I know that at night i won't be able to do anything other than cry. This also goes with affection, in the morning I shower my mom with kisses and hugs, we talk and laugh but in the afternoon or at night I can't talk or touch her."
187,Need some tips on how to get back to reality,"Okay, finally after a trip fishing I finally found the root of my problems, I'm so in my head, thinking of all sort of existentialist things and out of life fears, and mental illness and things of that nature.

189,"Need help seeing other ways of looking at this so I dont have to end my 10 year friendship with a supportive person, whom I am also support to.","He’s my best friend. As soon as we met we were like family, we shared the same childhood trauma and I guess we subconsciously knew we each needed what we had found in each other.

We settled in to a sibling/best friend kind of dynamic and it was great.

The problem is I trusted him completely. Last year he just ditched me. Cold, had no remorse, months went by, no conflicted feelings just flicked a switch and one day I was family, the next I was no one to him. It broke me.

Over the year we have patched stuff up, he has tried to make amends, we are sorta close again but that bond of trust is well we aren’t family anymore, I wish we were. I do t know how to get back there and don’t know if he even wants to. I think we are both scared and feel the loss of each other but are stuck.

So the mental health part is we both have a lot of childhood trauma, abandonment issues, CPTSD from child abuse. I’ve been really working on it had a great handle on it but I feel like this lesser relationship with him is kind of a constant abandonment, because he never really came back and I think I may have to give up.

He has a great heart but isn’t getting the help he needs. I help any way I can. I love him like family so do not want to reinforce his old wounds buy ending our friendship and I know I would continue to miss him the rest of my life but this quasi relationship puts what we have lost in my face day after day.

Anyone wise have a way to reframe this, help me continue with what is still an only friendship even though it isn’t what it once was? I need help.
I can’t just keep burying the issue. I need to know how to heal it so the friendship can continue.

Thanks in advance"

I KNOW this is super paranoid to think. I know meds could help me, but when I actually have the pills in my hand or mouth I cannot do it because Im sure they will kill me. 

Ive had delusions throughout my life, every time they were thought insertion/my thoughts being stolen by external forces. And the next day, I know it was a delusion. Im self aware after the fact.

I thought more about it, I realized that maybe if my doctor knew I cant take the meds because Im too paranoid/distrusting, my diagnosis would change. But I know I am paranoid. Wouldnt I not be self aware of paranoia, if this was a part of mental illness?"

i’ve struggled with anxiety for years, it’s not nearly as bad as it used to but i’ve started having panic attacks mainly to do with my ex.

looking back at the relationship i feel sick and groomed, i was 15 and he was 18 and i just feel like i was completely manipulated and abused. it wasn’t like he hit me but he guilt tripped and gas lighted me a lot, it often involved sex, i started a new medication which lowered my sex drive a lot and i’ll never forget the way he touched me although he knew i hated it, the way he said i don’t love him because i wont have sex, i feel like throwing up just thinking about it. 

I cant stop these anxiety attacks about this, hes friends with people i know and i cant escape him, my anxiety is getting worse and i don’t understand why. I have a new partner now and he’s incredible but i worry i’m going to freak out sometime, i’m currently 2 months clean from self harm as well and i want to continue for my new partner but i’m so scared. i don’t know what i’m supposed to do, who i’m supposed to contact and what do i even say to them. Can someone help? my anxiety is getting worse and worse"
199,Having a rough last couple of days.,Was supposed to start a new job yesterday but called out sick the last two days because my anxiety and depression have just gotten the better of me and I've just kinda laid in bed the whole time. I'm hoping to muster the courage/strength to show up tomorrow or idk if I'll be able to keep the job but when I think about having to go and idk be the new guy and learn a bunch of stuff it just feels like too much and I get overwhelmed and just don't want to do anything.
200,[19 M] I'm starting doubt I'll be able to function anymore. Please help.,"I woke up and felt no motivation at all to do the things I need to do or usually want to do. I didn't wanna eat, I didn't wanna play video games, I didn't wanna study, I didn't wanna workout, I didn't wanna work on creative projects. **Simply thinking about those activities felt like they were fruitless labor, none of what I do will ever bring any result.** At the same time I felt agonizing guilt of not doing anything and wasting time, along with anxiety and frustration of feeling this way.

It was like experiencing non-physical paralysis. It was so dreadful and scary. My depression was mild until this year, it wasn't ever this bad. Towards 11:30 pm (I woke up at 7:00 a.m) the symptoms began to subside a little and I'm using what little drive I have to type this post. If this does continue I don't think I'll be able to function and my life will be devastated

**I ask you not to suggest ""toughing it out"", I've given it a genuine shot and it's useless (my brain just forces me to believe whatever I'm doing is of no value and that I'm just wasting my strength)**

Note: I've been depressed and suicidal since early 2019. I don't have people I can talk to about it, not people who care at least. Therapy and meds are not an option (they just aren't)"
201,Question!!,"Is it gay/ stupid for me(I’m a guy, and NO guys in my school would ever post this) to put up on my story a pic of the mental health awareness month post on my story just to put up. The post looks very girly, and there are stars on it, 🥱 and guys in my school already call me gay. Isn’t that gay to put on my story? Should I avoid doing it so I don’t second guess what people will say cause I know I would right away think that. Plz help!"
202,Fuck I’m falling off the edge again,"Y’all ever go through the same cycle enough times that you can just *feel* each stage of it as it comes, but you’re not sure how to block it? 

I was sorta doing alright what with the quarantine and stuff, but last week I finally slipped and now I’m as deep down in it as I used to be. I can’t get myself to do my work, I can’t bear to show up to class and see people, I’m not even getting any joy from my escapes like movies and games and shit anymore, which means I’m about a day away from the stare-blankly-at-the-walls kind of shit. I can’t remember how I pulled out of it last time, I’ve been typing an email to my professors all fucking day and can not find the right words, and I just feel like a giant jackass because I pushed away all the friends who would have been here to support me, and that’s my fuckin fault. Fuck this"
203,I had to let this off of my chest,"You dont have to do anythong or say anything here
I just wanted to let it off my chest
Ive been having suicidal thoughts since november last year  and no one knows
Idk why im like this but i am, dont worry i wont harm myself  or even attempt anything to put mylife or anyones life in danger, but godamn it its soo frustraiting and lonely,"
204,Extreme fear and paranoia,"Throwaway account cuz im scared. 
Im (21f) really nervous to post this but heres the thing. (sorry for the spelling errors, english is not my first language) 
 Im not sure if knowing you are paranoid is actually having paranoia but I can't sleep beacuse of it and i cant study for college or focus on anything. 

 Ive had extreme hypohondria since i was a kid and i grew up in a very disfuntional, abusive family. Each time im away from home (yes i still curently live with this abusive family)  i fear something bad will happen. My father is very abusive and destructive. He has cheated on my mom multiple times and donwloaded spying apps on her phone. Im also 80% sure the whole house is full of avdio listening devices. I once found a usb with recordings of phone conversations. I fear my own dad beacuse he is very unstable. 

 I constantly fear something will happen to my dog or she has some diesese or something when she does something out of the ordinary or has a small symptom. 

and if im not worrying about that im worried that my boyfriend is cheating on me (he is a great guy and never cheated on me so i dont understand why i keep thinking so and i really want to stop beacuse im afraid hes gonna start hating me)..i guess i have very low self esteem.

 And lastly i keep worrying about my own health. Either that i have some form of cancer or something. Depends on what kind of symptom i have. 
I really dont know what to do at this point. I cant really talk to anyone about my feelings.  I dont really feel suicidal or want to self harm but im very tired of constantly living in fear. 

Should i get therapy? Is there something I can do about it myself first? 
Any advice would be apriciated.."
205,Change in eating,"Anymore it’s like I barely have an appetite. When I do manage to try and eat something, I can’t eat much without feeling nauseous. Nothing really sounds good to me anymore either. I don’t think ‘ooh that sounds good’ about any foods really. I’ll feel hungry, but have no desire to eat because absolutely nothing sounds appealing. When I do eat, it’s only because I want that feeling to go away so I don’t feel like I’ll pass out. I don’t get it."
206,I'm a coward and I feel like a liar,"I've struggled with depression for years and I've been self harming for close to 8 years. I stopped recently but lockdown in the UK has got me doing it again...
Except I cant draw blood. I want to. I want to feel pain and see my blood well up but I cant and I feel like a liar and a fake compared to everyone else who suffers with depression...
I'm a liar for saying I self harm compared to others and I'm a coward because I cant cut deep enough"
207,Fuck (tw),I fucking hate everything there are no words to describe how much I hate everything and everyone and myself especially myself I deserve to be hit and burned and die painfully because I am absolutely worthless I’ve done nothing with my life but be a pathetic fucking leech the world would be so much better if I’d died during birth my family wouldn’t have to put up with my bullshit I’m a disgusting mass of rotting garbage I’m wasting air I’m sorry to everyone I am a mistake
208,"If you take Invega/Paliperidone, how does it make you feel?","Hey guys, I doubled both my dose of Paliperidone (AKA Invega) and Lamotrigine (Lamictal) this week. I've been on a high dose of lamotrigine before, but Invega is new to me. If you've taken Invega, how did it make you feel? I notice I lack motivation and I'm hungrier, especially since increasing the dose, but I've also been far less volatile. Do you ever notice that you feel strange or off starting a new med?"
209,Get mind off a disturbing video?,"Today I was scrolling through twitter and someone who I was following liked a very disturbing and traumatizing video...
Now I can not get my mind off it. It pops up in my mind and I literally get chills and stomach pain thinking about it...

How can I get my mind off this traumatizing bs...?"
210,What should I expect from a psych evaluation?,"I’m at a point where I’ve been dealing with some issues for a long time. I’ve seen a therapist, but I haven’t seen a psychiatrist. The idea of doing it gives me a lot of anxiety. I probably just don’t want to find out I need to be on a medication that makes me feel less like myself, even though ironically that’s what I want most of the time. Also, does getting a psych evaluation effect your insurance rates or have any other negative consequences? I’m probably just being paranoid, but I can’t help with come up with crazy fears."
211,Frequent Mood Swings,"My mental health has had its ups and downs for awhile now, however those highs and lows have come a lot more frequently lately. I know its easy to mark it up as a result of the pandemic, and while that's definitely not helping its also not the cause.  I started anti-depressants last year with Lexapro. Not content with the results, I switched to Paxil at the beginning of the year. For awhile I thought it was helping. And in some aspects it was. My lows were not as low, but as a result my highs were almost non-existent. I often describe it as living in a state of constant neutrality. I would find myself reacting with the correct emotions and responses to situations but noticed I would never actually feel those emotions. I visited a doctor who diagnosed me with ADD and was subsequently put on Adderall.

This has done more for me than anything else I have been on. However, I'm worried about becoming reliant and addicted to the drug. It is all too easy to pop a pill to feel normal again. My mood fluctuates multiple times a day, from happy to sad, and back again. I feel lonely and empty when I am alone with myself and my own thoughts. I have an amazing group of supportive friends who I still maintain contact with through Discord, which helps a lot. However, when I have something to do that requires me to set off on my own, my thoughts always turn negative. I lay awake for hours at night unable to sleep, and this is when I am at my worst. I try to occupy my spare time with hobbies and busy work but this only helps so much. I guess what I'm seeking is some advice on how to not feel so alone. I recognize how fortunate I am to have the people I have in my life and don't take that for granted, but knowing this does not change how I feel.

I also stopped taking the Paxil a few weeks ago, and am now solely on Adderall."
212,I hate this,"My mental health is fucked. Being stuck in the house isn't making it any better. I have no one to talk to, my family isn't the best to go to. My only friend hasn't talked to me in a week. She lost a friend last week and having talked to me since. She told me she needed to be alone and had been ignoring me for almost a week. I have no one else to talk to. She's my only friend. Idk what to do."
213,In the moment alcaholic,Prolly manic depressive 29 lifes the same steady job 5 years parents divorced at five i dont wanna be alone but iv let my self become something i hate becuase of addiction and past drug use and isolate fantasize about death or driving away. Never had a social life ever grew up in the sticks and my parents just kindof had lived off the goverment or step family . I think at times im good but i drink everyday half a pint 101 beer i dont wanna do anything else and if im high im good till they talk to me im annoyed get mad hateful becuase iv never had any help i try but im a pos and have been called everything thing under the sun least i aint on drugs and pay my own bills they ask me guilt me into stuff. And they brag about all the money they got from unemployment and stimulus covid check. I felt sick all day from being drunk and telling them in the moment what i thought and i dont know what to do. Any more
214,How did you make the first step?,"So maybe 1-2 years ago I realised that I probably don't live the same life as other people.  I was and still am constantly tired, I have no energy, hate myself and I get sad often with 1-2 breakdowns a week. So I made these depression tests from mental health associations etc. and the outcome was that I PROBABLY have moderate to heavy depression. Ofc this isn't a diagnosis but yeah. How did you guys made the first step to get professional help?"
215,Have no one to talk to and just want to get this off my chest,"I just started crying for no reason at all and I realized that feelings nothing hurts all the same. I wasn't in pain, like the pain I'm familiar with, but the hopelessness is still there. It still pulls me down when it can. I don't even know the reason, but I feel so hopeless. I think so little of myself, I want to die now, so I don't have to endure the pains and troubles of life. I don't know how to survive any more years. I don't know how to do this. Everything seems worthless on the long run."
216,Mental Wellness in the Workplace,"In the current climate (and even before now! but especially with the uncertainty and shifting work patterns) wellness in the workplace is a super important topic. 

I've been extremely close to burn-out once, and it was such an awkward and uncomfortable experience, and I never did quite admit to the company just how much the workload was taking a toll on me.

I am now working in design. This experience was my inspiration for my current design project, which is to create a wellness app for the workplace.

I would really love to get some responses on a survey that I've created, to help inform the design of the app and the most important features and solutions that should be included. Please find the survey here (should only take 2 mins!) and thank you so much in advance - I really appreciate it!

217,Weird phenomenon that happened to me growing up.,"So I don't know if this belongs here, but...
I've recently remembered a sensation I've had multiple times while growing up, when I felt like I'm losing a feeling of my body proportions, like finger size or length, and a severe feeling of anxiety when touching soft objects like bed sheets and pillows, because everything felt hard and cold like a block of iron. One common thing was it always started while I was in my bed.
Reason I'm bringing it up again because I had to experience it again today (22). I've told my gf and she said she also had it while growing up, but has no idea what it's called whatsoever. 
Is this a known phenomenon?"
218,Dark poem about how I have been feeling lately,"  

Every day attempting to detect the trivial fragment of my true being that I have isolated 

Hiding my veracious agony; my tormenting mind

Blackened clouds menace over me, even on sunny days it is pouring for me; a torrent

One line turns into six and suddenly for that day I have completely become a shell

I do not care on those days

I want to but it is hard to when I bury the misery, so I continue in the storm 

Not able to relish in the conviviality life has to offer

Distant I feel, drowning above water, gasping for a breath

Hopes and dreams killed by my own mind

Constant anguish; constant despair

How do I break free from my own captivity?

How do I make the sun shine for me again? 

I want to be unburdened from my detrimental mind

I am ready to be released from this wretchedness 

I am ready to be myself again"
219,HELP ME PLEASE,"I know the best course would be to get some advice from an expert but for now this is all i have.If you could take the time and read through it would mean the world to me.

220,I am diagnosed with bipolar and had a question about what I'm feeling? I'm kind of confused. Please help.,I was diagnosed with Bipolar many years ago and have always had my ups and downs but I have noticed quite frequently in the past couple days that I'm feeling extremely depressed while simultaneously being extremely energetic at the same time. I'm down in the dumps yet I feel like my nerves are buzzing from the amount of energy I have. I know that there are depressive lows and manic highs but what I'm feeling is almost like an in-between??? Does anyone know what this is????
221,Venting on underlying issues I've had since childhood,"Hello, 

I am just spit balling here but I have been having some issues since I was a child that have manifested  into adulthood. I would just like to vent because I can't see a therapist due to quarantine issues. Bit of info to start. I'm a 24 year old female. I've gone to therapy on two separate occasions, both for seasonal depressive issues and not for what I want to vent about here. I can only think to do this in list form so here are some issues that I've been having since I was kid. 

* **Perverse need to rush through things**
   * I always scribbled in my coloring books instead of taking time to neatly fill in pictures. I never really took my time when I was first learning to write, resulting in bad hand writing that I've had to work with my teachers on through the years. I feel my mind racing when I try to take my time on something. I watch almost every YouTube at 2x speed because feel like they drag on and on. 
* **Difficulty mono-tasking**
   * This was not an issue when I was very young, but as a teenager I had a difficult time just reading/ taking tests and didn't want to take breaks because I was afraid I was lose my momentum. My 12th grader civics teacher gave me a koosh ball to mess with during test taking that was really helpful. Now giving my undivided attention to something feels like a struggle. I have to be in a very specific mood to want to watch movies, especially if they are more than 90 mins long. 
* **Dislike of being alone with my thoughts**
   * This one accompanies the previous bullet point. If I am doing something that doesn't require reading/active listening I hate listening to my own thoughts. For example, when I take walks or do the dishes I prefer listening to music or having a conversation with someone. I fall asleep to YouTube videos at night. If I don't have access to something to listen to I start counting or doing math in my head or else my mind races and my thoughts become repetitive but not intrusive. 
* **Rambling in conversation**
   * I police this one rather diligently when I am around friends, classmates, and coworkers. I don't have issues with listening to people in real life conversations. However, around family members, I tend to lose track of what I am talking about. I front load stories with details that will become important later in the story. I bounce between multiple talking points. I feel a need to share everything that I know about a topic in discussions (not in a pedantic way) . As a kid, this lead to a lot of oversharing. I feel a great sense of dread if the topic changes before I've said everything to say. 
* **Hyper-fixation on hobbies that only lasts for a few months**
* **Anger if I don't master something immediately** 
* **Forgetful to a fault**
   * This is probably the worse one for me. When I was in high school, I had very in-depth recall and memory. I never took notes in high school. I would skim my textbook before a test and then during the test I could just ""see the textbook"" in my head. That went away in college during a depressive episode, and I had to teach myself normal studying habits. My long term memory is still pretty good, but I am very forgetful in small day to day stuff. I misplace my phone/wallet all the time. I enter a room to do something and then immediately forget. I have to sing a little song when I put on deodorant or lock the door. These incidents happen almost every day. I did mention this to my therapist when I was in college, but she said it was more related to stress than anything. I don't feel  the same amount stress as I did in college and yet I am more forgetful. 

I feel like I've gone my whole life with some sort of un-diagnosed issue. I wouldn't be surprised if I started talking to a therapist and they told me I had ADHD. All of these issues never raised any red flags for any of the adults in my life or myself for that matter. I did very well in school. I consistently earned good grades. I went straight from undergrad to grad school and did not experience burn out until my final semester. I get all of my work done. I am generally an organized person. I was never a hyper child or anything like that. I feel like I have created a lot of structures to cope with this. 

And another issue I've had is creating conclusion to things. Thanks for reading"
222,I made so many mistakes.,"Im the worst, i started dating someone with DID, and immediately cheated on them. The secret hasn't come out, but the person i cheated with wants to kill herself and the one i was dating has gone away and wont come back for possible years. everyone should hate me but its my fault. Im not just feeling bad, it literally is my fault."
223,"(tw suicide) My best friend is having suicidal urges, I cannot go visit due to the pandemic, I feel so so helpless. What do I do?","I have been talking to her for hours.  I keep telling her how many plans we have together and all the things she still wanted to do, but she keeps telling me I'll be fine without her and she told me what to do with her stuff after she dies and so on, as if her death is certain.  She thanked me for our friendship...  She said she's trying to figure out the quickest way to die.

I feel so helpless.  I can't drive, she's 40 minutes away from me, and the nearest lyft/uber is 30 minutes away from my house.  It's not allowed anyway to go out due to the stay-at-home orders in this state currently, though I would consider this a health emergency.

Nothing has happened yet from what I can tell and she is waiting for someone in particular to respond to her messages before she tries anything.

There have been other attempts in the past.  I completely understand how she feels...  I'm no stranger to depression and suicidal thoughts myself.  That makes me feel even more helpless, that I understand and yet I can't help.  I'll delete this later, but I don;t know what to do other than just keep talking to her for as long as possible..."
224,Quarantine Mental health?,"Are there many people out there really struggling with their mental health because of this quarantine?

227,"I feel dead, fatigued and detached for no reason... And it's going nowhere for 4 years.","Excuse me, why is this even happening to me? Not to minimize the significance of my weird mental state, but i'm just sick of it, it's just stupid. I have no idea. ***This is a long post, and i don't know if i'm even allowed to upload this. Oh boy.***

I'm basically a stone, i have no preferences, opinions, personality, emotions. It's ridiculous, i feel no love, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness etc etc. I've been basically like this since i woke up one morning sleep deprived when i was 14, and it never went away. I tried crying, getting angry, expressing emotion, and i couldn't find any emotions to be expressed. Now i can somehow turn my empathy on and off, and when it's on, it really is a default set of common reactions that are expected. I did well in school, my parents cared and loved me, i had and still have friends. I also don't have anything to be distressed about. I just 'know' that i'm not really experiencing life or at all.

It also extends to sensations, i can't really feel taste anymore, no pleasure from sexual things, it's 10C in here and i'm freezing but i don't care, forget to eat, online classes, exams, names, concepts. I don't dream anymore when asleep. I sometimes just sit in bed and then... there goes nothing for hours and hours, and i never feel bored. Every move i make is as agonizing physically/energetically speaking as the next, same goes with conscious thought. I failed uni and i didn't even notice, and when i did i didn't care... Even though it was my passion that i worked for 6 years. It looks like that sort of 'magic' or life has just dissapeared overnight. I can't say i'm desperate, i've been rolling with it for ages.

I don't have an interest in anything, i just play GTA 3 repeatedly with no aim, maybe go outside to walk for 20 minutes, do nothing, listen to music all day without preferences. I have a gaming computer, i can play whatever i want, but i don't. I have 'my own' home, which my parents pay for, i should probably feel guilt but i don't. I occasionaly try to revive my passion for math and physics, doesn't work. Sometimes i think other people are delusional with their emotions, but i guess i'm the problem. Coronavirus had no effect whatsoever on my mental health, i don't care if i get it and die. Sometimes i try to simulate normal emotions, like love for the world and compassion, i roll with it for a couple of hours and then forget about it and feel nothing. **Honestly sorry for repeating the same words over and over, but i just want to make it more dramatic or something. Should i just quit CIAing this stuff and go with psych drugs?** I can go on with buzz words like Apathy, anhedonia, DP/DR, depression but i'm not sure. **If you have any advice i'm happy to hear it.**

***If you're like me, then i'd like to talk to you...***

And there's not a single piece of advice that has ever helped me significantly. Keep in mind that i stuck with each strategy for up to 2-3 months.

• I traveled, nothing 

• I tried forming meaningful friendships with uni classmates, nothing 

• I tried moving on with my 'dead for no reason passion', nothing 

• I try eating healthy, vitamins, exercise, nothing happens

• Tried acting as if i'm normal, doesn't work

• Coffee, no effect

• Blood and urine samples, magnesium deficiency corrected and fatigue improved a bit

• I've seen so many videos and read many books about emotional numbness, DP/DR, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, ocd. I don't really fit anywhere, and the clues don't match up.

• Therapy doesn't work, i'm not a human anymore. Actually 1/5 even said i was antisocial, nope.

• Had a cat once, didn't even bother to take care of it, felt nothing towards it, so i just let her go.

• I'm on Wellbutrin XR 150mg, 3rd week, fatigue is gone tho.

Thanks."

Should i just quit CIAing this stuff and go with psych drugs?** I can go on with buzz words like Apathy, anhedonia, DP/DR, depression but i'm not sure. **If you have any advice i'm happy to hear it.**

***If you're like me, then i'd like to talk to you...***

And there's not a single piece of advice that has ever helped me significantly. Keep in mind that i stuck with each strategy for up to 2-3 months.

• I traveled, nothing 

• I tried forming meaningful friendships with uni classmates, nothing 

• I tried moving on with my 'dead for no reason passion', nothing 

• I try eating healthy, vitamins, exercise, nothing happens

• Tried acting as if i'm normal, doesn't work

• Coffee, no effect

• Blood and urine samples, magnesium deficiency corrected and fatigue improved a bit

• I've seen so many videos and read many books about emotional numbness, DP/DR, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, ocd. I don't really fit anywhere, and the clues don't match up.

• Therapy doesn't work, i'm not a human anymore. Actually 1/5 even said i was antisocial, nope.

• Had a cat once, didn't even bother to take care of it, felt nothing towards it, so i just let her go.

• I'm on Wellbutrin XR 150mg, 3rd week, fatigue is gone tho.

Thanks."
229,i have obsessive thoughts frequently and i cant organize them in my head,"i fee like i've always had this problem but  this year it has become more intense and frequent, i don't know what it is excatly and why is it happening, like i would be doing a normal thing like studying or watching something or whatever and then a thought hits me and i obsess about it in my head four like hours and then when that thought is clear in my head i'm normal again then another comes and the cycle starts again, its not like i'm always like this during the day, i get things done, i talk with friends and hang out with them and stuff but when the thoughts come to me i have to isolate myself so i can think about them. But now with Covid-19 and this quarantine it has become worse than before, now i'm always like this, the only thing that i do during the day is online classes and studying otherwise i would be obsessing about the thoughts in my head, i cant enjoy anything, i cant read books (which was my favorite to do) i cant play music and, i cant watch movies and, even the simple things like scrolling through reddit get these thoughts started, before quarantine the way i used to deal with these obsessive thoughts is that i would make social interactions and because i'm an introvert those social interactions would take all my focus and energy so that would help divert my attention from these thoughts but now i cant do that anymore, also because i have commitment issues with people i don't really have friends, i have only acquaintances and it's really weird to text or call someone you barely know, i don't know really know what to do, i feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts, i was planning to seek medical help for this but i'm scared to do that because of  my family's judgment on that they would say that i'm not the only who has  with mental issues i already know that"

232,"I feel dead, fatigued and detached for no reason... And it's going nowhere for 4 years.","Excuse me, why is this even happening to me? Not to minimize the significance of my weird mental state, but i'm just sick of it, it's just stupid. I have no idea. ***This is a long post, and i don't know if i'm even allowed to upload this. Oh boy.***

I'm basically a stone, i have no preferences, opinions, personality, emotions. It's ridiculous, i feel no love, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness etc etc. I've been basically like this since i woke up one morning sleep deprived when i was 14, and it never went away. I tried crying, getting angry, expressing emotion, and i couldn't find any emotions to be expressed. Now i can somehow turn my empathy on and off, and when it's on, it really is a default set of common reactions that are expected. I did well in school, my parents cared and loved me, i had and still have friends. I also don't have anything to be distressed about. I just 'know' that i'm not really experiencing life or at all.

It also extends to sensations, i can't really feel taste anymore, no pleasure from sexual things, it's 10C in here and i'm freezing but i don't care, forget to eat, online classes, exams, names, concepts. I don't dream anymore when asleep. I sometimes just sit in bed and then... there goes nothing for hours and hours, and i never feel bored. Every move i make is as agonizing physically/energetically speaking as the next, same goes with conscious thought. I failed uni and i didn't even notice, and when i did i didn't care... Even though it was my passion that i worked for 6 years. It looks like that sort of 'magic' or life has just dissapeared overnight. I can't say i'm desperate, i've been rolling with it for ages.

I don't have an interest in anything, i just play GTA 3 repeatedly with no aim, maybe go outside to walk for 20 minutes, do nothing, listen to music all day without preferences. I have a gaming computer, i can play whatever i want, but i don't. I have 'my own' home, which my parents pay for, i should probably feel guilt but i don't. I occasionaly try to revive my passion for math and physics, doesn't work. Sometimes i think other people are delusional with their emotions, but i guess i'm the problem. Coronavirus had no effect whatsoever on my mental health, i don't care if i get it and die.

233,"which ""therapist"" do you see to talk to about your general issues/problems in life?","(24, M)
i know there's therapists, psychologists, shrink, etc.

I don't wanna be a sap, but i just don't have a single person to talk to. (nobody that would ever understand or give me good advice, anyway)

i've seen on the movies and such: you go to a ""therapist's"" private office 
where you talk about everything and everybody in your life
and the ""therapist"" just takes all the deep info you told em about and basically analyzes you and figures you out. 
i need that right now😂😂 answers! 👏🏻
i'm not comfortable in my own skin and i don't know why and I need to know why

but thank you, IA"

***If you're like me, then i'd like to talk to you...***

And there's not a single piece of advice that has ever helped me significantly. Keep in mind that i stuck with each strategy for up to 2-3 months.

I traveled, nothing 

I tried forming meaningful friendships with uni classmates, nothing 

I tried moving on with my 'dead for no reason passion', nothing 

I try eating healthy, vitamins, exercise, nothing happens

Tried acting as if i'm normal, doesn't work

Coffee, no effect

Blood and urine samples, magnesium deficiency corrected and fatigue improved a bit

I've seen so many videos and read many books about emotional numbness, DP/DR, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, ocd. I don't really fit anywhere, and the clues don't match up.

Therapy doesn't work, i'm not a human anymore. Actually 1/5 even said i was antisocial, nope.

Had a cat once, didn't even bother to take care of it, felt nothing towards it, so i just let her go.

I'm on Wellbutrin XR 150mg, 3rd week, fatigue is gone tho.

Thanks."
242,"I feel dead, fatigued and detached for no reason... And it's going nowhere for 4 years.","Excuse me, why is this even happening to me? Not to minimize the significance of my weird mental state, but i'm just sick of it, it's just stupid. I have no idea. ***This is a long post, and i don't know if i'm even allowed to upload this. Oh boy.***

I'm basically a stone, i have no preferences, opinions, personality, emotions. It's ridiculous, i feel no love, fear, anxiety, happiness, sadness etc etc. I've been basically like this since i woke up one morning sleep deprived when i was 14, and it never went away. I tried crying, getting angry, expressing emotion, and i couldn't find any emotions to be expressed. Now i can somehow turn my empathy on and off, and when it's on, it really is a default set of common reactions that are expected. I did well in school, my parents cared and loved me, i had and still have friends. I also don't have anything to be distressed about. I just 'know' that i'm not really experiencing life or at all.

It also extends to sensations, i can't really feel taste anymore, no pleasure from sexual things, it's 10C in here and i'm freezing but i don't care, forget to eat, online classes, exams, names, concepts. I don't dream anymore when asleep. I sometimes just sit in bed and then... there goes nothing for hours and hours, and i never feel bored. Every move i make is as agonizing physically/energetically speaking as the next, same goes with conscious thought. I failed uni and i didn't even notice, and when i did i didn't care... Even though it was my passion that i worked for 6 years. It looks like that sort of 'magic' or life has just dissapeared overnight. I can't say i'm desperate, i've been rolling with it for ages.

249,i have obsessive thought frequently and i can't organize them in my head,"i fee like i've always had this problem but  this year it has become more intense and frequent, i don't know what it is excatly and why is it happening, like i would be doing a normal thing like studying or watching something or whatever and then a thought hits me and i obsess about it in my head four like hours and then when that thought is clear in my head i'm normal again then another comes and the cycle starts again, its not like i'm always like this during the day, i get things done, i talk with friends and hang out with them and stuff but when the thoughts come to me i have to isolate myself so i can think about them. But now with Covid-19 and this quarantine it has become worse than before, now i'm always like this, the only thing that i do during the day is online classes and studying otherwise i would be obsessing about the thoughts in my head, i cant enjoy anything, i cant read books (which was my favorite to do) i cant play music and, i cant watch movies and, even the simple things like scrolling through reddit get these thoughts started, before quarantine the way i used to deal with these obsessive thoughts is that i would make social interactions and because i'm an introvert those social interactions would take all my focus and energy so that would help divert my attention from these thoughts but now i cant do that anymore, also because i have commitment issues with people i don't really have friends, i have only acquaintances and it's really weird to text or call someone you barely know, i don't know really know what to do, i feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts, i was planning to seek medical help for this but i'm scared to do that because of  my family's judgment on that they would say that i'm not the only who has  with mental issues i already know that"

260,My Diary Entry for the Day,"Growing up, I could start a book and finish it in a day. In high school, I read less books, but I took more naps.   If I got into an argument with my mother, I’d write her a letter to express my feelings. She even wrote back sometimes. I loved to put on a good song and cute dress and dance in the mirror (super cliché, I know). I loved hanging out with my girl friends and doing silly things, while ending the night talking deeply about how hopeful we were for our future. Heck, I even listened to music so much more than I do now! How is that possible?! 

*Pondering*

Maybe this is a rant about my cell phone and the internet. Why have I lost focus on the things I loved to do? If it doesn’t provide instant excitement, I’m bored of it - activities, books, and worst of all, people. It’s a platform to stay “connected” to family, friends, and strangers, but instead of connecting, we complain, compare, and compete with one another. This phone is such a distraction from the present moment and I absolutely hate how much it’s brainwashed me! Reaching for it constantly. I can’t imagine how much my brain is frying. Include my neck being bent and fingers going at it - yay future health problems! This technology is a blessing but in my opinion, a bigger curse. It has totally taken me (and many others) away from our natural state of being. 

Being: 
- n. 1) existence 2 the nature or essence of a person 
- v. present particle of be 

What I’m yearning for most is a connection to my spirit. I want to have peace of mind and less distraction. I want to welcome compassion and be content with everything I am and all that there is. Why is this so hard to do in modern society? *sigh*"

264,"Please Help, I don't know what to do (Advice please)","(So the first part of the post got a little long-- I swear I tried to trim it down and give the bare bones of context, but it didn't work the best. The actual advice request starts at 'So. Here I am.')

Okay. 

So a couple months ago [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eym53h/not_exactly_sure_what_to_do_ventadvice/) about a conflict with my DnD group of friends, and well. It's escalated in a way. This is all happening in the same group of 9 friends, just to mke sure. 

So, in mid February, I had a bit of a conflict with one of my friends while playing Minecraft, and in a panic I asked another friend in the group whether or not I should take a break. Both she and my DM agreed that I take a break from the game for a while, and I agreed to take a break from the game until the end of the semester. 

Then, when I went on our group's Minecraft server (we had switched worlds and I wanted to rebuild), my DM suggested I stay away from the server so my presence doesn't make people angry, which, you know, fair. And things carried on as normal. 

Until a couple weeks later, when in a fit of anxiety fueled paranoia, I asked my DM whether or not my friends secretly hated me and this was a convoluted method of getting me out of the group. He didn't reply no, and instead told me that it's probably better if I take a break from the discord and chill out. I didn't want to, but I figured it was better for the group and muted the discord, while still being in it. And I admit, every so often I would peek in, and see what everyone was talking about, and getting hurt that it seemed like no one seemed to miss me. 

Then I fucked up, and got a big letter telling me that \*until further notice\* I wasn't allowed in the Discord because of it. That was three weeks ago. I haven't been in a good place, mental health wise, since (compounded by the quarantine, struggling with schoolwork while at home, my family falling apart, etc etc), and I keep flipping back and forth between ""these people don't care about me and never had and never will, and I'm hurt and I should hurt them back and/or leave the group because they haven't kept me in mind"" and ""I'm a terrible person to have let it get this far, the only person I can blame is myself, and I should never speak in the group again and/or leave the group so I don't run the risk of hurting them ever again"". 

So. Here I am. 

I want to get better, and get back to my friends, and get back to being normal, cuz a lot of this has happened in the last few months. I don't want to keep talking over my friends and hurting them. I don't want to get in trouble again. I want to keep playing and having fun. In my friend's letter, they pointed out how I constantly complained in the discord, interrupted people, and constantly pivoted the attention to myself. And they're right, I'm very self absorbed and a straight up attention whore. But I don't know how to work on any of that, and I don't want to keep going back to the same person I've been talking to about this to ask for advice because they're not my therapist and they don't deserve to be treated like that. 

I've already tried to cut back on complaining about stuff in my other discords, but how do I work on not pivoting a conversation to be about myself all the time??? How do I relate a story I want to share without coming off as dominating the conversation??? How do I work on not interrupting people??? How do I work on being a better team player in general??? How do I fix myself???"

267,I feel like people and the media are trying to steal/ manipulate my thoughts,"I know the title makes it sound like I’ve lost it, but I promise that I know how ridiculous it sounds. I know it’s completely irrational to think these things, and I don’t think I completely believe them to be true. It’s like one side of my brain knows I’m being irrational and the other half takes it very seriously. 

I’ve been having these ideas for a while, like probably 6 months or so, but the lockdown has seemed to make the thoughts so much mire intense, and they’ve started to seriously affect my behaviour. One of my ideas is that people can say a certain word or phrase and if I read or listen to/ process that phrase then they’ll be able to hijack my thoughts, kind of like it’s a trap to manipulate me. As a result if I’m talking to someone online or in real life and they say something that I think is an attempt to manipulate my thoughts, I just blank my mind so that I don’t think about it and as a result I completely ignore them. This used to only happen like every 2 weeks or so, but now it’s pretty much every day.

Another thing I believe is that adverts like those on YouTube are also trying to hijack and manipulate my thoughts. So whenever an advert comes on on YouTube I immediately take my earbuds out and look away from the screen until it’s over. I also avoid mainstream media because I feel like it’s trying to achieve the same thing. It’s like I feel like everyone else has already been brainwashed and I don’t want to be brainwashed too.

Finally the more recent thing has been that whenever I do something I enjoy like listen to music or watch YouTube or play video games, I imagine a person telling me that what I like is stupid and bad and that I have bad taste and then it ruins the fun I was getting out of the activity. This has been the worst thing because now I feel like I can’t do anything I enjoy because he’ll be there taunting me and he’ll ruin it.


I know this all sounds really weird and crazy, but I promise that I know it’s crazy. I just can’t convince myself to stop thinking it’s real and it’s making me really agitated and upset. What can I do to stop thinking like this? I just want to be able to put my guard down and relax..."

269,My Diary Entry for Today,"Growing up, I could start a book and finish it in a day. In high school, I read less books, but I took more naps.   If I got into an argument with my mother, I’d write her a letter to express my feelings. She even wrote back sometimes. I loved to put on a good song and cute dress and dance in the mirror (super cliché, I know). I loved hanging out with my girl friends and doing silly things, while ending the night talking deeply about how hopeful we were for our future. Heck, I even listened to music so much more than I do now! How is that possible?!

It’s a platform to stay “connected” to family, friends, and strangers, but instead of connecting, we complain, compare, and compete with one another. This phone is such a distraction from the present moment and I absolutely hate how much it’s brainwashed me! Reaching for it constantly. I can’t imagine how much my brain is frying.

272,Weird things happening again,"There's a lot of weird stuff happening to me lately (hallucinations, voices, trippy thoughts) but my main problem is the fear. I'm afraid of what other people think of me. I feel like everyone in my life is just pretending to be kind to me to earn my trust and use it against me. At least that's what the whispers in my head say. I try to ignore them but in the quiet of the night it's hard to. I wish I could get help from a therapist or a hospital but it looks like I'm going to have to tackle this on my own this time.

I guess my main question would be how do deal with these thoughts? Please, I really need help."

275,Next steps with new diagnosis to depression and anxiety,"I spoke to my doctor about problems I’ve been having and she told me I most likely have moderate depression and moderate to severe anxiety. My doctor then told me I could take meds, talked through some, and also to discuss further with a therapist.

Have others just directly taken meds or recommend talking with a therapist first? 

Being open about my mental health is very new to me and I don’t know what path to take. Being in lockdown has definitely heightened a lot of my feelings and just trying to navigate ways to get better. 

I need to refollow up and fine a new therapist as as the one recommended ended up being on medical leave right after I spoke with my doctor."
276,Life with the Inlaws?,"Not sure if this belongs here (sorry in advance)


So I'm to get married in a couple months (fingers crossed) and honestly I love my inlaws. Like alot. And I know they like me too.. I think haha but idk, ever feel like somehow things may just be a formality from their end? I mean they've never done anything to make me feel as if I wasn't a part of their family already (I've been with my fiance for 3 years now) but idk when I look at them and try and place myself in the family photo I mean 99% of the time I'm like ya I belong, but I guess once in a while it's like wait do I? 

The fact that I've spent my life trying to belong/fit in somewhere, probably doesn't help or is the reason I feel this way 🤷🏾‍♀️"
277,How do I deal with a hater turned friend?,"
*Context:*
It's a very long story, but to cut to the chase, two years ago I had an artist friend who essentially jumped to the conclusion about some small things as well as fabricate lies. 

They ended up accusing me of a bunch of things I didn't do, but the scary part was that she seemed to insist to others it was true? Her and her friends shared a Discord group, and I never got a chance to reconcile because I was blocked everywhere. It didn't help that another friend who was also got involved, basically was a white knight about the whole situation and heavily defended her. It seemed unfair that I couldn't even get the word out there despite having reasonable points.

However, since reconcile is not an option, where would I go from here? It would be a lot easier for me to deal with anonymous hate than hater turned friends :/"
278,I visited a psychiatrist and he didn't listen or speak to me properly. Can I just find a new one? What happens to the prescription he wrote?,"I had a consultation with a psychiatrist last week for the first time. All my life i've suspected Ive had adult adhd along with anxiety. I wanted to finally try medication out now that we're in quarantine and I am in a safe, constant, environment at home with not much social interaction. To my disappointment, my consultation with this psychiatrist  lasted barely 25 minutes. The doctor made offhand remarks about my race ""did you grow up with a tiger mom? (because I am Chinese)"" and didn't seem to really listen to me saying ""uh uh"" and cutting me off when I talked. She proceeded to diagnose me with  depression and gave me a prescription for anti-depressants (lexapro). I left feeling like I wasn't  seen or heard in that appointment and  feeling worse about myself. I picked up the prescription from the pharmacy but haven't touched the meds.

I wasn't satisfied with that at all so I proceeded to go to a new psychiatrist for a second opinion. This one was much better with our session lasting a full 70 minutes and  i left feeling like someone had finally listened to me. She asked me questions and just let me talk. At the end of it, she said I showed signs of ADHD and prescribed to strattera. During this, she  asked me if I had taken prior meds or had seen a psychiatrist before aand I said no not thinking clearly b/c in my head I didn't feel like I did with that 25 min appt and having not taken any of the meds. 

&amp;#x200B;

After reviewing the appointment in my head, I'm worried that this new doctor can see my prescription history and might think i'm some kind of drug seeker. I am not and I truly just felt so shitty after the last psychiatrist appointment I wanted a second opinion. I know i fucked up by not telling her about the first psychiatrist consultation but now i'm stuck. What do I do? What do I do with my lexapro prescription which I'm not going to use? Can i return it to the pharmacy and prove I didn't take it? Will my new doctor not go through with my ADHD meds and further testing because of this?"
279,I feel like an anomaly [vent],"Hi, I’m 22, I live in the UK. I just need to vent, I’m sorry if this seems a little self pity-ing 

In my childhood, I never had access to anything other than very basic healthcare, so as I’ve progressed into adulthood, I feel as if I don’t deserve to get help, or as if I’d be dismissed because I’d be asking about all these things I know I have, but was never able to get a diagnosis when I was younger. I feel like a dr would just say “if these issues were bad enough, they would have been looked at sooner”

I know I have extreme Anxiety, to the point that I can’t function without another person helping me with things like phone calls, leaving home, talking to people etc. I’ve never had help with it, and for a long time I though I was just weak, or a coward. I have overwhelming paranoia and a debilitating fear of death. 
This in turn has come with depression, as I get frustrated with my reaction to the world around me, and My idea of my own self worth takes a downfall. I’ve been suicidal for over 6-7 years (never attempted anything because I’m too scared) and it really breaks your spirit to feel as if you’re just taking up space from more ‘deserving’ people. 
I’m 90% certain I have C-PTSD but since it’s such a new term, I wouldn’t know how to approach that. My childhood was full of mental and physical abusive, ranging from emotional manipulation to domestic violence and assault, both with and without weapons. I know it’s affected me, but thanks to the aforementioned idea of self worth, I have no clue where I could even begin.
I believe myself to be autistic, my parent even agrees here, but since I was neglected as a child, I never got that looked at. It’s hard to find someone who’ll even look at an adult for diagnosis, I might be stuck forever at ‘Suspected Autistic’

I don’t know how to live my life because I deal with situations so differently to anyone I’ve met- I feel like an Alien. I feel like I don’t deserve help for any of it, that I’d be wasting everyone’s time. I have no friends to speak of, I have no hobbies, I can’t even go to education (my one biggest want) because of a mix of mental health and money issues.

I’m not sure where I wanted to go with this, but it’s nice to write everything down."
280,My first real project I released today on youtube! It's about mental health,
281,Someone pls explain this!!!,Hi. I’ve been doing this more and more lately. I’ll have an idea for something I want to do and it’ll become all I can think about and can’t do anything else besides that thing. Spending a lot of time and money on it. I’ll be halfway thru completing it and I’ll drop it and start something else that is completely random from the current thing I’ve wanted to do previously.  And this will go on for maybe two weeks and then I won’t want to do anything for a long time but just crash on my bed for most of the day. Is this just me trying to find my interest and hobby? Or is this more than that?
282,I feel trapped,"I dont know how to explain it, but im going to try.
So i turned 19 this year and i feel Like life isnt worth it anymore (not Like it was before).
Ive always been a shy kind of person and never really had real friends. I also might have adhd (i was diagnosed with hyperactivity disorder but i suspect an inattention disorder too because ive always struggle to focus and no one understands me when talk and i also feel Like im not mature enough for my age) . Im also paranoïd (self diagnosed), i always feel Like people are tricking me /using me or want to harm me and it happens with everyone, in other words i see danger everywhere (litteraly). 
Im a very anxious person, to the point were i would avoid certain activities thinking that i might someday lose a limb and lose the ability to perform that activity (e.g learning to play the guitar). 
And there are probably other things i forgot to say. 
Anyways if had to sum up all i said, I'd say that i simply dont know how to cope with all of that. 

(sorry for my bad english)"
283,How to deal with anxiety and depression?,"It's been some tough weeks, I have been talking to my crush (who has a boyfriend) and I just told her all of my feelings towards her. She told me some time ago that she was having difficulties with her relationship and she doesn't know what will happen but she told me she have felt something for me as well. I just recently told her again my feelings and I just want to know if she wants me to wait or there is no chance for me and for her. I know it's a lot of pressure for her, but I'm just holding on to my love, every day we talk my feelings get even deeper for her. I'm sorry, I've never experienced this type of feeling, this is the first time I've ever been in love at 21 years old.
I imagined love different, I guess this is what happens when you try to give it all knowing there is no certainty.
Because all of this, I've been in my room, tired, trying to do whatever to distract my mind but I can't, I'm stressed because I have a lot of school projects I need to do for the next week but I can't focus. I have a lot of anxiety and all I wish is to go to the gym, it always helped me relieve my mind, even if it is for a few hours, but I can't because of this fucking quarantine. I'm alone in my room, wishing to tell someone all of this, hence why I'm posting this, I don't want to tell my family, and I wish I could act as if nothing is happening but I'm not a person that can cover up feelings. Being alone here is really stressing, if I go out my family will know that I have something and will be asking ""what is wrong with you?"" And I don't want to tell them.

It feels heavy, it's really painful, sometimes to the point where I feel I can't tolerate it. I wish sometimes I would have the guts to just kill myself to stop feeling but I know it's not the solution, I have dreams, goals, I want to experience more aspects of life before parting away. I wish that sometimes I was a different person, a wiser person that would know what to do in this situations.

What must I do? How can I relieve this anxiety? I will try to play videogames for a while to relieve this feeling a little bit, but I know that once I get in bed I will start feeling the same way. Fuck my life, I wish I would experience love like a normal person would, where two persons would just fall in love like that, without any problems, just like all of my friends do :("
284,A book of mental health,"Hello,

I have written a book about half a month ago about my story with mental illness and another story mixed in from someone I knew online who was heavily involved with a dark web mafia organization. He told me several stories of him in the crime family and also told me his trials with mental health. He felt like the only one who was really honest with him was me. I later found out he was arrested and I decided that his story was not to be wasted. I spent months writing, and editing the book about his life interlocked with my own to replicate a fictional setting. I have spent a very long time on the book and it's been very hard to get the book out there. I don't really even care about the fact that I have to sell it, but rather I care more about his life being wasted by his own organization. I was very angry about the fact but I knew it was hopeless to just give in. So I wrote the book to show his life, and my own to hopefully let him not go to waste as just another kid who got locked up. I would appreciate some feedback on the book aswell in this thread if you want to critique. If it seems like some errors are in I will take notice of them. The artistic style of the book was supposed to emulate a blog post because that was my friends other outlet. He had hosted it on the tor browser and it was called ""Padrino's Domain."" Unfortuantly it was shut down but it did really demonstrate how stressed he really was. I thank you for your time and hopefully you can give the book a good read.

285,Concerned about mental Health decline,"Hello there all. Im 23M, and I have  severe Anxiety, and depression. For about a year now, my mental health has been fairly decent. I've got a desk job, an apartment, and loving family/friends.

Over the last few weeks, i have noticed a frightening drop in my mood. I dont want to wake up, im hyper-sensitive... I feel like im going to cry at the drop of a hat... And im finding myself feeling very heartbroken and jealous of someone I'm not in a committed relationship with. I dont want to eat, i dont want to drink water.

I am a recreational cannabis user, and not even that isnt providing temporary relief anymore.

Things are starting to feel like they did when they were bad a little over a year ago.

I'm not going to injure myself of others, and im safe in my home.

I'm just very frightened."
286,Why do people care about me more than I care about me?,"I don’t hate myself (most of the time) I just don’t care about myself. Like I wish if I wanted to off myself right now I wish I could without people caring. I know it’s unusual to not want to be seen, but it’s me. I wanna kill myself cus I’m really fucking bored and I have been for a while. I’m tired of being bored and I don’t like anyone to socialize. I know I’m broken and society would be better off without me. All I do is hold people back so why do they hold me back when I wanna help them by not being a burden? Anyway thanks for reading and sry for the word vomit."
287,Back on my antidepressants after a month of feeling low.,I was trying yo figure out why I had been so depressed until I realized that I hadn't taken my antidepressants in 2 MONTHS. Biggest facepalm moment of my life.
288,Should I get an Ipad for drawing despite not drawing much with what i've got?,"Okay, I'm super conflicted wether i should buy myself an ipad w/ apple pencil to restart digital drawing despite having loads of traditional supplies? I'm a beginner/moderate drawer but my problem is I rarely draw or don't draw much. I've been severely struggling over the past 8 years with being productive and starting/sticking to a hobby on my own intuition is extremely hard. The only thing I do all day everyday is browse the internet and listen to music, thats it. This lack of productivity everyday has destroyed my physical and mental fitness. I took so much days off from school that i had to drop out and go to an alternative school. I've tried drawing again and filled up a quarter of my sketchbook but got distracted and forgot about it. I've tried digital drawing and really enjoyed it but I'm scared that once i get the ipad, I'll try it once or twice and feel its too hard, give up and forget about it. I did that with this new gouache set that i wanted so bad, got it and once i played a bit with it, didn't touch it much again. What ya'll think? :/"
289,I honestly just need to rant,"I have dissociative identity disorder (DID) formally known as 'multiple personality disorder'. I've had this alter, or 'other personality' with me since I was about 9. She was my literal best friend. She integrated recently (Meaning she became part of my whole personality again) I I miss her like crazy. You know how when you talk, the voice that you hear is different from what other's hear? Like, how people hate how their voice sounds in recordings? Mine sounds exactly like hers. When I record my voice, it's like she's talking to me again. So I started recording myself reading books. I listen to it when i'm really upset. My friend just called me egotistical, despite knowing all the facts of the situation. It's not that I like the sound of my own voice, I like the sound of *her* voice. Besides, what's wrong with recording a bit of an audio book for yourself? It's not like anyone hears it but me. Maybe I just need to be less sensitive. I don't know. I feel better after typing it all out though! If anyone made it this far, sorry and thanks for listening"
290,No appetite,These past 3 years my eating habits went from not eating in school cause i got used to being shamed for my habbits to i don't eat in front of people in general and at this point im not even hungry i have no appetite whenever i try to eat i feel nauseous and i also have these extremely painfully stabbing feeling in my chest (around my heart) and in my stomach and headaches lasting for weeks and i have no idea what i should do
291,do i have imposter syndrome? or am i literally just faking it?,"Alright I'm about to make myself vulnerable as hell. I'm 17, and I went to the pediatrician several months ago before all of this coronavirus craze. I took the paper surveys they give you to make sure you're ""okay,"" and I scored high for having anxiety, depression, and ADD or ADHD. 

The problem is that when I went to the doctor a year before, I was told I was fine and especially didn't have ADD/ADHD because my grades ""were too good."" My parents are making me take contacting a therapist/psychiatrist into my own hands, but I'm too anxious to do it because I feel like they'll tell me I'm neuro typical and laugh in my face. 

I suppose I do shit that would clearly give away my issues (loss of interest, self harm, the whole nine yards...), but I've had friends in much worse situations than mine so I feel like I should be ok. I guess I'm thinking this: if I've made it 17 years without killing myself, I'm fine...but I constantly feel like an underachieving dumbass.

Every day is an uphill battle for me (in the current situation), but there are so many people worse off than me. So am I just looking for attention? I would think that I could tell, but clearly not. My parents now walk on eggshells around me sometimes because I've a couple of outbursts, so that's definitely not helping. It makes me feel like a temperamental toddler if I'm being honest. I'm not 100% sure where I'm going with this, but has anyone else experienced the same thing? If so, how do I fix this? I'm not one to show much emotion on a daily basis or give way to how I feeling besides the ""happy mask"" I put on, so idk if therapy would even help me. Meds seem to make it all go away, so maybe I should just aim for finding a psychiatrist (if I'm correct on that one).  

I'm just not sure what to do. Each day is like dragging a ball and chain, but I've made it this far, you know? Anyways, let me know if I'm just being an overreactive teenager that thinks they're depressed when they're not lol. 

also, that's enough feelings for today!"

It all started sometime last week I'm not sure what exactly has triggered this all but I'll try my best to explain and I will answer any questions. So sometime in the last week my boyfriend who I'll refer to as L, started taking caffeine pills in secret. He stopped sleeping for a few days and had begun saying very strange things, things like demons were coming to kill us, or a certain famous person was talking to him in his head and was going to bring him guns so he could make sure he could defend himself. This and so many other strange things were happening but all of us in the house were very confused and didn't know exactly what to do. By Tuesday he had gotten pretty bad and was rambling to himself while chain-smoking cigarettes, we had found out on this day that he had been taking the caffeine pills and knew we had to try to settle him in for some good sleep that night. I kissed him and rolled over and let him know that I wasn't going to sleep until I knew he was sleeping (obviously because he's been up for days and I knew if I fell asleep first he would get up and be up all night again) while I was laying there relaxing waiting for him to sleep he began saying off the wall things like, I know what you're doing, you're not going to win, and more that I honestly can't remember. I began crying because I was pretty frightened and that's when he jumped out of bed and grabbed his knife. In that moment I didn't recognize the man I have woken up to everyday for 3 years, he looked at me and said if you don't stop crying I'm going to stab you. I freaked out and ran into his mother's room, I didn't sleep that night..  his mother and sister managed to get him to go to sleep(tho he should've gone to the hospital right then) the next morning he woke up and was still losing it, he kept screaming at me to get out, go to sleep or die. His mother and sister took him to the hospital and I packed my things and went to my mother's. I know this is a long read so thank you to everyone who has taken the time. There is a lot more to this story so I may do a part 2 but for know I just need advice. I love this man but I am terrified of him now. I know this isn't his fault but I can't stop thinking about what could've happened to me if we were alone... Please help Reddit..."
293,"Sexual assault survivors of reddit, I have a question.","So, this is a very personal question that I’m embarrassed to even ask people I know, so I’m doing it anonymously. I was sexually assaulted at 7 years old and I recently found out that I could have a life threatening secondary infection from gonorrhea and chlamydia and I’m really suffering. But I’m too ashamed to go to the doctor and get help because I feel mutilated and deformed *down there* and it’s like a hidden shame for me. My boyfriend says I’m not deformed or mutilated, but that’s how I feel. Why do I feel that way? Is this unusual for a survivor to feel that way-almost like blaming that part of their body for something awful or..?"
294,Dear Sandra (a rant. Sorry for swears),"Please read your client's fucking file before you start dishing out advice. I didn't get sectioned under the fucking mental health act just for you to keep telling me to be more positive. If you had read my file, you would know that I've been trying to manage depression and anxiety with the mental health system for the past five years, but that this current admission is to do with psychosis and cognitive issues. So kindly fuck off with your ""open the drapes"" and ""draw a butterfly"" bullshit, because my file will tell you I'm terrified and I'm not just here for kicks. 😒"
295,Something has been wrong for a while and I really don't know what to do,"As the title suggests.

I just feel like for a long time. Something has been wrong. I feel like I can't do something. So I don't. I tried to get through my project but in my heart, I gave up a while ago and the pandemic has made it so hard for me to get face to face help. I'm going to fail. My family tells me that after losing my dad and my brother, that they are proud but I feel like I just end up spitting all over that when I decide to just escape into my mindless routines and hobbies.

I'm living alone and I don't feel the desire to make any new friends anymore. I don't even like to speak to people and deliberately wear earphone to avoid interaction with strangers. I don't care about how I look, or what state I live in as long as I'm not going to get fined for letting food rot in my place. My sleep schedule is terrible and I've been waking up feeling awful. Wanting to sleep more so I won't be awake to worry, but too worried to fall back asleep.

I feel like my emotions are broken and my attention is terrible. All I can do is nod and smile, offering vapid responses like ""oh yeah"" and ""that's nice"". I find it hard to feel genuine happiness or excitement. Even in places where is I am genuinely happy for someone.

I feel like things have been wrong for a long time. But i don't break down in tears or panic. So I just can't say anything.

I may delete this tomorrow. Idk yet."
296,Alone for quarantine and it’s not really going well,"I’ve never been the most mentally stable person in the world but being left alone with my thoughts 24/7 is kind of getting to me. I have anxiety issues with the concept of death? But it’s gotten to a point where i have recurring suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm and it’s not the greatest... I feel empty and unmotivated with no hope for the future? But I also feel like a fraud who’s overreacting and I’m just exaggerating the feelings that i have. Idk who to tell so I’m just ranting here oop 
Anyways that is all"
297,I talked about my mental health publicly for the first time and it was hard,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K0NgZblws4

Here's the video, please contact me if you feel low or down, please please please"
298,How do I manage a manic episode?,"I sometimes get this fucking feeling of hate and disgust, but it's like I'm so fucking far out I don't really dislike it.

It's triggered by anger, and it's always late at night. 

But I've never been so awake before I can't go to sleep, I can't relax, I just wanna do something all the time. I play video game after video game and every game it gets worse, but I can't stop it. 

I don't know if manic episode is the right phrase but thats the best I can explain it. 

I'm in this fucking bubble and I can't get snap out of it."
299,Probably my last words,Yeah I have no family or friends who I can tell this to so idk goodbye I guess I'll keep u updated incase I pussy out
300,I'm so done with trying to get help. Not like anyone is devoted on helping a mental 13 year old.,"I had this online friend who was underaged. She drank vodka a lot. I told her to stop every time she said she waa doing it and she told me that I couldn't do anything to stop her. That struck me deep. Deeper than it should have. I just saw a suicide post. I was about to comment but then I just thought whatever not like I can do anything. I let people impact me so much and I'm a hypocrite.

I told someone that they needed to think for themselves. I don't. All I do is let people i want to like me make choices for me. I refuse to see how toxic they are until they are gone. I refuse to say no in fear of them hating me. Heck my ex boyfriend was mentally, physically, and sexually abusive. I refused to see it because I thought it was normal to 'play right's even though it hurt a lot sometimes. And if I ever beat him in said fights he'd keep going until he had me pinned in a painful position. 

I let him touch me because he was so desperate and I thought hed think i was a wimp for saying no or not wanting to. Then when I started saying no he was so used to it that he got mad and physically hurt me just to try and get me to cave. He threatened to hurt his animals that i cared for if I didn't do what he wanted. He'd get mad if I spent more time cuddling his dog. He put a FLAME to his dogs fur. He treated his ex better than me. He got mad when I didn't defend him but yet he didn't defend me when he was sitting next to me.

I could go on. But I won't. I care so little about other people that I can't help but wonder if I'm the biggest jerk alive. I care so much about the closest online friend I have and the odds are she's toxic. I put my happiness, mental stability, and how much I self harm in her hands and she doesn't even know it. I'm so scared of making her mad or upset that I try my absolute hardest to keep my mental state to myself. I blame myself for my drunk friend leaving us because I don't want to have a reason to not take her back if she comes back. She knows my reddit account so I don't know if she sees these.

If someone gave me a pencil and paper and told me to write how I feel id be sent to a hospital. But i can't go to a hospital because then my friend will be upset. And it doesn't matter how I feel or what I need or if I need to vent because she wants to play games instead so I have to keep her happy. I know this won't get upvotes. I never do. I don't care at this point. No one will reach out. No one actually cares to try because I'm so messed up that people don't feel like trying to fix me. It's easier to toss me aside or ignore me. Anyone that has reached out in the past is now gone or ignores me. I don't expect much from people on reddit but it's not like I can get help from anywhere else."
301,I can't speak my problems,"I have a really hard time putting my problems, the things I feel, especially sadness or distress, and how I understand things into words. No matter how hard I try, I can't find the words. Soon the feeling I was trying to share just disappears. The best way I can describe it is like loosing a dream, the more you try and it remember it the more you forget. Everything just goes blank. The things I do end up saying are confusing and don't make sense.

I feel like theres an underlying problem with me and I have no idea what it is or what to do."
302,Is this hollow feeling just growing up?,"So I've been thinking about my life and I feel like children have innate feelings of happines, primarily, and I do believe I did as well, but that once I hit adolescence/puberty, the primary thing I felt was just hollowness.

I guess what im wondering is if anyone else feels the same and if my assumptions are even somewhat correct."
303,Seeking advice. Please help.,"Hello, 
I am not the type to seek help from others about personal problems, I’m the type to bury them inside and hope they go away or that I stumble across a remedy by chance somehow. 

I want to ask for help from people who may be going through similar issues what they think I should look into in terms of identifying my possible behaviors and personality types so that I can read up on those topics and see how they might fit in my life so that I can start to repair them and fix this deep pain I constantly carry with me from years of unacknowledged traumas and Unhealed wounds.
I want to do this so that I can make sense of my story and find a light in this darkness that I’ve been lost in for so long. The key to “making sense” of your life experiences is to write a coherent narrative, which helps you understand how your childhood experiences are still affecting you in your life today. 
This is what I know I need to do if I want to escape this darkness and be able to have meaningful relationships.

One thing I’ve already identified:

Doing some random reading and I have realized I have “dismissive-avoidant attachment personality” likely from my primary caregiver (father) being emotionally distant and not meeting my emotional needs. My parents were split and my mother was largely not in my life due to her own problems mainly being drug addiction. 


My hope is that maybe someone who is familiar with this personality trait could point me in the direction of some other possible or common problems people deal with who are experiencing this. 
No answer will offend me, I simply need help identifying psychological terms so that I can research them and try to make sense of my story.

Thank you so much for reading"
304,I want to die...,"I'm tired physically, mentally and emotionally. It seems like everything I do is always seen as a bad thing. A helping hand is seen as a gateway to an illicit relationship, a word of advice is heard as a hate speech, every good deed done and/or attempted is an act of evil sin. I don't know if I'm depressed or is this something else, but by the way I  see things are going with my life I feel like it's not worth living anymore. I feel drained of everything, my flesh is alive but my insides are dying. Maybe dying isn't such a bad thing. I mean who would care right? Life just kept taking away the good in this world for me anyway..."
305,I need help with my anger problem,"I don’t know if this is classified as something that can be posted here but I want to seek help for a problem I’ve been dealing with all my life 

I tend to get angry at the simplest problems and become violent (not towards people, but generally I break things quite often), and then I’d regret it afterwards. I’ve already tried to help my problem, yet today, I exploded again and smashed my computer before regretting everything again. I’m so disappointed at myself, I don’t know what to do to help myself, I’ve been crying so much and I don’t know what to do. Is this even a big deal and is there anything I can do about it?"
306,It was all going so well.,"I was having a great day got my grades back from the previous semester pushing me up back to a 3.0 two of my professors upped my grades are remarking, it was mail day, my uncle invited me over for dinner on Sunday, reconnected with a highschool friend and won a game of warzone with him. I'm making a bit of spare change selling things on ebay. I finally fixed my broken nocturnal sleep Shedule. I finally stopped gambling on csgo cases, I've stopped seeing hookers. But suddenly I came across a radio head song I forgot about (glass house) and its beautifully depressing lyrics brought me back to a place Ive spent years and still frequent multiple times per week. (spiral in to drugs, mental illness, rehab and complete agony). I then jumped into a game with the lads and I asked myself midgame ""dude wtf is wrong right now"" ""what's making me feel this way?"" , I should be elated and having a great time... There were short bursts of euphoria, but Now I'm laying in bed with the squad pinging me on discord to come back and play another game of r6. But I just want to sulk. Scary thing is. I think I enjoy it. Part of me enjoys sulking and wallowing in self pity. I've done it for years. But today it's clear as day. Today should be an amazing day for me in quarentine,(I like being alone, but can  be social). School doesn't start for another week and all I care to do in life is sleep fap and game. And ofc this.

Fuck me, I just want to get high, 3 years in July. But no fucking way I'm touching anything. Not for the nightmare I put myself and my family through, fuck rehab fuck 12 steps and fuck letting my family see me as a weak minded drug addict. Perhaps I'll just fantasise about a relapse and everyone caring and understanding how hard it is for me to be sober.

Perhaps I'll just sit and chew the fat. 

Thanks for reading. First ever real post about how I'm feeling. :')"
307,What is wrong with me if I keep staying up until 8/9/10/11 am and waking up around 7/8/9 pm?,"I don't do night shifts.  Not working right now because I am in quarantine because of symptoms.  I'm usually a night owl but more staying up until 4 or 5 am, not this late."
308,IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY DEPRESSED OR BIPOLAR~,"I have been struggling for years and have tried a lot of different medications. I have been diagnosed with depression and Bipolar type 1. I recently stopped taking Vraylar because it worked for my bipolar-ness lol but didn’t help my depression as much as I would have liked. My psychiatrist put me on Lithium a couple weeks ago and WOW. That shit WORKS. It’s hard to describe, but lithium literally forces negative thoughts out of my mind. I just wanted to put this out there. If anyone is fucking struggling and is at their wits end, HANG ON A SECOND. Go to a doctor. Talk with them about Lithium. Try it. It has changed my life in a span of weeks. I am happy and it’s the weirdest thing. I honestly had forgotten what happiness felt like. It’s also not very expensive and a lot of insurances cover it, unlike Vraylar. But also, just because this medication works for me, does not mean it will work for everyone. Talk to a doctor. THERE IS HOPE"
309,Not sure how to really put this into words.,"For a while now, I've just felt so bored with life, and nothing really excites me and all that crap. Really, I've never been sad or stressed, or anything of the sort. I just feel like I have no excitement in life, or anything to be sad about, and it's just boredom. I can't ever tell if I genuinely like someone as a friend, or a as special someone, or, even if I'm just bored, and I end up becoming a toxic person in almost any relationship, by turning everything around. I dont know anyone I can talk to about this anymore, at least, because the two only people I did talk to about my issues are dead, or one of them just hate me. I just felt like leaving this here, and I dont want any remorse, or pity, or even sympathy. I just needed to let at least a few random strangers on the internet know how I feel."
310,I don’t want to be alive anymore,This Covid stuff is literally ruining my life to the point I don’t want to live anymore. I seriously think that not even winning the lotto would cheer me up. I’m afraid that if life doesn’t go back to normal soon (which it won’t) that I’m going to end up doing it
311,if I don't make it,"if I don't make it out I love you all, keep going strong even though I couldn't. I fucked up too much, but I'm in a better place"
312,I feel like I am unable to relate to people emotionally.,I find it hard to relate to what people are feeling most of the time. I struggle with being able to comfort my own girlfriend when she is down and this really bothers me as I feel I am unable to be there for her. Sometimes I think maybe I could possibly be a sociopath but then again idk. My family argues and fights constantly and I feel like this might of desensitized me in some way. Advice would be appreciated
313,Just some long term issues I’d like help with.,"Hello, I’m R and I’m here to ask for some advice concerning something that happened about two years ago. It was before I came out to anyone about being trans and my “friend” who knew I had depression and trust issues led me into trusting him and when I asked about how to tell what love was(I didn’t know I was aroace then) he practically forced me to go into a fake relationship where I was sexually abused and when I asked about it he said that it was normal for people our age to be doing it (I was 13-14 at the time) me not able to question as to me he was my only friend who I trusted in years I figured he knew but he just took advantage of my ignorance, because of all this I’ve been scared of making new friends in real life and I don’t like touching people even high fives just make me extremely anxious. In the past few months I haven’t been able to stop hearing things that remind me of it and it just makes me... well I’ve never been good with emotion but hurt in a way where it distracts me for hours to the point of my one safe thing, drawing, I just cannot do because back then I drew splatoon and dnd stuff, both of which I still love, and now I can’t do anything like it or else I just feel awful. Occasionally I hear a certain kind of doorbell or a certain sound from a videogame and I’m just out of it. Wow I’ve been rambling, I’m sorry I’ve never told anyone about this and I guess it got to a boiling point, so any advice would be amazing thanks so much to whoever read this far into my rant about nothing :)."
314,I have extensive sh scars on my arms and it has resulted not only in disfigurement but also pain and problems with nerves and blood flow.,"I have been clean for about 5 months (yay). About 2 years ago I struggles with sh addiction all over my body but concentrated on my arms. My left arm is the worst and overall both arms are disfigured severely. Even slight pressure results in pain. I find i hide my arms most time because they look so awkward. My fingers go numb because blood flow is disturbed.

I dont know what this is for I just need to get it into something."
315,Confused," Huge Rant/vent ig

I feel like im dreaming all the time. Like everything around me is off somehow and it just feels like im dreaming. I normally feel this way and i feel like my body is foreign and not rlly mine. I dont recognize my hands or my face in the mirror. Its like this constantly and im always disconnected from the world and spacing out all the time.

Time liss is a hige issue, almost everyday i have periods where i will blink and hours have oassed and ive done things i cant remember.

My memory is so scrambled and blurred. I cant remember any of my childhood and even yesterday is just a scrambled blur. The things i can remember arent consistant with what actually happened and apparently dont make sense and my memory is in “third person”

Im just stuck in my head ig. Spacing out into the void.

Sometimes its like im walking away from myself.

Ive lost grip of time and i dont think i ever had a grip on it in the first place.

Sometimes, a lot more recently, i have these memories that feel real and i dont like them. I normally forget them though so ig its not that big of a deal. The panick attacks and nightmares suck though.

Im just so confused all the time. Its like i have no control. I dont think i ever did.

I thought this was normal for awhile but im coming to find that it isnt.

The anxiety sucks. Trust issues. Its difficult to open up to people unless ik they cant hurt me. The only reason why im making this post is so i can gather my thoughts. Are they even my thoughts? Some of them dont sound or feel like my thoughts. I argue with them a lot.

Why cant i just remember yesterday? Ugh. Weeks gone in what feels like a couple days.

This is all too much for me. Im thinking about doing something so i can just feel real for once in my life."
316,Advice for Quarantine Depression?,"Hey all. About a year and a half ago, I moved to a new city for my husband's work. I now live a 3-4 hour drive away from my family. I'm a homebody and doing the housewife thing right now, and I've dealt with depression long enough to know that if I don't have a job, or some regular activity outside of the apartment, it gets way worse. I go from dealing with mostly just the physical effects (exhaustion) to dealing with all the more traditional symptoms, primarily a loss of enjoyment in hobbies and such. Since the move, I've mainly kept going by taking a local weekly painting class, and going to see my family every few months, even just for a day or two, just to catch up and hug them a lot, as I slowly, slooooowly search for friends in my new city.

Here's my current situation: my husband is deployed overseas, my weekly class has been cancelled, and obviously I can't go see my family. Even if I could, my normal pet boarding place is not currently boarding, until restrictions loosen. In some ways, it's made social distancing very easy. I only have one friend up here, who I hadn't even known that long, I don't have to worry about losing a job, or my husband bringing anything home. I don't go see my family, because they're out of state, etc. Mostly I've been hanging in there really well. I play D&amp;D online, and my closest friend and I primarily communicate online anyway, so that hasn't really changed, but these things really are not substitutes for seeing people in person. For hugging people, and being hugged. For even just having someone sit nearby, watching the same movie you are. Phonecalls, and online games prop me up for a day or so, before I just kind of feel how I did before. Over the last few months, I've gone from coping very well, to the last couple of weeks, where I either want to cry, feel numb, or feel frustrated, because I can't get invested in or excited about things I like. With the restrictions, I really have no idea how to fix this. I'm not a danger to myself, but god, I just feel that terrible hollowness, and I don't know what to do.

Has anyone found any good coping strategies during this time? Any replacements for human contact, at least?"
317,Declining mental health,"I am in my mid 30s (m) At some point I started to have anxiety and depression issues.  I don't like antidepressants and I tend to abuse anti anxiety meds like zanax so I stopped taking them (wish I didnt, cant sleep).  So I've let my mental health issues go untreated for some time.  I never really thought anyone liked me, never thought very high of myself.  Definitely low confidence.  Over the past few years I've had a tough time with my career which has made things a lot worse.  As of late probably over the past 6 months I've been steadily declining.  My depression/ anxiety issues have turned into something worse.  I constantly think,  I have delusions of grandeur and persecution.  I have taken a lot of hits to the head over the years and I took a nasty fall out of an attic a few months before things took a turn for the worse.  I started taking testosterone (low t) to help me with life and I did get better.  I figured more is better so I changed doctors and the new one increased the dose and prescribed several other hormone/energy related things.  At first when the gym was open life was good.  Now my mental health has gone to shit.  I'm literally delusional, depressed, lonely and I'm doing stupid stuff.  I don't have much social interaction at all.  I've lost intelligence.  I've started drinking heavily for the first time and I enjoy it.  I have an appointment Monday with a doctor to try to get this thing figured out.  I'll never have a life if I don't.  Already reduced the testosterone and related stuff on my own because it isn't helping.  I'm going to stop drinking and smoking ciggs.  I'm worried I could have a brain tumor or brain injury.  Things have just steadily worsened and this coronavirus crap has made it almost unbearable.  I've committed to the fact that I can't run from this anymore though and I have to do whatever it takes to get the whole situation figured out once and for all.  I'm ready for a new life."
318,My childhood best friend and roommate has DID,"I’m so sorry if this isn’t the correct place to put this, if it gets removed I’ll understand. 

Late last year, my best friend whom I live (in North Carolina, US) with was officially diagnosed with DID.

I don’t know much about DID, I don’t even know where to begin to help him through this, but I want to be as helpful and supportive as possible. I’ve been online researching a lot on it, trying to familiarize myself with it and normalize it in my mind the best I can. 

As I said before, I’ve been living with him for years, and I’ve seen his outbursts and mood swings before, and I’ve learned how to deal with it calmly. Now that I know this behavior could be a switch between alters, I’m wondering if maybe I should be doing something differently...

If anyone has helpful articles or blogs they can refer me to, I would be very grateful. We’re both a bit nervous about this, I think he may be in denial, but I really want to be helpful. I know of his past traumas that brought this on, and through my research I’ve learned what it may be doing to him. I’m not asking for advice, unless you’re a professional in which case I’d prefer you refer me to a site or blog instead. Thank you for reading, sorry again if this isn’t the correct place to post this. Have a nice day!"
319,I think quarantine is affecting me in unexpected ways. Help?,"I've been staying indoors most of the time, only leaving to go grocery shopping. I've had some mental health issues before but nothing 'serious' or diagnosed by a professional. However, these past few months I've been experiencing some issues, but they have really gotten worse while staying at home all the time...

Basically, during the day I'm totally fine but when I go to bed I have really bad irrational episodes that prevent me from sleeping. The majority of the time I'm terrified that someone may break into my home, or that there is paranormal activity in my house that will hurt or kill me (... and I'm an atheist lol). I sleep with my boyfriend and one night I heard him breathing a little differently, so I had thoughts that he was actually a robot lol. Just really ridiculous intrusive thoughts and obsessions that lead me to have to leave the light on or close the door. Yesterday my boyfriend put a hammer on our door knob and nails at the foot of the door, so that if it was opened I would be able to hear someone come in. I know that the chances are really low, but I can't help obsess about it, and every noise I hear at night scares me. 

I've tried countless things, like listening to Headspace before bed, deep breathing techniques, listening to music on Spotify, using a nightlight, etc. They work temporarily but the next night it doesn't matter. I should also mention that a couple nights ago I saw a dark figure (basically a person) in my bedroom doorway, and even when I stared at them they didn't go away, but I know it's just my mind seeing things in the dark. I know it's all in my head. But my heart starts racing after my boyfriend falls asleep, and then it's just me and the darkness. I sometimes stay up till 6AM, even though I'm exhausted, cause I just have to watch the door. 

Please help. I'm almost 21 and I'm afraid of the dark again. It's so embarrassing. I'm posting here because I'm afraid of talking to a friend about it. My boyfriend doesn't quite understand. And I don't want to see a therapist because I'm embarrassed and honestly don't want them to know it's me or see my face. Is this some kind of sleep anxiety or insomnia? 

If you've read this far, thank you. I see a lot of other posts here from truly hurting people. I'm sorry that my post pales in comparison, but I just needed to ask about what's wrong with me. :("
320,"I’ve told myself since I was 14 that If things didn’t get better, I’d kill myself on my 19th birthday. Now that date is 20 days away and I have a suicide plan.","
Hey there, first off i want to apologize for posting on this sub so frequently. I guess I’ve been hanging on by a thread for a very long time. 

As the title says, I have a suicide plan and intent to carry it out. I know that it is wrong and that I need to get help, but I can’t. My therapist/psychiatrist will not take me seriously because I always chicken out and tell them I am not planning anything. My parents would freak out if they knew because they think the thoughts are selfish and don’t understand mental illness.

I have no where to turn and know I’ll do it if I reach my birthday without any serious help."
321,Delusions,Anyone else suffer from delusions of persecution?  I've always been kind of unstable I guess but a lot of it is environmental.  Are delusions an effect of bipolar disorder?
322,OCD thoughts hopelessness help please,"Hello, I am struggling with OCD on the compulsive side. I have an issue lately that is horrible and I hate talking about these things from the fear of judgement. I have thoughts of bad things obviously but an example of what I am feeling I will write. 

So on Thursday I went and worked helping my friend at his greenhouse. It was him me and his mom and his little step sister. I saw his little step sister who is I think in the eighth grade and I am a senior in high school. My mind instantly sexualizes things most of the time but I did not in this situation. I was like yeah whatever they do not look bad and are not ugly or anything and tried to shake the thought. I sent the rest of the day and Friday not telling anyone how I felt and how I saw that situation.

Tonight I was talking to my girlfriend and told her about it and as you would have guessed she was not happy. I told her I would not act in these thoughts and I do not enjoy having them and I do not feel like that is me. Out of anger my girlfriend hung up and I messaged her about it but that is not what I am worried about. 

What I am worried about is that after talking about that and stuff I got the thought to go masturbate. I went and looked at some drawn porn (hentai) and then went to normal porn and back to hentai. I watched the video and got off to it and I can not help but to think that me talking about my friends step sister might have gave me the thought to go do things to myself and I feel guilty and shaky and I am not happy about it. I do not want tot elk my girlfriend about it in fear she will be upset and leave or anything. I do not like feeling this way and it makes me feel bad. 

I do not know if that is what gave me the thought to do it or if I just thought to go do it but I am thinking it was the thought or something of his little step sister and I feel bad and guilty. I do not want to feel like this and do not think I would ever act on anything like that. I do not know what to do and I feel like I may have thought bad and done something bad by thinking that way. Please help me."
323,What am I.,"Its been two months since I started my mental health treatment and I am already better. It's been years since I've felt this good, but sometimes I don't know what I am anymore. My whole life has just been pain and suffering. It was who I was. I became the the suffering and embodied hatred and wanted to kill every human on this earth. Now that years and years of my inner suffering is fading because of my antidepressants and antipsychotic medications my anger and hatred have been nullified. Now that my anger and hatred for mankind is gone I am nothing. I can't pick up the pieces because my past self is gone the past self that made me hurt and hate who I am. I feel helpless because I have to rebuild a life that was 17 years of pain. I don't know what to do or where to start. The inner me wants claw it's way out but I've trapped it in and it is nullified by my medication. I don't know what I am or what I should be moving on. How am I supposed to live like this when I don't have the energy or motivation to create a new me?"

327,"Thought it'd get better after meds and therapy, but I can't control the spiraling thoughts"," Today I just want to sleep forever. I want to go peacefully, without pain or discomfort… just fall asleep and never wake up. It feels like the hardships will  never end, the stress, the insomnia, the anger and depression, the list of things that are all 100 out 100 in priority. I just want silence. No thoughts. Not about how much money we don’t have, or what people think of us or our kids they have more than they could ever want, or even how I feel about myself. I just don't give a  fuck about anything. I want it to be over. I know there are consequences, but if I survived without my mother, my girls can too, right? He’ll find his perfect match. Clearly I’m not it, I’m just the off and on depression girl he met in highschool and almost left because I could NOT talk about what I was feeling. I’m literally nothing. I can’t handle 6 hours alone with my own damn kids. What good am I to anyone. Why the fuck am I even here, what’s the purpose. Why am I busting my ass for a 4.0 gpa. What if it leads me to nothing but more debt, extra anxiety, and nothing to show for it. I feel like I’m floating along for no good reason. Joy is fleeting. It comes and then goes away just as quickly.I’m happiest when spending time with my family, but my workload doesn’t permit that. I HAVE to work. I HAVE to succeed. I HAVE to give them the most amazing lives. But if i die in the process, is that a good or a bad thing? There are too many creative ideas in my head, it feels like my brain is going to explode if I don't let them out.I understand why so many artists went crazy,,, I feel like I’m headed down that fucking path, I cant focus on any one thing, one minute I’m sketching, then I;m designing, then I’m prototyping, then I’m changing shitty diapers, then I’m trying to figure out how we’ll get groceries this month, then I’m just.. Awake… the most recent streak was 4 ½ days straight, not even a nap or dozing off. Just so many ideas... But.why… they’ll never be executed. Just thoughts on a fucking page. Just like these. To be forgotten. Really, what is my purpose, I’m tired of waiting to find out, just a grim outlook and new trials everyday I open my eyes… Even when I wake with some semblance of gratitude and peace, it’s always something that comes along and snatched it away, like I never should have had it. I don’t know who the fuck I am. I’m tired of hearing how amazing I am from people who don’t know how fucked up my head is. They wouldn’t say those things if they knew I spend half of everyday wishing for death. ‘Oh you’ll figure it out” just keep grinding’ ‘It worked for me” ‘Quitters just didn’t have it in them” ‘Do more” “you’ll only get there if you work 3 times as hard as the smartest person in the room” STOP, I really don’t need to hear that shit. I need help to find a motivation and will to keep going, not cliche ‘isms’ that people like on Twitter but never actually apply. Whatever. I’m done. Whatever happens happens. I dont care anymore."
328,im a pornstar.,im so sick of these guys messaging me on twitter for for a quick fuck. this makes feel sick. If can help me feel better and not try to cum on face to do it.
329,I don’t have the energy to create anymore,"When I was in grade school, my mind was bursting with a constant flow of creativity. Now I can hardly complete a piece in a few days. I want to create again, but it’s as if my body and mind won’t let me do the things I loved anymore. I hope this is temporary, because if this lasts any longer, I might as well not stick around because that was my whole purpose of living. Can anyone relate?"
330,This seems to be the start of something good. Possibly great.,"So as I have said in this subreddit before, I had a severe car wreck back on December 7th of 2019. I was also dealing with rather intense alcoholism. Not even a month before that, I had lost my job due to smoking pot and pissing dirty after getting hurt. I have sadly been unemployed since then. The “covid” bullshit has not helped in job hunting either. My wife has been killin’ it and holding things down whilst I get myself straightened out. 

That said, it’s time I paid her back one thousand fold. I am beginning that process by acquiring a job. If all goes well during the onboarding process, I will be working at Amazon. I’ve yet to determine whether it will be long term or not. I do, however, plan on trying my absolute best to climb the ladder and try landing a higher up position there. 

I feel like things are finally starting to come together for me and I could not be more elated. Being consistent with my medication and putting my mental health first has given me a brand new outlook on just about every aspect of my life. I have so many things to do for the people who have been by my side during this time of my life. 
In short, don’t give up. If I can do this, anyone can."
331,My complete history of who I am This will lead to an emotional flow of high and low where I'm still struggling with that till now.,"Hey everyone this is vasi I'm 22 years old  the whole it is all based on the reaction I'm getting from my friends and surrounding and my personal pros and cons of myself. 
What others think about me 
Immature, weak, stupid, not qualified, doubters, defensive, inexperienced and Overthinking .. I agree I sometimes I never act like tough guy which 90%of the people naturally do  I will be just be goofing around and funnier that's it. 

Personally : I'm serious guy, from childhood mostly don't  watch movies , spend everyday watching useful things till now, always try to be nice to everyone still hated for no reason..  These questions and other things make my mood elvated and dropped sooner without no reasons. 


my mental struggles have always been related with my family financial status which has shaped me in and out personally during my elementary stages I used to hate my father for his worst attitude at the time being abusive to my mom and  during in my early teen every thing was going good even we were struggling we were living a life without problems then suddenly with some financial rise we literally become talk of the town for sudden rise in the status that was 14-16 at that time I was so confident happiest days of my life everywhere people started to respect me and then I started to proceed abroad to study  by 18 these were the beginning of toughest days in my life literally I had  no money for room rents I didn't pay for months no money for food (my friends helped me a lot for food) during that time gaming was the only emotional relief for me and the I started to play games everyday at one point it lead me into sleeplessness if I'm not sleepy then it was leading me to stress, depression and suicidal thoughts..then porn was helping me better but it was the beginning of yet another worst things to happen By 20 I started to realize and it took me more than a year to figure and to have a perfect chart to fix then when I turn 21 everything started to get a little bit better financially, emotionally from July 2019 I started to do workouts consistently, started practicing had better sleep at nights for many months until this quarantine shit which started make me feel worse emotionally no idea how to overcome sleeplessness, depressed and personally I've problems with my another group of friends..

I don't know how balance everything and be a happy person physically and mentally"

336,I don’t care about animals,"I don’t hate animals. I just don’t care about them. It might be because of childhood, but I also feel like it makes more sense than caring about one group and killing another. 

Dogs for example.

I don’t understand why people value dogs so much. They’re just another animal. Were okay with killing some animals, but go crazy about the death of dogs. Is it because people think they’re cute? Is their love of dogs just superficial? Pigs are as intelligent if not more intelligent than dogs, and we kill and eat them everyday.

I have the same reaction to seeing a cow and a dog die. Is there something wrong with my view? Let me know.

(Some backstory)

My dad lived in a reservation out in the middle of nowhere , and I would go there in the summers to visit him. There were a lot of dogs and he’d kill them and throw them on a dog pile in the woods. They were a bit of a pest and could be dangerous. Also, I’ve seen him kick a puppy like 10 feet. It was wild. 

These things made me realize that dogs aren’t anything special. I used to like them and had one when I was a kid, but those feelings are foreign to me now. I don’t hate them, just like I don’t hate any other animal. I just don’t care about them. 

Should I care about animals? I feel like you have to care about all animals or none. 

I see these hypocrites who happily slaughter an animal they don’t find “cute” and then abhor other cultures killing dogs. 

Is this not wrong? Am I wrong?

I find it hard enough to care about other humans let alone caring about the well being of less intelligent animals. 

How do I care about animals while also eating meat and turning a blind eye to the cruelty? 

Does it not make more sense to just stop pretending and admit that I don’t really care? 

Things live and die everyday. I’ll eventually cease to exist too. Does it matter? I don’t think so, but when I tell people I don’t care about dogs or animals they give me looks like I’m a crazy person. Are they not hypocrites? Am I wrong?"
337,Having Trouble Sleeping,"I don’t know where else to ask but I have been unable to sleep at a decent time for the past week. At first it was just a sensation of not being tired but now I just cannot get my mind to be quiet. I shoot up after maybe 5 minutes of being asleep tonight and said “Who is here” without meaning to. 

I’m kind of freaked out and if anyone has any strategies they use or advice  that would be very nice."
338,Therapy just makes me feel worse,"(Excuse my english, it’s my second language)

I just need a place to vent, i’m 15, and doing horrible. I’m not always sad / depressed, but when i am it’s like a 3 day episode of not even having motivation to leave my bed or eat / shower + being stuck in a loop of negativity and panic attacks that feel endless. These episodes have me extremely hopeless and i don’t know what to do anymore, lifes too hard on me emotionaly. I’m also really stressed 24/7, to the point where i developed a stomach ulcer. 

Whenever i tell my therapist about these episodes and other issues it feels like i’m not taken serious, like she downplays the issue. Which hurts me because i’m desperate for a solution or a way to cope and her not taking me seriously is just making my life even more shit then it already is. I’ve thought about quitting therapy because it simply has yet to help me in the 4 years that i’ve been going.

I think about using drugs or doing other reckless behaviour to cope 24/7 because i’m numb and desperate. Life fucking sucks and i don’t know how anyone can live life and be happy honestly, it’s all too overwhelming for me and i wish there was a way to numb myself."
339,I feel numb... From compliments and I can't seem to find out why...,"Idk how to really describe it...

Today at work I was told that I was too  smart for this job , likable, funny, and on other days got called good looking and I barely responded to these compliments... Like I didn't feel a sense of happiness or even feeling uplifted...

But on the other hand when something goes wrong I immediately get angry and start losing it as if there was no tomorrow.

Idk why I'm  like this... Maybe because lately I've been really stressed because of work+online school and I really can't take it anymore. it's even lead to me having breathing difficulties at work which is really strange..."

Point is; can your mind take over that much? Or am I just a shit driver"
341,Fear of Power,"I am a budding engineer and someday, I do plan on taking leadership positions.
However whenever I try to envision me in such a position, I feel intense fear of tyranny.

I would attribute the perception to my Mom.
She was narcissistic and gaslighting on me.

I fear all in power are meant to screw me.
And I fear that if I am in power, I will screw them.

Furthermore, I fear that if I am in power, people i have power over will resent me. Yes, I fear becoming my mother.

How could I go about healing myself here?
Not sure how I can convince myself that the determinism of these childhood experiences is not what I would repeat. I feel imprisoned by my past. It is petrifying..."
342,i feel like a complete waste of space,"i feel so little joy for things anymore. i ruin more lives than i fix, i just hurt people or piss them off. so many friends leave me. my own family has completely disowned me, i have to live with my boyfriend. i always feel so guilty fir taking up space, spending their money. i can't even get a fucking job since no one wants to hire me. the only job i had was a temporary one and i couldn't even handle that. i ruin so many things, for myself and others. yet i can't just kill myself to solve my issues, the few people who care are stopping me from doing so. i hate it. i hate being so useless and upset all the time, dealing with the trauma from years of abuse. i can't even get any real help. ive lost hope of getting better but i have no choice. i have to stick around. i don't want to burden more people by leaving a mess of my body in this house or leaving people to grieve. i think everyone would be better off without me but i can't seem to do it..."
343,Might have PTSD from past trauma with a ex,"This happend at the end of 2018 and was the big event that broke me and Ash up.  she wanted to go on a date to texas Roadhouse Ash suffers from bipolar and depression and when the waiter cooked her steak wrong she grabbed a knife that was on the table and tried to put it in to my leg she told me it was a joke after.  I'm Brazilian jiu jitsu fighter so I had no problem getting the knife away from her but to this day I always carry a knife on me I just want to know how I can live a normal life again. 

I know I probably shouldn't need the knife but I feel weird leaving without it"
344,A lot of shitty things are happening to me,"Starting with one that's fucking me up the most, my sleep. My sleep schedule is so jacked. Today I slept through dinner and it's always the same sleep pattern. Stay up all night having a mental breakdown, be tired all day, constantly almost passing out and disassociating, then as soon as dinner comes I either pass out before dinner's ready or when I eat I go straight to bed and pass out. I've literally fallen asleep on video calls multiple times. And sleep isn't coming to me since I've had those weird hallucinations/dreams. To the next problem, I can't cry anymore. It's been, like months and I haven't been able to fucking cry. I can make myself get choked up, and feel tears in my eyes like you do when you cry, but tears never fall. Even when they do it's for two seconds then it stops. I have no way to release pent up emotions besides writing and drawing and even then it doesn't help that much. I've been trying to cry for the longest time but I just, can't. Every day I'm just this emotionless being but as soon as I'm alone all of it just comes out. Not the tears, but all the negative emotions. I don't know if I'm emotionally strong or a heartless sociopath. Next problem. I want to kill someone, then myself. I want to slide a knife through someone's chest and watch the pained look on their face as they realize that they're not going to live. Stab them over and over and over again until that pained look becomes empty and dead. I want to break every bone in their body, cut off every limb. Cut out their tongues, their eyes, their ears. Behead them. Slice through their stomach and rip out their heart, their intestines, gut them like a fish. Soak the remains in gasoline and burn it. Leave nothing but a pile of ashes and blood on the ground. Then use that same knife and cut every inch of skin on my arms, until there's blood dripping off my arms. I want to punch the walls until my knuckles are bleeding.  Last fucked up thing. I would have new cuts every minute if I didn't want my mom to find out. Every time I cut she would give me the same lecture, "" You know I'm here for you right? Do we need to go to therapy more often? You're just distracting yourself from the REAL pain. ' 1) The whole point IS to distract myself from the emotional pain. And  2) Going to therapy makes me feel worse. I haven't cut for longer than I want it to be. Every time I feel any sort of emotions my arm starts to itch where my scars are and sometimes they start to get like, waves of pain. It's like my body WANTS me to cut. And trust me, I want to, but not only will my mother notice, everyone else I live with will notice. And I don't need them treating me like I'm some sort of special little kid. So, in conclusion, for someone who's a selfish narcissistic bitch, I hate myself a fuck ton"

I'm having really, really bad suicidal thoughts. They are scaring me. They are making me feel like a terrible mother. I love my daughter more than life, but my head is such a mess. I had a pretty traumatic childhood and teen life. Men have used and abused me, raped me, beaten me. Scarred me and left me with crippling anxiety, OCD and depression. I don't want to pass this on to her, she deserves better, she deserves more than me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My partner doesn't understand as much as I wish he did, maybe I'm not vocal enough. I cry everyday when I get five minutes to myself, I am crying. I don't even need to think about it, it just happens. I don't have many friends, a handful that are scattered around the country.   


I could walk around having suicidal thoughts and not one person notice, nobody. I do my best to try help everybody, console everybody when they need it. But I don't seem to have that, so I keep it to myself and it manifests. I'm so afraid I'll take my life, the thoughts are so vivid. It;s like my head is planning my own death without consent.

350,Tired of being looked at like some kind of damn invalid because I have a mental illness.,I am 45 and live with my parents. I have schizoaffective bipolar type among other things. I'm pretty damn stable too. I found out that my Mom and sister in law and dad were planning behind my back to claim me as a dependant so my mom and dad could benefit financially. Honestly I don't mind that they claim me. I mind they didn't ask me if it was ok that they do so. It to me is a total fucking slap in the face. I am still a human being deserving of some sort of respect. I'm mad as hell about this shit but I can't say a damn thing because it will make me look like some crazy unhinged lunatic. All I can do is absorb this truth and try to behave in a way that is indicative of a human being with some self respect.
351,Pulled out my eyebrows and didn't realize,I have had a problem for a long time biting my nails pulling out my hair and picking at my skin until it bleeds especially since I've gotten clean and stopped cutting. Alot of the time I don't realize I'm doing it or it happens when I loose time. even though those things were easier to hide or explain away I still wanted to stop. I've been in a really bad place lately and in trying to stop I started pulling out my eyebrow hair. I knew it was a problem but not too bad just like the other things but I must have lost time a few days ago and when I touched my face it hurt. Looked in the mirror and my eyebrows are gone and my skin is slightly damaged. It is extremely noticable and is now causing me more stress. I have been wearing low hats and sunglasses and stuff to hide it because I don't want anyone to notice or ask me about it. Does anyone know how long it will take for them to grow back or a way I can grow them back faster/ heal the skin faster? Please help

354,Should i go see my doctor?,"I have ocd and depression just incase thats relevant. 

I have an infatuation with a girl (long story short lol) and most of the time it makes me feel like absolute shit. However some days - and not for long - it wont really bother me, as in for a little bit i'm not infatuated with her and i feel like i'm fine.

That's just one example. I'll often get excited about something and then shortly after i'll be like ""why was i excited about that"" or whatever and it's like i get embarrassed or ashamed when people see me being happy about something.

Like i have these mood swings where i'll feel really good and i'll go for walks or go out and do something fun and then later on - like in the next few days or the next week I feel completely different.

My state of mind changes and I was in a completely different state of mind then because what i thought would be fun (and was) last week, i can't do this week and i view that activity the complete opposite)

357,Do I even have DID?," I've many ""episodes"" in the past and yesterday I guess I had one as well? I don't know if it's my imagination, or DID, or anything else, but yeah.. So I was talking to this girl about her recovering from anorexia and her hardships, then the conversation got into Mental Hospitals. I guess that was the trigger, because I started to feel something ""shift"" inside of me and some sort of blood-lust became more and more apparent. Then ""I"" went on a rant, talking about how I would adore to cut em open n shit like that, With a big ass smile on the face and was almost drooling at the thought of it happening. The visuals were pretty realistic tbh (I didn't see things, I just had kind of images pop up into my head about me cutting people up, burning them alive and listening to their screams, driving nails through their bones, and things like that..) .

Anyways, then when ""I"" realized what was going on I started an internal dialogue. He wanted to stay for longer, to have more ""fun"" and I just told him to fuck off cause I want to sleep. It was weird to say the least and it's only one of many.."

359,I am lost,"I find life very peculiar. I've been noticing some sign among the years of myself, leading to a conclusion which I'll address at the end of the post.

I find that I am unable to feel empathy. Just not too long ago a long-time friend of mine told me he had broken up with his girlfriend, and I didn't feel anything! And while this was not the first time I've noticed it, it was the latest one. I find it very weird because I can understand the feelings, and as a writer, I have gotten a lot of praise for representing feelings in a realistic way in my works.

In the end, I don't really care of other people? While I do follow social ideologies like humanism and feminism, I believe it is mostly just me trying to look better for others. I have some friends, and I am capable of loving, though only certain people, but I find it very difficult to be interested in others for an extended period of time.

I feel like I am superior to others. I put others' needs ahead of my own, but again, it is likely just me trying to look better. I feel like my goals are above all else, and I'd go to great lengths to achieve them, even if it meant manipulating others.

Thus I have come to a conclusion, am I a sociopath? I'd appreciate (though I do not feel the feeling of gratitude of appreciation) having some light to the subject, and will happily (I'm rarely happy) answer any and all questions, even regarding my personal history and emotions if it is of help."
360,Anxiety &amp; Juul,"If you use a Juul and also have anxiety, or see your anxiety worsen, please consider it possibly being the Juul.

I quit smoking cigarettes (1.5 packs a day x 8-10 years), and used a Juul for Nicotine Replacement.  I was told 1 pod = 1 pack of cigarettes.  However, I feel the use of the acid and nicotine salt method makes it 2.7x stronger than normal also.  

I vaped with the impression of it being 1 pack to 1 pod, and it did not take long for my blood pressure to reach (+20-30 / + 10-20 / + 10-20), and also experience heart palpitations, headache, fatigue, jittery, panic attacks, extreme anxiety, etc.

I started everything from beta blockers to going to therapy to try to figure out everything that has been going on.  

If you are experiencing any of these symptoms and Juul, try stopping the juul and see if it returns to normal.  As a former smoker, and going off the manufacturers listed nicotine rating, it took me longer to figure it out."
361,Wired thoughts,Anyone else get fucked thought you might think as wtf moments before actually doing something.

362,How to deal with nightmares?,"Hi, I’m not exactly sure if this is the right sub to ask the question, I hope it is though. 

When I left my abusive household 2 years ago I had the idea that I came out pretty okay, at least not with major mental health problems. I did however drink lots of alcohol which numbed my feelings, something I realized in hindsight. The drinking numbed my anxiety and how sad and betrayed I felt after my mother choose the side of my abusive stepfather. Last year I decided I had enough of this numbness and started tackling life head on. I quit smoking &amp; drinking and started exercising, meditating and focusing on my mental health. I had a planned appointment for a psychologist in march, but it was cancelled because of Covid-19. Now the biggest problem I face is now that I’m completely sober, I notice how anxious I am and I also have tons of nightmares. Every night I dream of being back in my household or encountering my stepfather. I never wake up refreshed and always like I’ve just been on a rollercoaster of misery. I’ll have to wait for the covid lockdown to end before I can talk to a psychologist, but the nightmares are keeping me from sleeping normally. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to improve my situation?

Thanks in advance"
363,getting really bad imposter syndrome recently,"Recently whenever I've gone on a call with people, I've always felt like I don't belong there and like people wouldn't care if I left. I start to get really anxious that Ill embarrass myself and annoy everyone. Everytime I say something, I always overthink about what ive said and how selfish it must seem or how annoying my voice is. i can never just feel like i fit in or feel relaxed. Also when I remeber like being in old clubs and even being part of communities on here and online, I feel like I dont belong. Does anyone else get this? What can I do to try and stop this? Why is it getting so bad because for me this feeling has never been this bad before?"
364,"I don’t know what to do, I’m freaking out, severe anxiety has been ongoing for weeks, going into a pretty bad depression.","I’m (21 F). I’ll start this off with the fact that I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. So I’m not sure if this is the cause, Either way. 

Starting from age 13 I was put on antidepressants. None worked until I got on Effexor, I was probably 14 or 15 when i started on it. And I stayed on it until about a year ago. That stuff was terrible for me for a lot of different reasons other than the fact that it made my anxiety practically inexistent. I was put on Wellbutrin and Lamictal and I’ve been on that mix for about a year now, and I’ve really enjoyed it until the past few months. More so even recently. 

I am STRUGGLING. It is constant panic attacks, my lungs hurt because I don’t ever feel like I can catch my breath. My throat has been feeling as though it’s closing. I’m not able to talk to anybody, I just lock up. And being around people who are talking gives me anxiety attacks. I’m not even able to be around my fiancé as of lately. And he’s getting worried about me because I have never done this before. Usually when I’m not doing okay I run to him for security, not run away. I can’t even talk to my coworkers. I haven’t been eating. I had to leave work a few weeks back because I was absolutely freaking out, I ended up calling in “sick” the next two days Just because I was so scared of going back. 

The anxiety issue is definitely causing some pretty bad depression, which I haven’t had depression this bad in .. years maybe? My anxiety has never been this bad before. I feel like I’m going batshit, and It’s ruining my life. Even driving, which is usually one of my favorite and most calming things is freaking me out. I’m used to my anxiety being existent, but not nearly anything this bad. 

I’ve tried to get in with my psychiatrist and they scheduled me for the 20th. I’m gonna call Monday and see if there’s any way I could get in earlier because of the severity. That’s a long damn time though, I’m feeling hopeless honestly. I don’t know what to do. 

I got a weighted blanket, which helps me sleep longer and better, but doesn’t help me much when I’m awake. I’ve been sleeping a lot more. I bought some valerian root, but I’m scared it’ll interact with my lamictal and make me insanely dizzy. I’ve tried coloring books, music, nothing really helps. I don’t know what to do. 

I feel hopeless. I’m not going to hurt myself, but I hella don’t feel like existing at the moment lol. 

Any of you have suggestions? Much much appreciation if so."
365,How long should I stop using drugs for if I’m schizophrenic and showing early warning signs of psychosis?,"Diagnosed with schizophrenia and as stupid as it sounds I still use drugs. I smoke weed daily and the last 2 days experimented with MDMA and coke. My sleep has been very poor and I’m noticing some early warnings signs of psychosis.

I know the answer to my question is to quit forever, but I can’t see that as a realistic goal at this point. Can anybody who is actually able to provide advice (unlike counselors) give me a realistic goal to aim for? Then when we get to that point we can try to go further."
366,I feel quilty for my symptoms,"I was abused as a child and got dissociation and ptsd. I also have add.
Today I was reading a reddit thread about why do people regret adopting. I was not adopted and did not behave like the horbbile traumatised adoptees did, but in my head I was thinking about the same things as a child.
I started watching porn when I was 9 and in my teens I wanted to burn my moms house down because of what happened in there. I feel like I’m on the better side of it now, but I feel like I could possibly relapse. I’ve been doing better only for a few months now.
I’ve ruined my relationships by being too clingy. I can’t be friends with females because they intimidate me. I only talk to guys and sometimes I do sexual favours for them. I go to therapy but I don’t want to talk about the sex aspect so much yet. My therapist knows I used to be a sex addict when I was younger because it took my mind away from the bad things. 
I’m really naive and it makes me act like I know better. My whole family is like that so I don’t keep in contact with them and try not to act like that at all.
I don’t get along with people that are my age and I only open up to my lovers or adults that I trust. 
Other things that might be strange to some is that I symphatise with Gypsy Blanchard because I was in a similar situation to her. 
I feel weird in the world where most people are neurotypical and not as traumatised. 
It’s hard for me to imagine to get fixed socially, that I could make friends and stop being so arrogant. I’m really short, 160cm/5’2 and the arrogance does’t fit to me anyway."
367,Just want someone to talk to,"I’m taking Risperidone, Lamictal, and Zoloft currently. Because of the lockdown, it’s been difficult to see my doctor. I’ve done online consultation with her and her Internet was horrible so we were being cut off every 5 minutes. Not to mention, she was very expensive. The session didn’t help. She wanted to see me every day after the session but told her I couldn’t afford her.

Anyway, I just need someone to talk to. I feel myself getting worse by the minute and thoughts have been clouding my mind. I’m too much of a coward to tell people in real life that I might actually want to kill myself. I feel like I need constant distraction or communication to fill my head with different things. I found comfort in drawing and painting but something happened and I can’t get myself to draw again. I feel like I’m going insane. I don’t know how to explain how shitty it feels. It’s so heavy.

Anyway, how are you? Would love to hear about what you’re up to!"
368,I’m not joking,"Every day I talk openly about really struggling with my mental health. I am literally screaming out for help. People just laugh it off. If anything ever happened people would be like “oh she always talked about how hard it is” and no one would be surprised. 

I hate feeling so alone in such a overpopulated world."
369,What's the easiest way I can get myself hospitalized?,"I don't want to kill myself, but I swear to God, if I don't get hospitalized, I will kill myself. I can't go into a mental ward because they don't provide it for foreigners. Just tell me how I can get hospitalized. Please."
370,Adjustment Disorder,I was recently told by a doctor that what I'm going through is most likely adjustment disorder. Has anyone else been through this and wants to share their experience?
371,Can't shake this mindset and need some advice,"Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I've really come to notice lately that when becoming close with someone romantically, I tend to take on this mindset that's like ""why are we doing this, I'm not special, no one's special. There's always other people that give you validation, why do I matter?""
And things of that nature. 

I've always had a few issues with relationships and vulnerability nothing that's ever really been major. But this has been a rather recent development and I can't seem to shake that feeling. It's like I get close to someone and BAM. I'm suddenly depressed and cynical and nihilistic. 


I thought potentially I've some trust issues. Or perhaps issues with allowing myself to be vulnerable. But I've met someone recently who I clicked with like you wouldn't believe, she made note of the fact that we were like the same person, and I find myself letting my guard down more than I've ever been able to, but in that same regard, as much as we click, I don't feel compelled to date her. I'm very confused in general.

Could anyone help gain some insight?"
372,Why is it so hard to be happy,"I haven't had a day as bad as this in a while. I've just been crying all day. I feel weak and sore mentally. My head hurts from being sad. I feel like it builds up for a while, and starts with days feeling pointless and useless and just being low energy. And then I have a massive outburst and just want to sleep and not wake up. This feeling only goes when im asleep and I just want it to stay like that.

im so confused with this life. some days im really happy and so confident and other days it feels like a heavy load of bricks I have to carry just to get out of bed. i hate that me being like this makes my mum sad too. i feel selfish for bringing her down with me.  

people at my school think im one of the happiest people they know. Ive been told this a few times and im always so shocked to hear it because I know how sad my own thoughts are. are all happy people as sad as this inside? I tell myself that sadness is apart of life and when I do have happy moments, those moments are so good because they're rare. I'm 18 years old and it already feels like I've fought so hard. i am so scared of the future when I will have real problems on top of this. Im so scared. I find it really hard to be excited about the future. Sure, I say im excited and sometimes I feel a bit of excitement, but I have just low expectations of myself im worried I will live up to these shitty expectations. 

I have this image of life being filled with only the sad parts. If I get into a relationship, I never live in the moment, I have such little faith in life that I assume it will break before anything even starts. I assume the worst before it happens. 

Sorry, I don't expect any advice here because I don't think that made a lot of sense. It was refreshing to write it out at least. Im kind of scared to think about how I feel too much. Im scared of a diagnosis because then I cant even change this and its not just a phase of my life. and im scared of me being fine aswell because then why am i like this? 

thankyou for reading if you read this far. if youre on this subreddit im assuming youre not exactly okay either, i wish you all the best."
373,i have stopped eating because of my father.,"yesterday at the lunch my father was commenting on the foods i eat. my diet at the time consisted mostly of pasta and some other things which i, personally, wouldnt consider to be too unhealthy since in my country most of the things we eat are home-made.

its important to note that my father was always an asshole. he'd abuse me mentally, verbally and i do recall times where it got physical, although physically it's not as common, so i don't see a point in asking for help. i believe other people need the help i'd get more. 

my best chance as of now, for my grand escape, is to marry an american and get a green card that way. 

my father is also obese, i'd say, although most of the males over 50 are that way here. 

anyhow, i had always had problems with myself and ive gone true many episodes in which i'd go without food or water for a long time. he's aware of that.
i've also done harm to myself, other than not eating, he knows that too.

my body shape makes it so i always look 'skinny-thick'. i have gained weight since this school year began due stress but most of it went to either my butt or my breasts, i wouldnt say i look much different from the time i used to watch out on what im consuming. its just the health and the state that gives a change at times like those.

so he says i should watch what i eat, and of course its triggering so i ask him to stop, and then he starts shitting about stuff unrelated to what we're talking about, he also tells me i'll regret it one day and so on.
he often has episodes like these, so it's no surprise to me.
however, i finish eating and go to my room.

now i sleep with my corset and i haven't eaten in about 18 hours.

the corset is one of those stretchy ones, they cant change the shape of your waist but it helps me sweat more and it restricts me from eating and breathing.

i hope i'll do better this time and actually die from it."
374,How did you get a job?,"I'm 20, have Asperger's syndrome, anxiety and depression. Where I live, at the end of your mandatory education there's an exam, written and oral. I always hated oral exams and answering questions that way, I've always preferred to just write them down. But last year, I had to have this bug exam. And literally i thought I would die. I was the best at English out of everyone in my class, and I did the worst at oral English. Then we had the other oral exam, I didn't know how to answer any question and I sweated like never before in my life (my hands were so sweaty, that my pen kept slipping out of them). I passed, but I still think it was only because they pitied me. I know I should get a job, but the interview part is too much for me to handle. I get a panic attack and start to cry just thinking about it. I wanted to start my own business, handmade candles and soaps, but I feel so unmotivated and worthless that I don't know it makes any sense. I just wish I could skip the next decade of my life to being a happy stay-at-home mom with my now boyfriend being my husband. I just don't know what to do with my life, I feel like being a parent will be the only thing that I'm ever good at it that makes sense"
375,I have finally hit it!!!,"The last two days something changed within me. I feel joy, I feel capable, I feel inspired, I feel a thirst for life. I cried with appreciation that I have my life back! I'm feeding myself and have a good start to the day, I opened up my study books and wasn't overwhelmed, I have my confidence again. There's no irrational anxiety, low mood or internal. 
-
I've worked hard my whole life to have good mental health after a terrible childhood. I even went to the Amazon jungle and drank psychedelic tea with an old magical witch!
-
Maybe this has come about from deciding to move away from people that aren't on my team and don't value me. I've got sessions booked in with psych I found. I've been taking medication. I was always adverse to meds after my teens on anti depressants but I feel this may be the chemical imbalance they speak of! I feel a subtle energy like the euphoria on mdma. And strangely tiktok has been supportive, seeing into others lives I see my problems and strengths reflected in them

376,Losing touch of reality.,"I've been smoking a lot of weed lately, now even if I'm sober I feel kinda ""high"", like a little bit like I don't know if I'm in a dream or not, kinda loosing touch of reality a little and being a little tired during the day. Also dreams have gotten really intense when I sleep high, it aren't necessarily nightmares but certainly not very pleasant dreams, I always feel stress in those dreams."
377,I need som serious help. I am 15 and I am losing my mind,I have had multiple panic attacks in my life and I think I am having one again. Girl was constantly harassing me and I can’t get my mind off of it. Besides that I have adhd and that’s it. I am shaking and haven’t slept in almost 2 days. Please I need help
378,A new beginning,"I feel like singing
‘Cause I got a new beginning
I got myself a new flat
Where I don’t need to keep a bat
A long time, I’ve been clean
Now I’m not nearly as mean
My feelings are good
I’m hardly ever in a mood
Fresh, calm and glad
It’s really not that bad
Not swamped in wealth
But on a sure way to health
Contempt with my past and the outcome
But I know who I can become
I was on a highway to hell
Changed lanes, now I’m on my way to well
I finally got a new chance
Until the end, I will dance"
379,Deep insecurity ruining my self esteem,"So I'm 20F and I'm asian. I'm badly insecure of the way I look. I mean I actually love my body shape but the skin is fueling my insecurities. I have acne and my skin is very oily. It's also pigmented. My whole body has all ranges of skin colors. My mom is very very attractive. One of the most attractive women I know. Tall fair petite. My father is also very handsome though he has higher melanin. Me,on the other hand turned out to be a dark baby. Much darker than anyone in my family has expected. I didn't really care about it while I was younger but now that I'm grown it has messed my mental health. Even my brother has clearer better skin. On some days my skin looks clear and I'm feeling like baddest b ever. Days like these are once in a blue moon. Since the quarantine the insecurity has only worsened. I look at the mirror more than I regularly would and it just kills my whole vibe. My family wonders why I am so rude. They don't know this anger is insecurity and pain in disguise. Whenever I meet my parent's relatives, I can see in their eyes how they're kinda disapprove with how I turned out. I'm asian so being dark is a no no. No matter how hard I try to live my skin, it just doesn't work. All my friends are beautiful. Further,my boyfriend is extremely good looking. He can literally get any girl he wants and it kinda hurts me how people would think we're a mismatch. I often worry about how his family would react when they'll see me. I am constantly anxious that they will never genuinely accept me. I am a student and my parents are already spending huge amounts of money on me and I don't want to waste their money on expensive skincare items. I feel like I'm getting uglier and uglier day by day and it's killing me. Any suggestions on how may I deal with all this :("
380,Do store clerks talk about customers?,"I’m a regular at one of the supermarkets in my hometown. I can get very overwhelmed when shopping, old social anxiety issues come back to haunt me.

I tend to become awkard and clumsy as a result, but try not to think about.

I sometimes joke to my friends that the store clerks think I’m mentally challenged. I honestly wonder sometimes, they’re mostly nice to me but It feels like they’re pitying me.

I feel as if I’ve become an internal joke, sometimes they look at me and begin talking to each other and laughing. 

Probably overthinking it, but It’s a small town and they recognize me by this point"
381,Charity recommendations,"Hi, 

I hope this is the right place to ask this. I am really eager to make a donation to a mental health charity. I’m looking for a charity that is preferably in Florida or Colorado and works primarily with teenage girls / young women and focuses on early intervention, suicide prevention and long term recovery. 

Does anybody have any recommendations?"
382,[Update] Looks like I'm homeless now...,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/g6z9ih/looks_like_im_homeless_now)

Honestly idk why I'm bothering to update this post; nobody asked me to and I doubt anyone will even read it. Maybe putting my story into words will help me process what's happening and give me a point of reference as I move forward into the unknown.

What a week. I spent the first few days back home visiting select friends and family (yes proper social distancing and precautions) and exploring/discussing options for housing. 

I went and visited ""the island"" and spent a couple days drinking, doing coke and working my ass off cleaning out one of the old cabins and making some improvements. It was fun and took my mind off of life for a bit, but it didnt take long for me to realize that the lifestyle there was simply unsustainable for me. The easy access to booze and drugs with zero accountability make for a really tempting but really awful combination. On my last day there I ran out of my meds and knew I needed to get outta there before I started to slide. 

I ended up back at my mom's place. I think that was on monday, and I spend the next four days curled up in a sleeping bag on a bed in a room in my moms workshop. I am nothing without my adderall, I'm a shell of a person. All it took to put me there was my mom asking if I could tackle a certain project for her. I'm not sure how to explain it but something about the realization that I *couldn't* do the thing she asked when I was in the state I was in made everything crash in and around me overwhelming me and sending me into a deep depression. 

Yesterday I finally was able to talk to my doctor and she made some adjustments to my meds, she actually increased my script for adderall so I wouldn't run out early. I'm gonna try SO HARD to only take it how I'm supposed to. I can't keep doing this fucking insane rollercoaster. 

She is also hooking me up with a case manager through mental health and addiction services and says she can get me into a group home for temporary housing so that's an option I guess. 

I filled my prescription and within 30 minutes of taking my addy I was back to normal. No, *better* than normal - I felt great!

I had a couple phone calls to make.

First, I talked to my now ex-gf. The conversation was more of a monologue (thanks addy) but she agreed with every point. All the things I had been agonizing over in my mind and crying myself to sleep thinking about were now crystal clear, concise and organized in my mind. They made their way out of my mouth in an easy, empathetic and logical manner and I found myself setting her free from the bonds of my mental illness. 

That's a really poetic way of saying we agreed to break up so she wouldn't have to put up with my shit anymore. I wasn't bringing anything to the table and I could feel myself becoming more of a burden and less stable the longer I was there. 

Bipolar fucking sucks for everyone. 

Next conversation was with my mom. Her and I have never been able to communicate well about these kinds of things, but I needed to address the fact that I just completely and utterly shut down and isolated myself for 4 days in her shop because she asked me to do a thing. 

It went really well. 

Again I was able to just clearly and easily explain why I had reacted the way I did, what was going on with my meds and my situation in general. She admitted she has no idea what to do with me or how to handle the situation when I'm not well. 

We discussed it. 

I asked if I could stay for another week while I got my living situation figured out, but clearly living there with her isnt an option either. I'm simply too unstable right now and it isnt fair to her to put her through my shit either. 

So with my options for living dwindling I find myself having to choose between living in my car (which *reeks* like gasoline now due to a spilled Jerry can in the trunk), or living in a group home. 

I've never lived in a group home before. 

My doctor says its staffed 247 and they provide a meal or two per day. That's literally all I know about it. I'm not worried about the other tenants at all, I'm worried about the restrictions. I highly value my freedom, but living in a stinky car in the midst of a pandemic might not be the wisest choice for now. 

Now for some good news.

I got the call yesterday from my disability case manager letting me know that my claim is all but approved. There's one more hurdle to go - my application, recommended for approval by my CM, is reviewed by a board for accountability purposes. Should get the final word early next week. I havent had an income (been off work due to my mental health) since before christmas so this is big... I fucking made it through the 4 month elimination period. Used up all my EI, my savings (RRSPS), gave up my house and filed for bankruptcy, but I fucking MADE IT. Now that I am assured a steady reliable income for the next two years I can actually start to focus on my recovery! 

It feels good to end this on somewhat of a positive note.

So now here I sit at the water's edge watching the sun rise over all the possibilities that are spread out before me. 

I guess I have some decisions to make."
383,How can a person make things better for a person with depression?,"Need your advice.

A special person to me that I met online goes through depression and doesnt have much support. From your experience, what are the best things to tell them or do to cheer them up?

I know I cant solve anything I just want to show my support better."
384,I'm having this weird feeling. Can anyone help me?,"Hello everyone,
I don't know where else to ask for help, so I'll try getting hints or ideas here. I have been feeling really weird since january. There are episodes where this weird feeling is more intense, and there are other times when I feel nearly normal. But the 'less intense version' of the feeling is present more or less most of the time.
When I get the 'intense version' of this feeling, I kinda get a bit dizzy, feel really weird and shitty and can't read or talk or understand anyone or anything, no matter how hard I try, for a few minutes. It's so hard to describe this feeling, but I've got the suspicion that it's a feeling I knew since childhood, something my mind digs up from the deepest depths. It differs a bit from time to time.

I knew this feeling beforehand, I had it maybe one, two or three times a year since I was a kid and only the 'intense' version - now it's been with me since january which is really unusual. I also didn't know the 'less intense' version. 
Another thing: I've been smoking weed a few times since last year in october. Now I'm assuming this triggered the feeling and everything else related to it. I stopped smoking weed in february and won’t do it again. Will this feeling go away after a few months? What is it called? I tried researching it but didn't find anything helpful. I'll probably go and visit a doctor soon but I'm kinda helpless right now and want to talk to people who experienced something similar.

Thank you so much for your help and I apologize for any mistakes."
385,"I have been ""fighting"" to stay alive for a long time","Hoarding reasons to live and gripping anything that makes the pain, anxiety, flashbacks etc ease off for a while. There have been so many times where I should have died, and so many opportunities to run away or end it while I had no fear.

Things only get worse for me, becoming desensitized to something, does not mean it has gotten any better. Don't fall for that shit. I needed serious therapy over ten years ago, in that time there has only been more traumatizing situations. 

I know I am not special or deserving of anything in life, but telling me to keep living it and then forcing me lies with a side of manipulation. Just feels gross as fuck.

I'd rather die than live like a zombie, or in complete terror. It is all too complex and I am fucking sorry"
386,Is turning anger into humor actually a good thing?,"I recently read about the proper way of channeling anger, i.e. actually letting it out and not making it personal by using 'I' instead of 'you' ('I feel like you're disrespecting me', 'I don't like being treated this way').

But what about turning it into humor, maybe by seeing the silver linings, the good, not in a meme style but when something makes you angry, you sit back and have a less emòtionally charged conversation with the person who angered you.

Is this actually a better alternative? Or is it just as bad as repressing it and turning your anger inward? Has anyone ever tried it?

Thanks!"

388,Is this what low self-esteem is like?,"I'll try to keep it short. I feel like my self-esteem has had a downfall recently, like, rock bottom. I suspect that everything I'm feeling is due to that but I can't help but wonder if I'm just going crazy, so I need some reassurance.

In the past year I gained quite some weight, my relationship has been rocky and I've had quite some issues at work. I started feeling worthless and unlovable and my self-esteem is the worst it's ever been.

The thing that bothers me is that I've been kind of having problems with connecting to the people I love and who were always good to me.

One example is my mother... she's so loving, supportive... my best friend. And she never held a grudge to me even when she maybe should have. I've been a problematic teen.. not extremely, but enough for it to weigh on me... but she never took it as something to make me feel bad about.

Lately I've been even feeling like she doesn't love me, like she's suddenly hating me for all my mistakes, like she thinks that I didn't grow up and started being a responsible person. I've started nitpicking some things she says and feeling like she's 'indirectly' trying to question me because she thinks I'm still misbehaving or that I'm bad, worthless...  
My rational mind knows there's no truth to this.  


My rational mind knows that she's worried because she sees that I'm not doing my best and she thinks I deserve to feel lovable.  


But these self-hating thoughts keep coming up  
I feel like it all comes back to me feeling worthless right now and trying to find a way to 'validate' that other people think so as well"
389,Can I avoid having certain dreams,"My girlfriend who has been my longest relationship left me recently after an on and off rocky relationship and my obvious attachment to her. I try my best to stay strong and I feel like I'm doing alright but when I sleep at night I dream about her, she says we didnt break up, that were together, and in my dream it feels like a relief but when I wake up it turns my mood that I've been working hard to keep up upside down. I'm not really sure what to do I just want to be able to forget any unnecessary attachments because I know I can do better things if I dont let this affect me."
390,Help with an issue,"I cried a lot today. I have anger issues especially when people in my family fight, i just get super angry trying to convince them to stop fighting. Im considered a calm person amongst the people that know me, but ever since my father passed away my mother or sister or grandparents fight a lot(almost everyday or two days). Do i have PTSD? Because i get super angry when no one understand when im trying to calm them down. Help would be great."
391,I wish I took better care of myself,"Hi there. So, I’m 18 years old, and depressed. Not because of loneliness and etc but because I cannot live my life as I would like to. My state of physical health has destroyed me. My resting heart rate is at around 96. My blood pressure is always high. I have shortness of breath even while doing everyday activities. I can barely talk somedays because of how exhausting talking can be for me. I don’t have energy anymore for anyone or anything. And it sucks. My family thinks I’m exaggerating everything which I’m not, I legitimately can’t even do the one thing in my life that I love which is bodybuilding. This last year has all been brain fog, and physical and emotional pain to me, which considering Im a senior is a big deal. I’ve had enough, and I’m not sure if I‘ll be able to handle waiting until after lockdown ends to solve my issues, because this is too much for me. This is the worst I’ve felt in my entire life."
392,just an unimportant rant,"quarantine has really reminded me that no one cares about me. I dont think I've ever had a 'true friend', in a strange sense. as in, all I ever talk to them about is academics and mindless gossip. we have never brushed past shallow conversations like these, we hardly meet up or talk outside of school, and I've known some of them for almost 8 years. I'm so fucking tired of being the friend with a perfect family, perfect grades, perfect everything. 

stop asking me about my fucking grades every chance you get. do you know how I sob and slice my arms everytime their below my expectations? and for fucks sake stop telling me that you admire how skinny I am. I starved myself just so I could maintain that perfect skinny body all if you love so much. i carved words into myself whenever I gained weight. stop giving me empty words just to make me feel better. I know I dont jump like I used to. i dont even get why my school accepted me for track. theres so much pressure and I cut myself every time I dont reach a good distance.

if I actually fail my exams this time, would I feel worse or better since I wont be so perfect anymore? no one will miss me if I'm gone, but how much money will I have wasted if I just decided to end my life? this thought has been with me since i was 8, after I read about the costs if living in my country. I'd waste all the money spent on tuition, music, sports, enrichment etc. what a waste for someone that wont grow up.

anyway, it's time for me to get out from the bathroom and study some more, then I'll practise my violin, and exercise. thank you to anyone who actually read this. I really appreciate it and i just needed to get this off my chest."
393,"I hate hugging and being touched, especially from the people I’m closest to. To the point I feel sick.","I’m not sure if this was the right place to post but I (17f) need some help figuring this out, or maybe I just need to express it. 
(Sorry for the layout, I’m on a phone. Also my first post!)

I’ve hated hugging for as long as I can remember, I can’t remember my childhood very clearly but I don’t think I hugged my parents very often - I wasn’t neglected or anything, they’re just not very physical people. I do remember that every time my brothers and I fought - psychically or verbally, my mum would tell us to hug to make up. I’m not sure if because of this, hugging has underlying negative connotations for me? While not at its worst now, hugging makes me extremely uncomfortable to the point I feel sick. When people touch me, even just lightly on the arm, I often feel it for the rest of the day and it makes me feel really uncomfortable and sick as well. 

The strangest part of it to me is that the closer I am to someone, the more uncomfortable I am with touching them. A lot of my friends/ people close to me make a big deal out of or make fun of me for hating hugs which makes me feel guilty and that I’m not normal. While everyone in my family gets on really well, we never hug each other - not even my parents. I can remember the last 2 times I hugged my mother - one was last year, and the other probably 3-4 years ago. I don’t remember the last time I hugged my brothers or father, but the closest I got to it was consoling my older brother as he was extremely upset (and drunk) last year. 

The thought of hugging my family makes me feel sick, as well as the thought of hugging most other people. I avoid situations where I am expected to hug people as much as I can and I previously couldn’t stop myself from telling people I hate hugging if they tried, or while they hugged me despite how uncomfortable it made the situation. 

Basically, the things that confuse me the most are the fact that when people touch me I can feel it for hours afterwards, which makes me feel sick, and that I’m more comfortable hugging people I barely know than people I love. There are also certain people who I can’t stand being touched by, and physically flinch away from - this upsets them a lot which makes me feel terrible. 

I know this didn’t stem from something serious like abuse, but I don’t think it’s normal. Again I have a pretty good relationship with my parents and I’m really close with my brothers- especially my older brother. While I used to have pretty bad social anxiety, l’ve always had really strong friendships and I’m now really social and make friends easily and I have lots of really close friends. I also don’t have much of a problem with intimacy. 

I have a fear of people touching/squeezing my sides which puts me on edge pretty often and I’ll get uncontrollably angry and upset if someone does it. It also makes my back hurt heaps. I’m not sure how much this relates to hating hugging though. 

If anyone has any suggestions as to what this could be or can relate, please let me know!!"
394,How content creators approach Mental Health,"If this post is not suitable for this place I will remove it.

—Tw—: Suicide, Anxiety, Depression

Hello good friends and the like.  I hope you’re doing fine, but I’d like to cut to the chase.

What do y’all cats think about content creators and their approach to mental health?

[I believe context will be important here. These people are playing horror maps, with intent to find a map that is truly scary. Their play style is very giggly and non serious at all]
I was watching a YTer on my recommended who was playing some MC maps; one of that had a blatant disclaimer about the map containing themes such as suicide and depression.  
Upon wandering into these situations where the theme is most climactic, the commentators simply kept to their aloof selves and just kinda slid away from talking about the issues in general.

(TW) &gt; the one only big examples of this is they came across a “noose” and a sign next to it saying “do it :)”
Which I assume is alluding to a voice in one’s mind as they experience it.  They simply brushed it off and said “hey guys look it’s just a switch!” Followed shortly after with one of the commentators just jumping in and saying “ALLEEE OOOP”

(TW) &gt; after that they were in a (for lack of better words) small room, where a “voice” spoke, “you’re nothing. You dont matter” and other things like that.
One commentator just said, “dude this is like the edgy stuff my little sister writes in her diary.”

This whole experience really stood out to me, because now-a-days most creators are careful about these issues and make sure there is a clear message on how they view the current conflict(s). The creators I spoke of did not do so in any way, shape, or form.

Yes, I understand that some people just have a style of things, 
And yes, maybe its because it’s been pounded into my head that people give some sort of small serious talk about these things before and after they finish the supposed action,
But it really struck me off with how they approached it.  Sure its not their style at all, they have no need to touch upon it, but I’m just awestricken.  Maybe it’s because I’m huge into the mental illnesses stuff, and if thats so, i can find a way out of it.

I simply want to hear all of your opinions.  What do you think about content creators who cover things that allude (either directly or indirectly) to mental illnesses/health?  Should they have some sort of message on what they think about it?  Any other thoughts? 

Sorry for long post; Whoever you are, I love you and care about you.  You’re doing amazing and your progress is noticeable.  Have an awesome night! &lt;3"

396,Effects of being married to a narcissist,"Hello, I was married to a narcissist for 6 years. I never knew the effects of it but I went from being a confident man to being someone that’s not confident, has low self-esteem, always wants to please people, is chronically feeling lonely. 

I’m in a new relationship now and she’s wonderful but I find myself feeling the effects of my old marriage. I have noticed that sometimes I’m even needy and I don’t think I was like that before my marriage. 

I understand that having been married to someone so emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive has had terrible effects on me.

What can I do to recover from that so that I can lead a happy life that’s free from fear of abandonment?"

I saw it as a sign that I should stop pretending that I’m sad or depressed or something, I got the face for it, but not the reason.

Rn I have no reason to be depressed, so I should stop pretending. But I think the problem is that I don’t feel happy either. I’m not sure.

All I know is that I’m wasting time acting and pretending I’m depressed, I got no time for that."
398,my depression and trauma treating COVID patients is making me suicidal,"CW depression, suicidal ideation, COVID

im a doctor working in NYC right now. I'm not in the ICU or the ER but I am seeing COVID patients daily. Last year when I was depressed and suicidal, on meds, in therapy. In intern year I saw some terrible stuff that gave me PTSD.  I  recently started to feel like I was getting better, healing, feeling supported and then this hit. 

In March I restarted medications anticipating I'd struggle with what is happening, and upped the frequency of therapy. I am not quite back to the level of depression I'd previously had, and my schedule at work is much more humane than it was at my last training location but I am still really suffering. I feel moral injury over the fact that so many people in power are just OK with me dying if it means the economy recovers - and there is no real expectation for support other than bullshit jet flyovers, cheering and pizza parties. I hate it when people call me a ""hero"" - I feel very small, insignificant, and pathetic right now. Even more I hate the people protesting lockdown, clamoring for ""natural immunity"" to take it s course and our politicians urging reopening while we still are this under-resourced. And I feel hopeless about things being okay again. I am already planning to take leave from work over the summer.  I dont feel like I can yet. I don't know. I worry I may not be able to actually practice medicine at all after this, and having spent so many years of my life and so much money trying to pursue it. 

Ive started to think about how I wish I'd actually killed myself last year, so I wouldn't have to suffer through this. Im not sure that Ive had enough good in the last 2 years to outweigh the bad and I am adding to my trauma and now having body pain that I am afraid will become chronic pain like I see in many of my patients. last night, I started trying to calculate if I had enough of certain medications in my home to kill myself.  I took some pills to just help me sleep and then went to bed, and I dont want to kill myself right now but.. it's so hard. 

I just need to say this somewhere so I dont lose my shit. Im too scared to tell my therapist about it yet or my husband or my other close friends because it's scaring me. I know I need to.

400,Unlocking the Subconscious Mind,"Most people are self-limiting. We can do way more than we believe. Even worse, most of us underrate ourselves, and sell ourselves short. The result is that most of us suffer from feelings of inferiority.

I was one of them. Suffering from axiety, depression, and a general sense of misery.

In the past four months, I studied the subconsious mind. Not only theoretically, but putting what I learned into practice.

I learned that 95% of our behavior, feeling, and response is habitual and automatic. These automatic habits are not set in stone. They can be changed.

While I believe that I have only scrached the surface, here are some of my results:

* I feel better than ever
* I feel young, full of energy
* I look forward to the future, “the best is yet to come”
* I am calmer and more relaxed
* I sleep better
* I feel “one” with the Universe, I am “in flow”

Here is the summary of what I have learned, including my ""personal workbook"" of exercises and habits: [https://remo.org/2020/04/30/subconscious-mind/](https://remo.org/2020/04/30/subconscious-mind/)

Most of what I learned is based on the book ""Psycho-Cybernetics"" by Dr. Maxwell Maltz.

401,My sister tested positive for Covid-19,[deleted]
402,My sister tested positive for Covid-19 and I'm so worried,"My sister and brother-in-law are both nurses, and my sister just tested positive for Covid. Her symptoms have been mainly a fever, a headache, and 'feeling like she was hit by a truck.' I'm obviously incredibly worried for my sister and brother-in-law, both of whom I love, but I'm so scared for my 2 year old niece. I just keep thinking of the worst happening and my niece having to grow up without her mother, who she just absolutely adores. I know the numbers are on the side of my sister making a full recovery, but I just can't help but think of the worst possible outcome.

Luckily, my sister knew she was exposed when it happened, and my niece has been staying with my parents since, so she hasn't been exposed.

The uncertainty and the fact that we just have to 'wait and see' is killing me. I'm horrible at coping with things out of my control. There is nothing I can do to take my mind off it, and I can't stop catastrophizing.

I just needed to vent."
403,Loss of passion in my day-to-day,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice. I will do my best to put everything in a concise readable page but bear with me, it covers a lot lol. I may crosspost to r/selfimprovement as this post rubs up on both subs but I am curious what the different groups would say.

While not going in extreme long winded detail, I find myself struggling with a few different aspects of my life. I struggle with making new connections with both friends or meeting potential dates. My self confidence is extremely low when it comes to this. This contrasts with my work. I work in the hotel industry as a manager. As a good manager (i think lol), you meet and engage with all kinds of people, guests and employees, so when it comes to whats needed I feel ok speaking and networking on a 'work' basis, even presentations.

But when I am not at work, all my confidence goes out the window, I do not feel comfortable at all trying to meet different people. This actively prohibits me from doing the things I want to do (in this case meet new friends and dates). I should note I just moved to a new city, no family or established friends here.

Im going to pause here and move to a different point and bring it back together....

Another area I am concerned about is my career trajectory. In general I think the hotel biz offers a lot of opportunity to move up into corporate or anywhere. Even bring your experience out of the biz with the business, sales, maintenance experience, etc you get into something else. When I started about 7 years ago, it was a front desk agent, but quickly went to supervisor and Assistant GM in about 18 months. But since then I have been in the same position (across different properties and some pay raise but same position itself) ...

Now going back to the first point, something I realized about why I am so hesitant and shy to meet new people is I feel like I don't have much to offer.

When people become good friends or dating partners, its usually because each person gets something out of it right? I don't mean selfishly, but beneficially. You could be friends with someone because you guys do the same fun stuff together or work out buddies or theyre nice to talk to, etc. You date someone because they make you laugh, theyre attractive, they do volunteer work, etc. It could be any reason but you get the idea.

I don't try engaging with people because I really doubt what I bring to the table and worry i do not have a good personality beyond my work. Both guys and girls, I am sure you can think of someone, who you thought was boring  or 1 dimensional.  I thought about some of things that you all may suggest. I tried getting into some new hobbies but didn't stick with them because I wasn't enjoying it. I can try again and maybe it will stick but I am not optimistic.

In my career, the natural next step would be general manager (or a few different pathways), but I have been hesitant to move up. One reason being I am not sure if I am responsible or ready to do it even though I have been told I am very qualified. Second reason being I am not sure that I *want* to.

After some thoughts, I think I THINK I came to a conclusion to why I struggle with both of these items. With socializing and why I can't stick with trying new things AND my career and why I am hesitant to move into another spot.

I think it is because in all honesty **I am not passionate about anything**. And when I use the word passionate, I mean more as a concept, not necessarily as say like a hobby although that is true too. But you get what I mean. And correct me if I should use a different word here. But back to my point. On paper I think I am doing ok but I feel like I am living as a robot. In my early 30s, I have a nice apartment, new furniture. I have a new car, I have a job that pays decent. No kids. Not saying this to gloat or something but to make my point. I think I am doing everything I am 'supposed' to be doing but I am definitely not getting any joy out of my day to day life. I wake up, get ready for work, drive, work, will say this the best part of my day (not extraordinarily but more because there is no other peak in my day) as I get out of the house and get to socialize with my coworkers and guests, go home, hangout at the house, go to sleep, and repeat. &lt;---That seriously is my day everyday besides maybe a grocery run or something.

Back to an earlier point I made: some people say get hobbies for example. That's great idea seriously, but I have never been able to stick with anything new or had a willingness to try. Again because I am not **passionate** enough to try. In this case passionate to be outgoing (not necessarily passionate about the hobby itself) and I don't think that is healthy. I keep using that word because I think most healthy people are passionate about *something.* Could be sports, working out, science, charity, whatever. So that even if they don't like a single hobby, they'll replace it with something else. That hasn't happened with me.

The same with my work, I feel like I have lost a passion in my work. I still do it, it pays the bills and the people are nice. I know some will argue that this happens to a lot of people and thats true, except I can not think of anything I would be passionate about to switch careers and pursue.

Concisely, I find myself not excited about 'anything'. Sounds pretty overdramatic but in a day to day sense, thats a true statement. I am wondering about the thoughts of strangers and what advice, if any, you may have.

407,Cognitive Impairment in Depression,"Hello everyone,

Im   writing out of curiosity and to get some clarification, I would like  to  ask some of you who have recovered from depression, about cognitive   impairement, I am a 20 year old male currently going through an anti   depressant therapy for the first time in my life , I believe I am in   depression since i was 17 since I moved out my parents house at 16 and   had to study / work and I initially only could afford to pay rent and   would have nothing to spend on myself and have any fun at all, my whole   existance was just paying for my existance and not doing anything but   that , now its different but the depression is still here, I did have   periods of recovery but they were short and I would go into remission   within a week.

for the first year   of my depression I wasn't affected all that much and didnt have any   major cognitive impairement but for the last 2 years , I feel like I have   dementia , I was an A\* grade mathematics and physics student and   enjoyed anything to do with maths, however now I can barley process   anything and I have extremely slow thinking to the point where I find it   difficult to comprehend with speech in movies and therefore even when I   try to find joy in something I get knocked of it because my thinking  is  just so slow, therefore I cant watch a movie without switching it  off  in 5 minutes and going into a state of doing nothing and just  feeling  hopeless. I have friends But I dont see them all that much  anymore due  to the covid-19 situation, and to be honest I wasnt seeing  them all that  much before it either for the year before it but before  was really  social went out to parties, did drugs. Not in a relationship  for 2 years  now broke up a year into my depression. I pretty much have  no one at  this point in time.

I  would like  to know preferably from someone who recovered , did the  cognitive  impairement go away or is it a life long burden, logically i  would like  to think that if there is no depression there should be no  symptoms of  cognitive impairement. however even when I felt better for  some periods  of time , I still saw no major change and improvement in  my cognition.  Will this ever end and will I ever be sharp as  I once  was , I would  like to hear honest answers and not just some dilusive  help of giving  hope. thanks everyone I would really appriciate this.

I dont miss at all the social interaction, like, at all. I dont miss going to parties or seeing my friends at uni, Im even becoming used to not seeing my boyfriend. The thing is, coning back to normal gives me extreme anguish. The thought of having my normal life back makes me want to cry. Right before quarantine I was thinking I might have been depressed (I met some diagnostic symptoms). Could I have a social issue? Could I be genuinely depressed and all this is just covering it up?"

411,Job Searching and Police Recruiting vent,"TLDR: back in Jan I applied for a big metropolitan police department in Canada, how they respond to me, or the lack there of, combining with this current pandemic situation, is igniting my old anger and anxiety problems.

My passion is to help people, I have made this my life goal, my career goal, and it is what truly makes me happy and get me through bad times. 

Thats why after graduated from the best engineer school in the country, I joined the army as an engineer officer instead of choosing the corporate world. I truly enjoyed being an junior rank leader, where I get to mentor a lot of younger kids and did a lot of domestic deployment like flood and fire mitigation etc.

I also volunteer at red cross, distress call centre, hospital, and help my friend run a weekly soup kitchen.

I don't think I am the best candidate out there but at least I deserve to get an email reply. Since filing my application in Jan 2020, I have yet to receive anything from the recruiting department. Even my email enquiries regarding general recruiting questions, written politely, only resulted ""we will contact you if we are interested"" replies.

I get it, it's a job application, they have every right to reject me and I was mentally prepared for it.

What is setting me off is that how well I know them, how bureaucratic and superficial they are.

A year ago, one of my new privates had operation stress syndrome during an exercise, he later decided to quit, absolutely believe that he is not good enough for the job. I couldn't convince him alone so I send a memo to my chain of command asking for some help. Two month there is nothing back, mean while the CoC is sending out mental health materials, feel good posters and even a little green ""soldier's card"" to put inside your wallet.

And I think police is just the same as my CoC, all talk but no shit getting done.

For the past five month, the recruiting department is doing women-in-police seminars, new badges for mental health, zoom Q&amp;A. Their chief is on the news saying things about need for more recruitment etc, yet can't even bother to reply an email.

This morning they posted a new ""future of policing, join us"" poster on their twitter, which makes me want to scream at them.

I genuinely to want to be a peace officer, helping people in their time of needs, but knowing how bureaucratic and useless those institutions are is casting double on my career choices and my life goals, I fell anxious and anger.

This is my vent."
412,I needed to vent anonymously online because I can't get it out verbally.,"I often find myself (M19) with a loss of passion for life, I can't maintain relationships in any form, not even with my parents or other loved ones. I live in my own apartment so I can retract from society because being around other human beings tires me to the point of physical exhaustion, however being alone has a really taken a toll on my mental as well as my physical wellbeing. I eat once every 1-2 days, my hallucinations and schizophrenic episodes are manifesting again and my depression is getting worse by the day. 

The biggest struggle right now is being able to perform for college as I have exams coming up and as I'm an Installation Arts student, I actually have to physically produce work such as drawings, conceptual artworks, sculptures etc.. I don't want to lose study points as we call them here so I can continue my studies to actually achieve some worth in life. 

Also the medicine mixture I'm on consisting of anti-depressants, ritalin, sleep medication etc.. rids me of any feeling of being alive, I go through me day surviving, breathing but not really feeling alive I'm just ""here"". It has created a deep emptiness within, to the point where I can't make myself cry to out any bottled up feelings I've had since I was a child.

I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts a lot again and I'm scared I might give in to them again because I really don't want to put my mom through the emotional destruction of having to bury your child as she's had a hard life.

My exams start on monday and I don't know how I'm gonna get through them, there's so much to take in all the while I can't find the energy to get out of bed or concentrate for 5 seconds."

415,Covid-19 Causing Me To Miss A Dose,"I missed yesterday's dose and I'll be missing today's because the person bringing my medication to me couldn't get to where I am because of the lockdown. Lexapro is scarce where I live currently in Nigeria,so I had to order from another state. I should be getting them tomorrow.

Hope i'll be okay, I've been on it for four months and they've been really helping me. Hope skipping two days won't have a negative effect."
416,My insecurities are ruining my relationships and in turn my life,"I am a 21 year old female. I have been abused and gone through trauma for much of my life, starting very young when my parents mistreated me and would blame me for their relationship problems. This really fucked me up. In addition to that, my mom became a cat hoarder and would steal my stuff and the house was disgusting. I literally had no where safe to eat or cook because roaches were everywhere. And then I had abusive boyfriends who hurt me and lied to me, so with all of that it was so scary and I couldn't trust anyone. Now I have a good boyfriend, but my insecurities have pushed me to accuse him of crazy things ( I needed to find a reason for my insecurities because it made no sense to have none)... I feel so awful that I've felt bad about myself and taken it out on him. He has made my life so much better but is now considering leaving me over this. I am desperate to change myself and control myself when I get insecure. With COVID-19 going on, I'm unsure of where to get the proper help for my insecurities and lack of self - love. but I really need help like now. Please tell me ways that I can get better/ get help."
417,I'm honestly angry because I have to treat my depression all over again,"First time I had severe depression was back in 2018. I treated myself using medication for about a year and got better. It was one of the worst moments of my life, I was suicidal, felt empty inside and the medication was not easy to deal with.

Now, 2020, it's happening again. Ever since january my mental health had not been at it's best due to some personal problems, but I was kind of dealing with it by going to therapy. However, coronavirus showed up and everything went to absolute shit (it gets even worse because my country is not taking the pandemic serious). I still do therapy online and now things have come to a point where both my therapist and I understood I can't deal with this on my own anymore.

I agreed to start treatment again because I know it's my only option and if I don't take medication I'll get worse and worse. But I am so fucking mad about it. This already happened once, why I do I have to go through this shit again? I'm angry and frustated. I don't want to be depressed again. But I am. I don't want to feel like I'm falling back into the same endless hole it took me so much time to get out of. But I am. I feel tired, exhausted, sad, disappointed, most of the time I just feel empty.

I'm trying to see the bright side here: this time is not as bad as last time. I'm not suicidal and can still get out of bed most days and do stuff. For now. I don't want this to get bad again. I don't want to go back to the worst I've ever been. 

And I'm not even sad about this. I'm just angry."
418,How do I get my parents to take me more seriously?,"Note: I can’t go to a therapist because of COVID, but this is just for the future. Country is USA.

I think a few months ago I realized there was something wrong, and I’m pretty sure I have OCD, I exhibit many of the symptoms to strong levels. But I’ve always had this constant, nagging fear that there’s no problem at all and I’m just doing this for attention. (Probably because of my parents) Because of this, I want to get a diagnosis more valid than a self-diagnosis, and see a therapist to help me get better. But my parents have always adamantly denied that there was ever something wrong with me. They always invalidate my feelings.

 When I was twelve, I wrote a story for a contest about two immortals who wanted to commit suicide, and showed it to my parents so they could give me feedback. But as my mom was driving me home from a piano lesson, she started lecturing me about how I shouldn’t write about those things because they’re adult things, and I have no idea what they’re like. But I do, I just have never been able to tell her because she wouldn’t have taken me seriously. This year it’s worse, I wanted to submit a poetry collection to another contest but I just stopped because i thought to myself that no contest would ever accept something as dark and awful as my poetry and I can’t bear to show it to my parents. It’s about depression and suicide and all my insecurities. I’m still young, and I think that’s why they don’t believe me.

But that was depression, and now there’s something more debilitating and permanent, and I don’t know how to get help. I don’t think I’d be able to ask my parents for a therapist. The conversation would just be awkward. How do I do this?"
419,how to distract myself?,Never been able to concentrate in school and I could just about sit through movies and watch series but now it's pretty much impossible. The only thing I've been doing to distract myself lately is speaking to my friends but even that's hard sometimes and it gets boring. Don't get how people can sit playing one game for hours to kinda 'block out' everything else when I literally just can't stop thinking and always have 0 energy

421,"A very comprehensive article on all aspects of Anxiety, Interesting read..", [https://slog.media/s/FWWPvQH6Vp8bCseykJaSwtMHGRHffyCxJ6v92MjPhCTH](https://slog.media/s/FWWPvQH6Vp8bCseykJaSwtMHGRHffyCxJ6v92MjPhCTH)
422,"Please help, I'm not sure what to do (Advice)","(So the first part of the post got a little long-- I swear I tried to trim it down and give the bare bones of context, but it didn't work the best. The actual advice request starts at 'So. Here I am.')

Okay. 

So a couple months ago [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eym53h/not_exactly_sure_what_to_do_ventadvice/) about a conflict with my DnD group of friends, and well. It's escalated in a way. This is all happening in the same group of 9 friends, just to mke sure. 

So, in mid February, I had a bit of a conflict with one of my friends while playing Minecraft, and in a panic I asked another friend in the group whether or not I should take a break. Both she and my DM agreed that I take a break from the game for a while, and I agreed to take a break from the game until the end of the semester. 

Then, when I went on our group's Minecraft server (we had switched worlds and I wanted to rebuild), my DM suggested I stay away from the server so my presence doesn't make people angry, which, you know, fair. And things carried on as normal. 

Until a couple weeks later, when in a fit of anxiety fueled paranoia, I asked my DM whether or not my friends secretly hated me and this was a convoluted method of getting me out of the group. He didn't reply no, and instead told me that it's probably better if I take a break from the discord and chill out. I didn't want to, but I figured it was better for the group and muted the discord, while still being in it. And I admit, every so often I would peek in, and see what everyone was talking about, and getting hurt that it seemed like no one seemed to miss me. 

Then I fucked up, and got a big letter telling me that \*until further notice\* I wasn't allowed in the Discord because of it. That was three weeks ago. I haven't been in a good place, mental health wise, since (compounded by the quarantine, struggling with schoolwork while at home, my family falling apart, etc etc), and I keep flipping back and forth between ""these people don't care about me and never had and never will, and I'm hurt and I should hurt them back and/or leave the group because they haven't kept me in mind"" and ""I'm a terrible person to have let it get this far, the only person I can blame is myself, and I should never speak in the group again and/or leave the group so I don't run the risk of hurting them ever again"". 

So. Here I am. 

I want to get better, and get back to my friends, and get back to being normal, cuz a lot of this has happened in the last few months. I don't want to keep talking over my friends and hurting them. I don't want to get in trouble again. I want to keep playing and having fun. In my friend's letter, they pointed out how I constantly complained in the discord, interrupted people, and constantly pivoted the attention to myself. And they're right, I'm very self absorbed and a straight up attention whore. But I don't know how to work on any of that, and I don't want to keep going back to the same person I've been talking to about this to ask for advice because they're not my therapist and they don't deserve to be treated like that. 

I've already tried to cut back on complaining about stuff in my other discords, but how do I work on not pivoting a conversation to be about myself all the time??? How do I relate a story I want to share without coming off as dominating the conversation??? How do I work on not interrupting people??? How do I work on being a better team player in general??? How do I fix myself???"
423,Life seems fake. Is this the onset of an episode or delusion? Please help!,"Over the last few months, I have increasingly felt like my life is governed and controlled by some unseen entity/force. Things that should feel arbitrary and random, somehow feel orchestrated or staged. Sometimes too convenient. Like something or someone is very knowingly messing with me.

What brought this feeling on, is the experience of very inexplicable coincidences. Some call them synchroncities. They feel very uncanny and deliberate. I feel like sometimes people just say the right things, like very specific to what I've already been thinking. Which feels odd. I sometimes feel like I don't really get a perspective different to mine, when I reach out to other people.

I don't know how to rid myself of the feeling that something greater than me is out there and is at play in my life. Knowing and calculating my every move. Is this a delusion?"
424,lost all hope TW,"I wanted to get help, i even had my first psychologist appointment set, i was optimistic for a second that it might get better and have a support system. The whole virus and quarantine bullshit ruined it. I dont see a point, i think about suicide everyday. I'd spend last 2 months in bed watching movies i do only what i have to for school and im probably gonna fail math. I get random bursts of energy, my ''''eating disorder'''' is screaming because since its quarantine i have time to lose as much weight as possible and i shouldnt waste food on myself. Im numb at this point, i dont see any reason to stay and i just want to die but i dont have guts to kill myself. Im very pathetic and i truly hate myself.

YES I KNOW THAT MY ENGLISH SUCKS IGNORE IT"
425,Why do setbacks feel so awful when you're recovering,"I'm trying to recover from bulimia on my own and today I binged and purged for the first time in a week. A week of no b/p doesn't sound like a feat but a few weeks ago I was binging and purging daily, even several times every day. I've been doing so, so well these past few weeks and was finally getting hopeful. Now I just feel like it was too good to be true. 


I'd even lost a bit of weight. Of course it all had to break apart. I'm so sure I've gained it all back, I ate so much, worth a whole week's food at least. I'm beyond ashamed of myself for not being able to control my gluttony. And I know at the back of my head I should be proud that I made it even this far but still I feel worse for failing now than when I failed every single day. Because at least now I had something to lose. I'm starting to feel like this will never get better."
426,Is it possible to focus too much on being normal?,"Hi, thanks for reading Im currently trying to figure out my disabilities for a long time. Having a hard time holding jobs feeling scared of everything, and having issues in figuring just me out. Im scared to post this now to have an answer and I hate society, public and anything in general. In the past year I did everything I could to feel normal and I held a job for the longest periods I did without break about a year. Everday I was in turmoil I thought everyone was against me judged me I was told I did good but I didnt feel it. Everyday I was coming home wiped out unable to focus scrolling netflix feeling like watching something is a chore i dont purposely ignore my wife but i cant help my focus. The cost of my constant focus in the past year of work I had no actual memory of being me or happy.. I feel as if my entire drive was only as an employee of my company to feel normal and I suddenly had hours I couldnt handle everyone jealous of me for having them. Everyday I kept saying this is normal this life of work and I cant find the drive to want to do anything even in work lack of energy and I feel like my focus on work is ruining my family relationship and mental health. Im coming home snapping about work and tired Im running to work afraid to come home because of how geared I am. I started trying to avoid certain shifte and people at my work to prevent stress because im constantly distracted and stressed everyday without notice. I cant even remember my day how many times my mind strayed I felt bad betrayed wrong and destroyed. Like Im told what to do thats it and I try to forget so much focus on doing tasks. Im trying to find my answer to give to the doctor but so much keeps coming up I cant remember or focus on how Im feeling. Is this making me feel normal enough because Im accepted in one job out of 10 in my life thus far that I forget everything by avoiding it all? Im afraid of being fired and chasing this because everyone else doesnt understand and says dont let it bother me but I bottled it all up till I had a panic attack during this pandemic feeling for my safety due to my comprimised immune system and colitis and I could not handle how I felt. Is this possible to think so much you need to do this to be normal you forget to actually help yourself and be yourself or think of who you are?"
427,I like it here,"I was stuck in anxiety subreddit for a long time. I wrote a post about how unpractical that subreddit is, how no one wants to better themselves but only superficial ""there,there"" and ""go drink some tea to calm yourself"". One person explained how that is the way that subbredit functions and that kind of people are on that subreddit. I knew about this subreddit so i tried participating. I have to say there's a lot of people here who actually want to better themselves. I feel like i'm leading a discussion and not a superficial chit chat.

I look forward to learning new stuff. Thank you in advance and i love you!"
428,Feel so lost and helpless,"Just going to give it straight , today has probably been one of my worst days on record for my mental health . I just tried to strangle myself with my own bare hands because I'm mentally and emotionally unable to cope with the current situation. I really feel like suicide would be better in the long run with the way things are looking now as if I kill myself I can guarantee that I won't get the virus whereas if I stay alive i'll get coronavirus and die from it. every time someone coughs in this house or leaves to get supplies(food, medicine etc.) I go into panic mode and automatically assume the worst. I don't want to do this anymore, I'm sick of all the thought cycles and uncertainty I just want to die"
429,Happy to help,"I’ve realised today how far I’ve come with my mental health journey. I really have to thank my ex for that. He knew I wasn’t feeling well and pushed me to take care of myself. 
I’ve learned a lot of different kinds of coping mechanisms, but I’m still not ready to go back to school or work. I’m priviledged to be in a situation like this where I can take care of my mental health first. 
I’ve always been talkative and I’m happy I got that back after my depression. I’ll try to use it for good. I don’t get triggered as easily anymore because I found the right meds for me. It’s crazy what a difference it has made. I also cut ties with toxic people and that probably has taken me further in this process. 
I don’t always come across as gentle or understanding as I’d want to because I’m really inpatient. I need to work on that and learn how to express myself to others better, so I can avoid misunderstandings. 
I’m really naive in a negative world and don’t always realise not everyone understands me. But I don’t think I can change myself much. I’ll always be impulsive and a bit selfish and childish. I’m different from the mass but it might be good as long as it doesn’t get like super quirky. We’ll see how lomg I’ll keep feeling like this."
430,struggling with impostor syndrome and fear of it holding me back,"hello all. a little about me - i’ve been wanting to become a nurse since i was 15. Since then I’ve been working my way towards that goal since then. There have been lots of tears and passion going towards that goal.

I have years worth of relevant volunteer/work experience (hospital, suicide hotline voluneer, i work at our school’s nursing faculty).
I’m in my final year of university and these are the grades that they’ll be looking at when I apply for nursing school. I worked really hard and achieved a 3.6 GPA. I don’t think I’m the strongest candidate to apply but I would say I have a chance.

For some reason I just feel like a “fraud”. I feel like due to the pandemic all my classes were online so my finals were easier (?) they were open-book, we had more time to complete them, we had shorter final exams.

I’m trying to tell myself that I deserve these grades because I took all of my midterms pre-quarantine in normal exam conditions and I scored high, so thats why my final grades were higher. My finals were only weighted 5% or 30% and my midterms were weighed higher. I guess I feel like because I didn’t get examined on the full course material in normal settings I feel a bit like a fraud.

I guess the reason why I feel like a fraud is because I’ve always been a little below average in like 60% of my classes. Even if I scored an 81, the class average would be 85. This includes pre-reqs i took for nursing. These have all been me studying to the best of my abilities at that time.

Because of this, I’m questioning my own ability to be able to pass nursing school. One of my worst fears is failing nursing school and wasting thousands of dollars. Sometimes I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can’t achieve the grade I wanted/was expecting. It’s making me consider social work instead and diminishing the passion I had for nursing. I remember crying when I scored low on a respiratory exam earlier this year and I felt so inadequate even though I studied 2 weeks in advance + devoted hours on it. I just don’t want to give up on something I haven’t even tried yet but I’m really struggling with imposter syndrome/self-doubt. 

I’m wondering if anyone else have gone through this and what helped. Thank you"
431,What should I watch in my everyday life in this new period of my life?,"It feels like in every period of my life I watch something different, when I was first getting stability in bipolar I watched a lot of spiritual teachings. When I was abusing drugs, I watched a lot of things on harm reduction. When I got of them I watched a lot of things on getting sober, when I finally got ok with being sober I started watching things about the coronavirus outbreak, but now I'm over it, and I don't have anything to watch.

Just to clarify I'm in a period in my life where I want to find new things, new objectives, and get back to the everyday teethwashing, bill paying reality , if that makes sense. But I need something to keep watching to entertain these thoughts, but I have no idea what, does anybody have any suggestion ?"
432,Lockdown,Is anyone else just feeling their mental health deteriorating during this lockdown? Everyday I look in the mirror and hate what I see in the reflection. Like i just hate how I look and get these thoughts that I’ll be alone for the rest of my life but I don’t know why. I think I’ve just started feeling like this because I’m normally quite busy at school etc. Is anybody else feeling like this and if so how are you dealing with it?
433,I (16F) have been in recovery from anorexia for year and a half now. This is my letter to “Ana”,"“Dear” Ana

You are a disgusting .You started your nonsense when I was only 13. I am 16 now and I am still recovering. You took away my teen years, I barely stepped into high school. I remember chest pains, fainting, feeling pain over my whole body, freezing. I remember how you made me run even though I could barely feel my legs, not able to catch a breath. You didn’t leave me alone. Constantly buzzing in my head. Bullying me.  You brain washed me. Loosing weight was just the start, my body slowly getting smaller. I was slowly fading away. You wanted me to fade away. You wanted me dead. The only positive thing is that you made me stronger. I am the boss of my body and I do not take orders from you. So you better shut up. I am not having any of your nonsense anymore. Get lost. My life is so much better without you. You suck. 

Sincerely,
The girl you tried to kill.


In total I am being treated for 6 mental illnesses. I had 3 suicide attempts and my doctor later told me that she taught that I was not going recover from anorexia.

If you are suffering from a mental illness, seek help. Take it from a girl that has been through all of this. It does get better."
434,First suicidal thought,"Thursday night was my first suicidal thought. Although I feel like I won’t actually kill myself, the reoccurring thought of just not having to be here no more does not leave my mind. I see a therapist but I am not an open person. I don’t like to talk about my feelings, I just don’t know how. I moved out about a year and a half ago 6 hours away from home to SoCal for school. School hasn’t gone well. I have a boyfriend of 3 years who I consider to be my best friend but I don’t think he’ll understand...at my lowest point I have no one to talk to but the internet."
435,Ridiculous block that I've put on myself which is destroying my mental health,[deleted]
436,Awareness and Depersonalization,"Hey guys, 

So recently I think I’ve been experiencing a lot of depersonalization at varying levels. Some days it’s pretty mild, and others it’s more intense. 

My symptoms include feeling like I’m living within or behind my eyes, trouble remembering things or recalling memories vividly, and a general feeling of anxiety due to said symptoms. Almost like life isn’t real or I’m in a dream/simulation. I don’t think I’m going crazy, though it does feel that way sometimes. But my awareness and ability to sum things up as, “just feeling off,” is what helps ground me back to reality. 

I’m not sure what is causing these feelings. I’ve definitely experienced depersonalization in the past—sometimes it’s the environment I’m in, high levels of stress, etc—but this round seems to be messing with me more than other times in the past.

Because of the ongoing pandemic and stress/changes it’s presented to all of our lives, it’s hard to say if these feelings are largely because of that, or because of other factors. 

I’m just seeking some advice from those who have also experienced this kind of depersonalization and how you coped/worked through it? 

My place of employment offers free counseling (I’ve had an established therapist in the past, but a recent move last year has let me without one). 

Any and all advice will be helpful, thanks 😌"

I still will never forgive myself and have to deal with myself for as long as I live whether that's a few hours or years. I love you all"
439,Can I help my friend?,"Yesterday my friend tried to kill himself by swallowing a bunch of pills, this happened twice (he says he has developed resistance to the pills so that’s why nothing happened)

He can’t go to a hospital since he is considered a vulnerable person (physically) and he could catch Coronavirus.

His psychologist and psychiatrist aren’t working, when he calls them they say he has to wait until quarantine is over to speak about anything.

He’s been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, he is dealing with many things but the thing that brings him down even more is he broke up with his GF, she was really abusive, isolated him for years and dump my friend because she thinks he is pretending to be sad to get attention and not give her the time she “deserves”.

As far as I know he is only talking to me about this (according to him and his mom) is there anything I can do? Can I help? How?"
440,“Can’t”,"I am not a writer, and am generally bad at describing things, so bear with me here. 

Does anyone else ever feel a general sense of “can’t?” Even though you know you can physically do the thing, you just can’t bring yourself to do it? 

For example, on my days off I find that I can’t get up. It’s not so much that I’m too tired. I got 8-10 hours of sleep. It’s not so much that I don’t want to. There’s things I wanted to accomplish today. It feels more like “can’t.” 

Yesterday I wanted to take my dogs to a flower field that I know only has a small window where the flowers are in bloom. This weekend was my only chance to photograph them. I wanted to go but I couldn’t. I couldn’t bring myself to get dressed, gather my photography gear, load it up as well as my dogs, drive the whopping 15 minutes to the field, hike the 2 or so miles up the hill, and take my photos. 

I don’t always feel like I can’t, luckily. And sometimes I’m able to overcome the “can’t.” I mean eventually I’m able to force myself out of bed, of course. Some days I can overcame the “can’t” of cooking, or cleaning, or hanging out with a friend. But oftentimes, I can’t overcome the can’t. 

Does anyone else go through this? Have you found a tried and true way to overcome it? Or to stop it from even happening in the first place? I’m tired of the battle. I want my alarm to go off and be ready for the day to start. If I want to do something, I want to be able to do it without having to internally struggle getting myself to just do it."
441,"Okay, so what exactly am I supposed to do since I can’t see my psychologist or psychiatrist during lockdown?",Just lie here in bed and accept there’s nothing I can do?
442,Can't seem to stay happy,"I've really been trying. I've been exercising  every day, I've been talking to my coworkers, I've been joking with my friends even if I have to force myself to do these things, because I know they're good for me.

Still, no matter what I do it ends up making me feel sad and angry, and I end up crying or hurting myself at the end of the day. I don't want to be like this anymore, but even when I really try to do the right things it just doesn't stay."
443,"I daydream too much. It may not be a place for diagnosing, I know... but still, I would like to know your opinions.","Hii. So, here is a thing. I've had this problem with daydreaming since I was a child (around 5 years old). The thing I've been enjoying the most was being alone with music and daydreaming. What is even more 'weird', I even have this extremely strong urge to act out while daydreaming (characters, situations etc.). It's like I'm trying to make the scenario real. Dunno why is it happening but it is interfering my life. (Cannot focus on my work, prefer daydreaming to socialising and such). If someone has the same problem or knows what is it about I would like you to comment. Thank you.

*I apologise for some grammar mistakes. English is not my mother tongue."
444,I can’t help but feel that maybe if I starve myself maybe they’ll see that I’m not “over exaggerating” I don’t know why my mother doesn’t understand she has mental illnesses to but she always says I’m overreacting or over exaggeration I don’t know how much more I can take,.
445,I'm trying to move but it's more complicated than expected and I'm exhausted,"I decided early this year to move out of my apartment to go back to my mom's before moving again in another city.

I sent my notice mid march just before they announced lockdown. It arrived only ten days ago. 

I called my owner, she's trying to discuss my notice period saying it's 90 days and not 30 while I added the appropriate decret. And that she's not sure she'll be able to come because only 100km (63 miles) radius trips around you are allowed, while she is at 105km (66miles). But it's an exceptional reason anyway so wilder trips are allowed. She is just playing me. Also her house is actually at 65km (40miles). She wants me to keep paying rent.

My dad refused to drive a truck so I'll have to make at least two trip with my mom's car. He agreed to that before but now says it's not his problem. Perfect example of why I'm the last of his four kids who still talk to him. 

I'm ready to take my owner to justice. Lash the Armageddon and everything, I'm just sick of her.

I'm so tired. I'm going to sleep right now and tomorrow I'll face it and also bake focaccia bread because it looks so tasty!

Good night people, and stay strong!"
446,How do you deal with constant intrusive thoughts?,[deleted]
447,What is this?,"Hello! I've just joined this sub. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'll be more than thankful. I have this constant feeling of ""something's not right"" in my gut. I'm currently home alone, family is out. I've been feeling like this nonstop for the past one or two weeks. I can sublime the feeling by focusing in something (writing this makes the feeling stop, actually) but, by the time I end my task, the feeling comes back. I've dealt with depression since last year, but I'm not sure this is somehow connected. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but this is getting in the way of my normal way of living, and at least I want to know what this is, so I can do something to make it stop. Maybe it's just the confinement or my lack of human contact recently (fortunately, I live in a country were Covid hasn't been too harsh, so I can at least go out and buy groseries), so I don't know what's wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like crying out of nowhere, and some other times it's just plain depression (lack of interest, feeling empty). And I've felt weaker as well, even though I had a wonderful night of sleep. Sometimes I can't keep up with my home workout routine because I feel exhausted. Anyway, I apologize for the long post. If any of you guys have any insight on what my ""symptoms""might mean, please let me know. Thanks!"
448,How Do I Tell My Parents I Need to Go to the Mental Hospital?,"Hey guys, I’m 16 and have been having a really hard time lately. I struggle with really bad anxiety and lately everything has been too much and it feels like everything is closing in on me. I can’t stand living anymore and need to go to the mental hospital, but I don’t know how to ask. I have such a horrible fear of confrontation the anxiety from needing to ask to go is making everything worse. What do I do? Please help"
449,I’m falling apart,"So this is yet another person obviously affected by the pandemic. Boo hoo you can ignore this.

So in my situation, I was in my final year of sixth form, and I had it so very thoroughly planned out, working hard on my exams and also high restricting on my body due to disordered eating to make sure I had the best summer ever and I felt my best. 

So for a while, I allowed myself to eat to I guess, make sure I had a working immune system. But because of all the stress, I had in the house, with a bratty sibling and too much noise (I’m also autistic) it turned into this depressive binging of “Eh no one’s gonna see me who cares might as well self destruct” because I felt hopeless about the future and saw no point in coming out in good shape.

Then for a bit, I thought “Oh wait this not healthy” because I was also massively stressing myself over the weight I inevitably gained (Which as of now is 10 lbs, remained in the healthy weight BMI).

So I tried to start planning out a semi-spontaneous routine and a healthy diet where I didn’t overeat, still indulged every once in a while but most importantly, tried finding better coping mechanisms.

I started browsing clothing stores to cope with stress, I guess entering an escapist fantasy of the cute things I’d wear, and thought “I’ll buy this once I reach this goal”. I started to feel hopeful again because I thought I had loads of time until the lockdown lifted, and even though I wouldn’t be 100% complete on the outside, I would have a much clearer mind. So for a couple of days, things looked good, I felt a bit better was able to manage my stress and depression better.

But then the last thing I expected to happen happened: My boyfriend all of a sudden broke up with me.

And frankly, I don’t even care that he broke up, but I was shattered because of the disgustingly terrible timing. When I had told him I had gone depressed and needed some support, he couldn’t wait to propose the breakup when I was in a better state of mind and with all the help I had given him in the past, I at least expected that consideration given my situation was a lot worse than his. So I felt betrayed.

On top of that, he was the only person I ever really talked to, the only person who came to talk to me first when my entire life, everyone just threw me under the bus. I felt like I lost the only thing I had left socially. (When fucking hell, he has real friends and so many good things going on in his life, and he KNEW I had no one else)

So the cycle repeated. I feel like life is telling me it’s not worth it to have goals because something’s just gonna come and ruin it. Kinda like that song from Linkin Park, “In the end, it doesn’t even matter”.

And now trying to return to the escapist fantasy makes me feel even worse because now I see no purpose in anything. What’s the point in going somewhere if I can’t show someone pics and they’re interested? What’s the point in looking good and feeling good when I don’t care for myself in the first place and I don’t have anyone waiting for me to reunite? What’s the point in buying things if I have no reason to work for it so I can feel like I deserve them?

My mother is telling me that things will be better once university starts but honestly, I’m scared. I was not given the proper chance to prepare myself and I feel like I’ll just get in looking retarded and giving a bad impression. A motivator would be to make sure I’ll give a good impression and prepare, but it’s such a new thing and a massive change on top of the pandemic that it’s overwhelming me.

I really wanna die, but my corpse self would be a bigger burden so I try not to act on it. But now I’m in desperate need of an optimistic mindset and hope that can motivate me to take care of myself better. Because now I feel like I tried them all and there’s nothing left for me to do but to rot to death."
450,Need help with differentiation betwen dreams and reality,"So lately ive been having a hard time knowing whats a dream and not. And i dont know what to do...

So in my dreams i can look at my phone, count my fingers, tell time  and blah blah blah... but what makes it hard is that some dreams restart with me in bed. So when i wake up in my bed i dont know if its real or not. Secondly i see minor shadows, flashes and hear noises. Like simple, small stuff usually. 

Like this was my last dream: 
So i got called by my sister at 9-10 ish n after that i fell asleep again. Its just that in the dream i couldnt fall aslepp, yeh... i looked up i was in bed i picked up my phone checked instagram a few mins went back to tryin to sleep. After a while a heard somethin u kno like somethin slamming a door o dropping somethin that u do when u have neighbours. But i always think its someone tryin to get in my place (thanks to the knife guy last year). So i went up about to check if my door was locked. U kno theres like a mirror before my bathroom that i just next to my outerdoor. So i bend down to get like a smudge of the floor real quick n i look up into the mirror and in the mirror i see that backside of a leg (the back of the knee kinda) but according to the mirror the person standing there would have stood infront of me, i double check. Im scared. Its a leg alright. Dream restarts. Im laying in bed, i hear the noise thinking of the same thing ""check the door"" but i feel like someone is watching me. Im laying on my stomach head in my pillow. I turn around AND I SEE MY-FUCKING-SLEF STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY BED. Not looking at me, standing facing my bookshelf like a character model. Stiff.  i freak out. Dream restarts. I get to the same point where i turn around and i see myself. Freakout again. But this time he?me?the dude? Reaches out his hand in a geature like im supposed to give him?myself? Something AND LOOKING AT ME!. I freak out cuss now MY-FUCKIN-SELF MOVED. Dream restarts. But this time i look up in bed seeing MY-FUCKING-SELF standing there. He turns his head around reaches out his hand with the same intent of me needing to give him something. But this time i was so much closer to myself. Dream desides that im all of a sudden next to my fridge, where my mirror is. Next to the fridge is my clothes drying rack thingie. I grab it and bolt for MYSELF? HIS? side/stomach. It goes through him. The stomach, shoulder up to his face starts looking blurry. Like i could see them but at the same time not. Legs and arms are still clear as day. He is still holding out his arm. The only thing clear in his face was his eyes. They looked like chrystals. Way too detailed. And then it ended

The problem is that i tend so see myself alot due to me working as a catwalk and photo model...

So what i need is a ""tell""... so far voices have worked but no one's really talking to me so voices are hard to get by (youtube and spotify dont work). Also im gonna see a docror on tuesday, but until then kind of a thing... and if the doctor dont have anything that works.

Any ideas?"
451,Dealing with someone with some sort of metal health condition,"Hello all I'm just looking for some input on this I don't want to go into too many personal details other than looking to see what people think about this behavior 



A family member we live with exhibits the following behavior:


- They can't admit fault at all anything wrong with their home or in their life is someone else's fault. Doesn't matter what it is could be something as simple as a roof leak on the front porch from a poor repair job to a serious life matter. It is never their fault always someone else's.



- Very quick to anger it's usually their go to response to most situations. 



- Very strong paranoia they feel as if their neighbors do things intentionally to them.



- Very high opinion of themselves and their accomplishments general talk down about others who have ""lesser"" accomplishments or education.



- Behave as if they are the resident expert on every topic in existence.



- Takes any form of criticism as a personal attack



There is more but those are the main behavior traits also this person is very old school and from the Era where mental health issues is considered a weakness so discussing this with them is completely out. I am mainly doing this as a coping mechanism I guess.


Thanks in advance for reading and replying."
452,I’m alone and have been alone for almost two months due to this lockdown. My birthday is in a week and a half and I dread the thought of spending that alone too. I am losing it. Really losing it.,"I have bad anxiety for starters. I live with a roommate who is very dirty, doesn’t pay bills, and we don’t communicate at all. Before this all even started, I have suffered from health anxiety so needless to say, it skyrocketed after this began spreading. I was worried, but my family and friends told me it would all be fine. 

Now it’s been almost two months since I’ve had face-to-face communication with anyone. I get sick easily so I’ve been terrified to go out. I am in the military and they have issued a travel ban which prohibits me from going beyond 50 miles. My family lives 10 hours away. They have been great and try to FaceTime whenever they can but it’s not enough. I’m losing it. I have a feeling of existential dread almost every day. I feel like I can’t breathe. The thought of spending my birthday alone is terrifying to me. I’m tired of being worried sick for 14 days every time that I do have to go out for essential trips. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up and my travel ban is issued until June 30th. I’m scared to talk to my family because I don’t want to worry them. 

I know I could have it MUCH worse. I know there are those suffering so much more than me. I am still getting paid, my unit is great and checks up on me, I am young and fit. I am grateful for those things. But despite that, I can’t handle it. My apartment is small and I stay in my room almost all day day, every day, unless I go outside for a walk. I really don’t think I can handle this feeling."
453,Sometimes I want people to suffer like I am,"When I get into a particularly bad spot, as I am in right now, I seem to have this desire and impulse to ruin everyone else's day... is this a normal feeling or am I just a terrible person? It's like I want them to feel what I am feeling, I want them to understand just how low I am which is awful. I know realistically I don't truly want them to feel so sad that they see no reason to go on living, it feels like jealousy almost, like I'm jealous of their happiness or something it so hard to describe. My friend has been ignoring me for the last few days talking to other friends. I told him that he was lucky to have those people but my horrible impulse was telling me to say that I have no friends and point out that those friends are only talking to him now because they have nothing else to do in lockdown. If I was in a good headspace there is no way all this would bother me so much and I wouldn't want to say something like that to him, or anyone.

Please help!! I don't want to push away what few friends I have left away from me, I know that would only make me feel worse."
454,My father is a paranoid schizophrenic. I am angry with him for giving up.,"He's still alive. My mum is his caretaker and thankfully,  keeps him on his meds. 

I was in my mid teens when the dam burst but I can't remember a time when I was able to look to him for stability or guidance - certainly not a father figure.  

So,  I don't now, nor have I ever had the luxury of a father.  While present physically,  he was not capable of filling the role.  

My anger in that regard passed long ago. 

However,  now I find myself angry because he simply stopped trying.  He ate himself to nearly half a ton, stopped working, reading, engaging with his grandchildren (unless they came to him - no effort on his part), and turned completely inward. He suffered a mild stroke (very mild) but refused to do the rehab exercises.  One day his knee gave out and he fell. He never got back up - not because he couldn't,  he just didn't.  

He is now a complete invalid,  by choice. He has sat for so long that his hips have literally turned outwards, from the weight of his legs. My mother moves him from his bed to a recliner, several times a day, via a harness and swing. He won't use a wheelchair because they hurt his butt - so they never leave the house.  She washes him, rolls him, scratches all of his itches, and hands him everything because he won't turn to reach. She also cares for his toilet,  including adjusting his positioning because his abdominal muscles have atrophied to the point that gravity does all of the work.  

He just stopped.  

The worst part is that the schizophrenia is still there, making it impossible for him to believe that he is responsible for his condition. He won't exercise,  won't diet,  won't try. 

I don't know how to stop feeling angry at him. I've run out of pity."
455,"i completely shut down and suddenly ""ghost"" other people when i get hit by depressive episodes","Most of the time i feel really anxious and depressed, but when it gets to a particularly suffocating point, i completely bail on other people. I come around after a few days or week though. I do this quite a lot and I'm afraid it's becoming pretty toxic and unfair to my friends and support networks.

But I can't help it, because I'm too scared to pull them in with me. I know that they might get tired of me always being such a downer and constantly feeling like this. I haven't even replied to my boyfriend in days and I think I've also triggered him because I keep seeing him post sad depressing stuff online. 

I've been feeling the need to isolate even more because the of many problems and the quarantine isn't making it any better.

I hate that I feel this way and always thinking that isolation is the key. But I'm really convinced that it's much more harmful to then if they see me in such a state because it's really hard to deal with a person with mental illness/es. I just want myself to stop doing this but I can't help it."
456,I feel like everytime i try to talk about my experiences im either outed as weird or dismissed entirly,"Currently staying at grandparents cause of quarentine.

Ive been doing a huge dive i to my mental health and ive been sharing it with my grandparents since i felt they were the only ppl who could help me.

As it turns out im wrong.

They just dismiss everything i say and make excuses for it. They dont really bother to actually help.

And my brother who is living with us tells me to stop bc i sound rlly weird.

Im just done with this and feel like im going to break"
457,How I learned to move pass the things that I cannot control. I want to help people with my story.,"
This is not a throwaway (obviously. look at my karma) because I don’t care if people I know see this. Maybe it will help them too. I (m,20) have had severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder since the age of 7. I developed it as a result of childhood trauma along with other psychiatric disorders. I won’t go into detail here, as I have on old posts that were made on throwaways. Sorry. Anyway, I have posted on here several times in the past back when I was struggling, but not since I have reached the end of the tunnel. Anyway, for years I struggled with OCD. I shook doorknobs for 5 or more minutes, I counted things, I checked things, I scrubbed my hands too much, and did several other things. I literally had hundreds of obsessions that ruled my life. On top of that, I had to deal with other disorders. I then decided to go to the doctor because I couldn’t take it anymore. Little did I know, I was approaching one of the toughest times in my life. For two years I had to play musical chairs with meds and therapy. Towards the end of the two years, I was practically suicidal. I stayed in my dark room only emerging to eat and shit. I looked for ways to die. I would be somewhat negligent with my life. Then one day, I decided to once again, for the millionth time and with the advice of my therapist, to get a med change. This med change may have been the best thing that has happened to my life. With these meds and therapy, I no longer shake door knobs more then a few times. It takes more than a month to empty a GermX bottle that used to take me less than a week to empty. I’m not overly afraid to shake hands with people (before Covid) and my other compulsive symptoms became irrelevant. I went from a very severe life to a normal life. Of course, OCD will always be there because it is permanent. But it stays in the shadows much more than it used to. You might ask how I did this. The first thing I did was stop obsessing over my OCD. I used to think about it constantly. I used to make it who I am. I talked about it all the time. But it didn’t stop until I got the right meds, talked to the therapist, and stopped thinking about OCD. (In they order of course. It’s impossible to do it in another order at least for me). Instead of loathing about it, I took action. Now I live a normal life. My final words for this is: whatever you do, don’t make yourself a victims as many of us have a habit  of doing. This doesn’t accomplish anything. Stand up, get meds, talk to someone, and quit thinking about it. Don’t make yourself a victim. Because if you continue to, as I used to, you will ALWAYS be OCDs victim."
458,The quarantined world,"The world is on lockdown and it finally feels like I can breath. Everyday I waste away, having no interactions with people or doing anything meaningful and now everyone is doing the same. There's no expectations anymore because everyone's home. During quarantine I don't feel the usual pressure I feel from the world. You know the pressure like, other people are working and living and having fun and I'm doing nothing. But all of that's stopped because now we're all doing nothing. I'm scared for when things return to normal because the world will start spinning again and I will remain stuck."
459,Feeling really sad,Everyday I wake up with a pit in my stomach and I still do my workout and read and make good food but the pit stays there and by the end of the day I’m too tired to fight it anymore ... I really want isolation to end
460,It’s Getting to Me,"So the Stay-at-Home order for my state has been extended until the end of May, termed as “Safer at Home” but it is basically the same stay at home order but with some exception. 

I live alone on a university campus and I just graduated. I had a roommate but she moved back home when everything started going downhill. Right before the quarantine, my boyfriend broke up with me randomly, and we haven’t spoken since. My friends all graduated last year and now live at home in the suburbs, and they all have boyfriends/are in (online) graduate school. Normally on the weekends, my friends would stay over at my place and we would go to the bars and hang out. 

While I definitely didn’t expect everything to open immediately, I did have some sort of hope that something would open up that could give me an additional option of something to do. I thought maybe smaller group gatherings would be allowed and my friends would be more inclined to come see me. My birthday is next week too. But I talked with my them last night and they basically are following the guidelines and won’t be leaving their houses for the next month and aren’t bothered at all by being quarantined.

It is particularly hard because I have to see all these other people not abiding by the rules, especially my ex hanging out with other girls. I come from quite a toxic family, which is why I’ve chosen to remain on campus, so at the core I just feel really alone and hopeless. I’ve worked hard to keep myself together and be my own support thus far, but it’s really getting to me. It feels like everyone has someone or somewhere to go, and I’m just here in my apartment. I’m constantly trying to distract myself but it’s becoming difficult to do so because I’m in my head all the time. I feel like im obsessing over my ex because I’m still not over it and I am becoming more and more tempted to text him. It’s like every day is a battle to just not say anything and to get through the day in general. I don’t know what else to do and I’m just feeling really stuck."
461,How do you know when you are having a panic attack?,"I’ve never had any panic attacks. Or any problems with my mental health. I don’t have any type of mental disorders and I’ve also never been in depression. Lately I’ve been making really stupid decisions. Idk how I changed so much this year. Yesterday, I was actually shaking and along with that I had a severe headache. I was really bad situation due to my stupidity. I was also having trouble focusing yesterday. Today I’m not shaking but I still have a severe headache. So do you think I should take this seriously or is it normal?"
462,Good news,"I’ve got a good life in general and good and caring people around me but I still can’t shake the feeling of not feeling worthy, even though I’ve got so many things to appreciate in life I still can’t escape the feeling of not wanting to go on. And I hate telling my parents about how I feel because all they wanna hear are the good news. I always isolate myself whenever I feel like shit and have a hard time talking to the people I normally wanna talk the most to. I hate myself and will never be able to understand why anyone would love me and I really struggle to motivate myself to keep seeing the girl I really like because I most of the time feel like I don’t deserve it and that it’s going to end just when it starts feeling like the pieces have fallen into place"
463,Hello from Osmind! connecting psychedelic medicine to people with treatment-resistant mental health; AMA the following Wednesdays (5/6 + 5/13) with psychedelic legal expert + ketamine practitioner,"Hey everyone,

My name is Sarai and I am currently studying neuroscience at Boston University. I am working with a team of Stanford graduate students on [Osmind](https://osmind.org/) to deliver a care platform for those with treatment-resistant mental health. Especially during crazy times like this, we want to provide support and do anything we can to help.

Today, we’re launching a forum for members to interact and socialize with each other. What’s different about our community is that it’s for individuals with treatment-resistant depression (people who have tried multiple types of medications for their treatments) and includes evidence-based, MD-verified content on psychedelic medicine and other types of treatments. We just hosted an [AMA on our site](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-wed-4-29-psychedelic-medicine-expert-from-stanford/124/48) with a leading psychedelic medicine researcher and have one on [May 6th](https://members.osmind.org/t/ask-me-anything-ama-on-wed-may-6-from-400pm-pt/209) lined up with a psychedelics legal expert and one on May 13th with one of the country’s leading ketamine practitioners.

We wanted to let this group know about these resources: you can join at [https://www.osmind.org/members](https://www.osmind.org/members). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what we’re doing! And feel free to pass along to any friends who might be interested.

Many Thanks,

464,Residential Treatment,"I've been looking into residential treatment facilities, but sometimes I feel like my mental illness isn't severe enough to warrant actually going through with it. 

My mental illness doesn't impact my life so to speak, I still go to work and school (online) regularly, but I do think it's messing with my relationships/self image/etc. 

I've done conventional therapy and whatnot, but I think it would be better for me to have a place to fully sort out everything, and then reintegrate into my every day life, versus just trying to help myself while dealing with everything going on in my life. 

Thoughts? Advice?"
465,*self harm and suicide trigger* How My Childhood Abuse Has Affected My Growing Up And Mental Health,"When I was younger my father was abusive, an alchoholic and would cheat on my mom. He would swear at us, hit us, threaten to kill us and hold guns to our heads. He took me and my sibling hostage once too when my mom was on the other side of the state. He told my mother she would never get to see her kids again. She did. We got home eventually and the next day, my mother ran away with us. Our aunt helped. That day my father constantly called my mom swearing at her and telling her to get home. She was traumatized. When he phoned for the last time, my aunt picked up, he said he wanted my mom to hear something she would never forget. My aunt refused, and he shot himself over the phone.

He left us bankrupt. We had no money. We were 3million rand in debt because of him and hidden accounts. Our house got repossessed by the bank. I moved 15 times as a kid due to being homeless. We have actually been properly homeless 6 times, and had to live in houses that were on sale/being renovated. We often went without food.

A different aunt of mine used to abuse me. Her family would train their dogs to attack me. They would make their pet marmoset attack me and used it to scare me. My uncle would pretend to throw knives at me too. I was always terrified there and would wet the bed. They would then make me sit outside in the blistering daytime heat (30+°c /86+°f) with the mattress, as well as put me in their monkey's cage as punishment. I used to get food spat into my face and would constantly be called baby when I would cry because of what was happening. Their children used to bully me too, and would make my brother bully me too. One of the most terrifying times for me there was running away from my cousins, being chased with a loaded crossbow. When I would try call my mom to fetch me, they would take away my phone.

My brother then became physically abusive towards me at home, as they has built this anger in him towards me and my mother.

When I was 6 I was molested. 

When I was in primary school I was bullied. I would get kicked and pushed. Teachers would bully and victimize me as well. I wen to a new school.

I got a scholarship for highschool but left after the 3rd year. I had arranged attacks made against me in the corridors. I'd be sworn at and attacked everyday. They were ruthless and would point out every possible thing wrong with me. I was told numerous times to go kill myself, over online bullying too. The last few weeks of grade 9. I wasn't at school for that reason.

My gran was psychologically abusive. She was abusive to my family because we had no else to go.

I started self harming at 12. I've had 7 suicide attempts. 4 of them I needed to be hospitalized for. I started smoking at 13 and drugs (CAT, LSD, Marijuana and ecstasy) at 14. Never drank though because of my father's alcoholism. 

I got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. I would often use my medications to get high and for my suicide attempts.

I got a boyfriend. My mother never liked him so It was always a secret. He always motivated me to do better and always tried his best to help me. His parents helped me stop smoking, and he helped me with my other addictions, that I never expected to be able to stop.

All this before I was even 17

I stopped self harming for about a year until i hit a really bad stage recently. I have not touched drugs in over a year and a half.

My partner helps me a lot with controlling my disorder and helps me with breaking bad habits and building good ones. I am forever grateful. He has never taken advantage of my mental state and used it to manipulate me.

I am on my recovery path. I am not always feeling the best, but everyday I am trying my best. I am not entirely happy/proud with where i am and where I've been, but I can certainly try my best with what I have right now, and I'm glad I've had 8 chances.

There's been a lot more stuff that has happened, I just didn't want to make this too long. 

Most of the hell I have endured, is from abusive homes and situations. I'm still struggling, and most of this will affect me for the rest of my life, but slowly I am trying to get myself to a better place. I'm trying my hardest. And I really just felt like I needed to share this."

467,The Twelve S's of Supreme Mental Health,"Greetings fellow Mental Health Minders,

My name is Carter, I have bipolar II disorder. I have learned that there are some things I simply have to do every day to stay stable, and some additional things which keep me on a healthy path. I call them the 12 S’s:

&amp;#x200B;

* sleep
* stretch
* sweat - exercise, get the heart rate up
* sit - meditate, as little as three deep breaths
* shower - SHOWER!
* spruce up - keep your spaces tidy
* slurp/swig/sip - drink water
* social - interact with other humans
* schedule - have a plan for the day, maybe even the next day
* supper/snack - eat three meals, or whatever works for you
* sedate/some meds - take your medicine
* see the doc - have appointments on the schedule

&amp;#x200B;

I have found this to be a good foundation to build from.

If you want to be accountability buddies, I’d be down.

Hope everyone is doing alright!"

About over 6 months ago I was getting much better, really putting my life together but I got sucked in to a depression for about a month until school started, and during school year barely did anything. I've dealt with depression symptoms since I was 13, and at 16 everything got better, I even stopped self harming after a year and a half of doing so.  But then the summer ruined it.
I just turned 17 and I hate my life more than ever. I was so close to living the way I wanted and being who I wanted to be but I ruined it and it feels like it's too late now. I was becoming peaceful with my body and accepting the way I look, even almost started going to the gym just so I could be stronger and run for longer periods of time, but I just couldn't.  I ruined everything. I had the perfect opportunity and threw it to the trash, and Ionly have a year to fix it(and yes, It really is just a year, even less). Now I hate myself even more than before and I can't look at myself in the mirror because I feel like I'm going to cry looking at my body. I just feel detached from it like never before. 
I really don't know what to do, and I just wish I could go six months back and make it all perfect again but I can't and I feel like there's no point for anything anymore, and I started thinking about self harm again. I just truly hate myself."

472,How to help girlfriend with anorexia nervose?,"My gf (20) is about 1.62 (5 feet 4 inches) and weighs 45 kgs (about 100 lbs) yet she is very obsessive about her weight and still tries to lose weight. She is also very sensitive about it when I touch her arm or grab her by the waist she gets angry thinking I'm trying to weigh her/ touch the fat (I don't know what that means either.) Because of this think twice before touching her.

I try to tell her that she is very okay and even below okay both directly and indirectly but it appears to be out of any help. And now she tells me that she is forcing herself to puke. Which worried me a lot. It also worries her, that's why she told me about it. She is worried about the fact that making herself puke doesn't worry him.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I help her? Going to a therapist is no option during quarantine and our country isnt giving enough online services for it.

What can we do? Please help."
473,Intense loneliness; autophobia? Something else?,"I figured the symptoms might be autophobia but I get this horrible anxious sad feeling not when I’m physically alone, but alone figuratively (“alone in life” I guess); for periods that I’m single, in a new city on my own for extended periods etc 

Its basically full blown depression and anxiety, rushing thoughts interfering with sleep and life but ONLY in the above circumstances 

If my girlfriend is away for a few hours or I’m visiting a city but my friends are seeing me a couple days later I’m fine, my usual self.

Its been crippling me and forced me to stay in certain relationships too long. I was an only child very close with my mother so I think it comes from there.

I guess this is just a kind of general anxiety? I’m not one for putting labels on everything but would love to know more so I could start to deal with it..."
474,Why do I always feel like I’ll never be more than what I am?,"When I was young I was SO ambitious. Now that I’m 20 I feel like I’m half as smart as I was at 15 and I’ll never learn anything new or achieve anything great. I have a terrible memory (I’ll forget what I’m taking about mid conversation 8/10 times) so learning is just frustrating and destroys all motivation. I’m unemployed, broke, I feel like I can’t get a job/any job I get will be miserable. I used to want to go to college but I went for a year, dropped out, and now I just don’t care. My boyfriend pushes me but it just makes me feel worse. I’m stuck. I struggle with depression and anxiety but i take medicine for it. I don’t know if I need a good pep talk, some tough love, or a higher dose of medication. I just need help."
475,Feeling like my every movement is under surveillance and coincidences are more than just that.,"I cannot shake this feeling from my head as much as I try. It feels like I am being watched when I use my phone or laptop, be it through the camera or somehow a hacker can see my every move on the internet or whatever. Other times it is like certain things that seemingly happen at random, are actually just people using technology as a means to harass me and control my life. Even having conversations with family and friends it seems like certain things are being said with a certain tone or even hinting at something else. I have been dealing with this for a few months now and I've done some things to combat the feelings and suspicions, which have helped and improved the quality of life,  but every now and then something will happen that makes me start questioning it all again and this feeling of impending doom reemerges.

I am marking this as nsfw just in case my post causes fear in other people"
476,"Chronic nightmares. Sad, disturbing dreams every night for YEARS. PTSD? Something else?","I'm used to them, but I want them gone.

Last night I had a dream that my little brother OD'd and we had to look for his body.

My brother doesnt do drugs.

This is just one example. They can be about anything. But they are always disturbing and unpleasant.

I have been through some rough stuff, and have always battled depression. I would really like to not have these dreams anymore.

Do any of you have experience with chronic nightmares?

Ive heard some PTSD sufferers are sometimes prescribed a medication that lessens nightmares.

I would love some advice. Thanks."
477,What is wrong here?,"Just to jump right into it I am a 29 year old male living on my own far from my hometown. I can say that for most my life I have gone through the years with episodes of anxiety, depression, and hyper-vigilance. Much like an emotional roller coaster. Lately I feel it has become so bad that my memory has become impaired as for my hand eye coordination and my approach to relationships. Instead of writing a lifetime novel I have decided to start jotting down daily problems I have in small spurts so as to not exhaust or over extend myself and any possible reader. I'm open to all questions and recommendations but mostly I wish to get the problems out and into the open as a sort of therapy since i don't have the means of obtaining the conventional kind. I am of course American and because of the pandemic I am unemployed waiting to be approved for unemployment and there fore I am not eligible for socialized healthcare at this time.  Anyway, here's what I've jotted down in the past two days.

*I cant keep a job, because i show up late, i become overwhelmed easily, and i generally have issues bonding and relating to my coworkers

*I have hardly any interest in anything beyond sitting at home watching tv. Even video games have become tiresome and tedious

*im mistrustful of others and crowds and being around strangers deep down scares the hell out of me, in fact when i go in public  i secretly wish no one can see me

*im so focused on myself that im obsessed over my mental health, how i look, how im seen, and yet at the same time im such a wreck that i dont have the will or energy to take care of myself or stick to any schedule or routine.

* im obsessed with porn. Ive tried to abstain from it for years but i always come back to it. When I allow myself to I will obsessively browse and download it for most of the day for weeks at a time, hardly leaving the house or taking care of basic needs such as eating, cleaning, washing, and sleeping. The side effects of this habit continued over many years has given me erectile dysfunction, a low sex drive, and a warped perception of my sexuality and women.

*My inadequacies cause me to be hyper vigilante and sensitive 
towards percieved slights 

* I always have had a hard time reading people and their intentions and that has resulted in others perceiving me as naive and perhaps even slow or idiotic. Growing up this has caused me to be bullied by peers.

*Ive always been sensitive, even though I can logically understand teasing as a sort of social grooming device I seem to take things to heart and I have trouble deciphering if a person means me harm when teasing me or if they are in fact taking a hurtful jab at me. 

* I am cautious about meeting new people and making friends but those that i feel I can trust and be around never seem to want to be around. It always seems like Im the one calling and asking to hang and never the other way around.

Disclaimer; I am currently abstaining successfully from porn and drug use and I do not see these things as being the root of my problems but rather symptoms of a deeper issue as well as  poor choices of coping."
478,I’m so confused about relationships,"I think I don’t really need people? I don’t know... now bc of the pandemic I’ve only spent time with my mum and I genuinely don’t miss anyone and I haven’t talked to my friends in a long time. We made  plans to play call multiple times but I always chicken out and cancel. It’s just that the thought of talking to them seems really scary and I always feel alone when I’m with people, whereas when I’m by myself I’m fine. Kind of... it’s been bothering me for a while and it makes me sad and confused because I WANT to love my friends and talk to them but I just can’t...I really don’t want to. And then there’s this boy who likes me and I really really want to like him back but I can’t imagine myself in a relationship or even just having a crush on anyone. Idkkkkk it’s like -“yes pls, love” but also “no, ew, love” . I don’t particularly hate people, I like them, I just don’t want to interact...I want to live in my own fantasy world with tea cups and pretty dresses so I’ve just kind of formed a bubble around myself. I’m really confused right now, I don’t know if there’s something wrong with me or if I’m just overreacting"
479,Is it normal to hit and scratch my face when angry or randomly irritated?,"So if I were to talk about the symptoms I have for a few mental health issues I would be able to go on for days but recently (past 6 months or so) this has become very frequent.

I used to self harm quite a lot, just because I “liked” it? But now it’s very rare for me to pick a blade back up. I’ve always gotten sudden outbursts of anger and I’ve ripped my clothes due to that or punched something, knocked something over etc.

Recently I’ve noticed when I get these outbursts I keep scratching my face or punching it. I’ve never went to the GP about anything, I don’t know why but I never have had the confidence to do so. I’ve been managing myself for years but some symptoms have gotten quite bad.

So, should I be concerned or will I be able to manage this myself?"
480,"I've been struggling with what I can only describe as anxiety, depression, even OCD since I was about 8, but I'm not allowed to get tested.","I still live with my parents, and I'm 15 and live in the UK, so legally not allowed to go and book an appointment with my GP by myself yet, and I recently told my parents about how I have been cutting since was about 11, and since I had fresh cuts my mum took me to the hospital to get them checked out in case they were infected. I know I need some form of therapy, but I can't get it unless I have been diagnosed with a mental illness. But my parents wont let me get tested for anything. What should I do?"
481,My narcissistic emotionally abusive mother.,"So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female ""friend"" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with. Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend ""more"" time with this ""friend"" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat"" and being a bitch to me yet again. Moral of the story, I have no clue how to deal with her, I have been suffering with her like this for a good couple of years now, and even then it doesnt clean up the fact that she did some horrible and selfish things that ended up hurting me in the end all throughout my life, I have a bunch of undiagnosed mental problems, and can't get help even after she found out that I harm, and I have no fucking idea how I'm supposed to stand this type of thing for another couple of years before I could at least move or leave the  country."
482,Had another rough day... I need some motivation.,Hi I’ve been feeling rubbish again today. I’ve enjoyed playing guitar and listening music but I noticed my ex unfollowed me on social media after dumping me a couple of months ago (like an idiot) I’m clearly not over her yet. I would unfollow her myself but that’ll make me look petty and like I’m keeping tabs on her so I’m not gonna do that. I’m not letting a good few months be let down by a bad couple of days no way. Also the fact I’ve had to cut some lifelong friends off for chatting crap behind my back. Just feeling a bit lonely at the moment
483,So productive today I did all of under 600 steps,Depression just keeps getting worse so why even bothereaving bed
484,I want help but I can't bring myself to open up to anyone,"It's pretty simple actually. I've recently started to realize that I have some severe trust and attatchment issues alongside with a solid amount of anxiety. I know it's a problem seriously affecting all of my relationships and the thing is I do want to fix it but I just can't bring myself to talk to anyone.

Like, I literally can't tell anyone what I feel even when I try my best to do it.

I don't think I'm a compulsive liar or anything but every time I try telling anyone about my feelings I just end up smoothing over everything and not really discusaing anything. Trust me, I've tried so many times: with my parents, sister, friends..

I kind of want to try a therapist but at the same time they can't help me if I won't tell them a thing so would there even be a point?

Idk, maybe someone here has experienced something similar and has a word of advice or two?"
485,Emotional detachment,So throughout my past I have done some pretty awful things of which is have a strong sense of overwhelming guilt that would eat me up. I thought about suicide howver fast forward nearly a year and I feel nothing . I have little compassion little guilt towards it and I don’t know why this is. Can someone tell me why
486,A compilation of empty thoughts,"I think about my life as a continuous cycle of never-ending doubt and upside down emotions.

The wheel of ""will I be okay today?"" keeps spinning round, and round. Because, I cannot foreshadow the face my mind chooses to portray today.

I wake up. Wow. Happiness. That's new. Let's inform the world until they are sick of all the positivity. Oh. The dark cousin. Hey suicidal thoughts...

Have you met crippling fear? Or irrational optimism? I think you would be good friends! 

Don't look now because here comes adrenaline. Ready to transport you to the land of 'cold hands and feet'. Or maybe a moonlit trip to 'wall-bounce euphoria'.

It doesn't make sense. It's not supposed to. Why would it. I can't tell you what it means if I don't understand it myself?

The leg shakes cause another earthquake as the mind deciphers whether the rain will fall today or the sun will shine instead. 

But the wheather reporter's on strike, whether the weather will weather the flame of passion and hope is yet to be decided.

I guess time will tell. 

Fluctuations of heat, and rain and sleet, erode the foundations that hold these feet. Fractures form as they ride this storm. And the rescue teams are late.

Will it stand?

Or will it break?"
487,Headvoice?,"I’m not really sure where to put this question, but I’m hoping you guys could point me in the right direction. It’s kinda hard to explain what’s going on in my head, but my goal is to try and expand my minds eye. I guess you would call it that. What I mean is my brain feels like I’m so narrow thinking, and I believe that is due to the fact that I really can only hear myself talk in my head. And I don’t mean I don’t listen and comprehend what people are saying. But everything I hear I hear back in my own voice. So like a dog whine, I hear the dog whine then I hear myself do the dog whine in my head. Also, sometimes when someone is talking of course my brain is doing the same and then it gets hard to focus on what the person is saying. Then it takes a lot of brain power to focus on what they are saying. I just feel like I’m so disconnected from everything. As if in reality I’m in a black void, closed off from everything. I just feel like I can’t take the moments in even though I’m trying really hard too. I feel like it’s due to that voice inside my head. Is there a way to slow the voice down? To freely think without it a bit?"
488,A multitude of problems,"So I don’t really feel much emotion.

I cant feel the repercussions of any event.

Things which previously bring joy spark nothing

I use to be depressed, I fixed my life and exercised everyday and ate right. I can’t exercise right now due to injury but I still eat really well

I try to learn everyday

I make sure I’m organized and productive everyday, I right our a schedule every morning aswell

The only emotion that comes very easy is frustration and anger

I feel like I’m having emotional Dysregulation along with problems with my emotional memory, any tips?"
489,Do we only care about suicide after the person is dead?,"I want to preface this by saying that I do not want any hotline numbers or any generic advice like that. I’m not in any immediate danger.

I’ve been having casual thoughts of suicide for years now. I’m very self conscious about admitting to having these issues, as I don’t want to be a burden on anyone else. But then I hear messages like “remember to check in on your friends. You don’t want to regret not doing so” etc etc. and I understand that basically all of us have mental health issues and I don’t want to add to anyone else’s mental capacity. But idk what to do? I’m literally looking into purchasing a firearm to kms and yet I still feel gaslighted by this voice in my head that is like “if you reach out to anyone and let them know how you’re feeling then you just want attention and you’re being manipulative” even though I’m quiet and introverted and don’t like attention.

Anyway, the problem is I did text my friend and said I’m having a hard time mentally. Very short message and not dramatic or demanding at all. Just wanted some company. He just said something like “sorry to hear that. my phone keeps dying and I’ve been at work”
It really hurt me to think that maybe people don’t really care. Maybe we always assume the person isn’t going to hurt themselves until it’s too late. Maybe I’d think the same thing if someone texted me that. Like the fact that everyone is depressed makes it harder to tell when someone is *actually* going off the deep end for real"
490,"(Rant) I just want a place to feel what I feel, and a person to speak express emotions honestly with","Tl:dr:  I have always struggled to acknowledge and express my own feelings, especially around family. While I finally understand some ways to cope with social anxiety and depression, I'm temporarily living with parents, and am having troublie coping with my loneliness in this emotionally stunting living situation


I'm 26(M), from Ohio, and I just need to share my stuggle to maybe get it off my mind, and to express that I'm not ok in a way that others will see, instead of it just echoing in my mind.  I stuggle talking about it to people irl, but this anon community can certainly be comforting, so I'm posting it here. Here's a little life/mental health backstory first.  I've always been shy, awkward, or socially anxious for as long as I can remember. I have never been great at discussing it (though there has been occasional glimpses of improvement in recent years). I can't recall ever talking to family about complex emotional topics starting very early in life. Despite my perpetual anxiety and difficulty managing and expressing the extent to which I feel emotion, I gathered a decent sized friend group in high school that I could be comfortable around.  I thoroughly experienced life with the social connection and physical contact as a normal occurrence.  However, there was one relationship I was holding onto that was not great for my mental health. Basically, we had good times, but I developed and mastered the art of ignoring my own feelings for the sake of another's. 

After highschool, I was in a 5 year relationship through college. I fully trusted her and felt comfortable around her; however, I never fully escaped that habbit of suppressing my feelings for the sake of my partner's. She tried hard to help me with that, and she certainly made it clear that all of my feelings, not just the positive ones, were worth expressing. Nonetheless, I still wasn't able to do that, and didn't really have the language or courage to try talking to anyone. I didn't really start communicating with my major classmates outside of class until a couple months before graduation, and even then, nothing emotionally charged. 

After I graduated, we split up (as planned) to allow each other to experience new things and work on ourselves. I agreed both then and now that was a good idea. Though that was the start of my 2 year deep depressive episode. 2 years of literally no physical contact with another human, with the exception of my parents (who I have never spoken to with any significant emotional honesty), which did not provide any comfort. Multiple jobs, eventually I'd always start start spiraling mentally and quit.  

The turning turning point was when I experienced psilocybin for the first time. Suddenly, I had a way to shift perspective and view my emotions and insecurities that had been blocked from view by the wall that I put up myself.  I also gained new perspective  on connecting with others, and emotional honesty. I started going outside more, going to parks, developed a love for hiking, inciting my sense of adventure again.  I bought an SUV with the help of my dad, built a bed to replace the seats, and explored the south west. I saw Denver, camped in the San Juan mountains, saw the grand canyon, then Vegas. My car broke down outside of Moab, where I some people at the hostel I stayed at who I eventually had some quick, but deep emotional connections with. I worked a seasonal winter job, which ended early due to Covid-19.  

That brings us to now. As I've mentioned, I struggle with social anxiety, and have a tendency to disregard my emotions and urges to satisfy other people's wants and expectations. I am in between seasonal jobs, living with my dad and step mom, and with no vehicle. As I also vaguely mentioned, I have always maintained the tendancy to hide my emotions, especially from family members. Now, stuck at my dad's, I currently have no physical place where I feel comfortable to acknowledge what I feel. The place I lived during my 2 year depression was a comfortable place for me, but I had only started to develop the skills to notice my emotions and needs that weren't being met soon before moving out. Even my own car can be a emotional safe-space, for lack of a better term, though I no longer have one. I'm so socially starved, and long to be touched and hugged. But I'm trapped in a place where I constantly portray the persona of someone who is fine and not struggling, taking away the ability to sit with and cope with my feelings. I just need to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening to my story :)"
491,Was this a panic attack or something else?,"I've had panic attacks before, but this seemed different. I started to dissociate super hard and began to get super dizzy. I sat down and started sweating super hard and my heart started to race. I could feel my blood flowing through my whole body. I started to feel intense fear and thought I was going to die. My vision began to close into blackness and I ended up passing out. I was with a friend and he said he was trying to shake me, but couldn't because my body was too stiff to move. Afterwards I was very pale looking. I didn't get emotional like usual, but I felt intense fear, tiredness, and weakness that lasted for about 24 hours."
492,I have severe social anxiety and I managed to call my doctor and get my meds changed!,"I started experiencing really bad side effects from my antidepressants a short while before we went into lockdown in the UK, a few months ago. I have severe social anxiety and haven't been able to speak to my doctor in several months as I couldn't get a face-to-face appointment. Yesterday I finally worked up the courage to book a telephone appointment and I spoke to her on the phone and got my medication changed to a different medication which will hopefully work a lot better for me.

I haven't talked on the phone to anyone in probably over 5 years, not even my parents. Idk I just felt kinda proud of myself and wanted to share this hopefully somewhere people can relate ❤️"
493,"Im not sure if Im ok, but don't want to know whats wrong.","For a while I feel like I have been almost seeing things. It's kind of like I can imagine it so vividly I could almost see and feel it. I can right now almost feel someone crawling on my leg and it feels like I can almost see them, but there is no one there."
494,The Persona,"
When I was younger, I put on a social mask to be apart of a group. I had conflicting motives. pretended so that others would like me. Often forcing myself. Now I put on a mask that I feel truly represents a part of me. No it’s not a mask I constantly change but the same throughout. When you see me you’ll find me the same here or there. I do realize that i am not my persona. That I just use it as a way of expressing myself and who I am. It’s my communication style. Is that such a bad thing?"
495,Helpful stuff!,"The link is at the end. Exercises that could help you stop believing your unwanted automatic thoughts. There's five of them.

Here's a TLDR because there's lots of text in the link:

1. exercise is called Disobey on purpose. The exercise in the link goes like this: write in a notebook ""I shouldn't walk around my room"". Then proceed to get up on your legs and start walking around the room while reading that sentence. 
2. exercise is called Give your mind a name, and listen to it politely. So the first one is obvious. I called my Garry (from Fallout haha), the author called his George and two another examples are Mrs. Mind and Mr. Mind. What you want to do with that is that it seems to you like you are talking to another person thus giving you the opportunity to agree or disagree with your mind. 
3. exercise is called Appreciate what your mind is trying to do. This is the most important part i think: ""As you listen to your thoughts and notice when your mind starts to chatter, answer it back with something like, “Thanks for that thought, George. Really — thank you.” If you speak to your mind dismissively, it will continue right on problem-solving, so be sincere. You might want to add, “I really get that you’re trying to be of use, so thank you for that. But I’ve got this covered.” Say this out loud if you’re alone, or internally if you’re with others."" Be persistent because your mind could try many times to go on and keep chattering.
4. exercise is called Sing it. So basically take a thought that is bothering you and start singing it. Rhythm, wording or what song you sing to doesn't matter. It only matter that you sing it!
5. exercise is called Carry it with you. This one is the toughest for me. Quote from the link: ""Write down a recurring, critical thought on a small piece of paper. Maybe it’s “I’m stupid” or “I’m unloveable” or “I’m going to fail.” After you finish writing, hold up the paper and look at it as if it were a precious and fragile page from an ancient manuscript. These words are an echo of your history. 

Even if the thought is painful, ask yourself if you’d be willing to honor that history by choosing to   
carry this piece of paper with you. If you can get to “yes,” place it in your pocket, wallet or bag   
and let it come along for the ride. During the days you carry it, every so often pat your wallet or   
bag (or wherever you keep it) to acknowledge that it is part of your journey, and it is welcome to   
come along.""

496,Help. Serious question,Is it normal to hate yourself to be diagnosed with anxiety and hate taking meds even though the meds your on help anxiety and the depression you don’t talk about?
497,"Everyone I've ever met doesn't seem capable of caring for others at all, is the whole world sociopathic?",Am I the only one that cares? Everyone I've met in my life is incapable of truly caring they all use it for their advantage against others to get what they want and use guilt trips and never end up caring in the end no matter what they say. Is this just me that notices this? Is the world this fucking dumb? I don't understand.
498,Struggling to cope during lockdown.,"
I’m making this post because I feel like I really need to vent somewhere about how the coronavirus lockdown has taken an unprecedented toll on my mental health. It really has ruined every aspect of my life for the time being. 

Just before the lockdown happened I was at university in another city that’s an hour and a half away from home. I was in a really good place in my life. I had a great circle of friends and doing fun stuff with them constantly like having nights out, going to the pub etc. My main hobby is working out, so having a gym less than a 10 min walk away was perfect. I was in the best shape I had ever been in my life as I was in a great routine which made me really motivated. Being in the gym and seeing my body progress more by the day makes me feel alive. Life wasn’t perfect though as there are some bad aspects including my job which I hated but the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives by a strong margin.

Now due to coronavirus though and the consequent lockdown, it really has just ruined my life in every single aspect and as a result has put me in a really dark place mentally. It’s forced me to move back home where there isn’t much worthwhile here for me to be honest, even before the lockdown. I’m stuck with my five other family members and two dogs, obviously I love them all deeply but I feel like being independent for so long at uni has made me realise that I’m at the stage in my life now where I need to leave the nest for good. I’m 21 and almost 22 now so I feel like I’m doing nothing but stagnating here. 

Every day that passes I’m feeling worse and worse, like a prisoner in my own home. I do home workouts but they feel mostly useless when I’m training with heavy weights constantly. I just had a body I was proud of and would even gain me a lot of compliments from other people. Now I’m noticing myself rapidly losing muscle mass and it’s making me feel utter shit. I’ve got a lot of uni assignments that I need to complete too but honestly I feel like I’m in no fit state of mind to do them. Whenever I start them my mind just automatically wanders and stresses about other aspects of my life. I can’t even focus. I think I need to ask my tutors for an extension. I know I’ll feel better once they’re all out the way, but right now they feel like they’re an impossible obstacle to overcome, given the state of my mental health. 

My close friends don’t seem to fully understand how I’m feeling. I’ve not opened up on this level to anyone because it feels like I’m speaking to a brick wall with most people. I’ve considered opening up to my parents but my house is so busy to the point where there is very rarely ever an opportunity to have a quiet one to one chat. I’d feel awkward doing that anyway. 

Overall, I just feel completely lost for what to do with myself right now. Every day feels completely meaningless and the end of lockdown doesn’t even seem to be in sight with nothing but constant doom and gloom on the news. I struggle to think positively.

I appreciate anyone taking their time to read this. I’m mostly writing this to find out if anyone else is in similar circumstances to me and feeling the same way."
499,I hit my boyfriend a few days ago. I feel like fucking garbage.,"I’m diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which is characterized (amongst other things) by difficulty controlling emotions and high irritability. I’m not a violent person. I never even got into fights in school. The first and last time I swung on somebody was nine years ago. I was 17 and I had told my boyfriend at the time that I didn’t want to have sex, but he wouldn’t stop groping me, so I hit him. I’m 26 now and not only have I not hit anyone since then, I’ve been in therapy for over two years and have gotten very good at controlling my reaction when I lose my temper or get emotional. I’m not any better at controlling the actual emotions, but I’ll separate myself from the situation to cool down instead of reacting. 

A few days ago, my boyfriend was over hanging out. We’ve been together for over two years and I’ve never come close to putting hands on him - I’ve only even raised my voice at him once, when he made a stupid comment while drunk and hurt my feelings. Anyway, we were play fighting and he got a little rough and almost pushed on top of my sleeping two month old. He’d never do it on purpose, he loves my kids, and afterwards he cried and told me that had he hurt my kid he’d never forgive himself. Anyway, I freaked out and swung on him. 

I felt bad enough for doing that. After a couple of swings, I saw the look on his face, put my arms to my side, and told him I was done and wouldn’t move my arms from where they were. I’ve apologized a thousand times. But - and this doesn’t make it any better, I’m pointing this out bc it makes me feel even worse - I thought I didn’t actually hurt him. As I was swinging, it felt to me like I had no strength behind my swings. Today at work (we work together) he showed me his arm and he has this gigantic black and purple bruise. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. 

I’ve apologized a thousand times, but I’m pretty sure I can’t do it enough. I told him he should’ve hit me back, or at least restrained me. He’s not mad at me. He told me it was stupid of us to be roughhousing with the kids around and it was a mistake, that I was just defending my baby, but I can’t help to feel like he’s gonna just be waiting for the next time I hit him again. I just wanna love him. I feel like the worst monster in the world for hurting him. I plan to make an emergency session with my therapist this week. I just want any advice you have about what to do here. How to make it up to him, how to forgive myself, whatever you got.

And yes, I know it was wrong, and yes, I know mental illness isn’t an excuse. I feel like the worst person in the world and I deserve to."

506,Im worried about my 12 year old niece,"I am very worried about my 12 year old niece. Ever since this lockdown began, she has gone from bright and bubly and loving, to extremely quiet, exhausted and withdrawn. 

My sister and her husband also have a 5 year old and a 6 year old who take up nearly all of their attention. I get very annoyed with my sister because her and her husband still treat my niece like she is 5 years old. They are hoarders and force her to share a very small bedroom with the little ones because they have completely filled up the other bedroom with literal trash and old junk. They make them all go to bed by 730, and the little ones wake her up between 530 and 6 am every day, yet my sister does not tell them to let her sleep. My niece always seems exhausted now. They still force her to lay down for a nap with the little ones nearly every day (she usually just reads). Just so my sister can have some quiet time for 30 minutes to an hour because the constant commotion is ""just too much for her"". This makes me very angry for my niece because it is not fair to her at all. She is starting to hit puberty now but is still treated like a little child at every turn. It seems like every little thing she does, they find a reason to snap at her. 
I worry more now because I think she may be depressed and my sister wont give her any positive attention it seems like. This scares me because I was actually depressed at age 11, to the point of being suicidal. I suffered in silence for months because I was too scared to speak up, out of fear that I would be immedietIy shipped to a mental facility. I worry that she might be in the same situation as she seems on the verge of crying a lot lately and is very quiet, but my sister doesnt seem tl notice.
I want to finally unload on my sister and tell her to pay attention to her goddamned daughter for once and shoe her some love and fairness, but I dont want to ruin my relationship with my family for standing up for my niece. Im not sure I could talk to them about her without it turning into rage filled screamimg on my part. Any advice on how to handle the situation?"

508,Going crazy trying to cope with trauma while my parents try to force me to live with them??,
509,Why does therapy seem to have such a strong drive to replicate abuse?,"Yes, I know the stuff about how the *victim* might have a drive to unconsciously replicate abuse.  But my own experience of therapy was that there seemed to be an incredibly strong drive coming from the therapist's side to recreate abusive patterns.  I'd be seeing dynamics that never come up anywhere else, and in ways where attempting to deviate from them would be shot down by the therapist.  I also don't think that I was seeing therapists who were unusually bad, narcissistic, or otherwise particularly acting outside of treatment norms.  I feel like ""you just saw narcissists"" gets used as sort of an easy fallback; all the evidence in my case suggests I was seeing therapists of at least roughly average caring and competence.

Here's what I saw:

 - The first part was the heavy push to induce self-doubt.  Framing everything so that my own pain was primarily a result of my distorted perception.  With therapy, this wasn't really justified so much as just sort of taken as an axiom that had to be accepted in order for treatment to proceed.  In both the abuse at home and in therapy, there was a lot of talk about how it was normal and even healthy to feel a certain way, but it was important to not be guided by our feelings or acting on them.  In both cases as well I think that ultimately this ended up simply dismissing heavy components of abuse; effectively it meant that anything that didn't do lasting physical damage was acceptable (possibly with the exception of overt sexual abuse or very obvious name-calling).  If I was genuinely distressed by anything else that was my problem.

 - Presenting the parent/therapist as the one with the objective viewpoint in contrast to mine as a child/mentally ill person.  Combining this with often very biased evidence collection techniques; e.g. going out of their way to search for one or two examples where what I said wasn't true as evidence that it wasn't true at all and I was just acting on emotions.  Pushing reasons why things that the parent/therapist didn't agree with were false while praising things that did agree and discouraging examining them.

 - Playing word games where we'd spend a lot of time critiquing or adjusting how I said things, without ever really addressing the point.  In particular downplaying any concern I didn't fully know how to explain or treating it as the most mild possible version; treating objections to this as just emotional or frustration at feeling like I wasn't being heard as evidence of my own emotional biases.  I think in therapy this is how the more overt cases of prior childhood abuse never came up: I didn't know how to put them into words very well and the therapists would typically push me to accept more normal-sounding versions of what I was trying to say as the unbiased story and treat my not wanting to accept it as an emotional reaction.

 - Very frequent use of ""you'll have to figure that out"" or ""you can't make progress if you won't try"" or similar ways of shifting the burden of not actually getting anywhere to me.  Insistence that I wasn't putting out effort no matter what I said; frequent rephrasing and downplaying of extreme emotions into milder forms.  In therapy this often took the particular form of reframing serious mental health fallout from sessions as minor unavoidable discomfort.  From my parent and therapists both, insisting also that when I said I couldn't cope with the expectations that it would be impossible for me to ever get anywhere if I wasn't willing to do the difficult parts.

 - Treating any anger or frustration at the parent/therapist as some sort of problem with me, without ever considering whether it could be legitimate.  Treating concerns about what was going on as simply resulting from emotions; in therapy responding to specific questions about technique or progress with general reassurances.  Continually redirecting questions or concerns about the relationship and the parent's or therapist's behavior to be questions solely about me and my reactions.

**Again, I have no particular reason to believe the therapists I saw were narcissistic or unusually incompetent.**  But across a number of different therapists these seem to have been very consistent patterns.  And many of these I see no particular way I could be coming up with the dynamic on my own or radically misinterpreting. It seems far more likely that the therapists I saw were simply stuck on seeing me as a kid from a good family who was struggling with depression or anxiety, and that the treatment environment was reinforcing this view.  There was never really any interest in why that was or even really any comprehension that that might be a worthwhile question; the idea that I had a mental illness was sort of treated as a complete explanation for my own actions such that it would be pointless to ask why any further.

I fully believe these therapists both intended to help me and believe they were helping.  And yet the effect on me was like being put repeatedly through an abusive relationship, without them ever seeming to be able to even comprehend that I might be being legitimately harmed.  Why does this happen?"
510,For anybody that needs to hear it,"  

everyone wants to understand you

when you’re comfortable

take the time you need"
511,im not entirely sure what’s wrong with me.,"basically its been like this since i was younger. everything has to be equal or even. 

when i walk, the number of steps i do on each leg has to be equal, when i step over/on a crack with one leg i have to do the same with the other.

if i’m watching tv, the volume has to be a multiple of two, but it cant:
1: end in a zero
2: be two numbers consectively (22,44,66,88 etc)
3: have the number 7 in it.

when i crack my knuckles on my hands, they have to be in the same order and in the same way, (like if i crack my middle finger backwards on my right hand, i have to do the same to my left.)

and probably the weirdest thing, is when i eat, how i chew must be equal. like, i chew on my right side, then my left, then my left again, then my right, then my right again, then my left. 
this sounds completely crazy, i am aware. it just doesnt really make sense when i talk about it, but in my mind there is a reason that i just cant really explain?

anyway, i’ve thought that it might be ocd, but a lot of people just kinda throw that term around and i dont wanna do that. and also it really isnt that bad compared to cases of ocd that i’ve seen or heard about, so i dont think that’s what it is.

i know i probably come off as completely crazy, but oh well. this was i guess just a vent thing? i definitely cant say any of this in real life, i wouldn’t even know how to explain it if i’m being honest. this is the first time i’ve ever really tried to put it all into words."
512,Outpatient hospitalization cost?,"my depression has been bad and I am enrolled in a partial hospitalization program which is outpatient. I was told by the hospital that my insurance approved but I would never told exactly the cost and I cannot get a hold of Aetna right now right now and it is on my mind.

So I was wondering if anyone here has Aetna And knows how much it covers outpatient hospitalization?

This is one of those 9 to 3 p.m. type of deals Monday through Friday."
513,Is this an unforeseen knock on of a past suicidal mindset?,"Long story short, ages 14-15 I was severely depressed and contemplated suicide most days (both ironically and un-ironically) I never attempted anything though thankfully. As well as this, I'm a very in the present kind of person, so haven't done a lot of future planning (like I'm a second year student now and still can't believe I'm at university). However, recently during an anxiety fuelled introspection session I equated this to being almost like I've lived past my expiry date and now don't know what to do with myself. This realisation has stuck with me and I'm not sure if it's the truth or just overthought nonsense.

Is this a common feeling between people of similar backgrounds?"
514,Yay! Finally:),Second day on celexa and I went from and all time low to an all time high. I’m worried though because I’m going on 38 hours no sleep and I still feel happy. Ive got a lot more done the past day and a half ish then I have the past 2 months. Only bad side affect is my mind is racing a million miles and hour but that might be because I have smoked weed. Not sure but if this is normal then fuck ya dude.
515,Weird feeling?,"For context, I've been told by school counselor I have Major Depressive Disorder. 

Sometimes I feel this weird feeling in my chest and  I've gotten these thoughts from like a different thing that tells me ""Go kill yourself"" ""You are worthless,"" etc. And now it tells me that I'm dead. like it'll be thought like ""\_\_\_\_ is dead."" (\_\_\_\_\_ stands for my name) And that thought will repeat that over and over and over until I start crying and shaking and begging \_\_\_\_\_ not to do it. And I'll get the imagery of myself hanging myself or jumping off a roof or slitting my wrists or something.  I can't sleep very well anymore and it's like this thing is in my chest trying to get out and take over me. 

Yeah, it's confusing. 

I just don't know what it is...

I just feel empty and sad and lost. Like I'm walking through a fog. 

My parents do not believe in mental issues and are prejudiced against people who have them. School counselor recently did something that tore me apart from her so I've stopped seeing her. 

Just I don't know what to do."
516,Is there anyone I can talk to besides a therapist?,I am sick of wasting $100 for a session of therapy but I am in desperate need to talk to someone face to face.
517,Admitted to my mother that I have a severe substance abuse problem [m18],"Just admitted to my mother that I have a substance abuse problem, she knows I use benzos for my anxiety (and recreationally). What she didn't know is that I'll take anything and everything to numb the daily pain, maybe you guys can relate. I just don't know what to do about it, if I found a 80mg oxy on the ground I'd swallow it in a heartbeat (or any opiate for that matter) and I know that is SERIOUSLY dangerous behavior, I just don't value my life. Just wondering, how many of you have come out to your loved ones as having a substance abuse disorder and how did it go?"
518,Don't be surprised when I'm homeless addicted to herion.,"I've accepted that this Is my fate. I don't care. Nothing phrases me, how could something phase me when this doesn't even phase me. I'm my own worst enemy. I take pleasure in being this. The world already wants me to be this way, why not just accept it and turn it to somewhat of a positive? I'm too stubborn for my own and I love that. I wish bad things upon me so I can have an excuse to feel this way."
519,"I'm actually, happy",Can't quite explain why. But it's incredible! Everything's worth it.
520,Drifting,"I really feel like I’m drifting through life. And the only way i can explain it is because i don’t think enough. I feel so unaware and void of thought (especially of my surroundings) that time just passes me by. I feel as though I’ve always been like this too since i can hardly remember my childhood or even the past few years. I’m pretty sure quarantine has made it worse not to mention school work and lack of motivation. 

Another weird thing regarding my surroundings is that fact that my room is a mess and it doesn’t really phase me. I’m only really aware of the side my bed is on and everything I’m completely blind to and i don’t even really notice. I don’t know it’s just sorta weird how passive i am to everything.. also not really sure if this is mental health but i figure someone can relate"
521,I absolutely despise my parents (F17),"I really didn't know where else to post this without fear of being ridiculed. I hate my parents. I know, that's a very stereotypical thing for a teenager to say. But this is different. I have a step father, whom I consider nothing more than my mom's husband. We have no relationship at all and haven't done anything together since I was 11. My other siblings hate him too, but I was the only one who had anything close to a father-daughter relationship with him. I've completely stopped talking to my mom. We live in the same house, yet I don't exchange any words with her at all. Sometimes I'll lie about what I'm even doing so I don't have to have a conversation with her. She comes into my room and I'm laying in my bed in the dark, and asks if I'm okay. I respond either with nothing at all or something snappy. I don't even look at her. You think, what could my parents could have possibly done? I don't have an answer. I don't know. I recently tried to express to my mother that I'm afraid that I'm suffering from depression, and she didn't believe me. I asked if we could try to get me on antidepressants, and she refused. She said I just needed to go outside more. This further drove me away from her. This has been going on for over three years. I haven't hugged my mom since I was around 13. I am not posting this to ask for pity, or excuses for how I am. I know what I am doing is terrible and heartbreaking. But most of the time I just don't even care anymore. I don't expect any nice comments at all, but you're welcome to express whatever opinion you can't hold back. I am simply asking if what this is is a symptom of depression. Because at this point, I don't have any answers for myself anymore."
522,What do I do if I can’t get a real diagnosis?,"I think that I might have mental illnesses, which wouldn’t be surprising because my parent has a lot of mental health issues. However, right now I can’t get I diagnosis, so what should I do?"
523,I feel.something wrong with me but I can't identify,"I can't sleep, it's been 3 days since I have slept for around 1-2 hr only, and for some traumatic reason I am now seeing out things which are not there from day 1. I usually sleep for 3-4 hr per day and be fresh and go for 2 works. But due to lockdown, I am not able to.follow my schedule and being alone is making it worst. I am seeing dead people around my home or it's just my brain who is making me see things.
I am sort of science person, who don't believe in ghost or paranormal things, wo I am kinda curious if there is.sort of problem I am going through.
Also, while I am working, today its almost I teleported in time, I started working, a simulation process I started which usually take around 2-3 hrs, and just right after starting I noticed it was completed in 15 min. While I was sitting. Also when I was boiling water for coffee, I skipped up and the water was all burn up and gone. I was pretty scared that time. Can anyone help me with my problem as I can't go out and there is plenty of free time left for me to understand and overcome .... 🙂"
524,i have obsessive thoughts frequently and i can't organize them in my head,"i feel like i've always had this problem but  this year it has become more intense and frequent, i don't know what it is excatly and why is it happening, like i would be doing a normal thing like studying or watching something or whatever and then a thought hits me and i obsess about it in my head four like hours and then when that thought is clear in my head i'm normal again then another comes and the cycle starts again, its not like i'm always like this during the day, i get things done, i talk with friends and hang out with them and stuff but when the thoughts come to me i have to isolate myself so i can think about them. But now with Covid-19 and this quarantine it has become worse than before, now i'm always like this, the only thing that i do during the day is online classes and studying otherwise i would be obsessing about the thoughts in my head, i cant enjoy anything, i cant read books (which was my favorite to do) i cant play music and, i cant watch movies and, even the simple things like scrolling through reddit get these thoughts started, before quarantine the way i used to deal with these obsessive thoughts is that i would make social interactions and because i'm an introvert those social interactions would take all my focus and energy so that would help divert my attention from these thoughts but now i cant do that anymore, also because i have commitment issues with people i don't really have friends, i have only acquaintances and it's really weird to text or call someone you barely know, i don't know really know what to do, i feel like i'm a prisoner to my own thoughts, i was planning to seek medical help for this but i'm scared to do that because of  my family's judgment on that they would say that i'm not the only who has  with mental issues i already know that"
525,Nocturnal panic attacks ruining my life!,"Hi! I have suffered from anxiety and panic attacks for a long time now including nocturnal panic attacks. It was way less before and they even stopped for a little while, but now they’re back. As I’m falling asleep I wake up panicking and feeling super unreal/detached so I involuntarily start scratching my face to “feel real” as I can feel the scratches burning. I went to therapy and I can control my anxiety and panic attacks during the day, but when I have to go to sleep at any time of the day (I’ve always avoided taking naps due to this reason, I can’t sleep when it’s bright outside anyway it gives me anxiety). I have no idea what to do! I’m so tired and sleepless, I just wanna sleep in peace. I feel so alone. :("
526,Not feeling myself,"Back in November of 2019, my anxiety and depression and OCD were stronger than they ever had been. I went to the ER 3 days in a row before I finally accepted help. I knew I needed serious help, but everytime I went to the ER, they would give me ativan while I waited for a psych evaluation. Both times I waited about 8 hours with no updates all day.  Usually the ativan would supress the symptoms, and I would request to just be sent home at the end. This happened 2 days in a row. The third day I finally accepted help, but only because they threatened to hold me involuntarily. It took me about 5 seconds to volunteer, as that was obviously the better route because I would have way more say in my treatment.
They prescribed me 2.5 mg of Zyprexa for my anxiety, depression and mood swings. That medication changed me for the better literally over night after the first dose alone. For the first time ever, I actually had an internal monologue (which I honest to God did not know was a thing). My thoughts didnt feel so clouded anymore, and I felt way more in control of my emotions and how I handled them. I was only there for 2 and a half days before I was allowed to go home since I showed improvement so fast. The zyprexa worked for a few months. The fabled magic cure was finally in my hands. However, after a few months, I began to feel as if I was slipping again. My thoughts feel way more clouded now and Ive totally lost my internal monologue. This scares me very much, because I no longer feel normal at all. To make matters worse, I feel very disconnected from everything. To try to put it as best as I can, I dont feel as if Im really in my own body, but I do at the same time. Ive never had any psychosis or breaks from reality, but I dont feel connected to the world. Its almost as though Im observing life through a pane of glass, unable to truly feel connected to anything. I still feel emotions, but I dont feel grounded or connected to anybody or anything. I feel so alone because I know I should be able to connect with people and the world around me, but I feel like I have lost this ability all together. My psychiatrist is not seeing anybody right now due to the lockdown, so Im not sure what to do. My anxiety, panic attacks and ocd have come back, but luckily depression has not reared its ugly head yet. Im very worried I could go right back to square one.

Any advice or similar experiences from anybody else?"
527,Disengagement/Detachment,"I've feel this for years. I don't feel strong passion about things or people. I rarely fully engaged in work, game, party, even in a competitive sports game. I feel like a bystander, outsider or observer. I'm doing a descent job for living; but I don't feel much passion. I'm in just for money; all I think about is early retirement. I don't know what I will do after retirement. I smile/flirt in parties just to be descent and polite. I feel some fun but not 100%. I used to seek excitement in adventuring, dating and sex. but as I've done more, these lost the excitement. Most of the time, I feel some tiresome mentally and bland.

How to feel the fun and excitement in daily life? How to find passion in life?"
528,Unanswered Questions,"Now i dont know whats really going on with me. Or maybe its just late night thoughts. but truthfully i dont understand myself. Like why i do things without any meaning, why i act like i love when really i dont, why i act like id be there for someone when im really not, why do i act like i care when i really dont. i literally dont understand myself, now dont misunderstand me i had or did have them type of feelings/reactions at some point in my life but at times it feels like my heart becomes frozen and i become immune to all of this. The love i get from people such as family members i just brush it off like it dont mean shit, but then out of the blues i feel like as if i dont exist to them. Then when its starts to hurt and i go back to the miserable person. Its like i become my own monster. One minute id like to do something with my friends or family then the next time it comes around i become agitated or frustrated which puts me in my own isolation for a couple of months. But im doing my normal activities like its normal. Always had this good thing about me is that i do things independently and i am capable of doing things by myself. But then i dont know? Its like im living two different lives but in one body. The funny thing is, im writing this out, pouring out enough informtion from my heart/feeling. But guaranteed the next morning ill wake up like shit never really happened, and im this stone cold person that just gets on with his buisness without any affection, care in the world. To be honest i dont even know what i am anymore,i dont even know what you would call what i am, just one emotionless stone cold kid tbh. Shit, even ive accepted it. I remember i used to get called a nickname that resembles a ghost, because i was seen once then never again, it stuck to me, and i act like thats the name i was born with, like im proud of it. What am I doing, what am I trying to achieve, who am I trying to be? I act like it's all okay but really it's not, so many unanswered questions yet not a single answer found, it's really sad tbh 
 I felt this was somewhat of a suitable place to put by because truthfully i dont have any friends or anyone i can really pour my heart out too because at the end who'd be there to really listen to my story? So i decided to post on here. Anonymous as i can be while maintaining whatever i have left. Thank you."
529,"Rant~~ I feel like nothing I say has value and will get negative responses, so I stopped talking for 20 years","I was a very outgoing child, and was really outspoken. Around age 8 I started learning that girls werent supposed to be outspoken and outgoing. I got a lot of negative reaponsew from friends and family, saying i was too loud or just stupid. So I stopped talking. I didn't participate in sports or class, stopped trying to make friends, now I can't get through the day without having at least 10 negative self talks or when I do talk to a stranger I replay over and over what I said in my head and tell myself I'm awkward and shouldn't talk to prople anymore. Over the past 20 years I now get criticized for being too quiet. I feel like I can't win. I know that having opinions may conflict wirh others' and talking to people won't always go great, but I'm at such a loss now that even getting downvoted on Reddit makes me want to just disassociate even more and crawl into a hole. Thanks for listening."
530,Even when I'm happy the suicidal thoughts never seem to go away?,"Been on and off over the years and have gotten quite a handle on mental health/how my mind works. But I'm slowly coming to believe that no matter how relaxed and collected I feel the thoughts of killing myself are always there? Wondering if anyone else feels this way. 

Today I was on the deck and everything was perfect, the sun was shining and I had a cold beer in my hand, but I close my eyes and I still see suicide as the ultimate thing I want. Even though I have everything I could ever need. Maybe the depression and anxiety comes from this and not vice versa? 

I feel pretty normal, but when I actually think about it, everything is actually kinda fucked."
531,Any advice?,"So, I have been really struggling with my mental health lately and I feel so incredibly heavy and dark. I have really bad anxiety and depression. I can't eat without getting sick, my stomach hurts. I feel like I am robbing my kids of their mom and I feel utterly hopeless. My family thinks it's a young person thing so they don't care to understand. I don't know what to do. How do you deal with it? What is something that changed your life for the better? 
I just want to feel better because I feel like I'm failing everyone in my family."
532,Abuse,"I have a question. 
If I have grown up with a physical abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, and shaming. How badly do you think my mental state will be with either my love life or myself... When I've grown into a full developed adult? 
Only asking because I want to get treatment or anything as soon as possible. Thanks in advance."
533,Mother.,"So, for starters, I'm currently in a long distance relationship and have been for 3 months now, and all this time I obviously wasn't telling my mother, however, recently during yet another argument with her she ended up finding out about my sh scars, which I never wanted her to know of (she is possibly the main cause of my harming problem) which then followed up with a long conversation about my mental health, where I ended up lying (more like masking the truth) about my so called female ""friend"" whom I met on social media and have been talking to for around 2 months, and how she really helped me and explained to me what the root of a lot of my problems is and how I can try to deal with them before getting proper treatment (which I have been denied by my mother multiple times) and for anyone who might be wondering, no , I can't tell her that its actually my boyfriend we're talking about here, and not because she won't accept it, maybe mostly because the woman gives me zero to no privacy and right to my own personal time/space, and gets extremely mad and defensive when I ask her to leave me alone or let me have my room to myself, and in that case she wouldn't change her behavior even if I told her I have a boyfriend who I'm trying to spend time with. Going forward to yesterday (and technically today too) in the middle of a COMPLETELY UNRELATED ARGUMENT, she let her overly narcissistic side take over, called me a bitch because I spend ""more"" time with this ""friend"" of mine than her, and for obvious reasons because shes clearly a stuck up bitch, and today when I was trying to watch a movie with him and she kept going into my room, talking about crap I don't care about, while there's a person on call with me and we are watching something together, and when, after I let her do that for about 15 minutes and getting both of us pissed, I kindly tell her that I am watching something with my friend, her reply: oH i aM SO soRry fOR iNteRRuPtiNg yOu TWo, I cAnt eVEn ComE in TO Say anYthiNg nOw SinCE I Am bEInG So bOTheRSomE, fUck yOU stUcK up BRat"" and being a bitch to me yet again. Moral of the story, I have no clue how to deal with her, I have been suffering with her like this for a good couple of years now, and even then it doesnt clean up the fact that she did some horrible and selfish things that ended up hurting me in the end all throughout my life, I have a bunch of undiagnosed mental problems, and can't get help even after she found out that I harm, and I have no fucking idea how I'm supposed to stand this type of thing for another couple of years before I could at least move or leave the  country."
534,Mentally destroyed from parents,"So some background information. My parents recently basically told me I’m dumb along with my grandparents for choosing a lower ranked state school over a good state school. They eventually forced me into choosing the good state school. (This is barely part of it). Then I complained for these past few weeks telling them I hate it, and they are screaming at me I made the choice. Whenever I complain my mom cries and both her and my dad call me asshole and my mom says I’m killing her because of the stress she already has on her from her dad dying. Then in any argument I have she does the same thing, cries at me and tells me she’s gonna die cause of me and my dad calls me an asshole. I also have 2 sisters both in college, who got to choose their colleges and got to go out of state paid for. Makes no sense to me. I feel like a pure asshole and piece of shit but I know they aren’t treating me right... unless I’m wrong and that’s why my mom is threatening to move out and stuff"
535,Can you have bipolar disorder/bipolar depression and just depression?,"I know I should go to my therapist first but anxiety sucks and I just wanna know what to look for to tel the difference, ive been diagnosed with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while and I know for sure I have that but the more I think about it the more it makes sense but I don’t want to self diagnose and get into a bubble so I... I just need some help"
536,Does anyone ever feel like your loved ones are the ones that seem to prevent you from getting better?,"This year I’ve opened up to people more than I have in my entire life regarding my mental health. At first it was very nice, it felt like people truly seemed to care about my well being and genuinely wanted me to get better. But it’s been quite some time, and with the motivation I got from my friends and family, I’ve been trying very hard to get better, but at one point I realized that I had also grown very dependant on the attention that they give me. So with this realization, I managed to fight this urge to constantly seek for attention from the people around me, and for a while I actually thought I was getting better, and I felt very driven and independant.

However, every time I try to become better, everyone now treats me as if I’m sick or something, and that makes me pretty sad. They constantly remind me of my problems when I try so hard to forget about them, and even when I feel normal they basically feed my ego and try to sympathize with my pain that I had almost forgotten which causes me to fall back into this “comfort” zone of being depressed 

For instance, every time I go outside for a walk or whatever, my brother constantly calls me and texts me asking if I’m okay and where i am, and then he always says things like “don’t do anything stupid” or “don’t hurt yourself” as if I’m on suicide watch... and whenever i find motivation to get out of my room to eat my parents always nag at me for being unhealthy, and just a lot more. 

Even when i say things are fine they are very skeptical of what i say."
537,How do you move on?,"In a three-week span, I broke up with the guy I thought I’d be with forever and lost my entire friend group. Everything on campus reminds me of him. And I’m finding it really hard to make new habits to fill up my free time because I don’t have friends anymore and I’m having a lot of trouble making new friends. I’ve tried joining new clubs but it hasn’t helped. It’s been almost four months and I’m no better than I was when it first happened. I have one more year of school. How do I move on from my ex while everything surrounding me reminds me of him and I can’t distract myself into being happy?"
538,Anxiety during pandemic,Hi everyone. So ever since this whole pandemic thing started I noticed I was having some anxiety mostly when it’s time for me to go to sleep. I live at home with my family . One of four siblings unfortunately. Yes I said it. I’ve had to work from home which means I’ve been surrounded by family alllllll the time and I honestly hate it. I’m in my late 20s. I’m still living at home so that I can save and get my own spot which I cannot wait to do. I find myself having to do breathing exercises and other things to distract myself . I’m just tryna figure out if this is anxiety is normal during this time we are in. That’s all . Thanks !
539,The worst part about a depressive episode,"Lately, I’ve been crying for what seems like no reason. Crying after sex, over stupid remarks from my boyfriend that I know full well are just jokes, small criticisms, the littlest thing makes my heart feel like it’s breaking. My boyfriend is starting to get worried, and I mean... maybe he’s right to be. I’ve been thinking about death a lot lately. Not that I want to die, at least I don’t think I do. I miss being happy. I want to fix myself and get better but I don’t know what’s broken, and with everything shut down I can’t go talk to anyone. I feel so lost and alone and it’s causing problems in my everyday life. Any advice on coping skills for the time being?"
540,Scared of someone for no reason,"I have a weird fear of my dad. He hasn't done anything to hurt or scare me at all, but whenever i'm around him I feel like the world is closing in on me. It's like there is always an impending sense of doom. Like I'm also paranoid he is going to do ""something""  I have a irrational fear that he is going to rape or hurt me in someway. It is horrible because I used to have such a good relationship with my dad. It's hard to describe how it feels. I just want to run away when he gets close. I cant even touch anything he has touched without freaking out. I was hooping someone could help me."
541,Can someone talk to me right now?,I'm having alot of feelings but I'm completely alone and need to talk to someone to sort out what I have to do.
542,Starting to struggle,"I'm getting quite paranoid and freaking myself out that there are things I cant see, it feels very real and I'm struggling to sleep because I have to have my full body covered incase something touches me but it gets too hot and I'm really struggling and dont know what to do"
543,Confusing Forced Regression..,"I don’t post really on Reddit but I need help or answers or comfort or something. Am confused. Also don’t know how to do trigger warnings on here so..

What does it mean when 
I had a time in April sometime when I think I was anxiety or maybe after an argument I don’t remember and my brain tried to force me into little space but immediately after/before it got remotely close to full little it forced me out and then it did it like 2 or 3 more times. I didn’t know what to do or how to stop or why I couldn’t regress proper. Or why it was forcing it on me and stopping. It make my head hurt and lost."
544,tips on finding a therapist that'll work for me?,i'm looking to start therapy here soon. i definitely need it but don't really know where to start because i already know i'm extremely picky when it comes to the type of people i will open up to. anyone have tips on how to find therapists that might be a good fit for me? i live in the united states if that makes any difference as far as resources i can use
545,Have you ever noticed that people who say “you can call me anytime if you need help” are surprised when you call at 2:30 AM after it’s actually gotten bad enough to reach out to someone? And they always only have two pieces of advice. Go back to sleep...or call 911.,"I can’t tell you how many times I’ve tried reaching out to people close to me only to be made to feel like my pain is an inconvenience to them.  Especially right now, with the COVID situation everyone is stressed out and frustrated.  I’ve been having a really hard 6 weeks now and It is so frustrating to try and talk to my sister or my close friends about the level of care I feel I need and feel them get upset with me because they are stressed about their own COVID situation. 

It’s like in order to be heard I have to force myself to lose focus explaining that I need to find a good psychiatrist &amp; psychologist while I let them tell me their tales of woe too.  And then I get nowhere 

I’ve been mentally ill for years and NEVER gotten adequate treatment, just quacks who want to put me on lithium"
546,Do you think my girlfriend has a mental illness? Why does she act like this?,"
I’m 19. My girlfriend is 21. We’ve been together since I was 13 and she was 15. Neither of us go to college. I actually am in a band. When the quarantine is over we are going to try and make it big. My girlfriend can’t keep a job for more than 2 months. She has a lot of drama with coworkers and gets fired. We live with her parents. We moved into an apartment last year for maybe 3 months but couldn’t afford rent so we moved in with her parents since mine wouldn’t let us. Her parents don’t mind me and they both make a lot of money. I do have a part time job and work right now though, so I can help pay some bills. 

My girlfriend also doesn’t have any friends. She just has me. She had this one friend who was on and off for months but they were really never good friends and fought a lot. High school/ middle school was rough for her since a lot of girls were jealous of her (she’s extremely attractive) so they bullied her and there was drama everywhere she went. She’s pretty socially awkward tbh. 

When we have sex, we have our clothes on because she’s too embarrassed to get fully naked. We have sex in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping. We don’t have sex that often. Only when she wants it which is usually when she’s ovulating. She will start giving me sex eyes and becoming flirtier with me and will actually want to be around me more. If I’m in the mood and she’s not she will tell me to go jack off. It kinda sucks. We do sleep together every night and cuddle. But I’m lucky if I get laid even once a week, unless it’s ovulation week because she’s all on me then. 

Her parents argue and fight a lot usually multiple times a day and are pretty toxic people to live with. I really would like to move out on our own because I hate seeing her so angry and stressed out because of her parents. I just can’t afford it at the moment. 

I love her but I would like her to be more affectionate towards me other than ovulation time. I mean she’s not mean but she’s pretty distant and does her own thing and doesn’t even ask me if I want to join in. Like playing video games, or broadcasting on Instagram, or taking the dogs for walks. She also will only make food for herself. She can also be kinda rude when joking with me. She says she loves me and I love her but she’s not very affectionate. In public, all the other couples want to hold hands and she never does. She walks ahead a lot. 

Her room is also a pigsty. Clothes and garbage everywhere. Her hygiene isn’t that great, either. I have talked to her about this and she says she will change but never does. I’ve cleaned it for her and she gave me sex in return but it goes back to being messy. 

We never yell or argue with eachother. 

Sometimes when we listen to r&amp;b love songs, she gets embarrassed as if another person is in the room and won’t look me in the eye while singing the lyrics, or she gets super embarrassed and giggly of lyrics talking about sex. Like an immature 12 year old. She also still has her stuffed animals from when she was a kid."
547,I hate myself but I don't want to admit why,"I know everyone has problems and can often cope with them or realize what their problems are, but I don't really know what my problems are with myself.

I have a lot of social anxiety, some form of depression, and an eating disorder because of how my mother raised me. Of course I have a lot of resentment towards her, but I feel like I genuinely hate myself instead of her. My dad was absent since he worked 7AM-7PM to support the family while my mom stayed at home with my brother and me. She's always preferred him since he was both older and biologically male, not to mention religious like her. I, on the other hand, was younger, gender non-conforming, and an atheist. She did have the liberty of kicking my dad out and divorcing him in 2018, followed by me in 2019. Needless to say, I fully understand my issues with her.

I guess my problems are more with myself. I didn't eat a meal for over four years and thrived off of self-harm until I was able to get my license, my first job, and tattoos. I went from being underweight and weak to average and muscular but I feel worse mentally now. I don't want to eat anymore but I still eat. I know I need to eat but I don't want to. I also want to self harm but I've replaced that with personal tattoos as a way to cope, but with COVID, all of the shops are closed and I've been struggling heavily. I've been struggling the most with my identity and acceptance, though. I really hate myself for being transgender but I don't hate other transgender people. I feel as if I'm disingenuous with strangers by presenting as the opposite of my birth certificate, driver's license, and other legal documents. If my mother was disgusted with my preferences then I should be as well. We're taught that our mother is always right, so why should I disagree with this if so many other people I've met throughout my life also agree with her?

I don't have any friends other than my significant other, who isn't particularly comfortable when I talk about my mental health. He doesn't like the way I talk about or view myself so I've learned to keep it all in or vent through artwork when I have motivation and alone time. He often spends time talking to his friends or hanging out with our neighbours, which I'm starting to become jealous of although I don't feel jealousy often in my life. I'm not jealous of the people he's around but I wish I could comfortably talk to strangers and acquaintances like he does. He, too, has social anxiety but mine keeps me from a normal lifestyle. I won't go out in public unless necessary or leave my bedroom if I'm not going to the bathroom. Granted my mental health fluctuates heavily within hours, days, or months depending on the dive I'm in. Sometimes I feel comfortable going out in public and forget I ever experience anxiety, but it's quite random when I hit that high or drop out of it. I only notice it when I'm back down again.

So, I guess I'm asking for advice or some form of relatability or understanding. My apologies for babbling and **thank you** for reading this far. I have to admit this felt kind of therapeutic to write.

\-

After reading through this, it's pretty clear that I'm uncomfortable with my identity. I don't like being different, and I just want to be normal. I don't know how to be normal, though, and that's likely my issue with myself.

\-

**TL;DR** \- I vented unintentionally and I hate myself because I'm uncomfortable with my identity and past. Any advice or stories you have are appreciated."
548,I feel so guilty about the way I treat my parents even though they are extremely toxic,"So basically to start off, my mom lied to my dad about being pregnant with me until it was too late to get an abortion so she can get that $$$$. My dad is a pretty crappy parent too though, he never wanted to be a parent though to be fair. 

(scroll down to the actual point of this rant... i put in all caps THE REASON IM WRITING THIS ! most of this is just me ranting about the abuse i went through) 

I’ve spent a lot of my life feeing like one big burden after my grandma told me this about my mom. My dad used to beat me as a kid and has ALWAYS accused me of lying. Probably projecting because my mom is a huge liar. Like one time he thought that I took one of his important papers so he beat me unconscious and I was only 4 years old. He later realized that he lost it himself and I wasn’t lying to him. 

They got divorced when i was 7 and my mom took me in and we lived w my grandma. My mom HATES my grandma (her mom) and was jumping on every dude so that she could move out. One of those men was a pedophile and assaulted me multiple times. He would constantly finger me when my mom wasn’t around and tell me to take off my clothes and take pictures of me and made me promise not to tell my mom or he wouldn’t let me play with his dog anymore. As an EIGHT year old this was a big deal. Eventually she broke up with him because turns out he was a registered sex offender (shocker). 

Her next boyfriend was the one we moved in with. Him and my mom forced me to go into fencing. He would hit me with the epée (the sword i used) if I did something wrong from time to time. He would also publicly embarrass me in group lessons. He once told my whole class that my bird died and I should use that emotion to be a better student. 

After A TON of abuse over like 5 years from this man. One night when I was 13 I asked him if my friend could sleepover. He said no, which would’ve been fine if he didn’t proceed to try and slam my fingers in between the door in an attempt to break them and my friend saw, called her mom and made me live w her until my dad took me in. Over the years CPS was called but my mom made me lie and tell them everything was fine if i didn’t want her to go to jail and never see her again. As a 13 y o this scared me. 

I moved in w my dad, he didn’t beat anymore me but constantly verbally abused me and called me stupid over grades like a 90 or bellow. I was never good enough for him. Even if i left a spot on the floor after cleaning it would lecture me about how incompetent i was. Y’all get the point. 

After all this, my mom told me that she’ll move into an apartment w me w/out her boyfriend (she was still dating him but just didn’t live w him) and since i was so sick of my dad putting me down, I jumped at the idea. 

Hahah that was a HUGE mistake. I quickly realized that my mom was not fit to be responsible for rent. She got a job working for Amazon and got fired because she wasn’t physically competent to work and would often pass out. I found out my mom had A LOT of health issues. 

I wasn’t able to go to school because I had to take care of her all the time. Sometimes she’d be out and she wouldn’t even come home. I missed 68 days my sophomore year and 46 days my junior year. I went from a 4.1 GPA to a 3.4 on a 5.0 scale. 

I had to also work all the time to help with rent. I’d be working almost 50 hours a week as a 16 year old kid. SUUPPEER ILLEGAL but i had to do it to keep the house. I even had a suicide attempt and they had to pump my stomach. eventually by my senior year i couldn’t do it anymore and moved back in with my dad. I had completely given up w school at that point and just screwed around my whole junior year and did some risky shit. 

THE POINT OF THIS RANT 
I developed PTSD and still hear my step dad’s voice and i used to have regular panic attacks. My senior year when it was memorial day weekend my mom and her boyfriend took me camping. Once again her boyfriend and his friend tried to attack me. My boyfriend was there and recorded the whole incident (the audio) and he wanted to go to the police. 

I told my mom it was either me or him. She chose him. Then she pretended to be in the hospital over the position i put her in. She was at home the whole time and made my family demonize me. Then when we all figured out she was lying she threatened to kill herself. 

My dad, after the way he treated me, victimizes himself and tells everyone that i’m a disrespectful daughter. He doesn’t even have a picture of me in the house. He has his cat on the refrigerator and not me. I moved out to live w my boyfriend and he said “i’ve betrayed him” 

At this point i barely speak to either parent and they make me feel SO BAD ABOUT IT. I cry about it often because i really don’t want to talk to them or see them but I feel guilty because after all they’re still my parents."
549,Having a panic attack about having a panic attack.,"Does anyone know if virtual visits can refill psych medications? My Clonazepam is due for a refill tomorrow and I am in a different city than my doctor (left LA to stay with family in San Diego) and I’m supposed to take it every day. 
I’m panicking about the potential of panicking even more."
550,Abuse?,"So, I'm in midst of separation from my 15 yr relationship, we have a 13 and a 6 yr old. My 6 yr old is autistic (she speaks like  a 2 yr old and my 13yr old son  has adhd and anxiety) Uuuumm.... fuuuuuu*k this is hard to type! He basically took my son and said it's because we cannot get along with me because he us a teenage boy, yet my autistic 6 yr old is with me. I was just diagnosed with Corona 4 days ago. I know both my kids had it in jan/February but the tests weren't out. Anyway, they are fine, I am sick as all hell and  even though he moved 3 blocks away in October, I cant visit or even talk to him. Do I have rights as a mom? Lawyers are closed (I'm in NJ) so I dont know who to ask. My daughter is happy and loving home school (not me) lol, and just pure beautiful lightness...

With schools closed my son LIVES being ho.e all day to play video games at his fathers with out his autistic sister coming in his room or me raising him. I just need ANY tips whatsoever! Thanks in advance!"
551,Any advice for going back to school to finish my degree?,
552,I don't know what is going on in my head.,"Hiya, so alittle baskstory/""important"" information that may help with this

I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and deppression and I have been on Prozaic for almost 2 years now. (Deppression is a constant battle but my anxiety has improved)

My traumatic events include self harm when I was a young teen and multiple severe anxiety attacks, one where I passed out, and being raised in a household where I made to feel worthless.

So for alittle over 3 months now it's like inside my head there is a constant arguement over everything. Whether it's what I should do or what I should say it's like I can't come to a consensus of what I should do. Lately it's been getting very bad, to the point I sat for 10 minutes starring blankly at a wall ""listening"" to it in my head over if I should text this person or not. Is this just a normal thing that happens or is there genuinely a underlying illness that is effecting me because I don't feel normal when I cry over the things in my head makeing me feel like I'm makeing the wrong choice. (Ps my subconscious and these voices/beings are different, I am my subconscious the voices are different)

[I can't go to a doctor for this because my family's budget can't handle it and covid also isn't helping.]"
553,Crisis lines are bs,"My boyfriend told me he’d call me when he got home, then later texted me that he got “in a predicament” and that he’ll talk to me tomorrow. I asked if he was safe and he said “kinda” and that he’d text me when AND IF he got home safe tonight. I’m in the middle of a panic attack and texted a crisis line. They asked if I was having suicidal thoughts and what I do when I’m overly stressed. No thoughts about suicide today and I TALK TO HIM WHEN IM STRESSED. “How do you feel about finding some calm in this moment?” WHY DO YOU THINK IM DOING THIS?"
554,Medication question,Just a quick one... Does anybody have really vivid dreams with Citalopram?
555,I cry every time I look in the mirror and I can’t take it anymore,"  I (F21) have always had issues with my body ever since I was 10. It’s gotten bad since having my daughter 2 years ago. I was actually pretty skinny before I got pregnant. It has been ups and downs over the years. I struggled with bulimia and anorexia for a long time &amp; I like to think I defeated it and I’m ok but that’s never really the case, is it? I just got out of a huge depressive episode and I know I should be feeling better but I don’t. I *HATE* my body.  I don’t even have an appetite anymore because I’m so disgusted with myself. If I try to eat i literally end up getting sick because I just can’t eat. I feel unlovable. When I look into the mirror I bawl my eyes out. I work out every single day, but I still can’t justify me eating. I feel horribly guilty every time. In addition to the guilt, I feel like I look bigger immediately after eating. My stomach, my arms, my legs, my face, etc. 
  I have anxiety attacks when I have to get dressed everyday. I’m so scared every time I have to leave the house that everyone will see me and be disgusted. People tell me I’m far from fat but I literally don’t understand how they can say that. My ex (that I still am sorta involved with) tells me he loves my body and that I don’t need to change but I don’t believe that. I swear it’s a war in my head everyday just to convince myself to eat. I’ve decided not eating is probably the best thing for me to do so I will not get sick or have to feel guilty. I literally just can’t do it. 

I don’t know what else to do.

I know this post was all over the place and I’m sorry that I can’t think clearly right now. 

TL;DR:  I can’t eat anymore due to overwhelming guilt and sickness"

557,Anxiety/ADHD/Depression????,"not sure if this is the right sub to post, but basically I went to see a therapist because because I’ve been struggling to get anything done the past year (school, job, relationships, etc.). I’ve been failing classes, and I got fired from my job among other things, all because I literally CANT make myself work. 

I’ve always assumed it was some sort of inattentive thing (hard to pay attention and stay focused), and I’ve always struggled with anxiety and panic disorder. There’s a lot of other stuff I struggle with as well, but I’m trying to keep this ~relatively~ short.

My therapist told me I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression (per the title). Not sure how accurate these are, And honestly, I’m overwhelmed. She recommended meds, but like, which disorder do I begin to treat? Has anyone struggled with all three of these things before? I’m honestly just overwhelmed and looking for some advice."
558,I can’t calm myself down I need some help,15 year male was recently harassed greatly. This girl is heavily obsessed with me and idk what to do. She knows my high school and where I live. She also even knows what I look like and even as far as my number in football. I had a panic attack this morning (3rd I ever had) and I think it’s somewhat related somehow. Idk what to I need help please
559,"You know that saying that’s been going around? “It’s is to not be ok”. No, no it’s not. This virus stuff has just ruined my entire life. I Already didn’t enjoy life before this and now it’s getting worse by the minute.","I honestly have no idea how much longer I can take crying myself to sleep each night just to do it all over again. I don’t want to be alive anymore. I can’t live in a world that’s ran by evil dictators that have no empathy for even themselves. I pray each night that I get involved in a situation where my life is out in the line, like getting mugged or trying to stop an armed robbery, just so that my family doesn’t have to mourn a suicide. This is all way too much and I have absolutely nothing that’s helping me stay here"
560,How do I tell my mom that I was sexually assaulted,"18 (f)
I had a boyfriend for three years starting at 15, he was 19. My mom approved of the relationship and he would even stay late at my house until 2am. Well almost every time I spent a day with my boyfriend, the night would end in sex. He would pressure me/ pester me into sex. And he would touch me all the time, even when I’d slap him, say no, say stop. Eventually my body couldn’t stand him anymore, sex became a task, not a fun thing for me, it became something that just did even if I said I didn’t want to. And he’d manipulate me into it.

My mom is also borderline emotionally abusive, she handles information in the worst was possible, but I need to tell her so I can get therapy because I’m on her health insurance. I don’t know what to do because how can I trust her with this information, expect her not to throw it at me in the future. I’m scared that this will just be a gateway into more problems. 

I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do."
561,I don’t know what to do anymore,"This is my first time looking at this subreddit but I just joined it because I sincerely don’t know what to do. My mental health has been going downhill lately. I have constant mental breakdown. I have lost a significant amount of weight. I know why, it has to do with my family. I know I am exaggerating but it’s taking a toll on me. I have been taking care of my siblings since I was eight. I am now sixteen. It has been from morning to night because my parents work ALL DAY EVERYDAY. I really do appreciate them. It’s just that my siblings are young and they scream and are really obnoxious. This is where I feel like I am exaggerating. I can’t control them and my parents can’t either. So everyday from the morning to night, I have to deal with that. Before I had breaks at school or after school things I did but now it’s taking a toll on me. I sincerely feel like I am going to lose my mind. I don’t know what to do. My parents don’t care, my mom specifically decides to target me and calling me slurs instead of fixing my siblings. And I’m done. I am truly and utterly done and losing my mind. Because of that I have really bad anxiety and quarantine is only making it worst.Sorry for the rant."
562,"TW: sexual assault and trauma, something happened and I need to vent","So 3 years ago I was sexually assaulted and I really struggled with ptsd the months/year after it. Because of this I became really reclusive and kept to myself. I struggled to make friends, lost the ones that I had, and was always terrified of socialising or going out. Very usual ptsd symptoms however I’d say over the last 2 years I’ve really worked through that and begun to start to feel more normal. 

Last night I was invited out by a friend from high-school who I hadn’t seen in months I’ll call her T. I had drunk one wine with my parents and thought fuck it I’ll go be a normal 18 year old and go out and have fun and drink. I had a good night we pretty much roamed the streets drinking, met up with 4 other school friends till about 3/4 in the morning. I blacked out and can’t remember past about 1am. 

Here’s where shit gets really fucked.

So when I woke up, I was completely nude from the waist down, another one of my friends was asleep on my floor I’ll call her J and there was one of my dildos on the ground. J woke up and was like haha dude last night was nuts and left. I hungover and confused started to clean up go through my phone and I found some really sexual gross messages from T. I deleted the chat because it freaked me out. I’m a gay dude with a boyfriend no way would I ever want anything to happen or have ever wanted anything to happen. Here’s where shit gets really fucked, I go to shower and take of my top and my chest is covered in bruises (hickeys) I instantly start crying, when I was sexually assaulted I was covered in bruises and hickeys and then shamed by my family for them so they are a huge, huge FUCKING HUGE trigger. I can’t even breath because now I start to think something more sinister happened. I text my friends to try and figure out what happened apparently I fell asleep first when we all went to mine two other friends left and it was just me,T and J left. J passed out on the floor and I passed out on the bed and there was about an hour of T being in my house before those messages I got that said she was leaving. I’m now fucking beside myself I feel all those ptsd feelings back I’m in bed so depressed so heavy I can’t move I’m so scared I’m terrified, I keep hearing cars go past thinking it’s her or them or somebody here to hurt me. I’m so so scared. 

I messaged T and she said she gave me the hickeys as a joke but she has lied a lot before, and I just do not trust her. A joke or not it’s fucked up. And when I messaged her my message was pretty much how the fuck did these bruises get here They really trigger me so she probably knew she fucked up straight away and wanted to cover her ass. Either way I’m so scared I don’t ever wanna drink or see anybody ever again I can’t feel safe anymore I’m so scared. 

I’m seeing my therapist at the end of the week but I’m just beside myself I’m traumatised I can’t process this This feels exactly the same as last time I feel so unsafe, dirty, disgusting and violated."
563,got no check. no unemployment money. my meds cost over 200$ a month. i had to do sex work to survive this month and i cant cope,i dont really know what to do with myself or where to go from here. i have chronic pain and mental illness. i fell through the cracks and everything that was supposed to help has failed me. i dont know what yo feel.
564,"I’m this close to breaking and no one notices or cares, I have no one and nothing","I just wanted to talk and I don’t have anyone who cares anymore so idk I wanted to rant. I went from being a fairly innocent 18 year old, graduating hs, living in my parents house, to two years later when I’ve been kicked out, I live at my friends parents house and I know they want me out because it’s been months but I have no where else to go, my income doesn’t allow for rent even in the cheapest neighborhoods. My own family called the cops on me at one point, that in itself was a whole traumatic experience, my parents want to fix things now but at this point I don’t trust them, they never were there for me when I needed someone, I finally meet my biological parents after 18 years just to find out they think of the current me as a disappointment, I have casual work friends but no one who really cares, I think I’m slowly becoming dependent on my medication just to keep the pain away, and that terrifies me, I have nothing and no one. I’m mentally disabled and doing school and work just to get by. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and it only gets worse. I’m a Optimistic person but at what point can I keep pretending everything’s ok when it’s clearly not. I barely eat I never get sleep because I have too much crap to do. I’m late a lot to work because I can’t fall asleep and I know people are starting to get mad at me over it. i want to be happy, but at this point, I mean there a point where life isn’t good. It’s a shithole that only gets worse as time goes by"
565,Emotional Disconnect,"I can understand emotions in my head, but I cannot physically feel some kinds of emotion. 

Ex: I know that I should be feeling sad and hurting, but I no longer can have actual feeling of hurt and sadness. 

Back story- 
I was in a abusive marriage. So I have lived though the physical pain of hurting and being sad. When I left that marriage I felt like a weight was lifted and never wanted to let myself feel that way again. 
To me, at the time, being strong meant not crying. Not letting mental emotions overcome me physically. Letting yourself be that vulnerable was a weakness. I mentally detached myself from the emotions of hurt and sadness. I never shed a tear after I left that marriage and here I am, 7 years later. 

*i went to about a year of therapy just In case I had any hidden PTSD or depression*  

Today- 
I don’t cry. I haven’t in over 7 years. I don’t feel heartbreak or pain when a good relationship ends. I know I should have that gut feeling of hurt or cry... but I don’t. And now I WANT to have those emotions again. . I can feel happy. I can express and feel joy. I can feel anger. But actual sadness and hurt don’t register anymore. 
You know that heartache feeling? The guy feeling when you are truly hurt? The physical and emotional pain of heartache? 
Recently I ended a relationship that was a dream cone true but distance and future endeavors would not allow it to work out. In my head, I know I should be sad. I want to have that good cry. That feeling of hurt. It sounds weird, but I feel like I’m missing out on a basic human response. This has been a problem with every relationship I’ve had since ending my marriage. 

Now, I know WHY I can’t feel this emotion.
I have spoken to my therapist and of course I know this is a type of PTSD and a type of repression. 

I do visualization practices. I meditate. And I do several things that were recommended. 
But she (therapist) says the big battle will be finding someone that I can be vulnerable with that will help unlock these emotions. 

Has anyone else had this issue?  
It’s so strange to me after YEARS of being proud of being “emotionless” and “strong” that I would actually long for the ability to truly cry. 

I just want to know that I’m not the only person with this problem and know what are some good techniques that you found that helped you reconnect those emotions and vulnerability."
566,Does anyone else pretend people are with them when they're lonely?,"I started doing this a long time ago. I have no clue when I started, but its getting out of hand. I can't go 5 minutes without pretending someone is with me, or spying on me, or running in my room and surprising me or whatever. And its driving me insane. Its starting to feel like these are real people, when its just my brain trying to make me feel like real people (or anime characters) are there with me so I feel less lonely. I can't think straight anymore because of this and I don't know what to do? Does anyone else have this problem, and if so, does it have a name? And how do I deal with it, especially now when I can't go out and see anyone."
567,Need help pls,"Ok now I'm going to explain this the best I can 

The way I used to live my life I have 2 frames of thoughts the front and the back. The front is the reality where you deal with daily lives. The back is where you think and escape into when life become a to hard. Now I'm ""normal"" doing both at the same time (because of some substance I had taken). I just want help understanding."
568,Panic Attacks with a mask,"So I’ve had a few panic attacks in public places now with my mask on. And it hightens the feeling of not being able to breathe. I’m not really sure what to do because I don’t want to/legally can’t take off my mask in some places (like the supermarket), but also if I leave, I have to wait in a line again. Everywhere seems oddly busier to me, and idk if it is anxiety, bad luck, or just people are actually out on weekdays."
569,I’ve never sought help.,"Since I was little there was always something wrong with me, it got to the point where I just can’t take it anymore. 
I was always laughed at for never being able to make eye contact, understand sarcasm or just making friends in general. In fact I’ve spent all of my life alone. After a traumatic event in my life things started to go downhill. I have this weird urge to cut off my leg and to be honest it’s extremely scary. I’m terrified. I’ve thought about suicide in multiple occasions, even recently but not because I want to, it’s more of an instinct to me. I find that words calm me down a bit, repeating them makes me feel better. The words that I “chose” are just the ones that others tell me that get stuck in my mind. I’ve found out that my favorite ones are the ones with multiple Rs or social media ones (like, subscribe, share and so on). I’ve also stopped studying. It was my favorite hobby and I’ve always been on top of my class so I feel so ashamed. I just physically can’t sit there and study anymore, my concentration doesn’t allow me so. I have major anxiety and paranoia about everything (other than insomnia, I haven’t slept in two days). I’m always scared to be arrested or killed for no reason. All of this is happening in my mind, none (besides my family) knows about it. I tried to seek help but I’ve been told that I was exaggerating and that others have it worse so I didn’t. Also, the last time I tried to open up with someone they started sharing my personal information to others which I hated. This quarantine is making everything worse as I keep seeing others living their best life while I’m here trapped in my own mind. 
I really don’t know what to do anymore."
570,How to endure a Narcissistic discard from cheating husband,"Husbands favorite game is to triangulate between me, his LDAP (long distance Ap) and local AP. This is unethical monogamy he has been lying cheating cake eater. He is stonewalling next since I found out"
571,I saw my father rape my mother at the approx. age of five and I’m reliving those traumatic memories,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I recalled two instances where my father raped my mother when she was asleep. I ‘repressed’ the memories for almost 25 years but it reared it’s ugly head last night, and I realize I really, really, really need help.

Please. This is a major cry for help."
572,Does anyone else have episodes of intensely hating and distrusting people?,"I don't know what causes it at all, but sometimes I suddenly go through episodes of intensely hating / being angry at / distrusting people, even if they're people I love (family, friends, SO especially). They don't do anything to provoke it either; it's random. It confuses me and I don't know how to explain why it happens, but it's fleeting and I go back to liking whoever the episode was centered on the next day."
573,I'm so lonely I went to a Coronavirus test center just so I'd get human interaction,"I really don't have more to say than this. I moved to a new country 4-5 months ago (where they're urging everyone to get tested) and I haven't had a chance to make friends because of getting settled in and then 7 weeks of lockdown.

The girl I was dating moved here with me, but moved out because she wanted her own place and I think she's cheating now cheating on me. I haven't had a chance to form any social connections because of everything and it's tearing me apart. Last week, I completely broke down from a lack of social interaction and went to the fucking test center just so I'd have the chance to talk to someone for a bit (even though it was 15-minutes and they were sticking a swab down my nostrils)."
574,I might ba having a panick attack right now,"Earlier ( 10 min) I had the feeling that my life was on teh line and that a mosnter with dog appearance was going to kill me, so I panivked and took a place to defend myself. there was nothing. i calmed down and wasnt as scare, but now My arm is moving weird, i am shaking, cant properly move and I am very scare, not of my life, but it feelt like someone was controlling my arm earlier and made threats at me without me knowing tha tI couldnt hear them. my face feels heavy"
575,Something is wrong,"I don’t know what is is. I can’t work. My mind trails for hours. My paranoia keeps me up until 6am. I feel like I’m going insane. I have mood swings of anger and happiness and sadness. When I finally get myself to focus on some work, it only lasts a short while. I’ve stopped feeling like anything matters. I’m pushing everyone away and I don’t know why. Why is it so hard to speak to a doctor on quarantine, you’d think telemedicine was supposed to be easier. I’m trying to tell people I need help and that somethings going downhill and that it has been for at least three years. I’ve had some of these problems since I was in the second grade. I got in so much trouble but i haven’t learned. So many breakdowns and now I’m just laughing. Lol."
576,NEED SERIOUS HELP WITH A FAMILY MEMBER! Please help me!,"I really don't know how to describe my situation. My mom for the past 4 years or so has been complaining about this odor around her, believing the odor is harmful to the family. At first, my brother, dad, and I didn't think it was anything at first. Soon enough, she began placing these fans around the house, opening the windows night and day to get rid of smell. This has been happening for the past 4 years. You guys need to understand that there is no odor what so ever, its all in her mind (or at least the rest of the family can't smell it). I really don't know when it started, but eventually my mother began to develop these kind of theories and accusations, saying that our neighbors are ""spraying clorox"" and out to get her. She believe the whole world is against her and that she's trying to protect the family by getting rid of the odor. 

&amp;#x200B;

When the rest of the family tries to explain to her that there is nothing, she will always make some kind of absurd accusation. I am 100% everything she has been saying is all in her head. When I myself try to talk to her, she always turns around everything I say and ends up not listening to a word I say. Constantly the whole family will get in an argument about this for no reason whatsoever (mostly my mom and dad). This has obvious caused their relationship to get worse than what it already is. The thing is, I feel like my dad hasn't done anything to reach out for help and that's why I've put the responsibility upon myself.

&amp;#x200B;

As much as my situation seems like a joke, rest assure this is all really happening. As much as I my family tries to talk to my mother, there seems to be no progress in her current condition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please I am asking you guys for any advice. What should I do? If I should find a therapist where and how? I am only 17 and I am hoping that I can find some kind of resolution quickly. I really don't want to go off to university and have to worry about my mom getting worse at hope. Please help!"
577,How to try to get diagnosed with mental illness during COVID-19?,"I think I may have OCD (if you want details read my other posts on my profile), but how can you get diagnosed during these times. Can you get diagnosed on online therapy or will I have to wait until COVID-19 is over? I’m confused on what to do."
578,What should I do.,"Hey so a few minutes ago I tried to kms and yesterday night (or morning) I tried to kill myself. Look up ""night night method"" I used tape and bean bags and basically just tried to cut off my carotid artery but it didn't work even after 1m 30s timer so 2m in all. Probably because I workout my neck and also I need different tape since I'm using electrical tape which is pretty elastic. Anyways. I'd love to maybe get some help or talk to someone other than a suicide hotline. Thing is, I CANNOT allow myself to ""act"" sad around other people. I can do it sometimes, but like right now I know if I went somewhere or anything I wouldn't be taken seriously. Also, I don't know who or how to tell. It seems impossible to me. I've gotten help, like I'm on meds and have been to therapy. Like, people aren't gonna take me serious. I'm gonna try one more time tonight but I'm kind of out of tape and I'm too lazy to look for more and I don't really think we have any that would work so."
579,"This is my first oanick attack, what to do against it?","ive been shacking, crying, just a liitle, not much and being scared for my life for a few seconds"
580,What do I have? Do I have pica?,"I don't know much about this and I just want to find out if there's something off or I'm just putting shit in my head, so since I was young to putting things in my mouth and chew on the ideam, like containers, plastic, straws and ear phones covers.
When I was younger I was seeing a doctor for it and they was going to get me something to chew on but it never happened and the chewing things still happen, idk if it's just a habit now or its something else.
I don't know if this should go here but I'm asking here, I'll put it somewhere else if it don't go here. I don't know where else to put this."
581,I can't exist anymore,"I started taking medication and my depression went away for a while, but a few days ago they just suddenly stopped working. I feel this crushing sense of despair all the time, almost as if something was sitting on my chest and whispering into my ear.

 ""you'll never be enough"" 

""it's all over"" 

""just give up""

I'm still taking it but I don't get better. And on top of the depression I already had, I learned that I probably have ptsd (if that's true I've had it for years but now I'm thinking about it a lot more) and I seem to have developed an eating disorder (based on what my friends who struggle with those things think of my symptoms, I'm only saying it's a possibility, not trying to self diagnose or anything). Oh and my parents are fighting more because of quarantine, so they're taking it out on me and being borderline abusive. It's a miracle I haven't cut in nearly a month, although I'm sure it's only a matter of time. I'm not coping well at all."
582,Had a discussion today with my father and he basically said goodbye,"My father is a manipulator and I know that, today I got into a discussion with him because of that by WhatsApp, and he basically told me that he’s going to end it. 

While I do know is something a manipulator would say, my concern is because he’s alone in this covid situation.

His phone is dead and he is not getting my messages. I’m in a country that police does not respond to those calls.

I’m not quite sure how to feel right now, and that feeling is quite driving me sad."
583,Having a rough time.,"Been waking up every day around 12 AM and then again at 2 AM to wash my hands because I have OCD. But today is even better: I woke up because I pissed myself. Then I went to use the washroom and I stepped in my dog's pee. Then I got stuck at my sink washing my hands and reopening the cuts on my hand that I got from washing yesterday, which are now really stinging and pulsating. Nobody really needs to comment, mostly because I don't have the strength to reply. But the thought of someone knowing helps a little."
584,I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore and I feel like I'm slowly forgetting stuff,"This has been going on since a few years (since I was around 13, now I'm 16) but I feel it more strongly. Idk if being stuck in the same room has aggravated this sense of general unrealness but it hasn't really ever quite left, I'm just more aware of it... I feel awful, I'm really afraid that I might start going crazy...I don't truly know why do I feel like this and my therapist doesn't really help, I don't think she believes me. What do I do?"
585,One Year Since I “Came Out” With Having GAD,"Hi everybody. Last year, I “came out” to the internet about my struggles with mental health and have since become an advocate and supporter for people getting the help they need. 

I speak quite candidly about my experiences with mental health because I know so many cannot.  If you’re going through it right now, know you’re not alone and know that you’re loved. 

You are strong and know that there are people who understand and appreciate you. Whatever your struggle is, I share my strength and wish you  
 restoration and healing ❤️ let’s all keep that in mind (and happy mental health awareness month!)"
586,Body Positivity,"I think when big things are going on (losing my job during covid for example), I think my mind tends to focus on smaller things to get myself distracted. I actually get obsessed with the same notions and thoughts until something snaps me out of it.

Yesterday I found little spider veins on my face and it made me feel sad as I'm only 27. And I'm worried it's something I've done to cause this permanent damage. But now I have become obsessed, trying to find out how to get rid of them. My mind doesn't stop thinking about it. 

It's messing up my mental health a bit and I basically need some positive affirmations about how this appearance is normal to stop my mind for going in these circles. There are a lot of Insta accounts for stretch marks, scars and cellulite, but nothing for veins.  I just wish there was so I felt normal. 

There's not really a lot to say about this, but if anyone has any tips or recommendations, please send them my way."

589,Revenge fantasies flaring Up,"Whenever I get angry I have revenge fantasies about hurting people and not giving a fuck about the law. The idea of just hitting them really hard or in a solid way is just appealing. It only takes a second after I do so in my mind before I snap back and relax.

I want to see a therapist and work this stuff out but I have no idea how to find one or what can help me get over this.

The more I think about it. I really do have some bad insecurities that are doing damage. And parents who have no idea, context, or more preoccupied with other things.

What do I do?"
590,I overthink until I shut down,"doesn’t matter what it is, i’ll literally overthink something until it tears me apart. if my partner doesn’t tell me where they’re going, i just assume they don’t care about me and i’ll think about it to the point where i just wont even want to talk about it because i know i’m being irrational. the other night i went from completely fine to remembering when i would hurt myself and spent the rest of the night convincing myself not to commit suicide. i don’t know why my brain works that way, i’m amazing at helping others control themselves and their thoughts but when it comes to my own, i stress myself out to a point where i’m unable to articulate my own thoughts."
591,"I'm not sure what this is, but I realised it wasnt normal","As I child I remember feeling no emotions, and crying in situations bdcusse I saw other people cry in them, or saw other people happy in that situation I'd act happy. I didn't understand the basics of anything social, and I didn't even begin to until I was around 14. Everything would just ""happen"" for me.

As a child I useto see real monsters. Not at night, not imagining, I saw them moving, and they were real. In the day time I saw them too, I also useto hear people whispering in my house and couldn't find the source of the whispering.

I dont have anything like this anymore, except I'll hear pianos playing sometimes, or occasionally someone saying my name, and I know no one is playing piano or saying my name.

I know for a fact I have empathy I can turn on and off. I'm not trying to be edgy. I did have depression and possibly still do now.

 I have abnormal compulsive behavior, I cant mention here for identity,  that I want to stop but I can't stop.

Sometimes ill get completely lost in thought while standing, or walking, and will sit there or walk around for north of half an hour, and want to stop, but I can't stop myself, I always get locked back into my thoughts, and it takes serious willpower to snap out of it.

I cant understand people, and can't connect with anyone, I have next to no friends created in my life, but I'm just mentioning abnormal stuff. I don't really have a problem with it."

I just want to find every baby duck and squish it until it dies, I have never ever gotten madder at anyone or anything more than a baby duck. I'm not even joking, like I get full on mad at baby ducks. I hope they all die and get squished. Sorry."
594,Life feels fake. Is this a delusion?,"Over the last few months, I have increasingly felt like my life is governed and controlled by some unseen entity/force. Things that should feel arbitrary and random, somehow feel orchestrated or staged. Sometimes too convenient. Like something or someone is very knowingly messing with me.

What brought this feeling on, is the experience of very inexplicable coincidences. Some call them synchroncities. They feel very uncanny and deliberate. I feel like sometimes people just say the right things, like very specific to what I've already been thinking. Which feels odd. I sometimes feel like I don't really get a perspective different to mine, when I reach out to other people.

I don't know how to rid myself of the feeling that something greater than me is out there and is at play in my life. Knowing and calculating my every move. Is this a delusion?"
595,Tips on improving coping skills?,"I had been going to a therapist for my anger outbursts (but due to a recent move I have stopped my sessions). I felt I had been doing well, and family commented that they saw improvement too. But tonight I had an outburst and I feel worthless, like the progress I made was worth nothing. Friends and family are disappointed in my behavior tonight.

Often at night, especially when I'm going through a depressive period, I get plagued by thoughts at night. The most annoying of them are just swearing and telling me to commit suicide over and over, but theres also ones that make me unable to sleep at night because they cause me panic attacks. Most of them are thoughts of my abusive father yelling at me or thoughts of my mom dying leading me to suicide. I have to try so hard to keep my mind off these thoughts, but somehow I always go back to thinking about it again. I don't know what these thoughts would be considered to be. Let me know if I'm wrong about this being intrusive thoughts, and what it would be otherwise."
597,Drove through a red light,"Hello all.

Yesterday I drove through a red traffic light and almost had a accident at a intersection. I initially stopped for the red light but after 10 seconds I just started driving because I thought it was green. Luckily my friend next to me noticed it on time. He asked dude why are driving? it is red! And I couldn’t recall the color of the traffic light. I was so shocked about this. What’s wrong with me!?"
598,How do you confront someone that doesn't like/want to be confronted?,"So I am not close to my brother, he left me emotionally a couple of years ago and started to get distant.  He is actually closer to his friends than to me.  I confronted him maybe a year or two ago and he just straight up denied it and made up some random BS which I didn't believe.  I told him what I felt like was happening to our relationship and he said not to worry.  The relationship is already strained but, what I wanted to know is how could I have handle this situation better?  I have been builled in the past and so I don't feel comfortable being open/vulnerable to people.  I also have a hard time saying what I really want to say.    


Thanks,"
599,How do you notice if you have mommy or/and daddy issues? Is it possible to have both at the same time?,"Are there any ""symptoms"" you notice or sth like that? Some people say they have those issues but how do you notice that and what happened that you get such issues?"
600,5 years later and nothing has changed,"
I had my internship back in 2015 at a hospital. I suffered from severe anxiety back then i just wanted to do everything perfectly and was so conscious of what other people might say about me. What happened was everything that was supposed to go wrong in a day went wrong for me. Im not even exaggerating. This triggered immense anxiety for me. I shook like a leaf everyday and couldnt get out of my head at all. Everyday i wished for an accident to happen to me just so i wont be able to go. I was bullied so hard and they even told the doctors. There was an OB Gyne who was mean to me and would laugh at my face. 



So after 5 years im currently working and still have severe anxiety from time to time but im 2 years in here so i know my thing. But due to the pandemic she was contacted as an oncall doctor here. The first time we met again i wasnt sure if she remembered me but she was rude to me. My heart was pounding so bad when i found out i have to assist her. I was so so awkward and wasn’t much of a help to her but that was understandable to me because our machine was new and i wasnt oriented about it which i explained but she still looked pissed My hands were also shaking. That was last month. And today it happened again. She talked to and instructed me like im a fucking idiot. I was kind of a spaz but given that i had dry mouth and pounding heart i think it went quickly and much better than the last time. She was rude again because 3x it happened that i couldnt hear what she was saying because of the ppe we were wearing and she wouldnt repeat what she said. She’d also say something but whenever i reply shed cut me off. I was nervous laughing the entire time though i know my thing. I also dont know if she said my name. Im scared she’d tell the hospital i interned at about me and theyd laugh and say im still an idiot.


Tldr: Met again the doctor who bullied me during my internship 5 years later and I looked like an idiot again."
601,I feel selfish,"Any time I feel down or depressed I think I’m incredibly selfish and childish. I think I’m making a big deal out of nothing, that there’s other people who have it harder than me and I have no right to complain. I feel so lonely and empty sometimes, I feel so drained and tired and fed up and I can’t figure out why. Because I should feel happy and grateful. I have a loving family and a home and friends and an income and I just feel that I’m so selfish and cruel for feeling this way when there’s people suffering in the world and I have no right to feel as I do."
602,Could someone point me in the right direction?,"I might sound crazy for this and I’m not sure if this is 100% the right subreddit for this but I’m afraid if I post it in other subreddits it will get removed for “asking others for a diagnosis” when I’m just looking for some insight.

First I should note that my family doesn’t have the money to really get this checked out and although it happens frequently it’s never put me in any sort of danger to myself or others so we haven’t found an urgent need to get it looked into. Right now I’m just full on curious on what’s going on and if anyone can point me in any sort of direction to what this may be so I’m going to provide as much information as I can.

Basically, for the past year or two I’ve been getting auditory hallucinations. Not anything extreme like ones commonly seen in people with schizophrenia which is what throws me off. I don’t specifically hear voices either, it’s mostly sounds. Another odd thing is that my brain will turn sounds into something else. The most common one being a car speeding down the street turns into screaming. Screaming is also what I hear the most, although I believe that specifically has to do with a bit of trauma from an event a few years back.

Other than that here’s a list of things I’ve heard (note I know these aren’t real, although sometimes it will take me a few minutes to figure that out):

Someone fiddling with the handle to my back screen door

Police sirens on a inconsistent loop for hours

Birds tweeting above me in my bed at 2 in the morning, again this went on for hours 

A couple arguing outside (I realized it wasn’t real when I couldn’t make out anything they were saying, it was all muffled and when I focused on the sound of my ceiling fan hard enough, it would stop)

Muffled tv from the other room turned into muffled sobbing

Now all these sounds don’t feel like they’re coming from my head. I can almost always pinpoint a direction they’re coming from.

Now sometimes these are very easy for me to figure out that their not real while other times it’s very difficult . Once I was walking with my friend in her neighborhood and I heard a quick but very loud scream and had to ask my friend if she heard that. She didn’t, no way she could have missed it if it was real.

Another thing that might be good to note is that when I was younger I would badly hallucinate every time I broke a fever, the only difference is these were visual. However I stopped doing that as I got older. 

I do have anxiety and I read that people with that can have simple auditory hallucinations which almost sounds right but mine seem just slightly more extreme. 

Like I said, I can narrow the screaming ones down to possibly some slight PTSD but the rest I have no idea. 

Any suggestions, articles, etc would be helpful. Eventually when I have the money I’ll for sure get this looked into professionally, but for now any insight or just hearing from anyone who had similar experiences would be helpful. Sometimes I feel crazy because what I experience doesn’t necessarily fit into what auditory hallucinations are known to be. 

Thank you for reading, if you need anymore information just let me know :)"
603,Retrogade amnesia and some shitty stuff.,"Hello reddit.

I think I should talk about what happened to me 2 years ago so you can understand my story a little better.

My doctors told me I was in a car accident involving a drunk driver. I was 16 at the time, they said. I was left in a coma, which I woke up from 3 months ago.

I have almost complete memory loss. Retrogade amnesia.

 Ribot's law states that the memories closest to the accident are the ones most likely to be lost. It doesn't apply to me. I only remember some of my teens.

I just don't remember being in this body. As I said, I remember my teens, and that is how I know I used to be a tall, skinny-looking, but somewhat muscular guy.



But I'm female, and that confuses me. Is my mind desperately trying to populate my memories with things I read or watched on TV?  I still don't believe this is my body. When I stood up for the first time, a week ago, I was shocked at how huge the world felt. I *just know* that I used to be tall.


It's taken some getting used to. I've been told this is unusual, but not unheard of. 

There are still some parts I refuse to believe. Sexual attraction is different now. Voice is kinda annoying.


This is all very weird stuff. I'm not who I thought I was, *literally*. I just need someone to talk to, tbh."
604,My boyfriend is ignorant about mental health," My boyfriend came to me yesterday laughing at his friend's reasons for feeling suicidal. I told him that was ignorant and that's when we got talking about mental health issues. He didn't know many of them and he said he doesn't like knowing about them because he would be prone to self-diagnosing and romanticizing them. Then he came to talking about depression and he implied that people who suffer from depression can cause their loved ones to get depressed and then started talking about a man he knew who had depression and didn't get treated for it and how people ostracized him and his family. Now guys, I have bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and he said that without thinking about how all this made me feel. I told him It was insensitive and he said that's just what he thought we no remorse. I have always struggled to explain to him when I am depressed and he always tries his best to help like when I told him to stop asking me why I am depressed because I often don't know why I feel so down but rather now he asks how are you feeling and the conversation starts from there. I am not expecting him to be a therapist but I expect him to have a basic understanding of what I go through. I am confused about whether this should be a dealbreaker considering he has not taken the time to teach himself about my struggles despite knowing about them or should I be patient and allow him to learn?  (I am a first time poster sorry for any posting mistakes)"
605,I’m awake before Midday,"Being on Furlough leave and experiencing the things I have (check my profile if you want to know more), it’s been a struggle to wake up before midday. 

I may have woken up at 10:30am but I’m classing that as a small victory.

 Baby Steps"
606,How do you stop procrastinating?,"I’m F (25) and have always struggled with my mental health. One of the symptoms that I get is lack of motivation. 

It’s gotten way worse recently. I’ll outline what happens when I want to do something (like read a book, or tidy my room)

- I feel like I’m not ready, and I have to spend time ‘relaxing’ first
- I cling to addictive behaviours like obsessively playing games on my phone or binge watching trashy tv to avoid what I actually want to do
- when I really try to engage with what I want to be doing I just consistently feel like I’m ‘not in the right headspace’

It doesn’t make sense to me, because whilst I understand things like procrastinating work or boring housework, I’ve started procrastinating things that I actually want to do too. Even writing this post took me so long because I was getting put off and distracted. 

I can tell that this is happening because of the current situation. I’m hiding and trying to escape because I can’t deal with what’s going on. One thing I’m procrastinating is engaging with my self development activities (the usual way I deal with my mental health) - so I do think that’s why I’m finding it so hard to engage with activities that might confront my emotions, because I’m still super switched on at work. 

Any tips on how to snap out of this please? I’ve tried gentle to do lists but it’s not helping."
607,My dad was cheating on my mum with my friends mum,Just found out my dad was having an affair. Tomorrow is my first day back at school after being online for a month. I'm not sure how I'll function and I'm so scared I'm going to fail year 12.
608,Thank you :),"I came to this subreddit as a desperate attempt to get help with my binge eating+body issues (I am not diagnosed! I just had problems.) , and thats what I got. 3 special users here tried to help me, and I thank you all so much! I feel amazing now, and I couldn’t be more grateful. If I didn’t come here, I don’t think my mental health would’ve been able to keep up. Again, thank you! And to the people who aren’t in a good place right now, I hope things turn out better. I love you all ❤️"
609,I cry over small things,"I get very emotional over small things; when I get a bad grade I try my best to hide the tears in my eyes and the shakiness in my voice when others are around. I've been this way my whole life.  I've seen that I've improved a little as I've gotten older. I care less about small things, but I still have breakdowns often. My parents are really sweet, but they've never discussed mental health with me. I start crying if I think about seeking help because I don't want my parents to think I'm a failure. I have friends that go to therapy and I'm happy for them that they get help, but I feel like I should be perfect. I really want to change, but I don't want anyone to know about this."
610,Sertraline,Anyone feel worse after taking sertraline? I havent taken it in a while but I was feeling a bit more anxious at work than I do normally and I feel worse. I also dont like myself as much when I take it I feel more numb and like I'm just going through the motions rather than better.
611,Am sad when not with a person,"So I can't seem to find any answers on google, so I'm hoping you all have some. I for some odd reason am sad when I'm not with this one person.

613,Can alcohol cause psychosis?,"A friend of mine went to the ER after drinking and had some sort of breakdown. She was having delusions about vampires and she had to get strapped down to the hospital bed cause she wanted to kill herself. She was making references to a TV show and thought she was in that world. She was in the hospital for around 10 hours and an anti psychotic drug made her snap out of it completely and she got released. This has never happened before and it scary because what if it happens again? The doctors were not very helpful about anything and they let her go without any sort of evaluation, they said she seems like she’s back to normal now and she was able to leave. She isn’t talking about it really and I believe she isn’t because she’s really embarrassed about it (which she shouldn’t be at all). I just don’t know what to do or say to her and her family is very worried about her mental state. Some advice would be so great."
614,Am I the only one who gets extreme nausea thinking about/seeing bees?,"I don’t know if I have a fear of them, but I saw two really big bumble bees yesterday mid-afternoon in my yard and I threw the trash by the bin and ran inside and had a panic attack. Anytime I think of bees I freak out or feel extreme nausea :”) Idk what’s happening.. I’m anxious."

Am I really seeing? Are my eyes real? Are memories real? Memories are just fake like this existence.
617,I have a weird problem where I set rules and have to complete them,"For example, when it comes to podcasts, if while listening to one podcast, another podcast is mentioned, then I \*have\* to listen to that podcast too. This resulted in me having over 140 videos queued up on youtube.  I can't leave it incomplete. I've wasted 2 years of my life trying to get that number back down to zero. Only then can I delete youtube. I'm down to about 50.  


What is wrong with me and what resources are available to allow me to ""let go"" of these completionist rules I come up with."
618,Am I a maladaptive daydreamer?,"These daydreaming episodes of mine have been going on for years. I just randomly devise a complex storyline (or change a real one) and imaginary characters to accompany it. There are real people who appear too, and its almost as though I play with them like dolls. Another character who makes a frequent appearance in my daydreams is my idealised self, and I can't stop pretending to be her. Sometimes I accidentally let my alter ego slip in front of other people, and then I snap back to reality. When I daydream, I am happy because everything goes my way, and I guess it is kind of like my escape from reality, but in social interactions, I can be quite bothered because, well, *I just want to daydream. E.g.* When somebody calls or texts me, I will ignore them completely because I would rather daydream than have to converse with them. I have been upfront with my friends about it in my awareness of the fact that it is hindering my daily life/damaging our relationships and they understand, but I am still curious as to what this actually means for me.

P.s. I think it is worth mentioning that when I am daydreaming, I tend to walk around my room, for it stimulates my thoughts. I also act out my thoughts by mouthing the words of my characters, and sometimes even bursting into laughter. Apologies for the above paragraphs if they do not appear cohesive, it is just that there is much I have to explain about this mysterious condition."
619,"Talking with my ""other self"""," 

Before you call me crazy, please listen:

Since last November I've been dealing with allot of intensive mood swings, anxiety, Intrusive thoughts daily, feeling depressed and having suicidal thoughts. (And yes, I'm having my first Therapy visit in like a week.)

So now I guess to my ""Other self"", I have been talking to myself for all my life, but I never have spoken more to myslef than in these last 3 months, so basically, this ""other me"" is kinda like an imaginary friend, and yea I'm a teen and I myself sometimes think this is stupid, but overtime I kinda have built a relationship with him, I mostly would have full conversations with my ""other self"" when I'm alone, since thats when I feel comfortable, I often start the conversations with a question, before I go any further I call it my ""other self"" because I often view him as my darker more evil self, since I discuss my intrusive thoughts and violent stuff with him like it's just something normal, yea I know. I sometimes give him a nice chuckle, since he sometimes can, I guess tell some wierd but I guess funny stuff. Btw I kinda want to say that in these last few months I've really gotten emotionally numb, I started to wear a mask on my face trying to be normal infront of people, but I'm hiding my true side from people, and that kinda freaks me out. One of the reasons I think I even started talking to this other side of me, is because I feel like since I'm alone most of the time I really just need someone to talk to that understands me, in that fact it would be him."
620,Whats wrong with me?,"I noticed over the past six months that i lack confidence, focus, comprehension and lack of willingness to complete tasks. I graduated over two years ago from college and i was doing fine then but what happened now? Am i too stressed from my current job even though i barely contribute? I find myself opening articles and can only read their headlines without actual reading of the text. I cant remember minor details and i cant focus in meetings at work. I can literally go into a meeting and come out of it without contributing one word or understanding one thing while everyone seems focused and contribute frequently. I am lacking ambition or i have goals but dont actually follow up on them because im too lazy or procastenate over them and find myself wasting every hour i have scrolling on youtube accomplishing nothing! I cant even start a tv series!!! Whats wrong?????"
621,First psychologist appointment,"So I know I have depression and anxiety but for a few years I've thought maybe there's something else going on. Obviously I don't want to try and diagnose myself but for some reason I'm incredibly in my head about how I should approach this session. I don't want the psych thinking I'm being overdramatic or trying to tick boxes of a diagnosis. Should I mention the condition I think I may have? Or just see what she says? 

Typing this out seems so silly but I'm so nervous"
622,The long journey to find something you could call friends &amp; family,"I have literally run out of plans, ideas to form a healthy social life. I have tried for a long time to create something you could call ""family"" or ""actual friends"", and it is breaking me apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Short information about myself; Male, around 20 years of age. For simplicity and anonymity, I am going to call myself ""Mark"" in this story.  Living in central Europe, coming from a middle class family. Parents divorced, never had something you could call a healthy family. Living with my father that usually works all day, seeing my mother a few times a month. Graduated all of my education with flying colours. Going to university next year, living with my father and my older brother.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, it is quite hard writing this text. I should be fully happy in life. I have a good education, a roof above my head, I live in a safe country without war, can eat and drink as much as I want. Apart from a few health issues I am living the life every child that suffers from war dreams about. I am athletic, doing lots of sports, enjoying good education, have a girlfriend. Money is no issue in my life. A lot of people look up to me, to my accomplishments. What I have achieved in life surprised many, even my own parents. But actually, behind the curtains, I am deeply unhappy. I have been struggling with myself for a long time. Actually, I am unsure if I struggle with myself, or if myself is struggling with society. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have a really pretty childhood. Growing up with my mom at home, my dad deployed in foreign countries, I didn't see him to often, when I did i certainly enjoyed his company. Used to life abroad for some time. Was a nice experience to see a different country, different cultures. My father always earned good money. Financially, we never struggled.  Everything was really good, until age 15. That is when we moved back to my home country, and that is where the trouble began.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came back, everything seemed to different. Suddenly, I am the foreigner in my own country. After so many years, most people have forgotten who I am. I had to start my social life all over. School wasn't easy. Because I came from a totally different culture, I was looked down upon as a weirdo. I really tried my best, but it never seemed enough. Also, I was struggling with health issues and surgery back then, which led to me having to walk around on crouches all the time. I was nicknamed ""the crippled"" and many other foul names, because I was very thin due to the meds I had to take, and the said ""weirdness"" of myself didn't make it any better. It was a really hard time. Even my old ""friends"" started looking down on me, some even low-key bullying me. I was actually bullied by a lot of people, both males and females. I was an outsider. At the same time, my parents divorced ugly, and my family fell completely apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've started consuming. Usually alcohol and weed. alcohol really fucked me up, and at age 17 I've decided to go dry. From there on it was pretty much only weed for me. As strangely as it sounds, cannabis by itself actually really helped me. I was in a super depressed state at that time. Thinking about self harm and suicide, back when I consumed alcohol I actually made an attempt to kill myself. Cannabis always elevated me above the bullshit, and made me realize that I had to change and get my shit together. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is when I decided I had to change myself. My body. A transformation maybe? I started to try to dress well. Get used to the local culture. Because of my thin body, I was looked down upon. I started working out heavily, even got a coach. Went from 60kg to 85kg of lean muscle in about 3 years. Did everything; hit the gym, swimming, climbing, cycling, running marathon, doing triathlon. That is when people really started to respect me, and my achievements. Not only did I excel in sports, I also did in school. I even started in local politics, and got elected in a low power position. In this time frame I have also met my girlfriend. She is the only person in this universe I could truly trust and relate to. Loving, loyal, pretty, she has all the thing I truly looked for in a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here comes to big downside; my social life. Even after all my supposed ""achievements"", all this struggle to implement myself into this ""society"", I am still failing. Apart from my girlfriend there is no one I could call ""friend"". I have many, many acquaintances. But I always feel like an asset, a handy man you could say. I am the sports man, the politician, the intelligent dude, the dude that cooks and bakes really good, the dude who supports you with your struggles, the dude who helps you paint your bedroom because you can't do it yourself, the dude whom you call if you need good weed, the dude you call when you need a ride, the dude you call when your car broke down. I am an asset, but I am never ""Mark"" to anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read many posts about this topic on Reddit and other pages. Looking at guides on how to make actual friends. I've tried everything. Investing time, inviting people, standing out by for example bringing bakery when invited, helping people when they need it. But still, I am only an acquaintance. Now you might say ""Mark, why do you say this? You are just in a depressive state of denial. People probably really like you and see you as a friend!"". I can tell you why I think like this.

&amp;#x200B;

The big thing is, I am always ""outside"" of everything. I NEVER get invited. Unless I write different texts every evening to all my local ""acquaintances"" I will end up spending my evening alone, working out or smoking weed till I fall asleep, with the only exception being my girlfriend. Mostly I get denied, with people saying ""oh no, I am not around today"", just to see them meeting their close friends and chilling on someones Instastory. I look at FB/Instagram/Snapchat, people I know and I've helped many times enjoying their time at home parties or other gatherings, making jokes with each other, laughing, filming and making photos. They seem like a family, something I actually never really had. I have tried so many times to get into a circle. Went to gathering, parties, etc. Talking, laughing, drinking. But even when everyone is leaving, I will say goodbye, just to know that really people just enjoyed me bringing joy into their life, and not really enjoying me as a person. No one will invite me unless I keep asking.  I am no part of any circle of friends. People plan things in front of me while casually excluding me. If I ask (and I am lucky), I may get included. But its never an invitation thing, its a struggling to get included. I am no friend. I am an asset, a nomad on the search for love an inclusion. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is really breaking me apart. I am so far in that I am considering just totally restarting my life somewhere else. Moving away, starting a new life, by a new name maybe. I just want to feel included, I want to feel at home. But I feel alien everywhere I go. I am so happy to have my girlfriend. But to be honest, I also fear that one day she will abandon me, like everyone else did, because she milked me for her own advantage. It really makes me sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone could give me advice, I would be truly happy."
623,Do you ever feel like you’re easily forgotten or just unwanted?,"So to be honest this pandemic had been really getting to my mental health lately and I haven’t been feeling the greatest, but I live in New England and one thing I enjoy doing to get my mind straight again is hiking. For several weeks I’ve been asking my group friends if they would be down to go on a hike, to which they would say yes and then bail on the day or just straight up say no. Which is fine, I get it, things happen and people make other plans. However, one weekend I decided not to ask and went on Snapchat to find that a few friends I asked posted pictures of a hike that they did together on their story. I’m sure you can imagine how shitty this felt having asked to do a hike several times and then finding out my “friends” decided to do a hike without me. Has anyone else been in a situation like this before?"
624,What do you guys do for self care?,My mental health has plummeted and my life is going down hill. I’m making dumb decisions and I really want to clear my head. What are some self care things you guys do that improve your mood or make you feel better?
625,I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia at the age of 16.,"      Hello everyone, this is my second time posting on Reddit. I can't sleep and I'm in a really dark place mentally right now so I'm going to vent to distract if that's okay here. I'm currently 21. I hadn't had a major panic attack or psychosis episode since I was around 17. My family is fucked up to be very Frank and if you all wish for more info I'll possibly make another post about them. I joined the army at 18/19 mainly because of my StepMother. I know that it's gonna be hard to believe I even could with the diagnosis for some people, but I did. The Dont ask Dont Tell policy is what majorly got me a pass as well and a recruiter that was eager to get another recruitment under his belt.
       I did fine in the army, I only ever had one panic attack and it was a small one due to a practice ""grenade"" (I don't remember the correct name for the ones that whistled then popped but it exploded nonetheless) going off while in basic. I don't have PTSD from it that I know of and definitely won't claim to unless I get formally diagnosed. I was discharged because I failed my final AIT PT test due to having ""knock knees"" and the Ruck marches we did really didn't help them, the pain killed me on my 2 mile run and I never could recover my time. I should have gotten medical discharge but that's a different story.
       I was discharged not too long ago, last June I believe, and now my mental health has taken a turn for the absolute worst. I've been having a few too many panic attacks at work and at home. My relationship with my fiance is suffering from it as well. The voices and hallucinations have been really really bad because of the increasing panic attacks, most of which the hallucinations cause. I've been in this constant state of my life having no meaning because I've failed at a majority of the tasks I and others have set for myself. I don't currently have health insurance and I wanted to check into a mental health clinic. I don't know how much that will be but I feel I need to. I don't even know if it'll help me at this point, it didn't really help too much when I was 16 because the medicine they put me on wasn't doing anything but making me numb and tired all the time. I feel trapped in a loop now because I'll feel fine one moment then the next I'll either have a panic attack or see/hear people running around me or ducking behind furniture. I don't know how I let myself get this bad and I don't know why I did. I'm lost and feel like I have nowhere to turn. Sometimes I’m scared to be alone and I hate it and myself for it. Any advice or even just a comment would be welcomed, I feel like I’m alone in this fight and people are just watching me. Sorry this one was so long but I needed to keep my hands busy."
626,4 Thoughts I had to Kill to heal from Anxiety,[https://medium.com/change-your-mind/4-thoughts-i-had-to-kill-to-heal-from-anxiety-1c663fc74a07](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/4-thoughts-i-had-to-kill-to-heal-from-anxiety-1c663fc74a07)
627,i for some reason talk to myself without realising and when i do i forget when i started it,"ok so i have been talking to myself without realising ALOT of the time, even when i was thinking about asking reddit i started talking to myself about what i was going to say, why does this happen?"
628,Is this because of my disorders? Or is this normal?,"[21F- Bpd/Avpd, social anxiety] I pretend people are with me sometimes and i talk to them
Fucking weird. I know. I’ve done this forever. I’m 21f now, have always done it. When i was a teenager and would have crushes i always did this but now that i actually am in a relationship i realize how weird it is. Or if i’m walking home from work by myself i will pretend i’m having a conversation with her about my day, or i will pretend i’m talking to someone else about her. Like literally say the words out loud. It’s weird i know but i don’t care because i love doing it. At night i cuddle my pillow and pretend it’s her and talk to her, not like a conversation with her but just me saying things. god damn i’m so embarrassed to even post this because i know it’s probably weird ass hell and is a psychopath problem, but fuck i get lonely. 
now thinking about it, i do this with everything. I sometimes talk to myself and pretend to explain my job or train a new employee. holy shit"
629,I’m screaming for help and I have no one. I’m planning my suicide at 17,
630,I'm loving the confined lifestyle and I'm not sure I'm going ready for when all will be over,I think I've said everything
631,Intrusive thoughts,"Hello! This past few days I have been plagued with horrible and violent intrusive thoughts. It’s more of stuff I say rather than things I see in my head. I don’t really want to to go into specifics about these thoughts but it’s horrible. I have had a meditation interrupted because I saw something I didn’t like and I’m scared to even look into how to properly manifest, cause I don’t want to manifest these horrible thoughts, cause I tend to dwell on them. Does anyone have any tips?"
632,I haven’t been taking my medicine and it’s been effecting me in so many horrible ways,"I have depression, anxiety and autism. I also have trouble sleeping and I think it may be connected to my other issues, but recently due to lockdown I haven’t been taking my medicine as my schedule is all out of line. I’ve been feeling a lot more down lately but also I can’t sleep. It’s currently 2am and I can’t sleep, however if I take melatonin I don’t have as much trouble. This is more of a PSA to take your medicine I guess I just needed to get it off my chest I dunno"
633,Hearing sounds and voices because of stress?,So I've been hearing things for several months now. In the beginning it was just odd noises that I would only hear now and then. The i started hearing like real voices right by my ear and it hadn't stopped for more than half a year. I've only heard a male voice telling me that I'm sick and dying almost every day and I'm curious if this can be caused by excessive stress.
634,"17, am I going schizo?","I am a 17 year old male. I have had bad anxiety since about 5th grade. The last year and a half have been very stressful, I haven't felt like my old self at all, I've battled dp/dr. I am constantly googling ""schizophrenia test"" ""am i bipolar"" ""am i psychotic"" It's like I have this obsession with being reassured that I'm normal. I think i might be manic but i can tell if I'm struggling with anxiety or psychosis... I just want to be my old self again"
635,Could someone help resolve a small I have issue with this lockdown advice?,"[this video](https://youtu.be/snAhsXyO3Ck) by cgp grey seems like generally good advice for how to stay productive/self improve during lockdown by dividing your living space and time between exercise, sleep, recreation, and creative work, there's only one small problem with it as it applies to me. I play dungeons and dragons as the dungeon master which is both creative and recreational. How should I apply this advice given my predicament?"
636,Can an inferiority complex be cured or will I always suffer from it?,"I think these last years I found the words to express how I always felt: I am inferior to everyone.


Growing up being in the spectrum I was always the quiet and shy kid who did everything wrong, who couldn't defend himself, always criticized for everything. I thought I had improved, which is true, but I still feel inferior and there are many things I suck at that normal people can do. The problem is, all these things are part of everyday life.



Sometimes I feel like there's a conspiracy to make me feel bad, even though I try to avoid it. Must be the mysterious forces of the universe at work. 



I can give you a small story to make you understand the kind of guy I am: when I was kid, I was having dinner at my friend's house. I was trying to peel an apple but couldn't do it properly. Someone laughed, someone frowned at me. I got up and went home crying.



Now I can't go home anymore because I am an adult, I have to take every hit. Every comment about my parking skill and eating with sticks. And I practiced them but still isn't as good as it should be.



I absolutely show all the symptoms of inferiority complex: I always compare myself to others, I am never happy for them, I am only happy for myself If I am better than others, I tend to hide myself, I am extremely sensitive to criticism, I want to fade in the background.


I secretely don't want people to have success in life. I want them to shy away, to be made fun of and not defend themselves. I don't want them to have confidence and assertiveness not evena a bit. How dare they make a comment/joke at me?



Like, sometimes I can't even listen to a specific kind of music because I am envious of the attention the musicians are getting.


My inferiority complex has led to me to sometimes feel cynic, angry, dark, negative. 


I also realized where I come from: low-middle social class, with probably narcissistic (but not evil) father and aspie mother. 



I read a lot of articles on the Internet but nothing seems to help. They all seem to consider inferiority complex as an idea you have. 


Like, no. I am inferior and it's not a distorted view. I lack social skills, am traumatized, I close myself to people, I lack general knowledge, general life skills. I am bizarre, probably the most bizarre person I know. 


I definitely have some positive characteristics and skills but they mean nothing to me. I feel like it's expected of me to have at least some positive thing, so they mean nothing to me.


I considered going to therapy, but it costs too much and I don't want to drain my wallet for nothing. I already went to a therapist a couple of years ago because my mother wanted to do (despite me not wanting to) and it didn't help at all. If anything, I added the therapist to the list of people to distrust.


Maybe some people are just doomed to suffer. At times I feel like I don't even want to be helped anymore, I just want to beat up someone."
637,What do you say to people with mental health issues?,"In the last 6 months I have had 4 different people confess to me that they were/are dealing with mental health issues (3 strangers online and 1 friend of mine).

It mostly starts out as a normal conversation but then it gets to more serious stuff about issues they are having with family or school and after that they talk about how they are just not doing well mentally. I always try to be as open and accepting as possible. I try not to be super shocked and stay calm and ask questions if they stop talking. It's kinda hard for me to know what to say cause I really want to help them and I feel like it's my responsibility because they trusted me enough to talk about it.  I always get anxious because it feels like what I say could mean live or death (there was one of them who said that they were planning to end it the next day but didn't cause I helped them and that really shook me down to my core). I'm only 17 and I don't feel qualified to actually be able to help them.

The problem is that most of them have said they don't want to see a therapist because of trust issues and bad experiences in the past plus they don't feel close enough to their friends or family / don't want others to be worried about them. So they have only told me or other strangers. Another thing is that all of them are under 18, most of them around the age of 13/14 so they live with their parents and don't have any money or freedom to go to a therapist even if they wanted to.

So I guess my question is: What is the best thing I can say to help them, not just the people I've already talked to but also any that I may talk to in the future?"
638,My teenage neighbor can't stop making noises and it's slowly driving me mad,"So, our apartment has quite thin walls, I guess. In the apartment below, in my room, lives a teenage boy.

And he is very, very loud. He may literally spend all day playing with a cat or a dog or some video game and making loud noises - barking, screeching, squealing, banging, yelping... you get the idea. It happens like every couple minutes or so, sometimes even more frequently.

Years ago, I used to ignore it. I even found it funny somehow, not taxing at all.

But over the years my mental health declined quite much, up to the point where now I shake internally every time I hear his loud noises. I am so tuned now to them, I can't even stop listening, can't stop being focused - and not react every time I hear them. 

Even while watching a movie, I might hear some remote noises of his, and I get irritated and angry and terrified of what a mess I became.

And now we are quarantined and I'm stuck in my room 24/7 every day... And so is he... With no school to go to. So, it's even worse now.

Sadly, I do not believe that talking to him is an option, since he is not really violating any law... I once made a comment about his loud music, and he started banging on the walls even louder.

I just want to become normal again. Is there any way I can change my focus? Become desensitized to these noises again? Not flinch every time I hear them? I am really scared that I'm becoming obsessed to the level that I can't think of anything else for hours on.

Any ideas?"
639,Setting boundaries,"I’ve recently made a list of things I want to work on with my counselor, and setting boundaries is number one on the list. 

I’ve come across a couple things- 
-5 Boundaries to Set: emotional, material, time and energy, mental and physical. 
-“I value ____, so I will need ____, and will honor it by ____.” 

Are there any things you do to help set boundaries with yourself and others? Any ideas you found helpful or even things you tried that didn’t really work for you are welcome 😊"
640,I don't know what to do and I need help and rant,"I have been diagnosed with PTSD and a host of other things. I've been feeling quite depressed for a while and I have been isolating myself in this drawing from everyone, I don't trust anyone, I don't really take care of myself. I don't enjoy anything and I'm having a hard time feeling my emotions and when I do I don't know what to do with them. The Mental Health Organization I'm with is not taking care of me the way I would like them to and I feel that they're neglecting me. Medications do not work I have tried them for a long time but they are ineffective. The only thing that seems to work is therapy and I only meet her once a week. I have enormous trust issues. I had opened up to someone and they walked out on me and now I'm having a hard time opening up to anyone. I have honestly been suicidal for a while and my thoughts run around in circles and circles and circles and I can't really seem to get them to stop I'm really sick of thinking but I can't stop thinking. Whenever I try and do something that actually helps it helps for a bit but then it doesn't. In fact I've been several relationships that were bad relationships and my trust has further been broken. I basically tried every religion every philosophy every coping skill which I hate coping skills cuz that just means that you do something else to distract yourself and it just creates more problems. I'm honestly at my wit's end hoping that something will help me feel better or good or relief or something. I haven't cried in 8 years I haven't truly felt my emotions for a very long time because I grew up in abusive cult and I completely repressed my emotions for basically my entire life. And I know that the majority of my issues are emotional as are all other mental health issues emotional. All of my emotions seem to be coming out in various weird ways that are unhealthy and I have trouble expressing them in constructive healthy way and honestly I don't know where to really start. I know that I'm heavily disassociated from my own thoughts and my emotions and feelings and my body because whenever I'm in my body I'm in excruciating pain. In fact I am suffering from depersonalization and derealization because right now I'm just watching myself do all these things and I can't seem to control what my body does I can want to do something but my body just doesn't do it. I can't sleep. I keep having nightmares. I'm having an enormous trouble eating anything I've always hated eating. I don't enjoy food. I don't know really how to make friends. Because of the way I grew up I was completely isolated my entire life with parents and friends and teachers who abused me my entire life and I don't know how to really talk to people other than when I need something very specific or there's a crisis. That was the only time I ever got any interaction when there is a big crisis going on. I spent the majority of my life on the internet and I'm sick of being on the internet. I've been on the internet for so long that it no longer has what I need and I'm afraid to say, the internet does not have all the answers I can assure you I've been on it for a very long time LOL. Although contradictorily enough I'm on the internet right now seeking help so perhaps I'm invalid in that assumption LOL. All jokes aside though. I don't really know how to have relationships or to make friends I don't even know what that looks like. I haven't enjoyed anyting in years maybe since I was 11 years old. I know that after I had brain surgery everything changed and they've never been the same. Be quite honest everybody expects me to do everything by myself but I can't do that. I can only do so much and people think that because I'm extremely high-functioning autistic person that I don't have autism cuz they probably feel that I'm neurotypical but I'm not. I have trouble communicating and the only reason I can communicate so well is because I thought all this out very thoroughly and it's very practiced but when it comes to communicating what's going on with myself that's when it's difficult. It was never safe growing up and I couldn't trust anyone including my parents in fact everyone was literally out to get me growing up and that makes me feel incredibly unsafe and I don't feel safe where I live. I have expressed these things too Mental Health Organization I work with and they don't seem to be really doing much or helping at all despite knowing this. To be quite frank they just want everyone to stay in their system and rely on them for everything from what I have observed. The people I'm with is the Nord Center and they are very incompetent if I do say so myself. I was talking to a social worker here and she said she no longer wanted to hear about my feelings when she was the first person I ever opened up to and started trusting and that hurted very great deal especially when she lied about what she said."
641,I genuinely believe I'm losing my sanity.,"For the past couple of years, I haven't been able to truly live my life due to school, a surgery, and being (Wrongly) locked in juvie + a psych ward.

During this time I had very little freedom, including after seeing as I was on probation.

Not only was I framed, but the guy who framed me was a pedo teacher who the school is protecting (long story). 

After being locked up and put on probation for something I didn't do, and after going through a deeply depressive and suicidal period, I thought I was going to live my life, then the damn world ends.

What's the point in having a life you can't live?

I just have so much anxiety because of everything that I genuinely think I'm losing my sanity.

I can't get to a therapist, I can't find any medication that works, and (not even exaggerating) think I'm starting to see shit again.

When I was little, I saw shit all the time, but it went away as I got older. Now I'm genuinely seeing shit I don't wanna see.

My mind constantly races at a million miles a minute, and things only get worse by the day.

Do many things weigh on my mind. The virus, the news, my family, my brother, my probation, my health, loneliness, online work, the economy, everything, and there's no help for it.

I haven't been like this in a long time, if not ever."

643,I keep having messed up episodes of rage,"I've never posted here before. It's so sad how I have to reach out to strangers rn as I'm in ghost mode. Sorry if it's all wrong.

Background info:
27yo Female. Left home at 16. Currently back home on the sofa until I can move into my own room at the end of the month.
Abusive father (mental/physical)
Alcoholic mother
4 younger siblings
Bullied for being fat by family and friends
Sexually assaulted

I've had a history of going into rage mode...it happens once every few months. Then follows days of feeling like shit and like I want to die. (I know I don't really want to die, sucks to not be alive right?) But the feeling is there. Then I'll go buy loads of unessesary shit to make myself feel better, even if I have no money (currently in 18k debt due to borrowing for.no fucking reason).

I'm so overwhelmed so I'm just gonna go from what happened today.

Recently I came off my meds (50mg setraline) as I thought I could cope. I was doing fine.

Today. Today was just. Today in the morning my dad told my mum he was going to bang her in when he got home, because she wanted him to leave. This is a normal occurance in this house. I came downstairs, and because there was a stain on my sofa (was keeping it in the back room until I moved out) and I literally flipped my shit.
Like, nothing mattered anymore, I felt like my brain was swelling to the size of a watermelon. I was screaming at my family and said so many nasty things and just couldn't stop, the words kept coming and coming and I just felt like smashing the place up (nearly did) and then smashing myself up (kinda happened).

This is the first episode I've had in a few weeks.

I decided to get my meds again. I literally don't know what to do. I don't feel like myself, I feel like this bitter angry person who everyone hates and I fucking hate everyone.

I'm scared to have children. Imagine if I had an episode like that with my child around me?? 

I was waiting for therapy, but then the virus happened so I think I'll be waiting a year or some shit for it. It can't be helped. I just need some love or some help I don't fucking know because my heart is so heavy rn it hurts and I feel like I have no support during the crises. Can't even hug my SO.

644,Overthinking Constantly - Where Does Overthinking Come From &amp; How Overthinking Works [ADVANCED],"So you want to stop overthinking right? But are you sure? 🤔

Because I know that there's a part of you that wants to stop, and another part of you that wants to keep going.

The first step to get rid of overthinking is to stop trying to get rid of it and to really understand what is going on inside of you and the internal mechanics on a deep level. 🧠

Watch this video and learn how overthinking works and where overthinking comes from so you're not just coping with it, but you're conquering yourself.

Because when these conflicts in you are resolved, overthinking goes away effortlessly, AUTOMATICALLY and INDIRECTLY without you trying to directly get rid of it and fight it and drain your energy in this endless battle along the way.

Enjoy! Here's the video [https://youtu.be/UNQpPmCio3c](https://youtu.be/UNQpPmCio3c)

Let me know if you have any questions and how i can further help you in the comments below :)"
645,"Who has written 'The note""","As title says, I've had, am having thoughts. Seems my mind and imagination is helping me to map out the scene and end result. My experiences to date are probably nothing compared to most but I see no way out. It's pathetic  honestly but my brain is/has short-circuited and I see no hope. I have a loving wife, she is great she really is, dumb as an ox but my counter-part. I've tried to teach her, failed I think but I don't know. All I do know is I can't climb out of this dark pit. I want to make a video, saying sorry to the loved ones I have, before I remove the disappointment that I am. So that's it.. I'm probably massively over-reacting to my situation but it's who I am, I deal in absolutes as it's a survival mechanism for me. I have nothing left to offer or give."
646,i think my insecurities are going to be the reason i kill myself,i don’t know what to do. all i get everyday from my family is why do you eat so much why are you such a pig you’re useless you don’t do anything. and then when i try to confront my parents about it they just cry and say they’re bad parents and make me feel guilty. everytime i look at myself i want to throw up i find myself sickening to look at and i don’t know what to do and i’m really struggling to keep afloat. it ruining my relationship with my s/o and my friends and when i talk to my siblings they just think i’m being dramatic and tell me to get over it. and i just really wish i didn’t exist
647,How to open up and stop invalidating my emotions?,"Hi I (f16) am having alot of trouble with opening up to psychologists and therapists. I’ve gone to many different therapist but it somehow always ends up with us talking about stuff that doesnt actually help me (like they just tell me to eat more and be happy, atleast thats what all the advice i get sounds to me in my head). I try to open up but I can never put what I feel and think into words. I feel like I’m really ashamed that I have depression, I’ve always been the type of person that’s mostly happy and social around people. 
I keep thinking that I’m a lazy brat for being depressed  and always shame myself for the way I feel and think. I’ve tried doing cognitive behaviour therapy but it didnt work at all, I feel like im not being understood correctly. And when I say that I feel like i’m not being understood, I just feel like an angsty annoying teenager.

My grades are going to shit and it makes me feel like I’m a waste of space. I try to be good, i want to be a good student and a good daughter but I don’t know why I can’t. My parents are ashamed of me for not having good grades.

I just constantly overthink, like ”what if I’m just being oversensitive and i’m not actually depressed”. 
I can’t even trust my own emotions. 

Can anyone please tell me what im supposed to do?"
648,Feel like I'm in an endless cycle worrying about death,"I've been feeling bad for 9 weeks now. I'm taking medicine, seen a doctor, and got therapy. I can't stop thinking about death. I'm terrified that I can't guarantee my own survival this pandemic. Death seems both horrifying and inescapable.

I was watching the old videos of the cystic fibrosis activist Claire Wineland. She described a near-death experience with respiratory failure, followed by 3 week medically induced coma. She said you can't do anything to prepare for death. That it's natural to die in a state of horror and grief.

Death has never seemed so close as it has during this pandemic. It's made me hyper sensitive to every little feeling. Are any of you worried about death? How do you console yourself?"
649,How do you confront someone that doesn't like/want to be confronted?,"So I am not close to my brother, he left me emotionally a couple of years ago and started to get distant. He is actually closer to his friends than to me. I confronted him maybe a year or two ago and he just straight up denied it and made up some random BS which I didn't believe. I told him what I felt like was happening to our relationship and he said not to worry. The relationship is already strained but, what I wanted to know is how could I have handle this situation better? I have been bullied in the past and so I don't feel comfortable being open/vulnerable to people. I also have a hard time saying what I really want to say.

Thanks"
650,i'm close to giving up,"my (16f) mother is the alpha and omega of my suffering. 

she and my father divorced when i was little; she neglected me and sent me to a whole country across the sea (america) when i was only seven, and now she's trying to make up for it by treating me as if i'm her husband or something. this includes being petty against me, showing me constant affection, coming to me for emotional support, gaslighting me, etc.  i'm aware that this is a form of emotional incest, but since ive become heavily educated on human psychology from experience, it's made me realize what deep of a hole i'm stuck in. 

i've been back in my home country for a few months now. every day, i wish i could go back, even if it means living with the physical, sexual, and psychological abuse i endured there. the CPS laws in Turkey aren't that great. beating your children is often preached and made fun of around here.

i've since made plans to go back to the US and report my family to proper authorities, but i just feel so.. done. being aware of my mom's behaviour and the effects it would cause on me, a teenager, is just tiring. i know what she's doing and i know what it'd do to me, had i not known about her antics in the first place. i'm glad i know a lot about these subjects, but not being able to do anything about it and watching myself get exposed to these things while knowing the consequences is tearing me apart."
651,Friend diagnosed with clinical depression,"Not picking up the phone (likely that the phone's switched off)...not responding to whatapp messages

Mutual friend also went AFK for the entire Sunday evening..tried to ask what's going on

What should I do?

I lost 2 friends to this soul-sucking mental/psychological illness already, I don't want to lose a third one."
652,Hmphh,"So i think im using this as a space to vent and shout my thoughts. If i suddenly delete these posts then thats probably why.

Anyway, i was talking to my brother aboit inner dialog which ig im bot very normal.

Ig i take talking to myself to the next level cause it isnt just my inner monolog, its like multiple people? And i argue with them a lot and we have conversations and i cant actually control them at all.

It can be rlly hard for me to meditate and stuff bc they can get rlly “loud”.

The arent external voices though and its ONLY internal which is why i dont know if it would be considered schizophrenia? Like the “others” can talk and have their own opinions and i can have a full on conversation with them or argument. Idk, all of this is a lik bit too much and im starting to think im lying to myself.

Sometimes its rlly quiet and i cant “hear” them anymore which always makes me a lil upset until i can “hear” them again.

Its a lil bit overwelming tbh with everything. The “voices” arent rlly the bug issue but idk whats happening and need to collect these thoughts anyway"
653,My mother told me that the only reason she hasn’t killed her self is because of me and my sister.,"My mom has always struggled with mental illness and I’ve always known it. . It probably has something to do with her abusive boyfriend who calls her names constantly. She hates him and the only reason she stays with him is because she’s my sisters dad and she doesn’t drive. 

When she told me she that the only reason she hasn’t killed her self is because of me and my sister, it made me sick to my stomach upset. I tried to keep it together for her and my sister. She went on to compare herself to her sisters, say more awful things about herself, and tell me about how she’s disappointed with her career ( she didn’t graduate high school). 

This has made me a perfectionist. I’m so afraid to be anything like my mother. Grades have to be perfect. I have to plan everything to a t and if anything goes wrong I feel. anxious. Surprises make me panic. No time for friends. No time for Sports or clubs. I’m so afraid to turn out like my mother that I can’t relax. I’m a sophomore and I just want to be a normal kid."
654,Just started adderall,"My psychiatrist told me that she thinks I may have inattentive type ADHD on Thursday (My therapist and I had previously attributed those symptoms to OCD, as there are some commonalities), and I started adderall on Friday. It’s honestly been incredible to see how much it helps. I’m able to sit through a task instead of bouncing around to different ones, I can prioritize tasks, and I’m able to start tasks instead of feeling too overwhelmed to begin. I’m actually finishing homework I’m a timely manner, and I’ve been able to actually sit down and study for my finals week. My psychiatrist said that I would see a drastic difference right away, but I certainly didn’t expect this. I’m really grateful and encouraged."
655,What do I do in this situation?,
656,How should I help my mom?,"I’m a person diagnosed with depression who has been undergoing treatment for the past few months. I’ve never felt better and only regret not doing it sooner, but I’m very worried about my mother.

When I was going through issues and would try to tell her that I wasn’t feeling well she would just seem to ignore it or she would basically just tell me to get over it because everyone else has to deal with the same things. One time I told her I feel ‘empty’ and she told me that every morning she wakes up and wishes she was dead. She’s also become increasingly bitter and hostile to society at large and chosen to isolate herself more. A few days ago she was feeling sick and my dad made a joke about and she said that life’s not worth living anyway.

Yesterday I was in her room because that’s the only way to get to the second floor bathroom and I saw her journal lying open on the bed. I read a little bit and it was very...bleak. I flipped through and it was just page after page of misery for months and months. I was like the stuff I wrote in my journal when I was at my lowest point.

I know she’s gone on anti-depressants in the past, but says she stopped taking them because they didn’t work. I talked to my therapist a little about this and she suggested she should go to therapy, but she seems very cynical about the idea; when I told her I was going to therapy she got this guilty look on her face like she felt she had failed as a mother.

Mother’s Day is next week and I want to do something to help her. Any advice?"
657,Things Piling Up,"I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and told my parents about it. My mum was barely ok with it, stating how she wont have any grandchildren from me (not that i even wanted kids in the first place) and my dad ranted to me about how all i do is overreact on everything and force it on them. They completely disregarded the fact that my sister also has this condition and has had it for over 10 years. Tonight i talked to my friend about asking a friend i really like whether they like me and she shot me down with the classic ""not to be blunt"" then proceeds to be hella blunt. this usually wouldnt bother me, but i cant be that blunt with her. The other day my other friend (who all my friends are fairly certain has munchausens) told everyone that she has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia with major depressive disorder and bipolar. I guess my point is, no one believes in me and whenever i try to speak to anyone about how i feel they make it about themselves (which i dont usually care) but i feel i need them to just listen. not necessarily reply. but just listen. I feel like its a burden for them to \*constantly have to make sure she is ok\* i know i am probably overreacting, but what do others do in this situation?"
658,Procrastination (heavy),"I'm a junior in college and procrastination is affecting my grade too much now. I can usually get stuff done, but it will be very last minute. This part has never been too much of a problem though.

However, when I get overwhelmed with the amount of course work (nearly 100% of the time), rather than trying to get it done I just let the deadlines pass. I will open a document, start typing, and then stop in the middle of a paragraph/question and go do something else. I just can't find the motivation to keep on going.

I feel really dumb, because this is the only thing I really want to improve but never make any progress on. It's like there's a fight inside my brain. I'll force myself to sit-down and work on it, but I will just sit there doing nothing instead for hours at a time. Not even being able to think about the problem. Sort of like a part of my brain is a pouting child refusing to partake, and the other part is like the parent trying to force them to.

My first year of college was fine. I'd study and do work ahead of time. During my sophomore year I had depression. The weird thing is that I was still able to do stress work and get most things done. I would still just do the bare minimum to pass during this time though (getting mostly just C's). Finally I managed to get rid of the my depression for junior year. I thought I would have an easier time now since I actually feel happy most of the time. It's gotten worse though. Now I tend to not even bother with a lot of it and I end up getting lower than C's. I'm only getting saved by the curve, just barely allowing me to pass classes. This semester I think I will fail at least one. 

*I would greatly appreciate some suggestions*. I've already tried a lot of guides on getting over procrastination with no luck, so I have tried a lot of generic stuff.

TLDR: Look at third paragraph"
659,I would just like to recommend the book reasons to stay alive by Matt Haig.,"I know this may not help or you may have read it already but I think it is an extremely Insightful look into someone who has suffered severe depression and anxiety and how he now lives his life.

If you're not much of a reader then audible do a 30 day free trial which you get a credit for 1 free book. It's very easy to listen to whilst out and about or traveling.

I hope this helps."
660,How to address my girlfriend’s mental health to her,"Me and my girlfriend have been going through a lot recently, especially since lockdown. 

She always sees the worst in me and always thinks I’m flirting with other girls and not showing her love. She thinks she is unlovable.

Over the past few weeks she has gone from saying she doesn’t want me (breaking up with me) to saying she does. Last week she even said her final decision was made and she didn’t want to be with me anymore, but then when I asked her about this a couple of days ago (after her saying she wanted to try with me again) she said she didn’t even remember saying that (she doesn’t remember a lot of stuff she says/does).

She was put on antidepressants a couple of months ago which have helped in some aspects, but she seems to be getting worse again. 

Does anybody have any idea what might be the problem here and how might I bring up the conversation with her, as she doesn’t like speaking about it?"
661,I just hate myself today,"I started a partial hospitalization program last week which so far I think has been helping but I wasn't able to enroll until Thursday so I'm still a newbie to it.

There is hardly anyone I feel like I can share about it with and I know it's not the kind of thing you share with everyone but for instance my family cannot handle it and yet they still want to maintain a relationship with me so they ask me questions about my day and I have to make up answers.

Any friends I think I have left probably are dealing with too much and don't want to hear from me.

The pain is unbearable but nobody cares and why should they because we're in a pandemic."
662,Existential Crisis,"I feel as though I have had this persistent existential crisis since I was about 11...that's 20+ years of just wondering what the point of being alive is. I've gotta say, it's quite ridiculous, but I have not found a satisfying answer for myself. I have learned that I ascribe value and worth to my life based on work or productivity. So, if I'm working (teaching) then life is ok, and there is meaning (although I'm aware there is minimal lasting meaning in work). If I am not working, life has no point. Therefore, weekends are typically incredibly difficult, unless I make a random project for myself. This pandemic has been difficult as well. Though I am still working, it has been very different, and much less productive, so even work doesn't seem like much of a reason  for living.

My ideas regarding others and their value as human beings is very different than how I feel about myself. For others, they have value simply because they are. All humans have value, regardless of what they do.

I realize that there is a huge disconnect between my views of myself versus how I view others. I guess I say all this because I have some questions I'd like to ask, and hopefully receive some feedback. 

What is the point of being alive? 
How do you ascribe value to your life?
How can/do you practice just being (instead of always having to do)?"
663,"In this subreddit you barely get any advice, I've posted twive and no one even replied",And I can see that I'm not the only one
664,Does it ever get better?,"I don't want to say that I hate my life because that would make me feel ungrateful; I have everything I need and I guess it is my decision to just sit around and do nothing all day. But the thing is, even when I do something I don't feel satisfied. Nothing makes me feel happy or accomplished anymore. Why should I do anything if it feels completely pointless to me? Or maybe these are just things I'm convincing myself of to make me feel better about being lazy?


I've posted here many times these past months. Most of the time I contemplate whether I'm depressed, but my mind always comes up with a way to write it off as laziness. I don't care anymore. I just want it to stop. But does it ever stop? How could anything stop this nihilism that seems so deeply etched into my very being? 


I look back to last year and can't believe I once had motivation and interests. Either I have simply led myself to become who I was always bound to be (a failure) or this is a condition I can treat. It just seems so unrealistic that something like antidepressants could pull me away from this spiral. How could anything ever make me feel again when I'm this deeply unsatisfied with everything?"
665,Tips for when bad mental health affects appetite?,"I have this really bad habit of not eating properly when I go through bouts of depression or bad days with my OCD. It’s not that I’m intentionally trying to starve myself, more that these things affect my appetite so much that eating feels almost impossible. I’ll go days on end of eating just one “meal” (I use that loosely as some days it’s hardly enough to even constitute a meal,) if I eat anything at all. Even when I am eating properly I’m fairly thin and underweight, and recently I’ve lost about 5lbs (I’ve gained one of it back.) Does anyone else here experience similar issues? What have you done to help it?"

667,Self diagnosed schizo (waiting for doctors referral) Need advice and feel free to ask any questions!,"Hey, this is my first post here and am looking for advice.

So I had my first psychotic break a few months back and I’ve been struggling with it ever since, some weeks can be great where as some are quite bad.

The first episode was after taking some LSD at a party which after a few hours resulted in me thinking that my friends were insulting me and trying to turn me insane, I eventually left and got a taxi home in which this continued with extreme paranoia and thinking they were somehow still insulting me through the radio 😂 I got home and after a few restless hours on the come down got some sleep and woke up the next day feeling very confused. I rang a friend to verify whether any of this was true and was told no, I was just sat there silent looking at everyone (this is where I was probably hearing the insults)

Anyway a few days went by and I started to return to some state of normality, I still get some feelings of paranoia to do with other things but quickly dismiss them in my head and don’t believe any of the delusions.

The situations I’m having now is that I am getting some tactile hallucinations like little insects on my legs at night as well as some visuals in my peripheral vision such as dark spots on walls and the occasional flash in the corner of my eye, it isn’t all day long it tends to happen when I’m not doing anything and not distracted.

I can pretty much deal with this as it doesn’t bother me much but the thing that’s getting to me most is my speech, I’m struggling to have conversations. When I’m listening to people I have a huge build of anxiety because I don’t wanna fuck up and mistakes and as you can imagine this causes me to fuck up 😂 My words either come out wrong, I say them in the wrong order or it’s a blend between 2 words. What’s the best way to fix this? It’s really impacting me and stopping me from wanting to be social or have conversations in case it happens again. Last week I seemed to be getting better but it’s came back to haunt me again

So any advice Reddit? It’d be much appreciated

Oh and last question, if I am fully diagnosed I feel like I’ll be a high functioning schizo, what’s the medication like? Would it fix my cluster of thoughts and speech?"
668,"Depression, school, just some things i have to say about my situation","Ocasionally, my mind starts to gaslight me, Making me question wether im actually troubled, or faking everything just so i can have it easy. However, in that case they wouldn't have prescribed me seronil just like that then. I know that my brain making me question everything is it's tactic to keep me trapped; i've lived trough this feeling before. It still makes me feel messy and a bit bummed though, but i am at least able to aknowledge that this isn't the end of the world.

I have a couple of things that are supposed to be due today, and for me, there is only about 5 hours left of this day. Just thinking about doing these things puts me into anxiety, even though my mother told me that i shouldn't focus on school during weekends, expecially with what's going on in my life. I mean, they're 3-4 Physical ed things, as well as a book-review for my finnish classes, that not doing would probably deal a big blow to my grades, but...

I think i should be able to survive. I still have my 9th grade ahead to fix my grades. Hopefully the next summer vacation is enough time for me to get better at handling my depression.

If you really took your time to read this, just you know that if it weren't for you, others wouldn't be able to express their feelings out here, cause what would be the point if no-one notices anyway? You make a huge difference, even if you don't know what to say. Just you know, you're being appreciated. Thanks. ❤️"

674,My dad and both of my dogs are all dying.,"I moved out in june 2018 to live in California with my long term bf. I moved back December 30 2019 when my dad was hospitalized.

Every day that passes, I become more and more depressed. My dad is 77 and has dementia. He's also been refusing to treat a bone infection for 6 months now. And his dementia is progressing more each day. He went from being able to drive perfectly to hitting our fence within a week. He can no longer drive. It's not safe. I'm doing everything for him, from cooking, cleaning, taking him to drs appointments and generally just making sure he doesn't injure himself. At one point the dishwasher broke so he put dirty dishes in the washing machine and broke most of the glass and ceramic. He put his clothes in the washing machine after taking out the big pieces and ended up with cuts all over his body from small glass and ceramic bits being embedded in his clothes.

One of my dogs is 11 years old and is dying from heart failure. The vet says it's likely because my dad had been feeding my dogs fast food almost everyday during the year and a half I lived in a different state and didn't take them to the vet for checkups or when they started to show symptoms of illness. The only vet closest to me who could treat her is a 6 mile drive away and I was quoted visits, treatments, and most likely surgery would cost $2500+.

My other dog is 17 and she's dying of lung cancer. This dog has been with me since I was a child. She on more than one occasion has stopped me from offing myself in the past. She knocked the bottle out of my hands every time. According to the vet, it started off as kennel cough, then it progressed to bronchitis, and it is now lung cancer. My dad never took her in for any of this. I found out in January that her treatments (medication and chemo) would cost upwards of $7k+. I cannot afford this. I can't afford to heal my dogs or even make them comfortable.

I'm simultaneously angry and sad because to an extent, he just wasn't able to care for them properly. When I left for California, he was fully independent. By the time I came back, things were really bad. He told me he noticed the dogs were ill but if he ignored it and kept feeding them fast food it would eventually go away. I know his logic is severely skewed due to the dementia but, I'm still angry at him for not mentioning it before it got this bad. I'm mad he didn't ask for help when he clearly needed it. I'm mad he's allowed my dogs to die in terrible ways. They're in pain and I can't even afford their pain medication.

My GP told me I don't need counseling or therapy for any of this and to just keep moving forward. I'm mad at him too. And because of the pandemic, my insurance won't let me transfer to another dr. No one is taking new patients at the moment.

I'm really close to a complete mental breakdown and don't know what to do. I'm angry, depressed, anxious... my soul is dying.. there's a massive hole in my chest..."
675,Feels like my minds deteriorating. I could use a hand.,"Just to jump right into it I am a 29 year old male living on my own far from my hometown. I can say that for most my life I have gone through the years with episodes of anxiety, depression, and hyper-vigilance. Much like an emotional roller coaster. Lately I feel it has become so bad that my memory has become impaired as for my hand eye coordination and my approach to relationships. Instead of writing a lifetime novel I have decided to start jotting down daily problems I have in small spurts so as to not exhaust or over extend myself and any possible reader. I'm open to all questions and recommendations but mostly I wish to get the problems out and into the open as a sort of therapy since i don't have the means of obtaining the conventional kind. I am of course American and because of the pandemic I am unemployed waiting to be approved for unemployment and there fore I am not eligible for socialized healthcare at this time.  Anyway, here's what I've jotted down in the past two days.

*I cant keep a job, because i show up late, i become overwhelmed easily, and i generally have issues bonding and relating to my coworkers

*I have hardly any interest in anything beyond sitting at home watching tv. Even video games have become tiresome and tedious

*im mistrustful of others and crowds and being around strangers deep down scares the hell out of me, in fact when i go in public  i secretly wish no one can see me

*im so focused on myself that im obsessed over my mental health, how i look, how im seen, and yet at the same time im such a wreck that i dont have the will or energy to take care of myself or stick to any schedule or routine.

* im obsessed with porn. Ive tried to abstain from it for years but i always come back to it. When I allow myself to I will obsessively browse and download it for most of the day for weeks at a time, hardly leaving the house or taking care of basic needs such as eating, cleaning, washing, and sleeping. The side effects of this habit continued over many years has given me erectile dysfunction, a low sex drive, and a warped perception of my sexuality and women.

*My inadequacies cause me to be hyper vigilante and sensitive 
towards percieved slights 

* I always have had a hard time reading people and their intentions and that has resulted in others perceiving me as naive and perhaps even slow or idiotic. Growing up this has caused me to be bullied by peers.

*Ive always been sensitive, even though I can logically understand teasing as a sort of social grooming device I seem to take things to heart and I have trouble deciphering if a person means me harm when teasing me or if they are in fact taking a hurtful jab at me. 

* I am cautious about meeting new people and making friends but those that i feel I can trust and be around never seem to want to be around. It always seems like Im the one calling and asking to hang and never the other way around.

Disclaimer; I am currently abstaining successfully from porn and drug use and I do not see these things as being the root of my problems but rather symptoms of a deeper issue as well as  poor choices of coping."
676,Mental health issue related to memories in general ?,"I am writing this to see if anyone else has a similar issue. I am 34 and my memories cause me a lot of pain. I've always had an excellent long term memory, and around age 27 I realized that I felt that I was at 'capacity' and wondered how I would handle more memories. The truth is- I can't.  I had a happy childhood, and good things happened in my life along with the bad, so it's not the quality of the memories themselves. Some of my memories are flat out beautiful, but the nostalgia is unbearable. Some are awful, and I suffer from them as if they had just happened. There's no such thing as a happy memory because memories usually gives me pain. I do have depression, but it generally well treated. I take good care of myself and I have good coping skills. But one of my worst triggers is going over my memories and things that happened to me in the past. I feel like this has gotten worse, and I've decided to make a concerted effort to forget. I also don't want to lose these fragments of the past, but they're preventing me from functioning."
677,I don't know what's happening,"The last few weeks i AM starting to geel really lonely even thought I have enough contact with friends and family i just feel like i died inside, i feel so empty and numb.
And i cry myself asleep.
I Just wanna know what's wrong with me in so stressed out about the situation i normally don't even like being around people.

Please if somebody knows why am feeling this wat please tell me. This is really tearing my soul apart."
678,Idk who to turn to,"So I have pretty much removed myself from all social media minus Reddit. If it’s even really considered social media. Doing so has shown me that I have basically no real friends. Nobody other than my wife and parents go out of their way to reach out to me. It has shown me who genuinely cares or likes me. I have one other friend who is my absolute best friend and bas been for over 15 years. The bad part about him is he lets his wife convince him that I’m not a real friend. They were moving some things in their house yesterday and I offered to come lend a hand. She straight up denied it. The worst part is, he was gonna say yes but as soon as she spoke up he changed tunes quickly. I thought to myself “nobody denies help with physical exertion” so I showed up to make sure they didn’t really need help. She (buddy’s wife) proceeded to chew my ass out for not “obeying her wishes”. This all happened while my wife was at work at her new job (3rd shift 12 hour shift) in one of the worst parts of the town she works in. With the stress of my best friend’s denial of me and my wife in a dangerous area, I said fuck it and drank some alcohol. This was after 3 months of sobriety. I feel like complete and utter human waste."
679,"uhh,, ??","Hi,, uhh recently I've had my mother point out a trend in my emotions?? and I wanna know if its all normal or something that I should try looking into?

I have no in-between my emotions, no middle ground. Its either i feel completely void and emotionless or hyper every emotion bumped up by 30 and more and i can do everything and oh my god! but I switch relatively quickly in-between those two, it fucking really sucks. I just really want some advice. Because I just want to have my middle ground back and not snap at the drop of a stick. 

ALSO!! how fun more news lol, I tried to get intact with a mental health service which I did get initially referred to but i slept through all the calls so in have to get referred again, how fun. I just wish i was useful."
680,My mom,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here I don't know here else to post it, I just need somewhere to vent. My mom is a very toxic negitive person, who also always has to be right. I'm only 16 but I try to be as best of a daughter I can, because I grew up with my older sister who was a VERY bad child. But she constantly talks down to me and refuses to have a genuine conversation with me because anything I say is wrong unless it's something she wants to hear. She makes me feel like such a problem child but the thing is I realise I'm not, I get bad grades and am sometimes moody but I don't drink or sneak out or steal from her or yell and break things. I try my best to be her ideal ""perfect child"" Like she wants but I can't. I struggle a lot with mental illness and health issues but she doesn't take it seriouse and I don't know what to do because being around her mentally drains me because she is constantly negative and acting as if she is better than everyone else."
681,I’m not doing so well,"This is really strange to me. Venting online to people I don’t know but I think I’m just really desperate. I’m sorry if nothing I say makes any sense or if I don’t do something right. 
  
   My mental health has never been the best.  I don’t think there was a time where I truly felt happy. I have short happy moments but they don’t last. the last time I felt so bad was around November. it had started in early May and just lingered. right now I’m in a bad spot. I feel so numb. my body is reacting to everyone and everything physically but emotionally I can’t feel anything. I’m barely talking to anyone and I’m barely getting out of bed. I’m not sure what to do at this point. I want to ask for help but I’m too afraid. I’m afraid of telling my mom. I don’t want to be a burden. She’s an essential worker right now and she’s so tired all the time from work. I don’t want to be another problem for her. I can’t find anyone to talk to. I don’t know what to do. I’m pushing everyone away and I just don’t know what to do."
682,Am I in the early stages of schizophrenia?,"Last weekend I woke up Saturday morning just feeling down, everything seemed hopeless and I just felt extremely negative about everything, I have never felt this way before because I've never been depressed before. I also should mention I had tripped on acid a month before which still is having effects on me like questioning reality and a lot of overthinking. My mind all week has been racing to the thought I'm in the early stages of schizophrenia since the symptoms of what I'm feeling (everyone tells me it's depression) are similar to the effects of schizophrenia in the very early stages.

Basically what I'm wanting to know is, what should I do? Should I just ride this out and keep reminding telling that it's just my new perception caused by LSD? Should I see a doctor? It so, is online therapists enough to get a professional opinion before seeing a psychiatrist or something like that? I haven't been seeing things or hearing voices but I'm having small delusions, nothing big just little ones that I can't really make myself believe fully."
683,I struggle with paraphilia and I really don't know where to turn and how to even get help," I'm a 22 year old guy and I struggle a lot with a paraphilia that I am ashamed about and I have never acted upon those urges, that being said seeking help for my issue is far from impossible.

I have come close so ratting myself out to therapist and psychologist, but the least I want is for one element of my life to ruin my entire life, I deserve to be a human being also.

My urges do make me have severe depression, but all everyone knows is that I have depression. No one will understand that I have something I can't help but control but in peoples eyes I deserve the death penalty.

I just want to be normal, and at 22 is getting harder to control myself and I don't know where to seek help"
684,Do Alters share memories?," I just discovered my Gf has DID and in her case, her alters do not share memories. But I don't know why, mine somewhat do.. I still have to do a lot of digging to find out what went on sometimes, but most of the time when I switch I still have somewhat of a memory of what happened. Is this normal?"
685,Intense thoughts of violence,"Almost daily I experience at least one burst of aggressive thoughts of violence. Usually they are 2-3 minutes long but I also had a couple that lasted longer than 15 minutes.

They usually go like this: I am insulted/assaulted by some other person (mostly strangers, sometimes family members). I then either start to beat them down with my bare hands or reveal some kind of weapon (mostly tools like hammers or screwdrivers; if a gun is involved, I use it to punch). Usually the fantasy involves me hitting the head of the other person repeatedly.

During these fantasies my entire body cramps up and I bite into the flesh of my checks. I am pretty sure that these are no seizures, because I can make them stop for a short while. The thoughts resurface a couple of minutes later, though. During especially intense bursts, I slam my fist onto my desk as hard as I can.

I had these thought-bursts as long as I can remember. If I am around people, they rarely appear and if they do, the embarrassment of people seeing me in this tense state overrides the thoughts. 

Anybody know if this is some kind of condition?"
686,Any idea of a diagnosis?,"DISCLAIMER: I am fully aware that this is not somewhere to seek professional medical advice. I am simply interested in other peoples opinions/experiences;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on two different types of antidepressants: sertraline then switched to Citalopram. I initially thought it was my low mood and stress, accompanied by the occasional panic attack. I spoke with my GP and she is changing me over to an SNRI, although not sure which one.

However, over the past few months, my self harming has been like it has never before, I genuinely feel that if I don't, then something back will happen. It has become an addiction, almost like a support mechanism.

I have heard a song play when the radio wasn't on. It definitely wasn't happening and I was aware but at the same time I could still hear it?

The absolute biggest fear is that I can spend hours, literally hours, talking to myself in a mirror, and replaying events/conversations that have happened recently or roleplay out a scenario with myself. I get the the point where I am so in these moments, I am fully emotionally connected i.e. if in the roleplay I have created or the angry conversation I am replaying over, I have cried, then I actually start crying and getting distressed. This has taken over my life. 

I'm at the point where I am scared of myself and how it is affecting my day to day life. I am completely isolating myself (no pun intended) and I'm very withdrawn. At home I am in tears and can't keep it together but around other people I put on such a happy face, no one knows a thing.

Has anyone experienced/know anything about the above? Thanks in advance"

i know in order to overcome this shitty illness i need to push through it and challenge myself, but i'm past the point of having something relevant to fight for aside for myself and a better life, which i know is more than enough but feeling worthless doesn't help.

i've been in a very dark place before but nothing like this, this time it's just too much for me to handle. i have no job, dropped out of school 2 years ago when i lost interest in the only thing i thought was meant to be my passion and i've been dealing with a terrible heartbreak for more than half a year now that won't cease and only makes me more depressed. i developed anxiety because of this breakup

my mood swings are so extreme it's crazy, just a few hours ago i was convinced of killing myself and now i want to get better. it's been like that for so long i'm losing my mind and becoming such a pain to be around.
i have been seeing a therapist for the past two years btw, but i don't think it helped me much. i might change to another one. he recommended taking antidepressants but then the pandemic happened so...

seeking help from friends isn't an option anymore, they're busy living their lives and don't care enough although they do know how serious this is.
and my situation at home is a mess so no family either, at this point they just think i'm playing the victim and are tired of me. i'm tired of them as well, that's another story.

i'm sure i'll delete this in a few hours when i no longer feel like this and go back to wanting to kill myself but anyway"
689,I'm paralyzingly hesitant about going to therapy.,"Long story short, I have a very deep mistrust of the US medical system, based on having watched my mom get kicked around like a soccer ball from doctor to doctor over the years. Combined with the underlying knowledge that therapists are ultimately listening to you in order to make money, I've found it terribly difficult to bring myself to look for a therapist.

Obviously anybody that's committing their time to a profession is looking to make money, and it's not like therapists are going to work for free, but idk - it always seemed insincere and disingenuous to me. Again, I know that nobody's going to work for free, but that's how I've viewed it since hearing about my friends' therapy horror stories where it seemed like the therapist was glancing at the clock every few minutes or didn't really seem like they cared about what they were being told.

I know that i likely need one, but I don't know how to get myself out of this rut of skepticism. I'd love some different perspectives, if anybody could offer one - but if not, I'm at least glad to have gotten this off my chest. Thanks for listening, y'all."
690,Internal struggle,"Today is my 29th birthday, every birthday that goes by I imagine hanging myself in my backyard. I have everything, husband, dog, bought a house this year, stable job, parents still alive.. but I swear my mental health is sabotaging me.
I drink a lot, which helps tone down the internal voices but obviously backfires the next morning.
I get so overwhelmed and frustrated that I have difficulty making decisions. I’m angry and agitated most of the time. When i get super ramped up i have little to no filter and basically have no control over what comes out of my mouth. I’m impulsive and white lie a lot. I hate myself to the fullest extent and I’ve gotten to the point where I just don’t want to do this anymore. I’m fucking tired.
My husband is a great man, literally. Sits by and watches while I just sit and be miserable which makes me feel even worse. He’s the polar opposite of me, upbeat positive, willing to do whatever to make my life better. Which makes me feel incredibly selfish, I do my best to not put anything on him but when I get in these moods I just sit in my bathroom on the floor and he gets so frustrated that he can’t make this better.. so he thinks it’s him which it isn’t. 
I’m kind of at a turning point right now because, psychiatrists are basically out of the question considering the pandemic. I’ve tried depression meds which make it worse.
Really don’t know what to do, I know this isn’t obviously somewhere to get medical advice.. I just feel like a crazy person and alone.

I am by no means no taking responsibility for my actions, I know I am the problem and I am my own worst enemy. But I am stuck."

694,"[VENT] Trying to get help, but discouraged to do so","How am I supposed to find a psychologist/psychiatrist and get help? When I confided to a teacher in my school that I wanted to get help and to ask for recommendations on cheap psychologists/psychiatrists, they just told me to go back to my home country if I really need to see a psychologist (I'm studying away from my home country). 

So now I'm just discouraged because the only language I'm comfortable expressing my feelings in is English (not my native language) and I was told to just head straight home if I'm mentally ill (which I am cause I got a diagnosis but I don't know where it is now). 

My first psychologist was cheap (because my home country's living expenses are low) but made me uncomfortable because he just listened to my problems for ~5 minutes and after that we only did exercises, so I told myself to try to find a better one and what I got was that discouraging response.

I was also told that if I had any problems, I should just consult them because psychologists would probably say the same things as them but frankly I don't trust anyone that I know personally. At least a psychologist/psychiatrist would be restricted from talking about a patient's condition, but I can't trust anyone from my school to do the same.

I'm not comfortable talking about this in the country subreddit because from what I've seen of previous posters they assume that my home country has better mental health services (but mine doesn't even have a suicide hotline lol) and I'd be closer to my parents/friends/support group (my parents aren't understanding about mental illnesses and they're busy with work; I only see one of them a few days in a year and the other a few hours but by that time they're already asleep from exhaustion with work anyways- I don't have friends I trust about my mental health issues and my home country isn't a place where you can walk around safely alone) so all I can do is vent to strangers on the internet who don't know about me in real life.

Also therapy is way too expensive here so I can't afford it."

696,Reducing Stigma for Mental Heath Project: Response to Coronavirus,"To the r/mentalhealth community,

I wish everyone the best during these difficult times. As I am sure you already know, this current global crisis has all taken a toll on our mental health. I myself have found my diagnosed depression and anxiety more difficult to control than ever, particularly contending with the loss of two close friends during this time. As a senior art student, I wanted to to create a final project which reflects the seemingly never-ending nature of our current situation, by creating a space where individuals are comfortable to share their experience in anonymity. With this project, I was hoping to engage this community which has already done so much for me, highlighting the importance of digital social interactions during this isolating time. If you feel this subreddit feels like this is the wrong place for this post, please direct me to one which you feel is better suited. 

Essentially, the aim is to reflect that no matter how alone we are, there are still social ties that exist across the digital world. The project would simply consist of a collage or collection of all submissions arranged in an aesthetic manner, the arrangement reflecting the submissions received. The submission form will be open only for a few days.

If individuals are comfortable, I would be open to sharing the project once it is complete. I would deeply appreciate any and all submissions (as they are all anonymous), even if they are as simple a letter, word, phrase or sentence. These submissions don't even have to explicitly reference your mental health, they can just be a literal or metaphorical representation of your current state. Images/videos/drawings/etc are also welcome (for these, pls submit an imgur or alternative link). I thank anyone who takes the time to read this post and make a submission. Please submit only if you are comfortable with sharing your experience. This is my first time doing something like this, so I am completely open to all advice/critique. Regardless, I thank you for your time. It truly means a lot to me. The google form is below.

[https://forms.gle/Zjxp62JK4N28u7Bs6](https://forms.gle/Zjxp62JK4N28u7Bs6)

tl;dr I am asking for submissions using the above anonymous google form for how people are currently feeling. These submissions will be arranged in an aesthetic art piece, to reflect our ties/shared experiences to each other through the digital world."
697,A total PoS,"I (M29) experienced (somewhat) a breakdown over this past weekend.

I stopped speaking to my sister (F26) who lives with me, since Friday. We were never close but our Mom thought it would be a good idea for us to stay together. I was clearly against it but Mother always gets her way. I knew it would end up with us disagreeing with eachother, but there was nothing I could say as, again, it would end up in an argument with my Mother.

I am fairly early in my career (hitting the two-year mark) and don't make much money. I've basically lived from cheque to cheque each month, even though my parents INSISTED they pay half my rent. Again, something I was clearly against, but Mother always gets her way. Please do not think I am ungrateful (I'm NOT), but I'm working towards becoming independent of them and now this current situation has made me depend on them even more. In addition, we are not a family of many means and I live in a city that's notorious for high living costs. 

I have to pay half my rent and all the other expenses my sister and I incur during the month, which leaves me with almost nothing at the end.

She was supposed to be looking for work, which hasn't happened. Obviously, with the current pandemic, this has put that on hold. 

However, honestly speaking, she's using this as a holiday.

Her rent gets paid, she gets an allowance and the rest is provided by me.

This has stressed me to the point of my breakdown.

I have no fucking idea how to approach my parents with this, without coming across as a complete piece of shit. 

My mental health was in a bad place, before all of this and now it's just deteriorating even further. 

I don't even know if I'll have a job in the next few months. I'm trying to push myself at work, just to add some value, but nothing is guaranteed, especially not now.

Right now, I'm struggling, really bad. Work. Finances. Family. Lockdown. COVID-19. It's all getting to me and I've become even more of a bitter fuck than I was.

I am extremely sorry for the bitter post. 

For anyone else who's struggling, I hope you deal/have dealt with it better than I have ❤"
698,"Convinced I have irreversible brain damage at 28 years old so I have a hard time with self-control and not drinking alcohol every night, eating fast food, neglecting my health and generally taking a nihilistic view of my health.","A little background. I have generally been in good health my whole life. I was born with mild spina bifida and hydrocephalus. I read things on the internet I probably shouldn’t like memory can be impaired with my type of spina bifida (myelomeningocele). I use to get bladder infections all the time which increased in frequency when I was in college. I have a suspicion that I have kidney disease that I can’t prove even though I have had a renal ultrasound that showed my kidneys were find. Another thing I’m worried about with my condition is bladder cancer. I used to drink (and drink a lot. sometimes 15 drinks in one night when I was having “fun” with friends and no it wasn’t a suicide attempt). So another thing I’m worried about is irreversible damage to my kidneys, liver, or brain because of that. I have horrible concentration at work (I work at my dad’s business so it is overlooked) and believe I am slower than my coworkers despite trying to push myself. I have had horrible concentration in college and failed out because of it. Despite this, I’m able to pay bills on time. I do neglect chores around my house some because I’m tired but have gotten better at it (I moved out of my parents house into my own). And I’m starting to exercise regularly. Despite this, I still feel like I have a lot of trouble with memory and my mood is really bad most of the time. Also I can’t feel a lot anymore. This is good for exercise because it allows me to push through. But I don’t feel happy, sad, hungry, thirsty, or drunk when I drink alcohol (I significantly cut back on my drinking). All I really feel is angry sometimes and my sex drive is really high."

702,Coping with Covid-19: Social Isolation Doesn't Mean Emotional Isolation | ALifeLearned,"We're all facing a societal trauma at the moment with the Corna virus pandemic, and thus, even those with average mental health could face some mental health struggles during or after this experience. Further, the isolation many of us are coping with in our attempts to flatten the curve is potentially worsening the symptoms of those who already struggles with their mental health. Thus, its important not to feel stigmatized by your experience, as the COVID-19 outbreak is unprecedented situation that we are genuinely all facing together. And to this regard, its important to remember that your mental health is just as important to maintain throughout this experience as your physical health is. With this, its important to stay connected to those closest to us, and focus on mental wellness practices.  In this vlog I discuss the concern of maintaining one's mental wellness and share a few tips to manage throughout the current pandemic:

704,Sleeping 10 hours every single night...should I be concerned?,"Since I'm not on my college campus anymore, I've had a bit more freedom with my sleep schedule, especially since my last day of classes was last week. If I'm given the chance (i.e. no alarm), I'll just sleep for 10 hours. Sometimes more. It's really frustrating because it wastes so much time in my day. It's pretty concerning at this point because 9 hours should be enough for me, but, despite this, I still sleep for 10 hours. The weirdest part is, I realized I could function remarkably well on only 3-4 hours of sleep (probably better than how I function on 10).

Today, I woke up to an alarm I set (I got fed up with myself) and have been exhausted the whole day. Worst part is, I have a final exam tomorrow and am having a lot of difficulty focusing because that ""exhausted and tired brain"" feeling is so strong today (I can't nap, by the way; I'm just incapable for some reason). I took my medication to help me focus, but, so far, it hasn't done anything (it's usually *incredibly* helpful). I want to go to bed at a reasonable time, but my brain is so active until around 1, 2, or 3am when I finally get tired. I'll just lay in bed for a while, trying to sleep, then give up and just do something else until I get tired. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? What can I do to help myself feel more alert during the day?"

706,Hey I’m 17 and my mom has bipolar disorder,"The last 5 days of my life have been a shitshow
My mom went on a trip with her husband to look for a place to move and get jobs and then by day 2 or 3 my sis gets phone calls from my mom saying incoherent word and sentences and my mom won’t answer her texts after day 4 we learned my mom had a broken phone according to my step dad she broke it
According to my mom he broke it after a argument And it turns out she also taking some pill she got from someone. 

day 5 my step dad gets arrested apparently according to my he deserted her at the hotel with the intention of not coming back apparently my step dad never explained why he got arrested. 

The day there were supposed to leave they didn’t because of them getting into more arguments and my mom going back to her “friends” house the next day was worse for me and my sister because my sister called my step dad to see how their we’re doing and how far out they are turns out they were arguing about why he told me my sister what going and blah blah and stuff my sister ended up hanging up on them
And then later when me and my sis were making dinner my mo called and said she killed tc and there will be no more problems and shit and apparently has been taking this pill that I didn’t know existed for two days. apparently it turns out during that call she had takin 4 pills of klonopin which I just found that she been taking like 2 hours before making this post and she’s been taking it while on the trip and now I’m fucking scared she doesn’t sound all there. to my knowledge she hasn’t taken it today but she seems spacey and walks lil weird she says the walking problems might be a brain problem and she’s planning on going to a doctor.

 and now my sister is planning on renting out a hotel room for a few weeks at a hotel she works at just so she can get away from the arguing and the drama and offered me to stay with her I’m scared because I feel if I leave that’s gonna push my mom over the “edge” and I don’t want that to happen but she’s been saying today that nobody loves her or cares about her idk what to do and I don’t think I can stay in a house with such negative thoughts 24/7.

I have to play music, ytb, games, eat, drink alcohol anything that gives me a little bit of dopamine. Whenever I go outside and I dont have my headphones I just keep on thinking about worse and worse stuff, even suicide. My mind seems to drive itself insane the more I am left alone. I tried to escape this many times but I always come back in just a few minutes because of the unbearable feeling I get when I dont get my thoughts stolen by something stupid on my phone or pc. I think this is some advanced addiction which I havent been aware for a really long time and now I have no social skills because I cant talk with a person. I dont know what people care about.

710,PTSD and BPD? So similar it's hard to know which one is which,"Sorry if this post makes no sense it's been one of those days. So due to childhood/teenage trauma I've been suffering for many years. I started seeing a psychiatrist at 14, then the system lost me from age 18. I'm 26 now. I had GAD and depression growing up but I think this is due to me not disclosing information. Looking back now and speaking to another psychiatrist about it he suggested that it sounds like PTSD. He even paused after saying it as though I haven't been obsessing over the flashbacks for years. I had a feeling it was PTSD but nobody wants to throw that label around because its way too serious. Anyway, I feel like this is the beginning of an official diagnosis and a way out of this other than death. If I have the right support then I might cope better. I'm guessing it's going to be a long process of diagnosing me but I've always been split between PTSD and BPD because they are so similar, I don't know where I'm going with this. I just feel alone. I have no friends and I am sabotaging my relationship as per. Can someone tell me they know how I feel? I'm really confused all of the time."
711,"Even when you feel completely alone in your own dark void, remember that others dwell here too.","My ex-girlfriend calls me sometimes. Maybe once every 2-3 months. But what calls me is just a remnant of what once was. If I could reverse time I would go back to one point and this point only.

I was depressed when I was with her, 4 years ago. But she was my escape, and I was hers, through the sex, laughter, weed, and we'd disappear from the face of the earth into our own world. I had my problems and so did she, but we never talked about it. Maybe a few times if we got drunk and fucked up enough. We subconsciously acted in a way that the pain inside of us belonged only inside, and held no place in conversation between us or to friends and family, for it was only esoteric and illusive pain, and thus its lack of tangibility meant it could be ignored and we could fight against it, alone, until it would somehow magically resolve without intervention. She breaks up with me for no reason (at least that was what I thought), says we need a break for a while. I don't question it. I probe a little, 'I accept, but why? Tell me whats going on' -- she restates, 'I just need a break alright?'. Somehow I forget that what she says on the surface isn't true, but a mere defense mechanism by her subconscious to disguise the real pain of her conscious. For the next 6 months, I take it all to heart. I act like the world revolves around me. I only acknowledge how I'm feeling, somehow failing to remember that my experience is not the only fucking experience that exists. She calls me after the 6 months, she wants to meet up. We meet up. We smoke and have sex. We drink. We drive. I still feel betrayed and I feel the love is gone, I feel she doesn't give a fuck about me and never did, and that all she wanted was sex, so I leave her house the next day without a word. I felt like a dog. I felt like my love for her was so evident and she was just playing around with it. Just like a human may feel guilty for not being able to match the love that you see a dog has for you just by looking into it's eyes. Except she wasn't guilty, but some sort of malevolent harness-er of love. I adopt the attitude of 'fuck this girl I don't need her'. I boast to my friends about the man I've become by being able to get out of the grasps of her. I live the next year feeling so accomplished with my decision. Until she calls again.

And we meet up. But this time, it's all fucked up. She's lost touch of reality. She doesn't know who she is. She's shaved all of her hair. She begins to show delusion by expressing that she is 'nicki minaj', and begins to show me all of these subliminal messages in the lyrics of a few songs that 'clearly show' that she is nicki minaj. I'm baffled. She reaches for my weed. I refuse, trying to understand what is going on. She begins to punch me trying to get a hold of the weed. She's crying. I'm crying. She had been rotting in her room for the past year. She was lost. So very lost. Her mental health must have declined. I call her mum in secret because my ex isn't telling me anything. Her mum says shes developed schizophrenia or psychosis through the abuse of weed. I ask her when this began. She told me it was shortly after we broke up. 

I was facing my own mental health issues, but right beside me, all along, the girl I thought I loved, but didn't love me, was being eaten up inside, and I had not the faintest clue due to my idiocracy, selfishness and lack of awareness for others. She must have initially broke up with me because she felt like she was losing her mind and soul, and had to fix it, away from me, not to cause me any trouble or disturbance. Yet I perceived it all as happening to ME. She reached out for me 6 months later, clearly fragile. And once again, I act like its all about me. I use my depression to shield my from acknowledging other peoples pain.

She calls me and I call her every now and again on facetime. I try to make sure shes doing well. But shes delusional. She forgets who I am sometimes. She forgets what I'm studying, doing, where I'm living. Recently, she often forgets that we are in quarantine, and I have to remind her. She will randomly get annoyed and begin to cuss me, closing the phone on my face. She's deteriorating. So is her family. She has no job. No education. No friendships. No ideas. No goals. No fucking axiom in her life to function around whatsoever. She thinks her mother is an evil imposter, and this must kill her mother inside. And I could have stopped all of this, If I was just more aware. 

All I'm left with is a ghost, of the person I have killed. A ghost of what I could have saved. The person I failed to recognize was crying for help inside. I dwelt in my own emotions failing to realise she was being eaten up by the demons inside of her. She's drugged up now mostly, sleeping 16 hours a day.  I'm her only friend so I insist to myself I must be there for her. But I can't stare into the empty vessel that I let drain of it's scarcely remaining light. Sometimes I think this isn't real, that I'm in hell, being punished for my sins. All I want to do is off myself, I can't stand to see what I have done. I feel like I don't deserve to live. I feel like my alcoholic father, who chose to only see his hard reality, not knowing that he was causing a chain reaction impacting everyone around him. But I've learnt my lesson, the world does not revolve around me. There are people who need me. I can't give up and kill myself. There are people who need you, guys. You may feel like you are alone in the dark void you dwell in, but there may just be someone hanging onto to your ankles. Don't be like me, don't use your mental health as a reason to not look down. You don't know who's down there below you. It's not too late for you guys. Look around you. Everyone is in pain. Don't separate yourselves from them. Don't be like me. It's not too late."
712,How do I stop feeling so anxious when people are being nice to me? And why is it happening??,"Whenever my whole family is on good terms with me I get so uneasy and almost guilty? And end up in such a low mood that I either need to start petty arguments in order to break up the good atmosphere, or I completely avoid them. This goes for friends too. This could just be me being toxic, but I'd really like to stop. It feels like I'm most comfortable after the argument when I'm trying to gain back the love with hugs and a suddenly good mood(even more toxic I know).

The only thing that I can think of is how my friends were back when I was in elementary school, where they'd get mad at me for really stupid reasons (like jokingly saying my friend's drawing looked flat, not as an insult to her drawing skills but because the paper was flat), and I'd end up having to chase after them and beg for forgiveness and promise not to do it again or whatever else until they agreed and stopped ignoring me, because I was so afraid of losing the good times with them. But  I don't know if it's possible for them to have such a big effect on me now?

But regardless of the reason, how do I stop? I realize it's so toxic of me to constantly do something to avoid or ruin the good atmosphere."
713,Days where my brain just feels entirely wrong,"I'm having one of these days today and I'm unsure if it's caused by something, as I'm not diagnosed with any sort of mental health issue. It happens maybe once a month or so on average (sometimes they happen closer together and other times I can go months without one of these). I'll try and explain my symptoms:

* I'm incredibly scatterbrained, like I forget things easily. When doing housework today I realized I can only remember one task at a time. Like I'll tell myself ""I need to do the dishes and then vacuum the rug,"" but once I do the dishes I'll go sit down and surf Reddit before my wife reminds me about the rug.

* My autopilot is malfunctioning. Stuff that comes as automatic is a struggle. I poured coffee grounds straight into the cup this morning instead of into the French press, and on a day like this a few months ago I cracked an egg straight into the garbage disposal.

* I call things by the wrong names. I keep calling cucumber salad ""green bean casserole"" because reasons. I also forget the street number of my house on days like this (I remember the rest of the address fine).

* I get startled easily. I opened a cabinet in my kitchen and a pot lid rattled a bit and I just about had a heart attack.

* Loud noises make me furious. Like if my son yells loudly when he's playing it makes me angry.

* I have zero attention span and it's like I have ADHD. I can't watch a new episode of a show, for example, because I lose the plot. I have to watch something I know AND surf Reddit AND play a game on my laptop all at the same time.

* I feel low-key nervous all day. Not paranoid or anything, think like you're expecting a fire drill so you know the alarm is going to go off at some point during the day but you don't know when so you're apprehensive.

* I feel mentally exhausted, like doing any task is a massive chore. I was cooking and I had to stir something to mix it into something else and I was just thinking of how time-consuming and frustrating the task was."

# So I have really weird compulsions.

So suppose I'm watching a movie and I missed a subtitle I have to backtrack and see what was exactly written there and repeat it 3 times(I know it's really weird).And I feel like whenever I have to read anything I have to read every single word even if I'm not interested in the topic. Also a lot of things I do, I feel like I have to do it thrice. Any solutions?"
715,Sometimes I don't want to get better,I don't know why bet when I feel a bit happier I just don't like it but then when I'm sad again that doesn't feel good either
716,"I feel overworked, but have no idea how to fix it.","So, with this pandemic going on, my work load has gone from  part-time to full time hours in the period of a few weeks. I am exhausted, physically, and it is affecting me mentally.

I have some physical health problems, ranging from severe nearsightedness to the tendons in my ankles not developing correctly. The latter one makes standing for long periods of time difficult, even with long breaks, and I am pretty sure I have plantar fasciitis, as that is where the center of the pain is. I work in retail specifically a grocery store's garden center, in America, so you are not allowed to sit unless you are on break. I go 2-4 hours standing at a time, and it hurts, even with insoles in my shoes, and replacing both the shoes or insoles every few months. If I get off work at 9, get home and go to bed by midnight, I can still feel the strain and pain the morning after at 8 am. Once I sit down at home after my normal 9 hr shift, I cannot get up without needing to wait a few minutes for the pain to subside enough to move. Yesterday was so terrible, I had to fake having to go to the bathroom so then I could sit because my feet and ankles nearly had me in tears. I don't want to complain about it to my supervisor or my manager because I have been told, by them, I am one of the most reliable and best performing workers they have. They don't even notice I have these pains because I push through it so hard. I take pride in that, and want to perform my best, but my physical issues are making my 'best' harder to achieve.

Compound this with my mental issues. I know I have depression, and maybe anxiety. The depression makes it so hard to enjoy the things I love, like video games and illustration. I haven't drawn in two months because by the time I am done with work, all I want to do in play games. Then, I play for a few minutes, and then the thoughts start pouring in. 'What's the point of this? I could have done X at work but didn't. Why am I not having fun? I waited all day for this, why am I not satisfied?' It also takes me a long time to go to sleep, but I also sleep for ungodly amounts of time, and still feel exhausted when I wake up. I dread going to work because it isn't what I want to do, but when I finally get to sit down and do what I want, I lose the motivation in an instant and just sit there and think and overthink and it sucks and I want it to stop. I want to enjoy things again.

I am not sure if I have anxiety, though. The only things that make me think I do is when I get up in the morning for work, I get a little paranoid that I'll miss and alarm to leave, or I'll forget something I need, or I got the schedule wrong and I'm late. I check my online schedule, write it down on a whiteboard with all my other family members so we know where everyone will be, and then have to online and check again the night before, and the morning of to make sure that yes, I do work today at a certain time. Not to mention, on my days off (ranging from 2 to 4 days in a row), I have this thing I can only describe as a worry pain in my chest about what day it is, thinking I'll forget the date and miss a day I have to work on accident. 

This is all accumulating into today. I got a call from my supervisor that I let go to voicemail because I knew they were going to ask me to work and I was still in pain from yesterday and knew I couldn't. She left a voicemail that asked if I could work Wednesday from 9a-6p. Today is Sunday, I have tomorrow off, I work Tuesday, and I was going to have Wednesday off before working a 6-day workweek. This last one was only 4 days, with a 5 day workweek before that I could barely handle. Taking on that Wednesday shift would mean I would be working eight days in a row, with two days off, then likely another six days. I can't do it. I don't have the physical capacity to do it. Even just the six-day workweek makes me fear for how my mental state is going to be later on, how my body is going to practically be falling apart. I'm breaking down right now, and I still haven't called her back to give her an answer because I have no fucking clue what to say.

I haven't self-harmed or have suicidal actions since sophomore year of high school. The thoughts never go away, it comes with the depression, but I am not sure I can take much more. I asked to be a part-time worker for a reason, so I don't have these exhausting 40-hr workweeks, but now I'm looking down the barrel of a 72-hour workweek if I call back and say yes. All I ever do is think about work, and my body is in shambles because of work, but I need to work to make money and survive- And everyone there relies on me to do my job effectively! I have no idea how to remedy the problem, even just the minor one of returning a fucking voicemail."
717,Any advice for seemingly hopeless diagnosis/testing? (ADD/ADHD),"Throwaway/new acct for MH issues as I don’t want this being part of my identifiable online information.   


I won’t bore you all too much with the long history, but I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression for over 10 years, have been through a lot with my health and personal circumstances, and I’m coming to accept that my recovery is going to be a long slow one, if it ever happens. I’m one of the lucky ones, I have a lot of support in place. It wasn’t easy to get, and it took a lot of fighting to be heard, but I’ve got an excellent counsellor, an assigned mental health practitioner, have been in many different types of therapies, been recently assigned to a clinical psychologist and had a brief overview with a psychiatrist that will hopefully continue to support my progress. My GP experience sucks balls, but the rest is promising.

From that perspective, it seems there’s little more I could feasibly ask for, but lately I’ve been doing a lot of personal and information searching for more of a root cause for my seemingly insurmountable issues that have long preceded (from childhood) my justifiable anxiety/depression troubles. basically, I want to be tested/assessed for ADHD/ADD (inattentive type) but I can’t pluck up the courage to ask that my concerns regarding focus, attention, compulsive and impulsive behaviours be taken seriously and not just automatically pegged on A/D. They have existed long before A/D and its just become a convenient scapegoat it seems, despite matching almost all of the classic symptoms/behaviours.

The problem is, I don’t want to be seen as seeking a diagnosis/treatment that (believe me - Ive got enough stigma) I actually don’t want. What I want is the cause, something to fight, something that is treated seriously. But I’m too tired and too wuss to demand to be assessed - and so far trying to subtly float the possibility has been completely pointless.   


Has anyone had any experience with this? Any advice? Any mental health professionals out there with suggestions?   


useful demographics type info:

early 20s, London/UK based, being treated via NHS practitioners. Tried Sertraline, Citalopram, about to change to Venlafaxine. 

Going private for an assessment is possible, but not ideal with finances, however I’d do it. I’m just worried about throwing the nhs resources I’ve been afforded back at them as if I don’t value the opportunities."

719,What's the best message to send to a friend who isn't replying back and dealing with a lot on their plate?,"
I haven't heard from my friend and now I know that asking 'how are you', 'what have you been up to' or something like that leads her to not reply if things aren't good. She wouldn't have much to state to message back if she's been lounging all day unmotivated to take care of herself so I get left hanging and she feels like I'm distant when we next see each other; though I only take the lack o a response as if I've done something wrong or if she's not interested in being friends so I am distant but it's not for the reasons she thinks so.

She's dumped her ex and I dunno how she is when he left the flat financially. Our last talks were about meeting for pizza but she declined and I left it at that. She did read my message but they have gone unanswered. While she isn't responsive, she is playing video games (Mario Kart) so I know she's still doing things but idk"

721,Does This Constitute a Traumatic Event?,"Last year, in July 2019, I was writing an article about the philosophy of Montagne on a now-deleted blog, when my brother (I was 12 at the time) when my brother, despite being a contemptible racist who views all blacks as violent degenerates worthy of death, started blasting rap music so loud R2D2 could fuckibg hear it. I texted him to turn it down, joking that an alien could hear it. He responded with several ad hominems, spitefully turned it up, and then walked into my room.

He started yelling at me. He was hurling insults at me, ""lazy,"" ""retard,"" ""piece of shit,"" ""nerd,"" ""pussy,"" ""loser."" I lightly tossed a pillow at him (which I probably shouldn't have done, because it is immature) and he punched me in the face and the gut.

I started sobbing and he said, ""Stop being a pussy. It's not insults, it's constructive criticism!"" And for the next 2 hours he yelled insults at me. Ever since his words, his actions have always been in the back of my mind.

Today it was especially apparent. The thoughts made me irritable, depressed, and shaky. I just sobbed from remembering the event. I looked up a list of traumatic events and no similar events were listed. Was I traumatized?"

It feels like I'm slowly going insane but my high anxiety and ptsd keep me locked in my room and whenever it seems I try to make a friend or leave the house people are mean and toxic and just deteriorate my mental health even more, therapy is strained were I'm at I live in a very small boomer town that doesn't believe in mental health and the only therapy place here is closed cause covid:/ any advice or comments is appreciated TIA"

I don't know how much time I'll take to learn considering fact that I can do it only one month per year. I don't know if this cycle will continue though. It was true for 2 years now.

Anyways I just sorta put 2 and 2 together, and now I suddenly feel disgusted by myself, I feel betrayed. 
I am way to old to self harm! I am an adult and I am not depressed! But for the past 4.5 roughly I have been wounding myself...

Anyways I have an appointment in a few days (online, because of the lockdown) but I can't get over the fact that I just... didn't realise
I think it was very much the fact that it wasn't the wrists and that there was no involvement of razors, that made me not not connect the dots"
730,I don't know what's wrong with me,"Hi!  From the title you have just read, you might be wondering why I wrote that. 

I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. To tell you about myself, I am someone who could firstly, control my anger or emotions in general in different situations.  Secondly, I don't necessarily get sexually active, in that sense where I don't necessarily do it (masturbate)  everyday. Thirdly, I don't get irritated easily, normally if I do, I would control it first and when the time is right, I will start to rant to my friends. I have depression and anxiety, which I only have known when I was like 15, I did not go to the doctors to confirm, but my counsellor suspected that I have it. My family doesn't know that I had suicidal thoughts( I stopped having it for now) and for my whole life I have kept that a secret to them. 

So now is the part where things get weird. Ever since last year, I have been getting strange. There would be times where I would feel so energetic, where I would feel happy and hyper, and there would be times where I would feel irritated at the littlest of things and honestly really sad for no apparent reasons. My friends, family and even I thought it was strange but they just shrugged it off and acted that it was normal. My anxiety attacks came more frequently, especially since last year was the year I had to take my national examinations. Maybe it was stress induced but it was strange, my counsellor would tell me why it happened more frequently and even I don't know why. Last year was also the year where I would get really horny( sorry but I have to put it out there), I don't know why like but I thought maybe puberty hit me hard or smth. Ever since I was 14, I had been dealing with stress eating to the point where I gain much weight because of the pressure of my parents, like there would be times where they would force me to eat food just to not waste it. But I too stress eat alot because of stress in school, friends and family issues. Especially when I was 14, because that year was one of the worse years of my life, my classmates didn't accept me as part of the class, consistent bullying, arguments with my parents for the most stupid reasons possible, the stress of being in a new class, new subjects and just coping up with the rest of the cohort. But it gradually decrease along the way and I learnt to just adapt and go for frequent counselling sessions when I need to.  

I really don't know what is happening to me right now, but I can't make an appointment to see a doctor because I don't have money and plus I don't want my family to know because they will just stop me from doing it( they are not a big fan of mental health I guess) and I guess this is my last resort to at least get advice from you guys. I know it's a long post, so thank you if you're reading it till the end!!"
731,I saw how my dog jumped from a 5th flat about 7 hours ago,"I created a reddit account just to vent a little bit. My dad, brother and I were sitting in the attic with our dogs and suddenly one of ours jumped to his death after seeing a bird (that's my guess). Now I can't get off my head that image of him jumping and the following images of blood and weird liquid coming out of his mouth. The feeling I got from the adrenaline rush and rushing him to the hospital still lingers in me. I've never experienced the death of a loved one and it's getting to me now. Every minute that image pops up in my head and it's absolutely horrible to remember it. Was I irresponsible? Could I have saved his life? How does the grieving process work?"
732,Please help me make a decision on what to do.,"Hi, I’m just recently 19 and have very bad social anxiety/ GAD and I believe depression also. I work at a phone store dealing with customers all day and this makes me anxiety so much worse. For example, if someone comes in to buy a phone, and I make a mistake or don’t know something, my heart starts pounding and my hands get super shaky, and I feel like they think I’m on stimulant drugs or something bc I’m shaking so bad.. which just gets me stuck in these thought loops and makes a 6 hours shift feel like 12. I’ve also started using substances to deal with it, and it just makes it worse. I have a lot of personal issues I need to figure out and I’m highly considering quitting but I’m afraid..like what if I can’t find another job or what if I go broke and lose everything I have.. and also being stuck at home..I’m terrified that’s going to make it even worse.. but it’s really a lose lose situation for me. My parents don’t understand mental health and will think I’m just lazy which will just add to my anxiety and depression. I’m so lost right now, and have nobody else to ask for advice from. Any help on this decision would be so much appreciated"
733,PTSD help,"I can't say much about this because I am trying to suppress my memory. I keep having meltdowns in public and this has actually led to arrests and prosecution. My lawyer says it's ridiculous that I'm being criminalised because I clearly need help which is harder and harder to find despite my searching and practically begging for a referral.

I've been badly manhandled by the police and basically tortured, neglected and abused while in police custody. I can feel a wall in my mind trying to block it out. When the wall breaks down I feel it all again and I can't eat or sleep or look after myself for days at a time. I'm a trigger fest. Often I can't move because almost anything seems to cause acute anxiety and pain."
734,Need some advice,"Hi. I'm sorry if this is all over the place as I have trouble explaining things, but please read and give me advice if you have any. So for some backstory, I'm 16 years old, and I live with both of my parents who hate each other. You can say they're ""divorced"" but they haven't actually signed any papers yet. We live in a apartment and struggle to get by, I haven't been to school since 5th grade since we move around a lot and they gave up. My father has a long distance girlfriend in a different country, who says that she will sell her farm for 70k (USD) and move here to be with my dad and we'll get a house and yada yada. I'm skeptical of this because my parents tend to make promises they can't keep. My mom on the other hand, relies on my dad for absolutely everything, despite hating him and physically abusing him. I cannot go to them for anything. I cannot ask my own parents for advice because my mom's turned into a ""reptilians are real Hollywood is demonic Trump is our savior I'm a descendant of Jesus Christ"" type person and my father is just a flat out liar manchild and always gets my hopes up. My older sister is the only person i can trust, but I don't see her often because she's a grown adult with two children and is overall busy. I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and suicide is looking less and less terrifying and more inviting every single day. Recently, I have been feeling so awful. The best I can describe it is, an uncomfortable terrified feeling in my stomach. I have no idea what it is, or what caused it but it's eating me alive. I have always felt bad, but nowhere near this bad. I have a loving, caring and supportive girlfriend who is always my safe place in times like this, but I need some advice from others. What's wrong with me? What can I do to make this feeling go away? Any advice at all is so greatly appreciated.
This may have been obvious, but professional help is not an option. My family just doesn't have the resources for it."
735,"""Virginity"", celibacy and mental health","I'm a 24-year-old male who's never been in a romantic relationship, had sex or even kissed anyone. I've also had unrelated struggles with anxiety for various reasons my whole life.

I've never cared about having sex as any kind of ""social status"" thing but I worry about what it implies about my mental state that I've never even attempted to do so, have a meaningful relationship etc all this time, and having left it so late I also worry that it will now be a) effectively impossible and b) even if I do I'll still be ""abnormal"" because of this abstinence at a time of life when everyone is ""supposed"" to have done it. 

For a while I thought I might be a latent homosexual but I no longer think that's the case and therefore it can't be the reason. I also don't consider myself to be very unattractive (although I could stand to lose some weight) and I know how subjective that is anyway. There have been some girls who've been interested (there may be even now, who knows?) but I've never had the psychological maturity to know what to do about it, and maybe that's the problem. But will that ever be ""fixed""? If it can't be, does that matter?

It’s a bitter pill to swallow but honestly I made the decision I thought was right at the time, so I should just get over it but I think about it non stop everyday “I earned these grades but now that I might not get in what if everyone thinks I’m unqualified and stupid?” Are the type of thoughts I’m getting.  I know none of these thoughts serve me anymore and I need to get over it but it’s so easier said than done.  I’m going nuts in my own head to a stir crazy point and I need some advice.

Sorry if my English will confuse you at any point...I m from Poland and I can't speak english fluently. Hope I'll speak better in future :)"
745,Just finished up an article on some benefits of mindfulness and OCD :),"[OVD and Mindfulness Meditation](https://ticsandthoughts.com/ocd-and-mindfulness-meditation/)

As someone with OCD I’ve gained so much from mindfulness meditation and think many others can as well. So decided to write an article about it on my site!

Site is brand new and I’m very new to the whole website thing so bare with me 😅 feedback is always welcome! Thanks for reading everybody"
746,Do I have a problem?,"Whenever I'm angry, whether it be at myself or at others, i end up finding anything I can to inflict pain to calm down. Whether it be tracing my skin with the sharp point of a compass, punching a wall to make my knuckles hurt, using scissors to cut my hands and arms etc. I don't have depression and neither do I have a history of cutting."
747,Just realizing I have “mommy and daddy issues” and need some advice 23/F,"After a few major breakdowns and wondering what is wrong with me regarding my relationships with people recently, I had a major epiphany: I have been looking for a parental figure in all of my close and (more specifically) romantic relationships without even being aware of it. I’m currently in the most stable and happy relationship of my life, but it has been struggling lately due to my issues that ALWAYS tend to arise in relationships— I fall into a trap of wanting my significant other to tell me what to do, praise me for doing it, and support me like a parent. I wasn’t conscious of my doing this until now, and it’s incredibly toxic behavior and I want to stop! 

I don’t have a job or a license at the age of 23 because I’m constantly waiting for someone to tell me what to do and how to do it. Despite knowing I’m capable, I don’t take the steps necessary to accomplish anything without someone holding my hand. I was a senior in college about to get a Bachelor’s Degree in Science until I ended my previous relationship and found myself unable to complete my degree without someone to tell me that I needed to do my homework and go to class. I dropped out, and I still want to finish my degree, but I’ve realized I haven’t gone and done that because I don’t have a chaperone to stand by me. I feel like I’m incapable of accomplishment without someone watching me do it, I crave praise and encouragement that I simply can’t expect from my peers and significant others.

For some background, my parents had me very young and I was an unwanted child. The appointment for me to be aborted was scheduled, but my mom didn’t go to the appointment out of fear/confusion. My parents split when I was seven, and they’re both mentally ill, struggle with substance abuse, and are very distant. I still see them both occasionally, but neither of them have ever been real “parents” to me for any part of my life. I’ve also dealt with some serious trauma due to abuse from a man my mother married, who I once saw as a potential father figure, that ended up physically abusing both me and my mom and eventually committing suicide. 

My mom is a psychologist and I’ve personally been close to a lot of psychologists in my life due to random circumstance, so I’ve talked to them extensively about some of my trauma but never really gotten to the root of things the way I just did on my own because I’ve never gone through actual therapy (yes, I know I need it, but I’m incredibly poor right now. it’s on the top of my list for future goals). I’ve always presumed I was just a little depressed and sensitive from the experiences I’ve had, but as I get older I’m becoming aware of deeper issues. I think I’ve neglected a lot of personal issues because various psychologists I’ve known have said “hey, you seem pretty okay despite it all!”

As it stands now, I lost my minimum wage job to coronavirus and I’ve been supported fully by my boyfriend for almost four months now. I continually look to him for guidance he simply doesn’t have, and he’s understandably frustrated with me at this point. He is still employed, and I’ve spent my time cleaning our apartment and writing him cute letters and expecting a pat on the head and a warm meal in return. He doesn’t deserve to parent me, and I don’t know if I can be “fixed” or if there’s any coping mechanisms for me to deal with this issue I’ve just recently become aware of. He is very aware of what I’ve been through and is very loving and understanding, but he doesn’t deserve to parent me. It makes me sick to think about the way I behave sometimes. This pattern has occurred many times in many different ways, and I want to know if now that I’m aware of what is making me act this way I can make a conscious effort to change it. 

Tl;dr: My parents didn’t offer me any emotional support or life advice and now I seek that type of support in my relationships, how can I change that?"
748,Why do I have the urge to do something but have not a single idea on what?,"Why do I have the urge to do something but have not a single idea on what? I just get this urge that I want to accomplish or do SOMETHING or ANYTHING but nothing I can think of is what I want, or I dont want to do x y or z."
749,Possible schizophrenia onset??,"I (M/17) have been experiencing depression, sudden change of friends followed by social withdrawal, neglect of hygiene, increased sensitivity to light, illusions and strong delusions (thinking that some family members will lure me into a forest to kill me or that they hired hitmen to take me down, always feeling watched, feeling that there are cameras hidden everywere). Also my visuals get really weird and frightening: Shadows begin to move slightly, objects veeery slightly moving, wall ""breathing"" in a subtle way, weird light tracers and bugs (mostly in peripheral vision). Also bigger objects like a closet gets really dark and appears to be a shadow entity that's sometimes wiggling around which is freaking me out tbh. Also there is this constant pinging noise in my ears and when I lay down in the dark I seem to hear distorted and very distant whispering voices or other unsettling noises, which are barely noticeable. Also my speech and writings are weird and unorganised, I sometimes forget what I was talking about before and stop speaking in the middle of a sentence without any apparent reason??
I feel VERY uncomfortable lying in the dark and ""hearing"" (only subtle, but still..) undistinct sounds that sound like whispering voices...my sleep pattern is also garbage, I only sleep like 4 hours and I don't even set an alarm clock. Frequent wakening and nightmares have been haunting me for several months, as the rest of the symptoms as well. I feel like the onset of schizophrenia starts to kick in, but there is no diagnosis, but if you don't hallucinate clearly you can't be diagnosed with this, that's the problem. What should I do??"
750,very loud inner voice,"if this matters at all i am a maladaptive day dreamer 

my inner voice is just ongoing and never shuts up, especially with watching something im actually interested in. I still know whats going on and tet the story and everything, but still id like to be able to focus on it without my head talking.

dont know if this is common but it sucks alot. It often gives me a sort of headache from me trying to shut the thoughts up, which i guess ill call intrusive, and just have there be nothing said about anything up there while im watching. When i think back to me watching it i never remember the thoughts in the memory, just what happened on the show. 

Hope this makes sense to someone. Ive found that actually talking about something stupid that happens can make me feel dumb for having it going on, so maybe this will help."
751,"A poem I wrote this week about my depression and weed usage, after finally turning a corner","I'm not the best poet, or writer for that matter, I do these things just for me personally usually but I thought it could be relatable for some and after years and years of heavily 'self medicating’ with weed I finally made the step and received a diagnosis and began prescribed medication. Even just the diagnosis has improved my mental state dramatically, so I'm feeling very hopeful right now.

Anyway, here it goes:

I don't want to be stoned
I want to be happy

I don't want to be stoned
I don't want to be snappy

I don't want to be stoned
I want to feel love

I don't want to be stoned
But that's something I'm scared of

I don't want to be stoned
I want to feel clear

Now I'm not stoned I actually feel here"
752,"Vent, i really need help...","So, i realy like this girl. The Times we have meet have ment alot to me. She makes me happy and Feel good, she makes me a stabil person, she have helped me cope with my mental health Issues.

I need help

Sorry for my english."
753,I broke. I hit my breaking point. Idk how to cope with quarantine anymore.,My schedule has been destroyed. All my routines and everything I did to keep myself same and productive. Gone. It's been like 2 months of lockdown and I cannot take it anymore. I need this to fucking end.
754,"Boyfriend having death anxiety, how to help","My boyfriend asked me questions about death today. What I think happens after we die, do you think a person feels it before they die unexpectedly what does it feel like when you’re dying you think. Anyway I simply took it as him wanting to have a morbid philosophical discussion but it turned out as he said that for the past couple of days he’s been constantly thinking about death and unexpectedly dying and how fragile and unpredictable life is and it’s giving him major anxiety. He says he has so many plans in life and with me and his dreams and passions and the fact that any moment he could go just worries him and how he’s been thinking about it for so long. 

He also has a habit of watching horror/scary videos right before bed every night and has recently been writing an article for a website which involves the remains of people found dead and looking at their photos. I told him that these things may have implicitly triggered information in his head about death and dying and negative thoughts in general which is probably the only reason he’s having such thoughts. It’s not a sign of anything else. While he did agree that it probably has to do with it, I could see that emotionally he was still distressed and thinking about it. 

We all get obsessive thoughts from time to time that are very distressful. It’s natural. I just want to know what I could say to him at this point that might make him feel better and less focused on this thing. What would you say to someone or if someone here experienced such thoughts, what would make you feel better?"
755,My boyfriend obsessively confesses his thoughts to me and I don't know how to stop him?,"My boyfriend's need to confess his intrusive thoughts is ruining our relationship. When he had OCD about our relationship he would blurt out really hurtful stuff and cried a few times like ""I thought a girl was hotter than you""/""I thought I regretted not sleeping with a few girls before you""/""I thought I wasn't attracted to you for a few minutes"" etc. and these comments almost caused me to break up with him. 

I love this man. I really do, its been nearly 2 years but his need to confess is unbearable and I can't stop him. The last few weeks he has obsessively confessed weird porn he watched when he was 11-13 or mean thoughts he has had about others or confessing to cute things he did with his ex and he feels bad cos I'm so much better or whatever. . He seems to feel unbearably guilty unless he comes to me to see if I can forgive him? It's mostly memories and a lot of it is stuff he isnt even sure happened or if he made it up from overthinking. It's hard to say no cos he'll just say ""I did something really bad once"" and my curiosity overwhelms me and I HAVE to know!! I feel like I'm his therapist. What should I do to help and get him to stop?"
756,Meds that cause nightmares?,"I've been on maaaany anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, anti-psychotics, etc. over about 8 years.  
I've had issues in the past with nightmares but it was always sporadic, on and off. Lately (the last 3-4 months), I've been having vivid dreams &amp; nightmares fairly regularly...at least 4x/week. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this too? Any suggestions on how to handle that? I've finally been on a consistent dosage/combo that seems to best help my mental health, I'd hate to have to go back to trials :(

Currently on Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, Clonazepam, and Tylenol 3's."
757,Texted the suicide text line. They basically disregarded what I was saying and ended the chat when I needed help.,The title says it all.
758,Alter's names?,"After my previous system had fallen (I don't even know if that can happen, I just remember thinking it was just a phase and that I was just imagining it all, so I thought to just silence everything and end the system.. somewhat), most got locked away for months... Some even years. Like my overemotional side that is constantly depressed and sad all the time, I didn't feel it until recently, when I got a major breakdown and cried for half an hour non stop, agonizing and wanting to end it all.

\-I just want to die already, it hurts so much to live with monsters without any humanity left in them.. I cut, yes.. It's the only way I have of showing that I exist. I'm so sorry that this body is still alive, I tried and tried, but the evil sides don't want to die, they want to be immortal, to break the rules and to kill... i don't think I ever cried so much... Someone wanted me to promise that I'll stop cutting, but.. I.. Always break this one promise... I cried in agony, not being able to scream, only letting out silent screams. I think I had flashbacks of being curled up with my hands covering my face screaming : ""Please Stop! No more! I don't want this!"" I don't know what to make of this.. Maybe it's all the times dad beat me up, maybe something else... And I guess I'm a girl.. I don't know what to make of that, I don't really have a name anymore since I got locked up after the fall.. I kinda like the names Emily, Luna, Zoey, Alice and Ivy.. I don't know which one to choose though....

\-What a sad and pathetic little child she is. I don't have much to say here except that no name is worthy enough for me to bear. I guess now that I'm this situation I must choose or else this post won't have any meaning. After some extensive research, i believe Cruciatus to be the most fitting name for me out of all.

\- Well I guess it's my time to shine. Blood and bones is all I see, also guts and eyes and especially the terrified look in their eyes. ohhh how I love to listen to their screams of misery, who doesn't like to mindlessly cut someone open and watch them bleed out, trying to escape? The sight of blood excites me beyond comprehension, or maybe sticking a knife up their chin? My little Knifey friend is a virgin, I want to make him lose his virginity and STAB someone, so he gets to feel the magnificence of blood dripping from his tip 🙃 I need to choose a name? Who needs a name if everybody's dead? Such a mood killer he is telling me I won't kill everybody.. Well seems like I have to think of one, my last name was Fouro, pretty meh I guess. Too lazy to come up with one so I'll steal Ruvik, pretty cool character imo. Also ""Cruciatus"" thinks he's evil incarnate or something of that nature lmao, so he has no gender. What about me? I'm a guy Now the ""host"" wants me to leave, but I get the music by my side, he can't stop me when my music is on Heheheheh. While I'm at it, let me say this: Did you ever see how Sexy and HOT a dismembered girl's naked body looks? That shit is just soooo fucking good, makes me hard :P

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well that was awkward.. Like he said, music helps switching and ""boosting"" one's power. Had to switch quite a lot today I guess, now my head hurts. Welp, hope nobody's going to report this. Goodnight!"
759,Does anyone else cry abnormally easy? I appreciate any kind of advice or sharing your experience.,"This has been a problem for years and can result in very awkward and ugly situations. 

I have had the issue since i was very young.

The slightest raise of tones whether it's me or another person towards me or someone i care will make me want to cry. I can go from smiling to wailing in a second and in my head i can only think *ohfuck-ohfuck-ohfuck it's happening"" and i just want to die on the spot rather than experience the embarrassment.

I don't feel sad or scared, I am not sure what I feel I just know that I want to cry and my chin does that weird trembling thing and my eyes get red and wet.

It feels like holding back the ugliest sneeze ever.

The fact that i cry so easily makes me feel pathetic and i get angry with myself but that anger changes into feeling sad for myself.

I am usually a very cheerful laid back guy and this is especially embarrassing for me.

My social life is hanging by a thread.

How do i stop this?"
760,Why do I feel like I want to die but I don’t have the guts to?,"I’m a junior in college studying Cybersecurity. I have very bad imposter syndrome where I feel like I’m not deserving to be in my major. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I no longer take my meds because they just weren’t doing it for me anymore. I’m doing well in all of my classes except for one. My professor is known for being harsh and he left an aggressive comment on one of my assignments. 

I showed it to many people that work in the field to get other opinions and they all agreed the response was very much out of line. That’s when I talked to one of the heads at my school’s center for student success about it who later referred to me to the dean. I talked to the dean and he has 5-6 students that complain about my professor a year. I told the dean to take no action because I’m afraid of retaliation.

The intensity of the course and other things happening in my life made it difficult for me to do well. First off, I was getting cyber stalked by a guy I was seeing on this platform. Secondly, my grandpa from italy died and due to the coronavirus my family couldn’t attend a funeral. There was no funeral for him sadly. I told none of my professors about my loss because I didn’t want to seem like an over emotional female. I also feel like I only had one day to grieve because the next day I had to go to my work study job. 

On the bright side in my other Cybersecurity classes I have all As in them and I also have an A in my German class. I feel like if I don’t pass the course I’ll end up acting upon my thoughts which I don’t want to do."
761,Advice on calming down after an anxiety attack so I can sleep :(,"I (21) am isolating with my boyfriend in a flat above some slightly crazy neighbours. Earlier today at 3pm my bf ran down our stairs to collect a package he had been waiting all day for. My downstairs neighbour and some older relative of hers came out of their flat and started screaming at him, throwing insults at both of us, threatening with getting us evicted, insulting our appearances, it was really intense I could barely get a word in.

I have her number so I later sent her a text apologising (not that we did much to warrant that abuse) but she did not really take it very well and I instead recieved multiple huge long messages further attacking me and my bf. As soon as I had finished speaking with her over text the anxiety attack began. I have anxiety that’s really badly triggered by raised voices and aggressiveness. I must of been so stressed about trying to cool down the situation with my neighbour that it wasn’t till after I’d stopped trying to speak to her that I began physically shaking. I’ve got past the worst of it but it is now 2am and I am unable to sleep because I still feel so sick with anxiety. I don’t know how to get over it and calm down. I have such a daunting feeling in the pit of my stomach. I genuinely feel really really shaken and sort of scared of my neighbour. She’s done this before but not in a while, I’ve been too toeing around the house all day and I’ve been too scared to make noise in the kitchen so I haven’t really eaten.

Does anyone have any advice I just want to feel like it’s okay so I can sleep and maybe wake up tomorrow and not want to cry with anxiety"
762,A shift from social anxiety to general anxiety,"Growing up, I was very depressed because of some marks on my body. One on the wrist from self harm in seventh grade. One other on my neck that looked identical to a large hickey. I messed up a do it yourself mole removal when I was a junior in HS. It was a nightmare. I couldn't be around anyone in broad daylight with little clothing. I was only happy during cold or rainy days with sleeves and hoods to cover myself. 

""What the fuck is on your neck is that a hickey!?""

It wasn't just embarrassing around high schoolers. I could see the disgusted looks on people's faces such as my youth pastor at church. I wasn't going to tell anyone. I just had to take them damage and try to let let it kill me. You'd also think that people would figure it out it's a scar after seeing me on a consistent basis, but that's far from what the truth was.

I then started Invisalign braces. Already being so insecure about myself, I hated wearing them. I had an unavoidable lisp because I had a bite stopper for my overbite. Along with that plastic aligners were the white chunks all over the teeth. I also had white spots from stains that were on them my teeth which were a bit yellow to begin with. When I finished Invisalign, it left me with a severe posterior open bite that is still not completely fixed.

""What the fuck's wrong with your teeth?!""

I had to hide socially for a long time because of comments like these. By the time this braces journey began, my scars were, for the most part, faded and bot noticeable. I was still very insecure about my teeth. This was when my ear began to start popping non stop. Soon after this ear popping began, I met my dream girl. I had already had a crush on this girl, but I didn't fall in love until after my ear had began popping. This was also the time where things didn't work out with my dream girl.

I now look in the mirror and see a handsome young man. My scars are faded. My teeth are good. I'm so happy about that, but my head is furthest from healthy. I've ridded myself of a tremendous amount of social anxiety because of my appearance, but I'm constantly panicking due to my overall situation in life. I really really miss this girl. It's an extremely severe obsession and my right side eustachian tube pops several thousands of times on many nights when I try to sleep. This popping in my ear has been going on for about four years now. Every day. I think I may be a good candidate for a diagnosis of some sort of psychogenic movement disorder. When I'm in the midst of a night's sleep is when my popping is most rapid and intense. I'm always panicking and panicking. This is what makes me the most suicidal. This non stop popping in my ear."
763,Hey guys first post here.,"
My brother and I have started. Mental health podcast and thought we would share the link of anyone is interested in listening to it. 

https://www.facebook.com/100981624896607/posts/104889724505797/?d=n

We’re always looking for ideas on topics, feedback and to get people involved. 

Much love."
764,"My Dad is Having a Tough Time (OCD, Anxiety)","My dad (46 years old) has never struggled with mental illness before and is normally a perfectly happy person. However, after the COVID19 hit and the stock market fell, he lost some money which led to some major behavior changes. At first, he would just talk to himself a lot and take a lot of deep sighs and but my family figured he had gone through a difficult situation and was dealing with it and would get better. We helped with the money situation, by getting a professional to take care of finances so he wouldn't have to stress. 

However, over the last two weeks he just keeps getting worse. He yells out loud very often (like almost screaming) and keeps repeating ""why didn't I sell them before."" Also, he is never in the present. If anyone speaks to him, he doesn't process it cause he is stuck in his own head and when he speaks, it feels like he is reading off a script. With this, I mean that he isn't speaking in his normal voice and is completely monotone. He also can't sleep at night, pulls at his hair, and makes a face of deep pain like he is going to cry but he never does. 

He said that he has a deep fear now that the stock market will fall and he can't stop thinking about it. He even acknowledges that if it falls, it won't affect him, but he can't get rid of this fear which is causing extreme anxiety. With this, we believe he has a sort of OCD and anxiety and it gets way worse in the evenings but it is present all day and all night. 

We talked to a doctor who gave him anxiety medication but that only seems to make it worse. I don't know how to help him, and it is really difficult for my whole family now. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences or knows how I can help my dad? I really appreciate any advice. Thank you!"
765,I want to live,I want to change
766,I can't find the right words to say and it's eating me up inside AND I'M IMPLODING,"This happens to me occasionally. I'm in the middle of a conversation and I can't find the right words to say or I'm saying the wrong words to describe something. And it aggravates me. What's even worse is that I google why this is occurring and nothing comes up but ""Why is it that you cannot come up with words when you're angry?""  BUT I WAS NOT ANGRY UNTIL THAT HAPPENED. 

That was supposed to be it but to hell with it, I'm just going to get sh\*t off my chest now. I've told my friends but they never cared. The very worse you guys could do is give me the same treatment. 

My OCD is getting bad. I keep thinking about pencils going through my hand and it freaks me out. I've implemented a ritual to deal with it but that does not work. There have been times where I thought that I might do it to give me the relief and that scared me. I'm hoarding pornography. First it started with me writing URLS in a book when I was a pre-teen, then bookmarking videos( then again, I bookmark everything I've opened just In case I need it) and now I'm downloading. I barely ever go back to watch anything so it's literally there just because if it's not there, it'll be on my mind forever. I feel like my OCD has evolved from the symptoms everyone assumes people with OCD have to the crazy symptoms. At one point it was sexual OCD and now I'm scared I want to put a pencil through my palms. I used to be a perfectionist that cared about order ans symmetry but things changed and became more violent and weird. Perhaps it's the household I live in but I don't know.

I'm afraid of blood and violence even if it's just a cartoon like Family guy. That is evidently not normal.

I daydream for hours at a time thinking about how much of a successful person the future me is while being broke and get nothing done. I'm a dunce, a literal dunce. I constantly argue with people I disagree with, even if we agree with 99.9% of things. That 0.1% gets to me. I hate arguing, it just happens. 

I have severe anxiety in public. Sweaty hands, not being able to be still (ever, I must move or stand), heart palpitations, heavy sweating, stomach aches (mainly in Uni, goes away afterwards). I even stopped going to classes and one of the main reasons why I go to school is because I need to get out of this house and that's one of the two places I could go to. But I avoid places with plenty of people staring and when I'm forced into those situations, I get paranoid. Even when I'm alone, my anxiety sneaks up on me.

I procrastinate everyday. I've wanted to start a YouTube channel for the last 6 years. Literally everyday, I said tomorrow. Everyday. I tried putting deadlines...Nothing. So I put the ultimate deadline of if I don't accomplish what I need to accomplish by the age of 30, I'll just end it. Then I lowered that to 25 when I did poorly in my exams. Nothing has changed. Either I'll do it or I'll pussy out because of my fear of pain.

I can't talk to women without my leg shaking uncontrollably and my heart just beating noticeably (to me obviously) hard. 

I worry hard about what people think about me and I wonder if I'm overstaying my welcome. When in front of my friend's friends, I wonder if they hate me because of the way I talk (I cuss a lot) and act. Some of them look t me weird. 

One time I had a manic episode and got a stupid Pinterest tattoo on my foot and another one on my wrist and also bought a thousand dollar watch without reason (at least I got into watches). The tattoo on my wrist hurt me more mentally than physically while getting it. There are long periods of time where I wonder how the hell I got tattoos considering my fear of pain and needles and basically sharp things. Other times, I'm fully motivated to get a tattoo. I'm becoming irritable af as of late.

There was a girl I liked that my close friend actually liked as well. Obviously I didn't chase after her (chase isn't the word I want to use but it's better to use that than destroy my computer from the anger of not remembering the word I usually use) and obviously he did and succeeded. And then he tried to jokingly run me over with his car with her watching. And tried to fight me with her watching saying that I wanted her because I talked to her a lot. But I never went after her or even explicitly said I liked her or anything. I was even more mean to her because my naive ass thought that that's how I could convince him that I wasn't after her. Of course, both made me paranoid, laughed behind my back but fronted to my face and then acted like they were victims when his (possibly) drunk ass almost crushed her. I tried to be there for them even after all the BS but they didn't want me there. I saw her one time in the mall and smiled while her hand was in her cast and her eyes bruised and I think she took it as me laughing at her. Still worried about that for no reason because those two never cared for me and likely don't think about me now. Man I suck!   

I'm depressed but that's obvious. Should just blow my brains out because of my stupidity but to die a failure draws me back into reality. I'm a clusterf\*\*k of emotions and contradictions. I suck. I really suck. Prozac does not work. Therapy scares me since I have trust issues. 

This has a lot of mistakes and only shows the tip of the iceberg in terms of my struggles. I wish I could've used better words and write this smoother and better and I'll forever be irritated by how this post flows but I had to vent."
767,A book I wrote about mental health,"Hi! So for the past few months I've been writing a book about my friend who was involved in a dark web organization at a very young age all the way until now to this day. From what I know about simple psychology based on my own experience I decided to not let his story go to waste. He used to run a blog on the tor browser and on the ""Rambles"" tab he would talk about his life struggles. So I decided to make a fictional story based around his life. Of course I couldn't just write about his life due to the lack of story in the blog, but I instead of making up a story I also merged in my own experience with mental illness.  If you want to check it out I'll leave the link in the comments. Thank you for your time!"
768,Am I the only one here thats fine with quarantine?,"I’ve heard that so many people haven’t been coping very well with keeping inside all of the time, and to those people I want to say keep up the good work! It’s all going to work out fine, I know that it’s hard for you but it’l be worth it once this is all over! Anyways though, personally I’ve been coping fine, I’m treating it like a more annoying school holidays, I don’t particularly have any big urges to see my friends again, I’m pretty happy being alone but I kind of wish that my family would leave me alone for a day or two. I don’t really require happiness to live, and quarantine makes it harder to feel happy so that might be why I’m coping so well. I hope everyone who is struggling has a good day!"
769,I feel different during COVID,"*Pr-amble: I am not trying to claim that I have been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or any mental health disorder. I understand that people live through how I feel regardless of their situations and while I will never know exactly how they feel, I try my best to empathize with what they have to go through daily.♥*

I have always been an anxious and emotional person but I am REALLY struggling through this quarantine. I am not even very social but I just feel sad all the time being so isolated and trapped. It's also when I start to think of all the things I have to do or can't do anymore. Sometimes it just feels like there is no point.

I work at an elementary school with differently-abled kids and it is so hard to think that I may not be able to physically see them until 2021 and seeing them online is just not the same. I also live in an apartment with a new puppy on the third floor and a cat who she wants to chase all the time. On top of that, my neighbors bellow me started cussing at me today while I was watering my plants on the patio. Taking care of my plants is one of the few things that actually give me joy right now and I don't even want to go out there now because I am afraid she will do it again. I feel so overwhelmed, trapped, and sick to my stomach when I think about the uncertainty of all of this.

I feel like I am missing out on the joys of life because my mind is always so full of worry and doubt that everything will be okay. I have a hard time lately seeing the good in situations that should be memorable or fun.

I am sorry for the rant but I feel so alone and don't want to constantly wear on my partner who is experiencing worries of his own.

I do not consider myself a person who is at high risk for self-harm or anything like that but I just don't know how to get through the days feeling like this anymore. I just want to lay in bed all day and keep the world out but I know that's not good for me.

Is anyone else experiencing this at this time? 

Does anyone have tricks that help them get through panic attacks?"
770,Do you believe that you bring out the worst in people?,
771,Parents are unsupportive and are surprised I’m upset,"A few months before spring I started working on a shawl I had planned it for months and months and was always talking to everybody about how I’m gonna make a shawl and have sunflowers embroidered onto it and how exited I was.

For Christmas I got yarn cause at the time I was super into crochet, and I started work on it a little while later. So I started work on it later in December and after along time (around 6 hours) and a ton of weekends and aching hands I was halfway done.

My dad walked into my room at around 10:00 at night and asked what I was doing and after explaining, he told me that what I was making was stupid and how under his watch I’ll never be allowed to wear something stupid like that.

It. Crushed. Me. I cried myself to sleep for a while cause until now I thought they were supportive but he came into my room and said what I loved to do was stupid.

So I stopped that project and didn’t do any others for a long long time cause they hated what I wanted to do so what’s the point. This coupled with my sexuality and school contributed to my depression and suicidal thoughts that I had for a long time.

Now tonight we were talking and I brought it up and my dad basically said “wow I didn’t know I said that” sounds good but then he told me “but I was saying the truth, I’d never let you leave with some scarf on”

He and my mother continued to laugh at me and say stuff like “that would be a nice gift for your grandma” and “you should thank me for stopping you from being bullied”

At last my dad told me “I’m sorry I said that, but again I was doing it to protect you” I was done with his s*** so I told him “oh so what your saying is I’m sorry I hurt your feelings but I did nothing wrong so really you should thank me”

He shut up but kept saying the same thing about how he was sorry but I did it to protect you, I kept saying what I said in my last paragraph and he shut up and changed the subject.

I hate that they laugh at me and call what I like stupid and then are surprised I’m upset at them, I feel like nothing I do is good enough for them, and that I can’t do anything. 

I hate being depressed and feeling with like I’m worthless while they sit in their bed and laugh and talk about how my of a psycho I am.

I hat myself for feeling like this"
772,question: What can I do to help someone who suffers from anxiety and depression?,"I don’t think I have ever suffered from a mental illness, but I want to learn how to support those who do. Although I will never be able to truly understand what they are going through or feeling, I want to be able to help in anyway I can to make their life better. So what are ways that I can be of help, support and love to them without being overbearing or too much?"
773,I'm very exhausted,"Hello

I currently work as a web developer, in the process of migrating to game development. I still don't work with games but I'm almost there.  
I have been working hard this past year but I am not satisfied with the results. I feel that I am on the right path but I am feeling very exhausted.

I have no energy in my body and mind. The lack of energy takes away my desire to do anything. I feel like my head is sleepy, thoughts are foggy and I can't reason as I used to. As a programmer, I see my logic getting weaker and weaker. I feel myself getting more and more ""dumb"". Even my current job is in a good company, but even it is unbearable.

Anyway, I don't know what's going on with me. I'm finally getting something I've always wanted but it seems like my body and mind don't not follow.

Does anyone know what's going on? What do you suggest?  
Has anyone been through something like this?   
Any kind of advice is welcome.

Thank you"
774,My physical description of anxiety,"Sometimes i can physically feel the anxiety inside my body, not like having a panic attack and the heavy breathing and shaking and stuff, but rather the anxiety itself. I have and oddly specific way of describing what it feels like. here it is...

for me the physical anxiety is a layer of fog surrounding my heart getting so dense near the heart itself it’s almost a solid but then it gets less and less dense the father away it gets from the heart and it goes through the walls of the lungs too like they aren’t even there and stops by the time it reaches the outside of the ribs.

i don’t know if anyone else feels this but i thought i would share."

776,Anyone know how to help my husband work through his emotionally abusive childhood?,"Husband has finally admitted that he was emotionally abused as a child. He wasn’t allowed to have emotions, was locked in his room for hours if upset, was left with various nannies, and was never allowed to seek comfort.

Now, he struggles with being too adaptable (doing whatever other people want) and thinking he’s a terrible person while pedestalizing others. He would have gone to any ends of the earth to get his family to accept him just a few months ago.

This is something he has finally admitted he struggles with and he asked me how to start working on these issues, especially with his mom and somewhat with his dad (both were extremely cold and punishment heavy). His one condition is that he doesn’t want therapy since he’s had bad experiences with multiple therapists in the past.

Any advice on how to get him started? Books he could read, podcasts, YouTube channels, etc. he’s super nervous and is wanting me to help him figure out where to go from here. TIa!

TL:dr; husband wants to start working through emotionally neglectful childhood but doesn’t know how to do it."

778,Advice on self-care after some suicidal thoughts?,"I'm 26 from California, USA.

The latter half of 2019 up to now was nothing but downhill for me. 

I went through two family deaths, a big car accident, and a suicide attempt. Then COVID and this Shelter In-Place happened. The high levels of isolation is driving me insane, anxious, depressed, and suicidal. Social media and the news is nothing, but COVID and I will get shunned upon by these people if I get caught going outside just to take care of myself. I lost one of my best friends through a bunch of arguments that built up and exploded in the end. I truly feel alone in this world, and I want to be stronger from this. Right now, after the relationships that were ruined, I want to learn how to fend for myself without anyone, y'know?

I contemplated on suicide last night, but never did it because I have this tiny bit of hope that things will get better. I ghosted all of my meetings and conversations with other people because my level of anxiety just spikes easily now. I uninstalled FaceBook and Instagram because there's nothing except COVID-this, COVID-that, ""stay home or kill your grandma"" posts...

So now, after a lot of contemplation, I realized that I need to change my mindset and my lifestyle to help me feel better about myself. I'm not sure where to start. I know exercising will help a bit for me, especially with my self-image. I also want to go back to some hobbies, such as singing, dancing, and reading to distract myself from everything in this world. I haven't been sleeping well for the past 2 months because I deal with insomnia. 

If you have any pointers in where to start in taking care of myself, that'll be great. I know these suicidal thoughts will come back again, but I wanna make sure to control it better in the long-run. Thank you."
779,Who has tried betterhelp.com? Any thoughts about it? Recommended?,It says text optional here but then post body must contain text.  Hmm
780,So I'm a 16 yr old female and i want to gain some answers about myself.,"Please wait before you jump to any conclusions and let me explain myself. So as a child I suffered from a significant amount of abuse physical, sexual, and mental. Just to say the least I'm proud fucked up but i want to take a journey to figure somethings out. 
  I suggest if you don't want to listen sign off now it might get a bit iffy. 
   So why not start at the beginning right my ma was very mentally ill and still is. She had the baby blues when she had my older brother and tried to suffocate him. I know, I know what does this have to do with me well lets just say it only go worse with her. Custody was given to my grandma on my dads side because my dad was too busy with work and when my ma had me she would have fits of rage from time to time. It got so bad she would throw knifes at my dad with me in his hands. They ended up getting divorced over her cheating and neglecting to take care of me or my brother leaving it up to my grandma and aunt.
 Moving on to more trauma along with getting bullied at school, and my brother despising me my elementary school days were filled with mostly physical abuse. First it was my dads gf Sara she hated my brother and i. She at one point threw my brother out of the car on the side of the highway and started to drive away as I screamed in the back seat to stop, my dad stopped the car and my brother got back in. Another one of my big memories with her is when she took the trash bin from outside and dumped out all the trash out in our room (my brother and i shared a room at the time). She didn't let us out or let us eat for the whole day and i was only 5-6 at this time. 
 The next person is where my memories get iffy around 3rd-4th grade my dad had shattered a few discs in his lower back from a work accident. We ended up not being able to pay bills anymore and had to move. While moving to place to place my dad had met another woman. Mary. Fun fact my therapist calls this time my cinderella story now allow me to tell you why. She had 7 children and my brother and i were forced to do everything around the house and me being a strong willed and headstrong child she would threaten me with throwing me down the stairs, harming my brother, or locking me under the stairs. I don't remember much from this time but i do remember her encouraging her children to gang up on my brother and me. The boys got in to fist fights a lot because of it and for me the 2 youngest girls would hit me with anything they could find. I remember getting put in the closet under the stairs with my worst fear at the time spiders and was locked in and laughed at. I was blamed for anything that happened there. I also can partially remember getting beat and thrown outside and also sleeping on the concrete in front of the fireplace in the middle of winter. 
 
Theres 2 traumatic events I'll tell but not go into details too much before i leave this post to get taken down within 5 mins. 

I was raped 3 times with in these last 5 years one of the guys is in jail. He was my friends dad and I thought of him as a father figure. He threatened if i ever ""tattled"" on him he would kill me. I was 11. The other 2 were guys that i knew through friends. 

And last but not least lets top this off with murder. A very sweet lady i knew because of my best friend was murdered within 2 blocks of me and my friend we both saw her as a mother figure/family. 

 So other then the bullying, cheating, lying, and those kinds of traumas you've read it all. I have major ptsd and large gaps in my memories at times. 
 The questions i have are:
  1. What made it so i didn't come out of all of this with any worse mental health issues?
  2. What can i do to get the memories back?

Sorry not sorry this was so long but I figured I might as well give as much details as i can muster and if you have any questions please feel free to ask."
781,How are you just okay knowing that you're going to die.,"Everyone dies and eventually nothing matters. Without religious bs what do we have to keep us going? How do people just accept that everyone around them will be dead soon. And so will they. Like come on, that's just fukin crazy isn't it?? Like what even is the point"
782,My experience with myself,"
Hi. I haven’t posted before, so let me try to get this right.

I want to put my story somewhere. Maybe someone can understand? Or maybe I just sound like I’m spewing nonsense. Be as harsh as you want. Maybe it’ll help me find my answer.

Before I start, let me say that I’m not on drugs. I’ve never used them. I also don’t have anything that would allow this to make sense. I’m just saying the things that I believe to be true most of the time.

A while ago, I became a “new person.” I don’t remember much about my past self, or how “I” came around. I still share the same name and natural traits (gender, sexuality, ect.) but I’m not her. I feel like she was lost. She went away. I believe she died in a way, and I had to replace her.

I know neither of us believed religion ever. None of this makes sense.

I know it had to happen, but things were starting to look up. I still don’t understand what went wrong.

I still have similar interests, but I reject everything heavily associated with it. It gets overwhelming to keep that stuff in my head.

I don’t want to be here, but other people want me here. I feel like she should be here. I don’t have any deep connections to anyone most of the time. I just want to leave, but I know doing so would hurt others, and it’s not my body to throw away.

I wish she would come back."
783,I need some advice/opinions about meds,"So my doctor has recently prescribed several medications to stop me from getting disregulated.... none of them seem to be working at all.

Just to be clear, these arent long term medications and yes I do therapy.

I just want some other people's perspectives on this (specifically benzodiazepines)

Any input/advice is helpful cause shit has been rough lately."
784,Feeling “lonely” before quarantine has made this entire experience even harder to understand.,"Being socially isolated has been difficult, but even more so because I felt emotionally distant which led to me being socially distant before it wasn’t a choice.

Let me also say that in no way am I criticizing the policies put in place. In fact both myself and my mom have suppressed immune systems. I am currently staying with my parents while I work on treatment for my autoimmune disorder. On top of that, my mom is going through treatment for breast cancer. 

Lots of really hard things have happened in the last year. All of which lead me to slowly drift away from people without even realizing it. Now that we are in quarantine, it has added a layer which makes it very difficult to tell whether my loneliness I feel is that which was already there or if it is even lonelier than before."
785,How did you get over your insecurities?,"I have an intense insecurity/ anxiety about everything about me: especially in terms of work, physical appearance, and personality.

I logically know that I shouldn't have these insecurities since I'm doing well at work, I'm from a prestigious university, and my SO and friends provide me with so much love and support. I feel like I'm not worthy all the time. I can trust my SO and friends with my life, but I'm too afraid to ask for help. I love them too much and think that asking them for help will be a burden to them or annoy them.

I sometimes need to drink to go to sleep and I realize that this is really unhealthy. Please provide me with guidance."
786,Is there any reason to the way I think or is there something wrong?,"TLDR: I don’t care about anything but I’m not sad and I don’t hate myself. Suicide seems rational but I can’t be bothered.

Let me preface this by saying that I don’t hate myself, I don’t think I’m ugly, I’m not sad over someone dying/not loving me back, I don’t think I’m a worthless piece of shit, etc etc etc.

I’m fine with my appearance, my abilities, who I am as a person. I hate saying this because I’ll always end up sounding like some edgy kid but I just really don’t care about anything. I’ve never had any real ambition, drive, motivation, or goal to pursue so I’ve always just gone with the flow or taken the path of least resistance. After high school I went to college because that’s what you do no? I applied for an engineering major because I show aptitude for science so sure, stem, let’s go.

Afterwards I went to graduate school. Why? It was that or work and I got my acceptance letter before I heard back from any of the job applications I sent out. That’s where I am now.

I’ve never had particularly strong feelings about anything, I’ve never felt any sort of real bond with other people. As a kid I think other people felt I was odd or distant so I was mostly ignored. I made friends in high school but it was one of those “this is a group of people I just spend time with” kind of things. I keep in touch with one friend from high school because we just meet up and catch up when I’m in town, otherwise we don’t speak.

I have one “close friend”, the only one I’ve ever had, that I’ve actively kept up with since undergrad. It’s primarily because of effort on their part although I do reciprocate. I think they find my being super accepting of other people (I don’t care enough to judge) and willingness to indulge other people’s interests comforting. I like them and I enjoy speaking to them but if they left, I’d be fine and get over it.

I’ve dated before “to see what happens”. I don’t think I ever even had any real romantic interest in them or anybody, so those things never lasted wrong. I was never upset about it. I haven’t bothered dating since after high school (it feels cruel on my part) and I haven’t been interested or felt drawn to anybody. I don’t understand what people mean when they say they “feel close” to someone.

As a kid I understood that my mindset isn’t typical. Suicide is something that’s always been at the back of my mind since middle school but it’s not some “I can’t deal with life, it hurts” kind of thing, it’s just “why not when I care so little”. There are times when I’ve felt down but I mostly just feel empty. I go through life robotically.

I’m not actively suicidal, there's so much work and research involved and I'll definitely have a reason to be if I fuck it up and I end up with a blown off jaw or paralyzed, but it feels like some sort of inevitability that’s always in the back of my mind. I exist just to exist, I’m already here so sure lets put some effort into things and not be a total waste of space, but why am I doing these things? They mean nothing to me.

I have hobbies to keep me my mind occupied, I crochet, I draw, I study, I’ll play video games. Do I enjoy them? I don’t know, I just like having something to do although sometimes I’m equally satisfied just laying in bed and staring at the ceiling.

Everything I’ve written up until now makes total sense to me.

Here’s when I’ll admit I start sounding off. I don’t think I was ever meant to exist. My mother was on the verge of dying giving birth to me. The only reason she didn’t is because some doctor that happened to drop by (they weren’t supposed to be there) that day knew what to do and was able to direct the other medical staff. I didn’t know this until I was an adult so it’s not like this was a catalyst for the way I think. It was more of an “oh that makes sense” moment, but that’s just confirmation bias no?

I don't think i'm a nihilist. I don’t think there’s real meaning to anything or a reason for anybody to exist but I think self-appointed meaning is just as valid as any sort of significance granted on a cosmic/spiritual level. I just don’t seem capable of giving that to myself.

Anyway, any of this make sense? It does to me. Or am I fucked in the head?

P.S: Thank you to anyone willing to read all of this."
787,I want to get better,I’ve been struggling with mental health for as long as I could remember but I always kept it to myself because I didn’t want to be burden on anyone but recently it’s been getting harder and I feel like I’ve hit a rock bottom and I need to get better but I don’t know where to start
788,Moving Out vs. Therapy,"I want to move out with my boyfriend in a year but decent therapy tailored to my specific diagnosis costs quite a lot per month. I feel like getting out of the house would alleviate the toxicity that greets me in my everyday life (my family) BUT I’m also actively trying my best to improve my mental health with therapy. The money I earn right now isn’t that much for the area I live in and I don’t plan on moving jobs anytime soon because of the current state of the economy. (I’m still very much thankful to still have my job) If I move out, I won’t be able to afford therapy or at least move out within the planned date of a year. If I go to therapy, I will live in this toxic environment longer than my planned date. Has anyone else had to make a decision like this?"
789,Always wondering,"Ok I don't know if I can properly explain this guys but I just want to know if anyone else does this. I dont know if there's even a name for it - maybe it fits into social anxiety, who knows. So whenever I am with people, or view people's lives or what they put on social media, it always makes me feel weird. Very weird actually- maybe anxiety, sickening anxiety. I try and I can't figure out how they do what they do. With their lives and their moods and their thoughts. How can they do this-and-this and be happy and fulfilled? I wonder all the time. Sometimes I'll even try to copy them but it never works. I dont know if I was able to properly explain this, or even if I can get someone to understand. It goes much deeper than what I wrote here. There's much more to it, but I'm desperate to know if anyone else has experienced this. Thank you in advance."
790,#Bipolar Mental Disorder,
791,Cardiophobia has ruined my life,"For the longest time, I've dealt with health anxiety issues regarding my heart. For these past four months, it's been much worse. I've have gotten pain in my left arm and jaw/teeth as well as a swelling feeling in my legs. I've asked my parents for me to go to the ER but they refused since I've gone to the ER several times in the past. The coronavirus pandemic isn't helping. I rarely go out of my room out of fear that I'll have a heart attack (I've been called lazy because of this) if I move too much although I have been able to exercise for about 10-13 min with very little pain. Sometimes when I'm on the exercising machine (idk what it's called) my parents ridicule me for not going fast enough. Whenever I tell them about what's bothering me, they scream at me for ""not eating enough"" or ""being weak"" and they still ask what's bothering me. I've stopped doing homework because I can hardly concentrate and I don't see the point if I think I'm dying all the time. I'm in a weird position where I'm very afraid of dying but it makes life so much worse."
792,Maybe have mild ADHD/share your experience,"So I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 10 and have been medicated pretty consistently since then, and has been the primary focus of my mental health and therapy.  Recently my parents kinda mentioned that I maybe get a test or evaluation for ADHD.  I kinda thought I couldn’t have had it since I was pretty good at school, (I know that sounds stupid now.) intelligent and studious since kindergarten but I started slacking and getting frustrated in middle school.  Recent years my frustration with school and generally work that I don’t find useful or interesting, has kinda exploded and manifested in crippling depression and anxiety.  Worth noting that my dad was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age and I’ve always viewed his more severe symptoms as the average experience.  He takes a pretty high dose of Concerta.  Sorry for kinda dragging on but I was wondering if anyone could share their experiences with getting evaluated or being diagnosed later in life.  Anything you think might be helpful I guess."
793,Do you ever feel like your reason for wanting to not exist is so.. silly?,"My reason is jealousy. Can be a such a strong emotion to feel, but to warrant feeling like I need to down all my pills? Absolutely bizarre. If someone wants to try and keep me from doing something incredibly stupid due to jealousy, boy would that make my entire night. It’s like. The smallest thing can just set you off and make you want to die. I’m trying so hard to be here. I’m shaking and I want to cry"

His most recent tik tok is him talking about ""the bad thing"" alot of fans are really worried because that was posted over 22 hours ago and he posts alot in a day. Can someone help me figure out what the bad thing is. I think i know but i need others opinions. Thank you"
795,Struggling with my Weight,"I realize I am really struggling with my weight recently. I have struggled with eating disorders in the past. I have an unhealthy relationship with food and lack of control, hiding emotions and stress are my big triggers.  Obviously all of that is at the fore front now with Corona. 
I see a lot of women posting about gaining weight and eating all day and things and it's so triggering. I feel hungrier than normal sometimes and I can't help but eat more. Then I feel sick to my stomach because I overate. The fact that I feel constantly drained from work and can't refill myself doesn't help. 
I see myself hating my body lately and focusing on numbers that I know are unhealthy. I'm very close to underweight and look like it. I'm worried about the obsession and negative effect it is having on my health. I'm scared to talk to people about my problems lately because I feel like they have so many things to deal with, but I needed it to be out in the open. I just want to feel beautiful and look healthy."
796,How do you deal with not fitting in anywhere or having a group of friends?,It’s days like this where I feel truly alone and like I don’t belong anywhere in this world. It’s a shitty feeling and I’m not sure how to get over it
797,"My sister's long-time boyfriend just died of a drug overdose. She (27) has GAD and an otherwise manageable proclivity to substance abuse. How do I help her when the rest of my family seems to be somewhat chaotic in their approach. Don't Upvote, I don't need exposure.","This happened 2 days ago. I (24) was sitting at home celebrating because I just got into Columbia. Then my mom woke me up and told me what happened. I don't know the best way to approach this situation because I have dealt with severe mental illness with myself, and substance abuse but never the loss of a loved one. We're concerned because my sister has a prescription to some narcotics for anxiety and drinks a good deal on the weekends.  


She's very responsible and very dependable but my question is how can I be, because she shouldn't be expected to have a very high level of self-care right now, or should she? She dated her boyfriend for 9 years on and off, high school sweethearts, and always best friends. She has cried since I saw her shortly after it happened. She won't look anybody in the eyes. I think when she talked to him a few days ago she said she didn't want to talk to him anymore because he was using, so I imagine she feels guilt. She's very smart but can also be superstitious. I don't know that she's not blaming herself.   


She also has above-average anxiety about COVID-19...   


Please give me some strong, strong direction. Thank you."
798,It gets better?,"To start, I’m not in any immediate danger, although I have a plan of what I want to do, I also have some things that I know I need to face before I can go forward with anything. But I don’t believe this whole “it gets better thing.” I’m on my second antidepressant, the first one increased my SI thoughts and even though I feel like the new one might be slightly working I really got so comfortable with the idea that this would all be over with soon, that I really don’t want the new pill to work. I’m in my 30’s and have a massive amount of debt, no idea what I want to do with my life because I don’t feel I can do anything and struggle to stay at any job longer than 3-6 months because I always feel like I’m not good at my job which makes me not like what I’m doing. I have one friend, but we rarely talk and I can’t talk to him about anything serious and I rarely talk to my family and again when we do, we don’t talk feelings. I was talking with my therapist about some of this and she’s trying to get me to work on my internal narrative that is so hateful to myself. She asked me, if I could have anything for my life what I would want and the only things I could come up with are to be debt free and to own a house. She asked me what about a partner? And I told her no, I don’t want anyone and she made me feel like i have to want someone, but I don’t understand why it’s so off to think that I want to live alone. She told me that it’s possible to change these negative thoughts I have about myself, but it takes work, I just don’t get how this will work if I don’t believe it will work and if I really truly believe it would be easier to end it. I guess this doesn’t really have a point but how can so many people tell random strangers things will get better when the world is so messed up and we have no clue what is really going on in anyone’s life."
799,Something is trying to get me to give up,"Life always seems to work against me. I was borderline suicidal in highschool. I thought to myself. All of this work all of these long nights will pay off in college. I get to college and my life gets monumentally worse. The “anxiety and depression” I had in highschool was actually manic and depressive episodes. I was diagnosed bipolar in January. But of course not before I failed a class in college cause my first semester was just one giant bipolar episode. 

Now I’m in this fucking quarantine and I had to move back with my parents. I’m drowning in school work I failing math A SECOND time and struggling to do the work from my other courses I haven’t seen my bf of 2 years in a month. I was supposed to see him tomorrow and of course my dad gets some kind of cold so now we are on lockdown again ( even though we haven’t been out since early March and both my parents work from home). 

Yesterday I got bit by a tick even though I live in LOS ANGELES and I have FUCKING LYME DISEASE. 

Something is trying to get me to give up. And I’m just about to. I see no fucking point. Nothing gets better for me. My life has been a train wreck for 5 years straight. I’m bipolar my meds barely work for shit. 

My years of verbal abuse, trauma, and bipolar depression are going win. 

I’m thinking about giving up."
800,Suicide thought is always my first go-to solution when feeling stressed,"Got a bad grade? Suicide. Can’t fly back to my home country due to COVID-19 because I forgot to upload my temperature for 1 day? Suicide. Can’t get into the major I want to? Suicide. I had one suicide attempt many years ago and another one a year ago, and recently I realized this is my first reaction when coming to a stressful situation. This is very unhealthy I know, but I don’t know how to fix this. Any ideas?"
801,How can I cope with intense sexual frustration?,"I’m a 19 year old male and I have never even kissed a girl. So basically I am very sexually frustrated and I see very attractive women on my Instagram and it makes me even more frustrated, since I can only watch and not actually do anything with the girls. Finding an attractive girl is very tough these days, so what should I do? I can’t deal with it. All advice is appreciated."
802,not wanting medication,"do you ever feel averse to wanting to take medication for various reasons?

side effects, feeling numb.. feeling like you aren't feeling life totally..

that's how I've felt... family members have encouraged me to try and take meds for bipolar

i took zoloft when i was a teen and they diagnosed me with anxiety... i haaated it and got off shortly after. made me feel like a zombie.

are meds life long? i was always under the impression that medication is for short to medium term in combination with therapy.

do some people take meds for their whole life?

is it worth trying?

i am sober and so proud of myself for being so. so I'm turned off by drugs off all kinds.. i am weary of them due to past experiences battling substances...

thoughts?"
803,Chronic feelings I’ve been having.,"Been struggling with this as of late 2019:

• Crying at least once a week. Usually Twice. (Unlike my prior once every 4 or so months.) Its hard for me to stop once began, and I’m feeling tightness of chest.
• I’ve been having more “down” days. Where I feel hopeless or like I’m stuck. 
• When I feel down, it no longer feels like it’s just in my head. But it takes over my body. My chest feels tight. I feel like I can’t move. I feel like my insides are curled up, hollowed, or like they’re sinking. (I hope that’s a decent description.)
• I’ve been really missing my mom. She’s alive, and lives just 40 min away. I don’t make it home often because of work. But lately I’ve come to the realization that ‘wow, no one loves you more than your mom’ and my insides start to sink again, I start bawling, and feeling terrible about how simple it all used to be. How I never took advantage of the days when I was back home spending time with her. How I never thanked her enough for all that she’s done for me. 
• I’ve spent years trying to gain the things that I have now. And now that my dream life is here, I feel incapable enjoying it. I feel so dissatisfied even though I thought I knew what I wanted. I always changed my environment — my location, my job, my friends. I was hoping I’d become a better product of my environment and that this would satisfy me. It hasn’t. 
• I make big issues of small things. (Thinking calling out of work one day would get me fired, thinking if I don’t show up to a social event I’ll let down others.) This usually results in me stuck on the couch, unable to move, tight chest, bawling. 

I’m really stuck here. Can anyone help me?"
804,i think i have undiagnosed ocd and i am sick of living,"i keep having delusions and sensitivity to different things and it drives me quite literally insane. i have been crying for the past 3 hours because i decided to throw my laptop and it lost my progress on a math assignment. i also threw my glasses so now they are crooked and it really bothers me when i try and wear them, so i have a raging migraine. i also really really fucking hate my boyfriend. we have been together since march 2018, broke up in november 2019, and got back together two months later. i wish i was still broken up with him but i feel manipulated. he really is toxic, and doesnt give a shit about me. i feel like nothing more than an accessory to him. i feel hollow; people enjoy me for my looks and not my personality. i feel like all my ""friends"" will never be there for me. no one fucking cares about me everything is miserable. all my family gives a shit about is my marks so i get into an ivy league or some shit. i am sick of everything. i wish people knew more about me."
805,I feel like I haven't been my true self in front of people for the past 4 years,"I've been dealing with increasing problems with anxiety and struggles to find self worth for a long time. I feel like whenever I'm around people, I still feel alone, and I'm constantly unhappy with myself, sad/mad about previous ""failures"" that have occurred in my life, or just feeling numb and unresponsive to any sort of emotion. I used to be extremely social and would love to spend time with other people, but now I just don't feel like talking to anyone, except when I feel like I'm losing hold of myself and just need someone to talk to so I can feel alive and like I exist. It's gotten to the point where when I'm extremely quiet, downtrodden, or downright emotionless or not emotionally or mentally present, people just think that's the way I am. Whenever I try to open up to people about these struggles, including my own family members and friends, they don't take me seriously, and I feel like sometimes I'm just searching for pity or something. I literally came home every single day last year and laid on my bed and cried, and when I'm with other people I'm like a robot, just greeting them occasionally and making stupid small talk that doesn't mean anything to me at all. Now I'm also afraid of being too dependent on other people for anything, even as friends, because I feel like I may just be a burden or I may exploit others unintentionally just to make me feel a little bit better. I feel like I'm just in a pit of anxiety, self hatred, and it doesn't help that I just can't trust many people anymore since I'm always available to help others but when I need help they just turn their backs on me. I didn't even realize there was anything wrong with me until recently, since I've been living like this for so long. I just want to stop feeling this way, but it's so difficult since it seems ingrained into my mind at this point."
806,Please do not bring your firearm into businesses to intimidate employees that are required to ask you to wear a mask,"Happened at my job today and I proceeded to have an anxiety attack and was physically shaking for an hour. I do not get paid enough to face down a gun and I already suffer from PTSD, anxiety disorders, and depression and deciding you want to flex on grocery store employees because you’re so intimidated by us you need to carry a gun in case an employee asks you to wear a mask as required by our employer is absurd. Just please fucking stop I have enough trouble holding a job in normal circumstances I don’t need to fear for my life going to a minimum wage job."
807,does anyone else feel like this,i don’t want to die but i really don’t want to live. i get su**idal thoughts but i know i’ll never act on them
808,I no longer have a substance problem but my hair follicle test might say otherwise,"i have been sober since september 2019 with one occasion of a slip up where i smoked a joint in april. i used to take party pills, benzos, pregablin and smoke pot on a daily basis for 2 years straight. i attend a health assessment next week and the outcome i want from him is to say that i am no risk to myself or the public health as i want to go back to praciting as a nurse. should i mention the one slip up of smoking a small amount of marijuana or should i not? he has my results from my urine, blood and hair folicle drug test which i had to attend to last week, and i assume that traces pattern of drug use. he has seen me once 2 years ago and deemed that i had a substance abuse disorder. 

Longstory short - should i mention to him about smoking weed once or not? he has my urine, blood and hair folicle sample which i am not sure if it states that i am positve or negative for any substances."

811,Doc is decreasing my meds until I'm off.,"I am happy, mindful, active, and energetic again. I have started meditating, eating better, and have a much better relationship with my SO. I'm hopeful for the future again."
812,I do not know the meaning of my life,"I play, study, spend time with family, but everyday I wake up, and I think, what am I living for apart from the stuff I must do like school and homework. I'm not sure what the meaning of life for me is. Is that on the verge of depression?"
813,"Dealing with some of the obsessive parts of my OCD relating to suicidal ideations during this quarantine has been a challenge. Anybody else having these issues, and anyone have any advice?","My suicidal ideations are, in a nutshell, from a place of fear rather than a place of despair. While I do suffer from depression (which has been severely exacerbated by the quarantine), my suicidal ideations are not a symptom of suicidality, as my psychologist and psychiatrist (and one other psychologist) have assured me, but rather a symptom of my OCD - worrying that I will deteriorate to a breaking point in the near or far future. The current quarantine measures have worsened this obsessive line of thinking, and my usual affirmation is not working as it used to - “I’m not suicidal. Three mental health professionals have assured you of this. You have obsessive compulsive disorder, and this is a symptom of it.” Any advice on dealing with these thoughts during this rough period? I know logically that will be okay when the quarantine measures are all over, because I was making good progress in therapy and on my medications before this started. But the OCD and depression are doing that thing they do where they convince me that this will never get better."

817,Numbing out with seroquel,"Hi I can’t stand the isolation and anxiety all I do is take seroquel day and night I just woke up from a 12 hour sleep and ill be on to the next I don’t know what the fuck to do (I have an anxiety diagnosis but was told to take it in emergency cases only, didn’t take it for a year so I just built my supply)"
818,I don't feel real and others don't feel real to me.,"It feels like I'm stuck in a coma or something waiting till I wake up. I've done things to try and connect myself to the world. Such as cutting, leaving myself under hot water. It temporarily works, but I soon find myself back into the belief that everything is fake much like a simulation.  I try to ground myself by pointing out some things in the are, things that I can immediately feel (touch) etc... To ground me but does not work for long. 
This is not fun. Never was. 
I notice that every time a dream that I can remember,  I die, and then I wake up. So what makes me believe otherwise that this is but another dream. 

I go hiking, see new things but it all has an underlying theme.  It's not real. I feel but I'm nothing but a machine who has these sensors to help interpret and direct you towards a ""destiny."" The people I love is not real, which leads me to question,  ""will i see them if i wake up?""

I'm plummeting downward. (9.8m/s × 100,000). 

I really want to know what's wrong with me. I'm growing weary everyday waiting for my answer."
819,where to start with therapy,"this is something i’ve thought about a lot but i’m so terrified of where to start

context: in college, on my parents insurance. don’t want them to know about it (do not want to be a burden or concern) have no idea if it’d be covered and where or what i would expect to pay. my college has resources and i have heard so many bad things about them. i dont even know if this is what i should do but i at least want to see my options and wonder what other peoples experiences are w the first step"
820,is there something wrong with my gf?,"hi, i have an account but i'm using this second one.

I'm 25 years old and my girlfriend is 18.

We are a same-sex couple,and have been together for over a year.

I'm concerned about her mental health. In high school she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. At sixteen she was falsely accused of assault. She is a very loving, gentle and kind girl. She would never hurt anyone.

But lately, over the last six months, our intimate moments have become rough. Very rough. She will slap me, bite my lips, neck, breasts etc. I don't really mind this, and didn't think much of it until i decided to look through her internet history.

I understand some people like gore, I really do, but..this was something else. I found links to the site best gore. They were things like people getting beaten up, choked, and just a straight up search for ""abuse."" 

Can someone please help me? I don't know if i should talk to her about it or not. Ilove her with all my heart, and want to help her as best I can if there is an issue.

(also, i clicked one of the links, and i have no idea how she watched the video.)"
821,Any advice would be amazing,"Hi, I’m 18 (f) and I have Bipolar Depression (diagnosed when I was 14)

I just moved in with my boyfriend of two years, I know there’s a pandemic going on but I living in a very mentally and emotionally abusive household and I was genuinely on the verge of suicide.

Things have been a lot better since I got here, it’s been about a month. We live with his grandparents, parents and two little brothers. They’re the family unit I’ve always wanted to be apart of and it’s amazing!

My problem is that I still have my days where I’m miserable, obviously my disorder wasn’t going to disappear. Nothing triggers it, I just wake up and I feel empty, nothing matters, I’m physically and mentally exhausted and I just want to sit on the couch in our room and stare into space. 

I can tell it hurts my boyfriend when this happens because he tries his best to do anything that could make me feel better, he tries to get me to tell him what’s wrong but I just can’t, because nothings wrong, my body is completely empty during my episodes.

I don’t know if anyone else has ways that they can mask their episodes so that I can atleast put on a facade of ‘I’m fine’ and just stay like that until the episode passes. And secondly I don’t know what to tell him when he begs to know what’s wrong.

I just want some kind of way to cope without sinking into the couch for an entire day, I’ve started a new life living here and I want to live every day the best I can"
822,Crippling anxiety,Idk where to start. Ever since the quarantine started my mental health has just dipped so hard. I was completely fine throughout the year with school/sports and have always been an anxious person but it has never in my life been remotely this bad. Every time I think about certain things I just always start to think negative and think about the worst possible outcomes and it just spirals uncontrollably. I know in my head where overthinking about certain things will lead me but it’s just an uncontrollable and almost inevitable outcome to worry about these things. I am too embarrassed to talk about these things to anyone because they will probably just think I’m a pussy or they will just not understand where I’m coming from. I hate going to bed at night because that usually triggers more overthinking and worrying as I am laying down with nothing to think about. Hopefully someone on here can understand where I’m coming from and maybe provide some helpful tips on controlling anxiety.
823,Losing track of date and time,"While others are working,I can't work due to covid,because of my job nature and poor business. Since then I've been steadily losing track of time. Counsellor called twice and I defaulted on her phone appointment. Ordered at least 4 animal crossing plushes and one egg. N I still want to get gelatoni from Duffy n friends. Fuelling some kind of shopping addiction. Long queues at baking shops so I can't buy stuff to practice baking. Nintendo switches are mostly sold out. I feel like I'm becoming less religious as nothing seems to go right these days. Baked a cake n steamed it n it never cooked properly. Random shipping delays. So many nightmares and self doubt. Starting to alienate myself from my church."
824,Why do I only feel anxious and depressed around other people ?,"When I live alone, I feel so at peace I forget I even have anxiety. But when I live with my roommates (I haven’t felt this way living with others) my depression seems worse and I feel anxious?"
825,Any help would be great,"I have some days where I’m so stressed that I’m doing literally 24/7 work because I have an extremely heavy workload and I’m just breaking down every 2 seconds while still trying to do my work because I have so much of it. (Not really super productive because in general I have no motivation or energy)

Then there are the days I’m just completely out of touch where I can’t focus and kind of just don’t care at all? And I can’t get anything done because I’m so tired and can’t concentrate or be motivated to do anything. 

How do I make it so that I get my work done in time?"
826,Asking for advice on how to get over a tic,"Guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you're all doing well. In the last 6 months or so, I have developed a bad tic which sporadically (usually onsetting about 4 or 5 times a day) makes me say ""Momma!"", much to my mom's annoyance (I'm a European college student, still living with her. I have never taken any medications regarding my overall mental health, but this has started to bug me in the recent period. 

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, it has never occurred to me in public, which is a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to overcome this?

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers"
827,Sad triggers,"I haven't cried in a while but recently there's been a few triggers that have really been close to just making me sob uncontrollably. I discovered the first trigger when i was listening to Red Extensions of Me by The Flashbulb, I think the song was Sensual Data, and it had a sample of somebody singing in a soft whisper voice ""it's a beautiful day outside"". I had to stop the song and go sit in my kitchen away from my computer because I almost burst into tears. I can't exactly pin point why. The general reason is because of my agoraphobia. But idk what about it makes me tear up. 

Second trigger is Skyrim music. The music is fine but it brings me back to a time in my life where my brain was at peace. Where I would play Skyrim and whatnot. I can still play Skyrim but I have to have the sound off or I get super depressed

Then I have intrusive thoughts of different scenarios that really hurt. Almost all of them involve a situation where everything is peaceful and happy. My brain is absolutely fucked. I'm also tired so that might be part of it."
828,Need advice on how to deal with stress caused by epileptic husband,[removed]
829,Can you please diagnose this?,"So, I’ve taken some tests and they say I have OCD, but I never clean or care about anything that’s not mine. But when my stuff is dirty and I start thinking about that, I have a mental breakdown. Earlier, I was about to sit down in my chair to play video games, and it squeaked. I started having trouble breathing for a while then saw a thick layer of dust on my desk and started crying. Does anyone know what this could be? Is there any way to help me?"
830,Is messing around sexually with someone else while young considered rape?,"I used to do sexual activities with a friend of mine when we were younger. He would look for me some times so we could mess around, but most of the time it was me. Many times after we came we said we shouldn't do it again, as we thought it was wrong since we were very young and we were both males. We both ended up being gay, and now sometimes he accuses me of ""making him gay"" since he says I was the one who wanted it to happen first (I really don't remember because we were about 8 or something). I feel bad and i've talked to him and he always says to me that he doesn't consider it rape but he still tells people that he was ""Kinda raped"".  


We once went to a psychologist together, since when we were 17 and it was still happening and he got his parents involved and it was a huge issue, so they went to a psychologist and made an appointment with me and my parents. He then told the psychologist I raped him. I tried to talk to him, my parents and his parents that it was something consensual and that he also looked for me.  He kinda forced me into coming out to my parents with this and I was only 17 (he was one year younger that me)  


Today we are still friends but his comments hurt me and I really don't know what to think, sometimes I get so paranoid about being a rapist and maybe having issues even though I've never again done anything related to rape or anything. It's affected my sexual life and I really don't know what to do and it has taken a psychological toll on me. I'd like to get more information on it or know what i can do or something, and hear your advices/comments. I never meant no harm, i was so naive and young! to me it was kind of like a game (even though we both knew it was bad)."
831,Feeling like there’s always someone watching me?,"I always feel like there’s someone watching me or something along those lines (ex: feeling like there’s someone watching me from a corner, like there’s someone waiting outside the door to attack me). It feels almost like a visual hallucination but I don’t see anyone (which probably doesn’t make sense). I feel like if I turn around or open a door someone is going to be there but I don’t ever see anyone. Sometimes I hear a door open or footsteps but there’s never anyone there and there’s never a door open. I’m terrified of actually seeing someone one day and I’m so scared of having a hallucination even though I’ve never had one before. It gets so bad that I can almost never sleep or if I’m in the bathroom I have to call my dad (sometimes wake him up) to come out and make sure no ones there. I’m almost always scared. Why do you think this is and any tips/advice or anything? (sorry if this is the wrong place to post this)"
832,I've become obsessed with the fear of not being understood after I die,"I'm (20f)  not sure how to explain this exactly, but I am increasingly becoming afraid that when I die, my thoughts/opinions/views/character/etc. will never be known by anyone. Not just by everyone in my life, but by anyone at all, even just one person. I also fear being forgotten about after I die. I'm not terminally ill or suicidal, but I keep getting extremely anxious that I'll die in a freak accident or from a dumb mistake and nobody will ever know what ""who"" I truly was.

I know this sounds a bit ridiculous and I'm sure everyone shares this fear. But its affecting me on a daily basis now and it never leaves my mind. I constantly feel the need to write down all my thoughts and share my ideas and views in the hopes that if/when I die, somebody can piece it all together to know who I was.

I have never felt this in my life. This started becoming really apparent about two or three months ago I'd say. I have become so paranoid that I'll suddenly die or lose the ability to share whats in my head that I've started to try and figure out a sort of doomsday device (dont laugh at me lmao) that goes off in case that happens. I want the passwords to all my accounts given to somebody in case something happens. That way they can see what I think or talk about (good or bad) and share who I actually was. 

I even reached out to a close friend recently and told him that in case I die, I want him to have access to my accounts and things online because I know he cares about me enough to look through some of it. I made sure that he knew I wasn't suicidal tho, obviously. We had a small conversation about it but I dont want to make him worry or anything so I never brought it up again. He wasnt alarmed or confused really, he just was reassuring me that he'd want to help in the event that it happens. 

I'm not necessarily scared of being *misunderstood*, but more scared of not being understood...if that makes any sense. I'm worried about being forgotten, while not to the same extent, but a lot too. I'm not really scared of dying or death itself, tho.

I'm sorry if this is hard to follow. Now that I'm writing this, I cant help but wonder if I'm writing this as a way to feed into this obsession. I'm sure everyone worries about this, but is it bad that I worry about this specific thing all day every day? Is that normal? I dont particularly enjoy drawing or writing but I do it so often now because I feel like I have to. I even started ""googling"" things in case when I die, somebody looks through my search history. I dont actually care about the results from googling random things, I just am making any desperate attempt I can think of. It makes me really uncomfortable. I genuinely am fixated on this.

I'm sorry if this makes me seem selfish or full of myself. I dont think I'm unique or important to the history of humankind or anything, I just think my greatest fear is never being understood. I'm serious when I say it never leaves my mind now. It drains a lot of my energy.

Is there a term for this? Anyways sorry for the long post."
833,Bad night every couple of months,"Every couple of months there is a night where every single bad thing people close to me have done or said to me just come to mind. Then I feel like nobody truly cares about me, and that I’m a burden to everyone, that I’m an afterthought, that I’m not good at the things I think I’m good at, that I’m my parent’s least favorite child, just a bunch of negative thoughts. In 2018 I was depressed and had severe anxiety, but I managed to overcome that and (I think) become a very positive person who is happy a lot. But even after all the overcoming I think I’ve done, I still have nights where I cry and think all these bad thoughts, and I think that If I had [means to kill myself] I would do it, no question. But then when I wake up the next morning I think back and am like WTF was I thinking? My life is fine, and my friends to love me. All the negative thoughts are gone, and I’m back to my normal self. This happens every couple of months and it’s terrible. I feel alone, I feel like everybody in my life is fake, and I feel like a failure. Which is opposite to how I regularly feel. I feel like this is very unhealthy, but at the same time I feel like since it only happens every couple of months, and I never feel the same way any other time, it’s not a huge deal."

835,"I'm a ""Gifting Mastermind"".

Is this a mental health problem I have?","I do get pleasure watching someone I care about trying to figure out who gave them that gift they been wanting for a long time. It's like I'm the Riddler, and I get excited watching Batman fail in my riddles. However, something just tells me this isn't healthy, and I wanted to ask you guys is this unhealthy?"
836,Weird repeating thoughts that I don´t understand why they´re happening,"Ok so basically these thoughts are as goes simply and kind of change but remain the same

me in classroom with classmates overhearing people talking about me in a positive manner 

I have no idea why I do this repetitively since I´m not too worried about what people think about me

Can anyone help me understand??"
837,Nighttime Anxiety?,"I don’t think I have anxiety disorder or any true mental illness but during the night time I feel so anxious. During the day I’m totally fine, I go along with life but during the night all these thoughts of insecurities and situations with a 0.0000001% chance of happening cloud my mind. I think typing it all out helps."
838,Is self harm bad?,"So I'm currently back in a phase of self harm (cutting bruising, scratching, burning ect.) And if I'm honest, it truly makes me feel better and take the edge off. I always have an instinctual urge to hurt myself from years of partaking in self harm but Ive made in effort to not give in. Ive been told not to, and that it's not a healthy way to relieve stress and every time my therapist asks, ""what makes you stop from hurting yourself and how can you focus on that to keep you from doing it?"" I always respond with, ""I don't know, I've just been told I'm not supposed to so I don't."" It's not that I feel guilty for doing it, or that I'm afraid of scars or people finding out, I've just been told it's bad so I try not to. Is their like any studies saying that it's always unhealthy, or is it possible it can it be an ok way to take away the tension?"
839,What to do? Insect PTSD? A note to vent to myself.,"They’re never gonna go away are they? No matter how much money I spend, no matter how precautions I am, no matter how many times I spray they’re still gonna be there right? Do I have to buy a new mattress? And tear apart my room to spray ever last inch. I can’t live like this, I know I can’t sleep now because of my work...
But I don’t want to sleep, I refuse to sleep in there. I can’t sleep knowing there’s things crawling next to me. These things that just infest and live off of my blood. 
It’s going to consume my mind, I’m going to go mentally insane. I need to get out of this apartment. I need to go somewhere where I can start fresh and leave everything behind. I’ve lived my whole life with insects, cockroaches, bed bugs. I don’t think I can do it anymore. There’s a certain time in my life where it’s time to go. And it’s now, because I know that I’m not gonna sleep. And if I don’t sleep, I die. A slow painful death, where I lose my mind and see things and what I see are these things crawling on me. There’s something about these bugs that make me lose my mind and make me mentally insane. And I can’t take it anymore, I took it for a majority of my life. When I see them I just want to rip my skin off, because all I do it feel them crawling on me. And I pinch my skin so I know it’s not real. But it’s going to be real if I don’t get out of here. The floors are falling apart. It’s like we don’t live here the bugs do and they control me. I know I sound fucking crazy and it’s because I am. Now I can’t stop itching, and I can’t even do my work because I’ve been hiding in the corner of the couch pinching myself and crying. I need help. I really do. Because I’m gonna end up dying."
840,Has anyone had a conversation about mental health with their family?,[removed]
841,Just tired,"I am really tired, i don't want to continue what i am doing right now, i ruined my future, i am lost, i am confused, i just want this to end, i want to sleep all day long, i don't want to talk to my family, i don't want to do anything anymore, i don't want to be alive, i am really tired, i live in another country far from home and i can't come back because of this corona thing, and even if i manage to come back the situation in my home country is fucked up and everyone is telling me work hard and try to take advantage of my visa and try to look for opportunities, but i am just tired, i've lost interest in everything, i am alone, i don't feel good talking to my family, for the past few weeks all i have been soing is downloading and deleting the same apps, i don't know what to do."
842,I only want to finally hang myself,"I've been getting ""help"" for over 5 years so don't tell me that's what I need. I've seen 6 therapists because I haven't worked well with any of them. Over the same time frame I've tried at least a dozen meds too and 4 psychiatrists. I've been hospitalized, gone through intensive outpatient, group therapy, tried exercise, mindfulness, meditation, Journaling, etc. Absolutely nothing helps my depression.



Now I've given up on treatment. Stopped taking my meds and skipped my therapy appointment. I'm just trying to live out my last days however I can. Drinking and doing drugs. 


I've completely withdrawn from everybody. I have a noose tied and ready, strong rope that I know would work. It's been sitting in my room for at least 2 years now and I've just been waiting for the right time to use it and it finally feels like this is it."
843,Be Who You Want To Be Until It’s Over,"Or until you decide it’s over...
I lived the most tender and moral setting part of my life (birth thru adolescence to young adulthood) to understand at 20 years of age in this lifetime what life is all about, yet again. 
I lived long enough sober with this realization, this hidden truth that no one wants mention, that life is what you make of it until it’s over. And when it’s over is what i can’t get out of my head. Not a fear of it, not anxiety of it, but complete acceptance and anticipation of it. 
I’m a sober being for the most part, besides smoking cannabis but that’s a habit i really started getting into the older i got. I dabbled in whatever other pills and powders in high school and never got into em. I found the start of my spiritual journey in psychedelics when i got into that wave and it’s honestly passed. 
So with that being said, i live a spiritual type of lifestyle, one of my choosing fit to the way i see my life playing out which is eventful to say the the least, boring to say the most. 
I’m just honestly tired of the monotony of day to day life. I can choose to spice it up as much as i want, but at the end of the day, it’s the same day, over and over, the same made up emotions, words, feelings, friends, foes, family, belief and moral systems, routine activity and “random” happenings. It’s so meticulous. So crude. So boring. I’m honestly bored of being a human being. I know the power of my being, if you could see the state of my mental health now versus a year and prior, you’d be proud of me. I’ve come a long way, but so far that i feel as if i’m ready for the end game. Time moves fast when you believe in the concept of time, but if you try to put that concept up against the concept of pure existence, you’d understand why i’m just not joyous about a day to day existence. I wake up, no longer mentally within the days of the week or even applying time for any specific use other than when to speak to my people, i go through the same shit as usual, quarantine or not my day is not different. I’d otherwise be at my job setting for the 8 hours and back home. 
I no longer feel the want or need to participate in this crazy fucking thing called life. (air quotations with extra eye roll and cringe effect). I. Am. Fucking. Bored. Bored of the stench that i’m subjected to intaking everyday, the stench of a systemized version of what used to be, a capitalists dream, a free spirits nightmare. 

Money used to be but no longer is a motivator or key factor in my existence. As i’ve come to the understanding that it’s just another thing to keep a being, whos not in tune with the true nature of existence, in line with the illusion of free will. It’s a shame that i have to pretend i don’t want to die and continue to live each day. It honestly is, and don’t give me the but what about your parents. Because 24 grand and 8 months ago, my single mom passed away. I came to terms with it as i try to move on and live life in a way that was originally foreign but now i realize was only a part of the plan anyways. It’s part of the monotony. 
I miss my mom everyday, but i don’t cry as hard as i used to, i still shed a tear but i know that her soul was one that was pure and the energy that captivated her being is now apart of the energy that captivates our existence. 
I continue to move on though, day by day, week by week, month by month, yet, none of the accomplishments mean anything to me but some talking point to pin up on the wall for when i pass, so people can pull it down and re-talk about it at the funeral. 
I guess this was supposed to be a turn around post from me just wanting to fade out of my body into existence, to me talking about how good life can be for those needing to hear it. 
Although my current headset seems rather grim, it doesn’t at all reflect the state of my life or the rest of me for that matter. My life is going great, i’m just kind of checking out early if you get what i’m saying. I’m choosing to, at 20, appreciate the scope of the entire thing than appreciate the smaller wins and losses in the day to day because i see how they are all the same. They all have the same lesson, to be happy about what you’ve done or move on and make a better choice the next time. 
But anyways, my life is good. The day of my moms funeral, i got a job offer that changed everything, put money in my pockets i’ve never fathomed of attaining in any way that was legal. Showed me how you can catch a quick dub in a dark time, but nonetheless, money doesn’t replace my parent. The memories of her are all i have left, yet when i die, all of thats going to be gone, which leaves me thinking, “fuck, how much of life should i care about and how much should i take with a grain of salt for the pure fact that the moment i go, none of it will mean anything as i will have a new purpose as one with the true god of our existence, which happens to be pure existence itself.” 
In other words, life can be the greatest thing in the world if that’s how much you value your life. My life doesn’t have a price value to me. Not saying that my price value is $0, but saying that the energy that captivates my being currently, my soul, transcends and lives in existence at all times so, this human thing just doesn’t mean as much as that does to me. 
What i’m saying is, life is a hell of a thing. It’s almost complex, it is if that’s how you choose to perceive it. But, it’s rather simple actually. It’s just exactly what it is. Existence, but from the confines of a human being on a planet that we formerly used for exploration, currently are using to tap dry of its resources and destroy its natural flow, and possibly probably not but in some form of a future will have to go on to complete space integration and exploration becoming a multi planetary species. 
There’s a lot that life has to offer of the forced direction our worlds leaders are pushing it in. Like literally, just say fuck it and do what makes you comfortable. Because that’s what this damn party’s all about man, it is an experience. A nonstop experience whether you are a part of it in human form or in form of a piece of the outer source that is the totality of existence. 
Be who you want to be, no matter what the cost is, whether it be monetary or whatever else, because why? That’s all you got. Do what you love, what makes you feel good. 
And don’t tell me take my own advice because I do, it’s just, i see too clearly what this is and in every moment experience what exactly this is and i just get it man. Some people are jazzed when they come to the realization that life is literally what you make of it, and that the sky is the limit when you allow it to be. Me? I realized it for the first time at 2 years old when my grandma passed away in front of my very eyes. And again when i was maybe around 7 or 8 years old, when my older brother went to live with his father and left me and mom alone. 
And then again at age 12 when i decided i wanted to have a music career and start a music label collective. Again, at age 19 during the midst of a deep salvia experiment, playing with the extents of my mind space and searching for some answers about some negative feelings i had throughout my life and came out of that experiment a fully spiritual being  and completely changed man. A and then again at age 20, months before the death of my only parental figure, where my music collective had been officially running for nearly 8 years and i had dropped a single that reached my first 100,000 streams on one song. And again after my mom passed in november and the end of the year was here and i looked at how much work i had put in towards the collective and realized it had done over half a million plays in 2019 alone. And again now, as i’m sitting here, writing this very long narrative. 
I took like by the neck at every moment i could and shook the fucking opportunity out of it, until the opportunity of the moment was mine. And continue to do so, but with the mindset, that this isn’t even for me at this point. I don’t care too much about what’s left. I really don’t care, whether the success of my career continues or falls, the success of my music continues or halts, whether i continue on earth or retract to pure existence. 
At this point, i can’t commit suicide. I made some promises that i’d half to deal with before i got to where i needed to go next. But the thing is, my death would do so much more good than harm because of the frequency in which the people that surround me choose to indulge themselves in. One that consists of frustration due to lack of monetary gain, even though money continues flows in it continues to flow right back out, and they lack the depth on innerstanding to get past this state of being and accept that it’s all a part of keeping up this fucking circus. 
It’s tiring having to play along with it, the not knowing, because who wants to feel like an idiot for not being able to speak outwardly of clairvoyance because society is known to shun those that don’t fall in line with paradigm. 
Nonetheless, you are free to be who you want to be because free will is the end goal we are all chasing. We all want to feel like we are in control, so we stick to a routine that feels natural to us, although that’s the exact thing that causes the monotony i feel and honestly can’t stand. 
So, be in control. Positive phrases like anything’s possible, and the sky is the limit, are literal phrases. Do what you want man, you got a life to live here so live it. 
Peace and one love to all. 🙌🏾"
844,I'm seriously worried for my girlfriends safety but she won't get help for her mental health,"She talks of suicide almost daily and I don't know how to help her at all, I'm thinking of getting external help but we can't afford therapy or anything of the like. I just want her to be safe and I'm so terrified I don't know what to do. She finds it basically impossible to talk to any mental health services because she has extreme anxiety about such things that manifests itself as a paralysing fear, but I can't help her at all."
845,I've been dropping the 'B' bomb around my new partner's family lately and I dont know why I'm doing it.,"I'm bipolar type 2, i sort've mentioned to atleast 3 of his family members during phone calls and visits. it's like I'm giving myself the stigma and it annoys me..i dated him in highschool 17 years ago.. I'm openly honest but it pisses me off that I've put that brand on myself. Partner takes meds for anxiety so it's kind of come up around the medication talk around him.. and that when i breastfed I had to stop because i got diagnosed and put on medication. I dunno.. My breakdown is what people class me as in my hometown where we are now. We're about to move back to his family's farm 5 and a half hours away. I just gotta know when not to bring it up I guess."
846,Quit my meds,"I was on Zoloft, propranolol and seroquel but none of them were doing a damn thing. I didn't want to keep dealing with side effects or keep spending money on them so I stopped them cold turkey.



The funny thing? It's been almost 2 months without them and I haven't noticed any change whatsoever, good or bad. Glad I was right that they didn't do shit.



I've been on probably a dozen meds now and none of them have done a thing, so I'm over it."
847,Am I a freak for doing this?,Am I a freak for liking to take pictures of my scars? This might sound fucked up but I see it as like an art if it's taken with the right angles. I like them.
848,I have these thoughts of committing an act of violence and then killing myself,"Yes I see a therapist and take meds but nothing helps, they don't actually care to understand.


My thoughts are mostly not even targeted at anyone in particular, I'm just misanthropic and think about this in general"
849,I don't know how to deal with this anymore.,"I'm currently a 23 year old student which is stuck in my own world that i created. I've been living with my mom and dad for my whole life, but it was never a normal way of living. My dad used to be alcohol addicted from my age of 8 until 12 and than he went to rehab.  


Two years later he developed cancer due to smoking. He had it removed and it came back for another time. After removing it this time it was gone for good. At my age of 15 until now he became addicted to alcohol, as well as heavy sleeping medication. The amount he takes would put a normal person easily into a coma of 1 week.   


When he used the alcohol and medication at the same time he would be really unpredictable en wasn't able to walk normally. He falls occasionally from the stairs to the ground floor and i have to call the ambulance, because my mother is 9/10 times out working. I've fought with him once and that moment isn't fading away since than. Every time i hear a loud bang without me noticing, my whole body starts shaking and i panic.   


i always used gaming as my escape, but everything is catching up now. I wasn't able to tell any of my feelings to my formarly girlfriend. Even the smallest annoyance wouldn't be told by me. Until this day i can't express my feelings until it gets to the point i just errupt in tears or anger or anxiety. I've numbed myself with gaming up to the point i can't recognise my own feelings. MY girlfriend tried to tell me that i needed help, but i thought i was fine, until 2 months ago. My dad tried to drill a hole in his stomach and i saw it happening before me. I ran upstairs and was shaking and crying for two days. Since that day i can't listen to any emotional music without heavy pain inside me and just crying. Every time i let my emotions in i'm not able to control them anymore and they overflow me.   


I'm stuck in this situation right now. I still live with both my parents, but i don't know how to handle this anymore. I feel like ive done so much wrong in this time period. Only if i seeked and wanted help before it was too late. I still would've have had this amazing relationship and i would be able to just express my feelings. Every day i just feel like im losing more grip on everything and feel like nobody really understands me beside my formarly girlfriend. I try to talk to my friends and i feel fine for a couple of hours, until everything just comes back.   


I hope someone has advice for me or just have some good words. I just hope some day i can feel better."
850,Community judgment (and hatred) in a small town/city,"TLDR: I moved from a big nobody cares who you are city to a small everyone knows everyone small town/city. I've  been married for nearly ten years but found it difficult to make friends or engage with people in my community for years because I've been labelled as a ""lying online catfisher!"" 

To give some brief context: I'm a black guy who married an attractive white woman.
I don't claim to be beautiful or attractive, Infact I've been called ugly more times than I can count lol... 7 years ago though I moved  to a new country to be with a woman who became my wife who I met online.

I thought it was going to be all good. 

However I got depressed when I moved and developed psychosis and the main feature of this depression/psychosis is being heard or seen. I really have this complex about people judging how I speak or how I look when I'm speaking. I moved to another English speaking country but with my accent in my mind I feel I stand out so I have developed behavior whereby I lower my volume of my voice whenever I perceive I could be heard by strangers or my neighbors...

Sidenote: actually I remember recently learning about a statistic that showed immigrants were prone to high levels of mental health issues. I look around and I see the locals who have lived in this city all their lives with their family and friends and then there's me, I have no family but my wife and no friends.


I want to recover...i really do...but it seems the small community that I moved to 7 years ago has had tagged me as a hardcore ""catfisher"" and when I'm indoors or out and about I regularly hear the neighbors and passers by making mean comments about me as ""crazy person"" or disparaging comments about my face/body.  Sometimes people will pass me in the street or I will hear them making disparaging remarks as they pass my house all to do with how they perceived how deeply I must have catfished my wife. Wether I'm doing mundane thingsike taking out the trash or fun  things like going to the movies my life is about being hypersensitive to potential comments that community members might make of me when they notice me visually or audibly... For example one stranger who walked past us once whilst myself and my wife were out shopping said out loud ""well if he didn't catfish her she must have been really desperate"".  Other common remarks ""I hate hearing/seeing/meeting that guy""; "" I hate hearing him even when he's happy!""; ""I wish he would move"".  Sometimes I feel victimized by strangers when I perceive them to be laughing about me, and in those times it's like I'm reduced to high school where everyone laughs at you and you feel so small.

I used to be a smiley and a non judgmental person when I met my wife and before I moved to her country... but through this experience people either don't give me the chance to engage or are nice to my face and then make disparaging comments behind my back it's so hard for me to not get stressed about people I don't know.

As I said I got depressed as soon as I moved but the community has judged my depression and behaviour as validation for their remarks and judgements that my current delressed mental is the ""real me""  and that I was depressed and ugly all along that I hid it from my wife, that I long conned her. This is what fuels the community hatred of me.  They don't know that I was much happier before I immigrated...(I could move back to my home country but it's not an option because of finance).

Ive asked my wife many times: do you think I catfished you? Do you think I lied to you or made out thatI was something that I wasnt when we met online? Did i make out that I was better looking than I was? She has reassured me for all questons NO.  


I know I should listen to what my wife thinks more than the random strangers in my community but it gets to me...I have gotten into a pattern wherby I'll chew in the negative remarks, either getting sad it angry or both. Either way my life has become limited, Ive stopped going out to avoid being around othets and if course when you do that it doesn't help...


I know I should join a club or social group, but because everyone knows everyone in this small town city it's hard for me to go somewhere and feel like I'm starting with a blank canvas when I meet people. When I meet people I seem to decode  their behaviour as ""oh god not this guy, wish I didn't have to be stuck with him!"" I perceive that people just see me as the 'catfisher guy' and act guarded and defensive and even when they are being nice and civilised its I do the seem to detect sincerity I see the civilised behavior amas a way of saying GO AWAY! Like the difference between behind civilised and genuinely warm are two different things, I pick up on that and then I get disheartened... and then I become sad and guarded in response.


I try to kid myself that I don't need new people in my life as part of my recovery but I know that's a lie...I need people, but when you feel that people in your community already have a negative pre-judgment of you as a bad egg how do you deal with that?

So has anyone experienced similar feeling of being labeled (for whatever reason) and how that label can make engaging with people in your community difficult especially when you are judged as a bad person?

If you made it this far thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice or if you can't give advice just a cyber hug lol."
851,(Suicide/Self Harm TW) I'm Anxious Around My Girlfriend And I Don't Know Why Or How To Stop,"Okay, so this requires a little context. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for nearly a year now, and we're super close and have been through a lot together. We both admire and love each other lots and we are extra supportive and conscientious about each other's feelings. Naturally, we often have conversations about what would make the both of us the most happy and comfortable. Now, a few days ago, her abusive mother had been chewing her out for an hour about how she wasn't able to get some of her work done for a class in a time frame she thought was appropriate. My girlfriend told her that the amount of work she had been assigned had made her feel suicidal, which was justifiable because it was 100 questions on 10 assignments with a 70 question final at the end all in a week, her mother yelled at her, saying she was being dramatic.   


She came back sobbing in call and I told her to call the hotline because I didn't think I was equipped well enough to help with a self harm scare only a little while before. She ended up not calling because I was able to calm herself down enough to where she just needed some reassurance and assistance with things she needed. I was scared and one of my not great coping mechanisms is to fall asleep, I'm not sure if I knew that her mother was yelling at her or not when I passed out because it's kind of a haze. I woke up and she felt betrayed that I wasn't there for her then, and I told her that one of my coping mechanisms is to shut down and fall asleep, she said it was okay and that we could work on together how to combat against shutting down completely. I said okay and tried to move on from it. I later asked her about other people she could go to for when she is in distress and needs a backup because I shut down. She told me about one of our mutual friends that could help, but after all this I've felt intimidated to speak to her and anxious whenever I don't know what to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the irrational side of my brain still thinks that I am her only lifeline and I need to save her from herself. I've been in a friendship that was like that once before and it scares me, I know for a fact it's not healthy for either parties and I think I might be being dramatic. The thing is, is that, I don't know how to stop feeling so anxious! I just keep getting worse and worse as time goes by. I'm thinking about showing her this post to show her my feelings fully, without getting choked up by fear. I'm certain that this fear has only been brought on through trauma or something, but I don't know how to help. All I really know how to do is sleep.  


I don't know if I'm looking to vent or for advice, so comfort or guidance both would be appreciated! Thank you for reading."
852,"My boyfriend feels the need to confess every mistake he's ever made, even if he isn't sure if it really happened?","My boyfriend's need to confess his bad thoughts/mistakes is ruining our relationship. He had a phase of blurting out really hurtful stuff and cried a few times like ""I thought a girl was hotter than you""/""I thought I regretted not sleeping with a few girls before you""/""I thought I wasn't attracted to you for a few minutes"" etc. and these comments almost caused me to break up with him. 

I love this man. I really do, its been nearly 2 years but his need to confess is unbearable and I can't stop him. The last few weeks he has obsessively confessed weird porn he watched when he was 11-13 or mean thoughts he has had about others or confessing to cute things he did with his ex and he feels bad cos I'm so much better or whatever. . He seems to feel unbearably guilty unless he comes to me to see if I can forgive him? It's mostly memories and a lot of it is stuff he isnt even sure happened or if he made it up from overthinking. It's hard to say no cos he'll just say ""I did something really bad once"" and my curiosity overwhelms me and I HAVE to know!! I feel like I'm his therapist. What should I do to help?"
853,What is wrong with me?,"I need help understanding myself. I get the strangest mood swings in the world, sometimes something will make me happy, I’ll smile, and then as the smile wipes off of my face, I’ll realise that the moment of happiness is gone, and I’ll feel a feeling which I can’t describe, sort of like a sense of impending doom. I can’t sleep at night, I sit up all night, not because I want to stay up on my phone or anything, but because I hate the feeling of knowing that my time has ran out, and that once I get in bed, I won’t be able to communicate with anyone, and I’ll be alone. I’m so frightened of being alone, but last night I left all of the group chats with my friends because I get worried that I’m “burdening” them with my words- I can’t stop myself from spamming them with every detail of my life. I need to tell people about myself or what’s going on otherwise I feel completely alone. 
I’m extremely self-conscious about myself but sometimes I can except great amounts of comments, I go from “being the shit” to being embarrassed to be seen in public, for no reason. It’s like there are switches in my head and a monkey is in my brain just fucking around with them. My personality changes at a faster rate than I can even realise. 5 months ago I was so different that looking back I don’t imagine myself like that. I don’t want to bother the people around me, so I try to help everyone, but then things, make them smile, but then come 3am I’ll be sitting in the bathroom with my head in my hands.
I’m not using any labels for myself, because I don’t understand the labels, but sometimes I get so anxious, and 5 minutes later I’d be ballsy enough to offer out anyone that crosses me. The worst put down is when I’m doing well, when I’m succeeding I’ll tell my friends but they don’t seem to care at all, unless I’m entertaining them they seem like they want nothing to do with me, but other times I feel like I have the best, most caring friends in the world, I don’t know if it’s my own distorted perception of reality, or whether I’m just nitpicking.



*Somebody please help me*"
854,"Best friend isn't there like I expected her to be, really struggling.","I get right now is extremely hard for everyone, please don't get me wrong, I know everyone is going through their own struggles. Two of my grandparents have passed within a week, I was so close with both of them so I am devastated. 

I cannot turn to my parents for support right now as they're both trying to come to terms with their own losses. The only person I really have is my best friend. I don't have a partner and I'm in lockdown alone. Apart from my family, she is the only other person who knew how close I was to my grandparents.

I don't know if I am being unfair. She doesn't have many close friends outside of our friendship and neither do I. I get talking to me right now is probably draining, but if she were going through the same, I would be there night or day. But the last week or so, I will send a message, she will reply, I will reply back and then she won't answer or take like 5 days to reply or she will message me first, I'll reply and she won't answer. I'm not even being depressing when I'm talking to her, I'm trying hard not to mention how I really feel and just chat about normal things, but I just need someone there, which usually she would have been. We normally talk everyday. Every single time I have spoken to her I've asked her how she is, how her family are, what she's been up to, whether she needs anything. I've literally mentioned their death once, and that is when it happened. Not since, even when she's asked how I'm feeling.

I don't know, I just feel sad as I thought she would 100% be there and I miss her. I feel sad about this on top of everything else. I don't want to sound selfish at all.She's at home with nothing to do either, she's said it plenty of times. She's online constantly. I just know that I would act differently."
855,Can you get PTSD/something similar from a breakup?,"Hi there,

Put this up on my throwaway as my main account has a very distinguishable name. 

**Context** *(Question is just as the title asks)*
I had a break up not far off 2 years ago now. We were engaged, had been together for 8+ years, since we were 14 years old. The life I had wasn’t a life I was “settling for”, I loved what I had and considered myself the luckiest person in the world to have found it so early. 

Things changed suddenly and I was accused through the grapevine of cheating, with a new colleague. We broke up over the course of a long three month argument, lots of time has passed, I assume it is now known that no cheating happened etc. 

I have suffered heavily since the breakup with flashbacks, and a lot of large shifts in mentality that debilitate me temporary, and I have never been a person to take note of these sort of things. I see the entirety of a conversation that we had during the breakup, some more often than others, just seeing her crying, hearing the sadness in her voice like she was next to me. It just cripples me, I lose interest in where I am and who I’m with, I just turn and feel completely empty. I have never had any mental health problems before, so this is quite new to me and I’m just wondering if this is something that people could advise on. 

Thank you."
856,I feel like no matter where I am or what I do that I’ll never truly be happy,"I’ve always leaned on the idea that one day I’ll get a perfect or close to it group of friends that I love and trust and that will stick with me throughout my life or at least some of it during hard times to help me get through it. Now I’be finally moved away from my old school and into a new one and after my first day it suddenly hit me no matter what I do or how hard I try I’ll never find this group of friends and that I’ll never truly be able to live instead of existing. This already sucks on its own  basically rendering everything that’s kept me alive worthless and nonexistent but my brain decided to one up itself and now I’ve realised no matter what I do I’ll never be happy. No matter how much I change myself or where I move or what I choose to do I won’t ever be truly happy. I know that happiness isn’t eternal and that there are shitty moments but I don’t want a life full of shitty moments and I’ll do anything to stop that from happening, anything but I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to die on the off chance that hey maybe I will end up with that group of friends but at the same time I don’t want to just survive knowing that my life could of been something so much better something that I actually enjoyed and truly loved instead of something that just happened to me."
857,Anxiety builds...,"I've been struggling with anxiety for the past year or so. Most so these last 6 months. About 7-8 months ago I was put into a Director position for a tribal child welfare department. It's been a challenge, and I've had to push myself past what I ever thought I could do. Prior to this, I had only been with the department for a year as a case worker, and like 6 months as their office manager. Despite having no experience, they liked the work I did. While I was only in the director position for the interim, it was an awesome learning experience. We just got a new director on last month, and I've been training them since. 

The past few months have been hell though. Employees were starting to slack, I had to write people up, and the work just kept on piling. I didn't mind the work piling, because that's how I see my job security. I always have something to keep me busy, but with all the emotions and office squabbles. then having a new director on that's making big decisions before they have even learn the job. It's scared me a few times. 

Now I've always had anxiety. It was never bad, just always there. Just the way I was raised and everything has had it ingrained in me. The past 6 months have caused it to sky rocket thou. There were nights were I wasn't able to sleep, like tonight. While my blood pressure and heart rate were just fine, I could still hear my heart pounding in my chest whenever I laid down. No matter what I did I couldn't sleep. I'd lie there in the dark, then just feel myself ramping up until I'd have to sit up and turn on the light just to calm back down. Lately it's been getting worse. Something as simple as finding music to listen to frustrates the hell out of me because I can never find something that'd calm me down. Then adding on to a new event which should be a good thing, I found a new job in another city.  I leave at the end of the month. It'd be great if I didn't already have all this anxiety built up already. Now I have the fear of trying to figure things out before I actually move. I just want to sleep and never wake up..."
858,I am soooo sensitive. How do you deal with it?,"I am highly sensitive... I notice every little thing and just see myself reacting to the little thing afterwards. I feel irritated right away and I just can’t, just can’t let go of the little things. It’s like every 10mins there’ll be something that’ll make me feel upset. Am I depressed? I don’t feel sad when I’m not being sensitive though. But my temper, it’s draining me out and my loved ones too."
859,Severe PTSD,"Hey,

I’m really just looking for advice here...

For some backstory last august 3 people broke into my house I live with my mum and stepdad one had an axe and one a golf club, ever since then I’ve had a lot of trouble sleeping I get no sleep on a Sunday (the day they broke in) and every night I can’t sleep till after 1;30 am (the time) I always keep my window open to try and hear anything and I’ll think I hear something and my heart will start pumping super hard and I can’t seem to relax, I have tried thinking about it logically but it was a targetted attack because my old brother who lives in another country and has for about 4 years was a pretty big time drug dealer so it was his old friends who know he doesn’t live there anymore that broke in

Since then last week I found out they got released from prison and I’ve barely got any sleep no matter the night, I live in Australia so getting a gun isn’t really an option haha

Does anyone who has been through a similar situation Have any advice on how they’re coping?"
860,No sense of self...,"I don't know what I am anymore... I'm just so fucking all over the place..  I have no identity, I'm really nice and sweet at one moment then I snap and suddenly I'm the fucking worst this world have seen, then I become suicidal, then my mind goes on a bloodthirsty rampage... I DON'T KNOW WHAT IN THE FUCK I AM ANYMORE!!! I'M AN ABOMINATION THAT SHOULDN'T EXIST!! WHY AM I EVEN ALIVE? WHAT AM I? WHO AM I? The only possible explanation that I could come up with is DID, but then EVERYBODY SAYS IT'S FAKE AND IT DOESn'T EXIST! IS IT ALL IN MY HEAD? AM I DREAMING?  WHAT THE FUCK AM IIII?????????? I'll CUT MY WRISTS 100 TIMES IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE TRUTH! I just exist.. And then I don't.. And then I'm good and then I'm evil, Then I'm depressed, but then I'm superactive and homicidal.. I just want to fucking kill myself, but I can't CAUSE NOBODY LETS ME DO IT! WHY DO I HAVE TO LIVE THIS TORTUROUS LIFE OF PAIN AND AGONY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT AM I?????????"
861,Why am I having insomnia? It’s the worst.,"So, I decided 4 days ago to stop smoking and take a t-break, at least (haven’t decided how much I want to cut back whenever I smoke again; need to talk it over with my psychiatrist). Usage prior to this was vaping at night before bed and whenever my girlfriend has work—I’m stuck at home all day and a bit of a high helps make this teeny apartment more livable. I’d say I was probably taking about 10 hits average per smoking session. 

Two weeks ago, I started a new antidepressant, Cymbalta. Currently at 60 mg daily (a.m.) and have been on it for 2 weeks. I also take Wellbutrin daily—300 mg. 

The past four days since stopping the smoking, a couple of notable things have happened that will be impossible for me to correlate to an absolute cause:

1. I definitely feel like my mood is improving. I haven’t been lethargic at all whereas prior to this every day getting out of bed was hard as hell, and I’d sleep for hours when the girlfriend was at work because I didn’t feel interested in doing anything. Today, I did laundry, went out to get beer, fixed our bed, did dishes, talked to mom for over 2 hours on the phone, and perused Reddit like a fiend. I partly worry that I’m experiencing hypomania, tbh. 

2. I’m experiencing insomnia. It’s 3 a.m. here and I’m not tired. I’m only on my phone because I’ve been trying to sleep for almost two hours with no luck. Last night, I did fall asleep around midnight but then I woke up at 4am and again at 8; both times, I was super wired. 

I know t-breaks can cause sleeplessness but apparently so can Cymbalta. I know weed can exacerbate depression for some people, so I’m wondering if my mood boost is because I stopped smoking or because the meds are kicking in (though the timing seems to convenient for it not to be the t-break; my mood was significantly better the day after I stopped smoking. 

Do I smoke a little to get to bed? Do I hold out hope that after a couple more days I’ll finally be tired? Because that’s the other thing, I’m not even tired. I’ve heard that Cymbalta-related insomnia can clear up eventually, if that’s all this is. 

Thoughts? Experiences?"
862,What is wrong with me?,"19F here and I believe I have been struggling with mental health issues for quite some time now.

The things I did/do that make me believe so:

1. I'm a pathological liar, I make things up, I have even made up people. I lie about both things that matter and things that don't matter. Lying is natural to me. I think I do it for attention but I'm not sure. I definitely like to be the center of attention.

2. I catfish people, I've been doing so since I was 14. It started out as an innocent little game but now it's becoming very serious. My catfishing story is a long one so I won't talk about the details of it. The whole situation is making me super paranoid and anxious.

3. I don't think I've ever felt guilty for the things I've done. I never feel bad. I never think I did something wrong. The only time I'm angry at myself is if I mess something up and put myself in danger.

4. I steal money from my parents. I don't even remember how much I've stolen so far. I usually take 10-50€ at a time. I use it for buying clothes, makeup and stuff like that and also for going out. They still haven't noticed.

5. I have a really bad memory. I sometimes feel like a stranger to myself. I feel so empty. I don't know who I am. I am so many people at once but at the same time I'm no one. I try to build my personality and make it logically consistent. And I'm good at it because everyone believes me. Everyone believes the bullshit I serve them but deep down I don't think I care about anything in this world.

6. I think I'm hypersensitive in a way. I get offended and hurt very very easily but I hate to admit it and I almost never show it. I get really angry about little things. I hold grudges and I am vengeful. I've thought about destroying people's lives. I've even thought about killing someone but I was never serious about it because I thought it wouldn't be possible to get away with it. But if I could do it without anyone knowing I definitely would.

I went to a therapist for about a year in 2017 and 2018. I was diagnosed with depression. I honestly don't even remember if I was just faking it or not. I just know that I didn't talk about any of my actual problems with my therapist.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't know if I believe I can get better. Maybe I'm just curious. Anyways I've never talked about any of this to anyone. Ever. I have mentioned some parts of it in posts like this one but that's it.

What is wrong with me?"
863,Thought change.?,So for the pass couple of weeks I've been really paranoid that people have been tampering with my food so I wouldn't eat that much maybe 100-700 calories a day but I had some strange dreams like reflecting back on my life and I woke up and the paranoia is like gone? And I feel really good about myself? Like hyper someone explain.?
864,Im so tired but i don't want to sleep,Im not scared to sleep but whenever i think about it i just feel so much aversion..
865,I’m just so uneasy theses days. Just needed to vent..,"I’m at the point in my life where I don’t care anymore I don’t feel anything anymore:/ I get angry most of the time and just up and leave and I have to no idea to handle it and I’m just in misery Nd in a black hole that I can’t get out of no matter how much I try 
I just want people to understand I’m not choosing to be this way. It’s just people who have messed with my head continuously keep doing it and expect me not to get upset over littlest things but again I can’t help it. 
They expect sunshine and giggles the old me well I’m sorry if I say something and it makes you think I hate you or don’t care can you just stop fucking assuming. 
And relationships are also just an extremely hard thing for me I want one with the guy I’m with but he makes feel all :/ confused. I would tell you what happened but then I know he will get hate in the comments to which I don’t want to happen so I’ll just have to keep it in for now.
But I just wanted to let that out there’s so much more but I feel sick and I don’t want to type anymore."

867,My dysphoria seemed to disappear for a week,"It’s only ever happened to me twice before for about a week each time. It always makes me worried that I’m lying to myself about being trans but those were the only moments I can easily recall feeling like that. Although the first time it happened I was also really interested in the idea of adopting several kids and being a mother, which if you know me having kids literally sounds like an absolute nightmare to me so the fact that I *really* wanted kids just for the one week surprised me. I think the fact that not only did my dysphoria go away but I also experienced a major shift in my personality as a whole might indicate that I actually am trans and that something else was at play like my hyper fixations or a possible manic episode. This next part might sound weird but since I was in a religious environment growing up I was taught that when we die and our bodies are brought back to us, they return in their original state. That absolutely terrified me that I could potentially be stuck living as a female for eternity when I die. I’m always worried that moments like these are somehow proving that right. Although my dysphoria disappeared for only a few days is probably was the result of some mental illness, my OCD won’t let me live it down. It sometimes makes me terrified of dying, or ironically of ending up in heaven, because of something like this."
868,I want to understand and help this person. Help please!,"Hi!  
I'd like to know what is happen to my girlfriend to understand if this is normal and, if it is not, how can I help her in a better way.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Usually her bad moments happen without a reason one or two days per week and they last from a couple of hours to half of a day.  
Whey the bad moments start she changes from being communicative and involved to a condition where she becomes really lazy, she no longer communicates (or very little), she becomes very impatient and she no longer wants any physical contact (kisses or anything). She practically isolates herself from everything and sits alone using her smartphone or doing something else. Sometimes she has quasi-catatonic states where she starts to stare at something on the wall without blinking for a couple of minutes.   
When we talked about these reactions she says she doesn't know where they come from, she always had them and sometimes she cries because she knows she is hurting me.  
I don't know if this is related but often she is tired (as if she doesn't sleep well) and often she has bad nightmares and she is always worried that her loved ones can die.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
What it can be?   
I love her and I don't want to change her. I'm just trying to understand her better so I can help her the best as I can.  
When these moments happen, I try to be supportive speaking calmly with her, asking if she needs some time alone and when she agrees I try to find something else to do so I can give her some space (for 20-30 minutes). It's correct?"
869,It’s time to change our approach to mental health awareness campaigns: Part 1. The use of psychiatric diagnosis,"THE FIRST PART OF THIS WAS POSTED AT THE END OF LAST WEEK, SO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY READ IT, SKIP STRAIGHT TO 'PART 1: THE PROBLEMATIC USE OF PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS'.   


*Radical shifts are needed to properly reposition mental health as something that is personally meaningful to everyone, not just the domain of ‘experts’ and people who are experiencing acute distress.* 

This might seem like a surprising proposition at a time when there is evidence of the success of mental health awareness campaigns everywhere you look — [Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp’s ‘powerful discussion’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=emb_logo&amp;v=xUlHqab3YZo) on mental health in football is not something I ever expected to see on Super Sunday. Even the royal family is getting involved, with [Prince William’s campaigning](https://www.headstogether.org.uk/) reflecting what seems to be a genuine passion for the subject matter. Corporates are also scrambling to demonstrate their commitment to promoting mental health and ‘wellness’, through ever-expanding employee assistance programs, the appointment of ‘mental health first aiders’, and the provision of lunchtime yoga sessions. Some pretty solid examples of how the reach of mental health awareness campaigns now extends to cultural spaces not typically associated with a progressive outlook and social responsibility.

Before going any further, it is important to say that I am wholeheartedly on board with the overarching objectives of campaigns such as [Time To Change](https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/) and [Mental Health Awareness Week (which starts on 18th May)](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week) and the many others that have made a huge contribution to the growing interest in all things mental health. We should be extremely grateful to the organisations who have worked hard to promote the interests of the marginalised.

Whilst there is considerable cause for optimism, I believe that those with the biggest audiences are yet to capitalise on a golden opportunity to help dislodge stigma-perpetuating ideas from our collective conscience. At present, anti-stigma campaign groups tend to emphasise our collective responsibility to show sympathy and understanding to those affected by mental health issues. A noble cause, but we should be striving for a more radical shift: the repositioning of mental health as something that directly applies to all us in our personal quests for fulfillment and meaning, so that it is not solely the concern of those who are acutely distressed or ‘ill’. I get the impression is that this intuitively makes sense to most people, given that being human involves navigating impossible dilemmas, a near-constant struggle with bad habits, feeling the pain of losses, and finding relationships perpetually difficult. Labels or no labels, we all experience some level of psychological pain and suffering some of the time.

How a repositioning of mental health could dramatically benefit *everyone,* will hopefully become clear over the course this two-part blog, where I suggest that the following two issues need to become more central to conversations about mental health:

**Part 1 — The problematic use of psychiatric diagnosis**

Not only do diagnoses constitute dodgy science, but they also get in the way of our self-reflective capacity and our natural inclination to help other people to explore themselves. By not automatically deferring to psychiatric labels, we can create space for all of us to explore problems and dilemmas on a more personal and meaningful level.

**Part 2 — The unhelpful promotion of a binary view of mental health**

In other words, the idea that you’ve either got mental health problems or you don’t. Let’s face it, we’ve all struggled, are struggling or will struggle with the psychological turmoil that comes with being human. Is it, therefore, helpful (or logical) to say ‘1 in 4’ of us have mental health problems? What are the thresholds? What do messages like this imply about the ‘1 in 4’ and the other ‘3 in 4’? Is the ‘mentally ill’ vs ‘normal’ dichotomy working?

  
**Part 1. The problematic use of psychiatric diagnosis**

It has been seven years since The British Psychological Society released a [position statement on psychiatric diagnosis](https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/www.bps.org.uk/files/Member%20Networks/Divisions/DCP/Classification%20of%20behaviour%20and%20experience%20in%20relation%20to%20functional%20psychiatric%20diagnoses.pdf) highlighting it’s ‘significant conceptual and empirical limitations’. In short, the classification of mental ‘disorders’ (such as Depression, Schizophrenia and OCD) are supposed to be based on the ‘disease model’ of health used by the rest of medical science, but a century of attempts to find evidence of disease processes that consistently correspond with psychiatric classifications have largely failed. Whilst there are physiological markers that tally with specific behaviours, thoughts and emotions, these markers do not cluster in a way that supports the existing psychiatric classifications. Despite this, psychiatry has stuck by it’s system of what now must be seen as descriptions of problematic thoughts, feelings and behaviours, not illnesses or diseases. Most people intuitively get suspicious when they hear terms like ‘Internet Gaming Disorder’, and it’s the same pseudo-science underpinning more familiar ‘disorders’ which have come to mistakenly accept as evidence-based constructs. This stuff is not in the realm of anti-establishment conspiracy theories - even [the NHS agrees](https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/news-analysis-controversial-mental-health-guide-dsm-5/) but has continued to use the system for want of another way of being able to categorise and treat ([despite the fact that there are viable alternatives](https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/Policy%20-%20Files/PTM%20Framework%20%28January%202018%29_0.pdf) emerging). 

Given that psychiatry is supposed to be part of medicine and medicine is supposed to be scientific, it is not unreasonable to expect a bit of hesitancy when it comes to the use of words like ‘illness’ and ‘disorder’ when describing psychological distress. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. No doubt a desire to offer people who are suffering, definitive explanations and solutions has played a big part in medicine’s reluctance to abandon a flawed system. A bit of [big pharma lobbying](https://medium.com/@brenoserson/big-pharma-fda-approvals-and-disease-mongering-82d63f1be8ce) might also have something to do with it but that’s for another day.

Please don’t misinterpret this as me minimising or denying the painful reality of psychological distress. As an NHS psychologist and as a person grappling with what it means to be a human being, I have seen and felt emotional pain as I am sure every person reading this has. I am also well aware that many people’s lives are dominated by mental health problems, and a diagnosis is the key to accessing support and resources. Getting rid of diagnosis does not mean getting rid of support for those who need it, but clearly this would need careful consideration in practice.

*The harm caused by psychiatric diagnosis*

The fact that we use scientifically flawed concepts to describe psychological problems is actually more of a footnote that sets the scene for a bigger problem: the role that diagnosis plays in the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems. Not only are most diagnoses not scientifically valid, they can also cause harm. Let me explain how:

Often these labels are internalised and become part of the person’s identity in a way that erodes their self-confidence and sense of agency. As a psychologist it can sometimes feel like you and the person in other chair are both fighting a losing battle: as you work together to deconstruct the unhelpful narratives that they too have come identify with (I’m an anxious person, a depressed person, a hyperactive person etc), external forces are constantly reinforcing these negative stories loaded with connotations of worthlessness and futility of trying to bring about change. The greater the extent to which someone has been defined by their ‘illness’, the harder it is for the person and the people around them, to see anything other than the label. Let me illustrate this with an example.

*The ‘Schizophrenic’ school teacher*

Take a ‘Paranoid Schizophrenic’. What comes to mind when you hear this term? And what if someone told you that your daughter’s school teacher was once given this diagnosis? The compassionate part of you is probably trying to make a case for being non-judgemental (you are after all a nice mental-health-blog-post-reading person), but I imagine there is another part of you connecting with the dominant stories that are told about ‘Schizophrenia’ and feeling uneasy about the possible risk posed by this potentially dangerous ‘Schizophrenic’. 

Conversely, if you were told your daughter’s teacher was raped when she was in her teens by someone she trusted, and in the two years that followed she was overwhelmed by suspicious thoughts about people’s intentions, you would probably view the same ‘Schizophrenic’ very differently. A story of an unpredictable and potentially dangerous person, becomes a story of hope and resilience - a woman gripped by fear has been able to overcome a horrific trauma. Her capacity to survive extreme adversity and determinedly rebuild her life, also gives some indication of the kind of strength and emotional intelligence that potentially have the makings of an excellent role model and teacher.

This hopefully illustrates what the dominant narratives associated with different labels can do: reduce a person and their story to set of negative stereotypes that lead to discrimination and the erosion of a person’s self-worth, particualarly if the person themself starts to believe these stories. This isn’t the most subtle example, but 

*Stifled curiosity*

I hope you are starting to see how the language of psychiatric diagnosis, has the potential to be a key perpetuating factor when it comes to stigma. Unfortunately, the language of psychiatry is so ingrained in our culture we often find it hard to talk about psychological distress without the use of this medical terminology. As well as obscuring personal stories, these terms hinder our natural curiosity and ability to make sense of our own or other peoples’ experiences in a meaningful way. “How is your OCD at the moment?” feels like a weird question because you are asking about something so abstract and decontextualised, that is probably not clear to anyone involved what is actually being asked about. It’s a conversational cul-de-sac that normally leads to someone describing a set of symptoms that the well meaning enquirer is then unsure of how to helpfully respond to. End result = ‘Probably best not talk about that again unless we really have to’. If takes away the label, you have experiences and behaviours that you can talk about in a more human way. Using the ‘OCD’ example a conversation between two friends might develop in a way that is more useful and exploratory.

A: How is the handwashing thing at the moment?

B: It's pretty bad actually.

A: How come? 

B: I’m not sure, but it tends to be worse when I’m stressed out. 

A: What are you stressed about?

In therapy, if someone comes to me with the baggage of labels, my first questions are normally along the lines of ‘what does ‘depression’ mean to you?’ and ‘how do you make sense of it?’. This normally jump-starts the person's natural curiosity that has been partially or completely suppressed by the idea that they have ‘a mental condition’. Questions like these often branch off into other questions until we are talking about relationships, hopes, fears and beliefs. Talking about ‘the depression’ becomes an increasingly absurd proposition as problems start to be understood as a part of a complex personal matrix of ideas that cannot be meaningfully reduced to a list of symptoms. 

*Back to stigma campaigns*

For many people, diagnosis and medicalised explanations are the only framework they have for making sense of their own suffering, so there is understandable wariness and in some cases hostility, from people who are attached to, and feel validated by, a diagnosis. Indeed for many it can be the one thing that makes them feel like their distress has been noticed. Whilst we must respect people’s freedom to label themselves however they please, mental health campaigners who have a large audience, also have a responsibility to (at the very least) say what their position is on this key issue. If an organisation continues to use language psychiatry without disclaimers, they are effectively reinforcing these potentially damaging ideas. Mind, It’s Time For Change, and Rethink have shown their willingness to engage with these issues by highlighting the controversy surrounding different diagnoses to some extent, which is a positive step. However, there is a strong case for going much further: Why not actively encourage people to think beyond labels we know are poorly constructed, and give people permission to be more curious about their own and each others’ idiosyncrasies? That is largely what good therapists do - be genuinely curious so that people have the chance to explore themselves. Which, incidentally, is what good friends also do. 

*Final thoughts*

As long as we go on deferring to labels as the default position thus discouraging our natural inclination to be curious, we will never reach the point where ordinary people feel like mental health is their domain, as opposed to the domain of experts. If you want to eradicate stigma, mental health needs to become something everyone has ownership of. When conversations about mental health become conversations about our personal philosophies and sharing ideas about how we navigate the impossible task of being a human being, we are starting to get somewhere. Encouraging people to be more sympathetic to a subset of people who are more acutely distressed has been the starting point, but I hope this is just the beginning.

In Part 2 (released later this week), I will be taking a look at the problem with the promotion of a binary view of mental health. In other words, the idea that you’ve either got mental health problems or you don’t. Let’s face it, we’ve all struggled, are struggling or will struggle with the painful reality of being human. Is it, therefore, helpful (or logical) to say that 1 in 4 of us have mental health problems?

I thought about writing how I feel and showing it on my therapy session, but when I do write something...after a few weeks when I go back to it, it's like I don't feel that way. It's like my understanding for my condition deepens and therefore I explain it in a whole different manner each time I do so. I'm not sure if anyone will get me.   
I also feel like I can never exactly say how I feel when speaking in person. It's like I'm socially incapable. I wish they could just plug my brain into a computer and see what the hell is wrong with me."
872,"Having a relapse. And because of the quarantine, I can't get a therapist to help me.","Been diagnosed before of depression and anxiety for self-harming. Now, I am spiraling again because of my insecurities. *trigger warning: last night I made cuts and puched the wall a couple of times after a big fight with my partner. Mainly because I felt the urge to punish myself for being petty. After a year of no meds, popped again a couple of sedative pills. Got calm but it still feel heavy inside. There are two remaining pills huhu idk how to survive anymore without the pills. How do I cope? 

Furthermore, my SO is a suspected COVID patient and I am the one taking care of her. The whole pandemic is soooooo anxiety-inducing and I feel lost. So so so lost. I just want pills. PILLS PILLS PILLS."
873,Sad and uncertain of what to do next.,"Hi everyone. I've never done this before, put my feelings out there for everybody to read. So here goes. 
I've been struggling with Anxiety/Depression for years. Never treated or really even properly diagnosed. I've always tried to ignore it and convince myself that I'm fine, it's just that I'm down sometimes and I'm anxious around people. However, it's recently become more than that. I find myself suicidal at moments and absolutely helpless. It's almost always about putting myself into new situations, meeting new people, but sometimes it comes out of nowhere and hits me like a wave. Now let me tell you, I have an amazing support system. My mom and dad are the most amazing people and the reason I am still alive today, I love them with everything I have. I have amazing siblings who I talk to on a regular basis, I have some friends who I will talk to here and there (none that I'm super close to) and my boyfriend...I can't even explain him to you. He makes me want to live, and he makes me feel so loved every single day. I should mention, I'm a 23 female, moved out with my boyfriend and we've been together for 3 years. 
   Anyways, even with all these amazing people around me my heart still hurts so much all the time. In my head I can say, I'm very lucky and I really shouldn't be this sad. However I just can't shake it. Part of the reason I am writing this is because I started a new job recently serving at the same restaurant that my boyfriend and friends do. I know...you're a server? Honestly, I'm not very good and I took the job because I needed to get out of my last job. It was very very toxic and I could make decent money serving. I took this job in one of my high moments, thinking that was what I was supposed to do in the moment. Working with my boyfriend has been nice, we don't ever fight and he is always there to help me. I also don't drive, simply because it scared the absolute shit out of me. I have my license, but immediately go into full panic mode when I sit behind the wheel, that is something I really wish to work on someday. The only downside to working with him is that I lean on him and my friends too much. If I'm too nervous to do something, he does it for me. I don't ever want him or my bosses to feel like I'm incapable of doing my job. Which, I guess when I write it down seems like that's what it is. It's just not the job for me. Every single time I get a new table and have to go up to them my heart starts racing and I feel like I'm going to just break down. I do it, obviously but it's absolute torture everytime.
   So, onto what is happening now. We are in a world pandemic, as I'm sure you all know who are reading this. I've been quarantined for about a month and a half, only working at the restaurant one day a week taking to-go orders. Not having to worry about my social anxiety, it's been nice if I'm being completely honest. I've been weirdly calm about this pandemic, while being very careful and taking the right precautions. However as I'm sat at home I can't help but feel like I shouldn't have to put myself through hell going to work every day and feeling like my world is ending. I've started drawing, painting, writing again. That is what I love to do. I also do special effects makeup and would love to peruse that as either a career or a form of art people can just admire through photos. That problem is, I have no idea how to do that. No idea how to go about making my passions into a sustainable living. I would love to try though. 
So as we speak I am writing this because I have called into work today, the first day the dining room would be open partially to the public and last night I had a full meltdown. I was panicking and my boyfriend just couldn't help, I wouldn't let him. I feel like when I have a panic attack like that I push every single good thing in my life away. All that was going through my head was, it would just be easier to die, or you aren't going to progress in life ever so what's the point?
I know that got really grim, I'm sorry. 
   I'm typing this because I'm uncertain of what to do next. I know I need help. I don't have any insurance so I'm not sure how to get some help. I've asked for help many times over the years, but then when nothing happens I hit a random high and try to convince myself that I can carry this baggage, when I know that my whole world will come crashing down once again. It always does. If you did read this whole thing, thank you and if you have some nice advice or encouraging words to give I would love to hear it. &lt;3"
874,Anyone had experiences with CBD for anxiety?,"I have anxiety disorder and panic disorder and depression. Usually I have a cycle of escalating anxiety and panic episodes, leading to burn out and into a major depressive episode. 

I was on SSRI/SSNRI for about 12 years, but after a while found them ineffective. 
I’ve been medication free for about 18months now. But things are not going well and I think I need to look at medication again. 

I’m not a fan of the trial and error that usually comes along with finding the right antidepressant/anti anxiety medication!

A friend of mine has been using CBD for her anxiety and found it helps a lot. 

In my country it’s very difficult to get CBD legally, although I’m trying to go start the process. 
I would prefer this as it seems a more natural option with fewer negative side effects. 

Just wondering is anyone else has experience in using CBD of it has helped them? Is it worth going through the long drawn out process to try it?"
875,Might actually have DDNOS,"So I was thinking that I had Dissociative Identity Disorder, but some criteria really didn't match.  But recently I got told that DID is on a spectrum, researched it a bit and  I'm more or less confident I have DDNOS instead of DID. It would make much more sense because of all the inconsistencies I have with people who actually have DID. Lots of people bashed me because of yesterday's post about Alter's names or something, telling me I'm a liar and I'm fake and I'm just imagining things. Had another breakdown after reading those ""positive"" comments, thanks community! But after my girlfriend consoled me and I talked with a med student about it, I kinda realized everything is on a spectrum. Autism, Dissociative, Sociopathy, and more... Kind of cleared up some things for me, at least I have a sense of identity now somewhat. At least I know what I am, maybe not who I am, but still... I know where to put myself.."
876,A question to those of you who want to share their experience with social anxiety,"I feel like it's been years since I've felt uncomfortable in social environments but it wasn't always like that for me.

In my teen years, social anxiety was always keeping me from expressing myself. I've had it ever since I can remember and I'm curious is that the case with you guys/girls as well.

I'm doing research on the topic and would love to hear your history with this problem. And more importantly where are you at right now? Is social anxiety still an issue or more of a memory for you guys/girls?

I've pretty much dealt with it so any questions are welcomed :)"
877,Research Study: Adolescent Anxiety During COVID-19 - Access to Therapy and Use of Online Technologies,"We are a group of researchers from the University of Bolton (UK). We are currently running an anonymous online survey on the use of online health information and virtual technologies (therapeutic websites/apps/games etc.) during COVID-19, for adolescents who experience anxiety.

We are interested in the extent and type of technology used by adolescents to help cope with anxiety during COVID-19, if your access to pre-lockdown support has been reduced, and how comfortable you feel using these technologies.

The survey is open to anyone who experiences anxiety and is aged between 10-19 years old, regardless of if you have a formal anxiety diagnosis or not.

The study is not sponsored by any organisation, and has been ethically approved by our university and the link to the survey is below. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete, and we would really appreciate your participation. 

Further information and contact details for the lead researcher are available on the first screen upon clicking the link.

Thank you for your time.

878,My mother has bipolar disorder and I think I’m starting to show symptoms??,"I’m no stranger to mental illness, I have depression and generalized/sometimes severe anxiety. And it’s in the family. My mom has bipolar disorder (I’m not sure what kind) and I’ve seen what it does to a person and felt what it does to the people around them. 
I think I have symptoms of it, like highs and lows and random irritability. Also I get bursts of energy where I feel like I can do anything (well... write anything) 
This is the same stuff I saw with my mom. She would shop and buy impulsively and have these moments where she would be like “we can but the house and do this and that!” Similar time what I’m feeling. 

I would talk to my physiatrist but it’s really her doctor and I don’t connect with him well and he never listens to me. Not to mention we can’t get a meeting in at all because of the lockdown. 

I just don’t want to be like my mother. I really hope it’s my anxiety but it’s been going on for a while and I see the similarities. It’s scares me."
879,What are these pangs of hurt and loneliness I feel is attacking my heart despite waking up on to a nice day outside?,"I've woke up just now and felt empty, hurt, like maybe this is what life is: hurt and all you can really do is distract yourself from the pain."
880,They've fucked my medication,"I'm supposed to be on 40mg fluoxetine. It was on my repeat prescription at university so I assumed it would be when I moved back to my home town and transferred back to my home GP. Apparently not.

So when I sent my prescription stating it was urgent they couldn't send it to me because apparently it wasn't on my repeat prescription. I had to call the GP and talk to them and they said if I send a photo of the box of pills via email then they will sort it out (because it says 20mg fluoxetine, 2 to be taken each day, with my name etc) I also told them I had one day's worth of pills left (sort of a lie I had only 1 pill left). Anyway I sent them the photo evidence via email, included my DOB and name.

Now it's been 6 days later and apparently they never received the email when I absolutely sent it. This also means I haven't taken any fluoxetine in 5 days and haven't taken my full dose in 7 days.

I'm so fucked and I want to cry."
881,Nothing good ever happens,"Depression has killed me. It ate me up completely. I no longer recognize myself. I lost myself. I lost all the spark. I tried hard to regain it. Believe me, I tried. I went against all my comfort zones, and NOTHING HAPPENED.

WHY IS LIFE SO FUCKING BORING."
882,Advice needed.,"Options for what to do. - 17M

So I sent this in an email to my student support person at school she knows I am dealing through a lot of depression and anxiety and waiting for a counsellor and psychiatrist is 2 &amp; 4 weeks away respectively.

Me: “I am really concerned that if I am to wait such long times to see someone I am really going to detoriate.”
Referring to self harm, and suicidal thinking
School: “My duty of care is to support you and when safety is a concern I need to share this with others. From what I am hearing from you safety is a concern. I would like to talk to your mum, and would like to talk to you first. “ 

I don’t want people to know I am struggling mum knows parts but I don’t want her to know all of it.

I feel in my meeting tomorrow I am going to ask for confidentiality and beg for her not to ring as my safety is not a concern to me and if she thinks I am at risk of harming my self or others, where I live you can send the regional manager of mental health services an email asking for a test to be done on someone and I will suggest for her to do that in order to deal with the problems. If deemed unsafe I will get hospitalised for 5 days and it will be reviewed for another 5 days and then 14 if still unsafe.

Any advice?? What should I do, do I have the right approach to this ?"
883,Mental health / mushrooms,"I NEED HELP.

About 5 days ago, i did mushrooms for the second time. I had a trip not that good, cuz my dad arrived home earlier than i thought and i started panicking. Ive been feeling sick since then. A lot anxiety, my head is always like bumping or some shit, like overwhelmed, i feel weak. Ive told to my mom what ive done, and she is willing to help me in every way possible. Is this some aftereffects that will heal soon?

Im not a drug addict and i barely do drugs, only smoke weed very rarely.

Help me asap. I need you guys.

Francisco."
884,Is it normal to try to hang yourself and stop just because of the pain??,"I tried to do it with a rope but the tree wasn't tall enough, so I just had to not stand up on my feet, but in the last moment I stood up and I don't know why, I think maybe it is bc of the pain on my neck but in those moments the pain is supposed to don't matter. Was I just trying to call others attention??"
885,Unmotivated to do my daily reviews,"I have a test around next month and if I'm behind on my daily reviews then I won't learn enough words for the test, but because of the stress due to my imminent failure I have gastrointestinal problems right now which is just great :/

If anyone has tips in order to motivate me to study I'd appreciate it if you could share them with me. Also if this post doesn't fit the sub tell me and I'll delete it."
886,My Body Image,"I don’t like to post on Reddit often, but I don’t have anything else to turn to. I can’t talk about my body image on Facebook or any either social media site due to my friends and family. 

Here’s the rundown. I weight about two hundred pounds and I am 5’10. I have a stomach, but it can be concealed easily with big shirts and leggings. I haven’t been overweight my entire life, only after Sophomore year of high school did I gain most of it. Despite my efforts, I can’t keep a workout routine for my life and I hate eating healthy. I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for almost a year now and everything is great.. except our sex life. I am never in the mood anymore due to my insecurities and I eventually gave him permission to watch porn, only to keep him satisfied. It wasn’t a big deal until I noticed he watched a lot of skinny girls that always have perfect bodies. He swears that no matter what he watches, he still prefers how I look and that he loves my body. Tonight, I was in the mood for the first time in forever and I wasn’t able to make him finish. We talked afterwards and it took a lot of pushing, but he finally admitted that sometimes he wishes my body was like the girl’s he watched. I was the one who asked for the truth, but it still hurt really bad. I was finally getting comfortable with him seeing my body too, but now I just want to hide myself from everybody. Right now, I feel lost and very sad. I am already insecure and this is just going to make it worse. I know this is stupid and it’s a small thing, but I don’t know what to do to make him happy. My friends also say that I am perfect and blah, blah, blah.. but they’ve commented on my body before. So has my mom. I can’t even go swimming anymore because people will look at me and I don’t want them to see my body. 

If this post isn’t allowed, I am sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest and maybe I won’t feel so alone."
887,"After a rough few days with my mental health again, I need to sort my life out. Any tips would be great","I’ve been working on self improvement and personal growth ever since I was dumped 2/3 months ago, but since I’ve had a tough few days, I feel like everything has started to slide back the other way, and I need to stop this regression and keep improving. There’s a lot of things in life I have struggled with, I have a long term health condition (cystic fibrosis) which increases my anxiety, particularly with potential girlfriends, even though I’m looking after myself and touch wood keeping in good condition. I get really bad performance anxiety during sex to the point where I just can’t stay hard and my heart races and I just panic. I find approaching girls (sometimes even other guys I could possibly be friends with) difficult, because my mind goes blank with things to talk about and I feel like I’ll be perceived as creepy. I’ve always been very conflict avoidant and a people pleaser because I feel like if I bring up my true opinions everyone will screw me over, but I did the other day cut off quite a few friends who I found were chatting shit behind my back and being very two faced which was a good step. I was abused as a child by my stepdad and hid it from my mum for 8 years both physically and emotionally (that has been dealt with). I have a problem with social media, I feel like I compare my life to everyone else, like everyone has expectations for me. I delete my tweets if they don’t get enough likes, try too hard to interact with people, then people view me as desperate and stuff like that. I feel very lonely at the moment, especially considering I have only my 1 close friend and when they are working/busy then I have nobody. I decided to take a social media break for a while, and started treatment for anxiety but this has been put back due to the pandemic. I did learn guitar and have gotten pretty good with it, but again that doesn’t help the fact I feel inferior and don’t have a good self worth. I’ve let people walk all over me my whole life. The people who know me won’t know this side of me, they think I’m a funny caring friendly guy and they’re shocked when I tell them this. I just want to be at a point where I’m happy, comfortable, confident and still keep my personality, but I just don’t know how to go about it. Thanks"
888,Please can someone shed some light??,"Hi guys, hope you are all doing well and keeping safe. So my anxiety/ thoughts calmed for about 10 days and they have came back this morning and it’s all about the whole harm OCD rubbish and harm coming to myself and what if people don’t really like me?? It’s so annoying. Like I could say something to someone and then walk away and think I wonder if that person thinks I’m weird or what if they just spoke to me but really want to hurt me. Is this OCD related? I have major schizophrenia worries like major and now I’m so aware of all my thoughts, I question everything and put a scenario on everything and also recently I had the thought which made me cringe. My partners mother is going into hospital and I was thinking if she doesn’t come out the hospital and passes away would I be happy. Why the hell would I have this thought and then I question myself oh do I really want that to happens like genuinely questioning my thoughts? Anyone know what this could be or what OCD this sounds like? I’d love some background? Thanks"
889,I feel so hurt and I'm having trouble coping with it.,"I'm in a pretty unstable state right now so sorry if it seems chaotic to read.

I just feel so worthless and inadequate and invalid. 

I want to give care and love to someone that I hold very dear to my heart, but I couldn't. I just feel so depressed I hardly have any enjoyment doing stuff I love. All my support systems right now are basically unavailable. I don't to cause too much strain on him because I'm afraid I'm going to make it worse for the both of us. 

I don't know it's just... I don't want him to feel even worse than before yet I let that chance slip just because I'm feeling shit myself. I fucking love him yet I couldn't do anything. I literally have some advice and healthy coping ways but my brain decided to ignore all of that.

I'm scared. I feel so uncomfortable. I know that I'm not perfect and that troubles me a lot. 

I'm hypocritical a lot of the time and it pains me.

I hate the concept of time. If I don't have anything done then I just sit there, with a heavy anxious feeling suffocating me. It's simple homework for fucks sake yet I'm feel so hurt that I just don't want to do it.

My brain doesn't want to improve itself from all the mistreatment I had ever since I was a kid. 

I think I'm hard to love, not empathetic enough, not caring enough to give someone love, extremely aggressive on others, even though I don't want to cause harm to others. That's how people can force me into doing things, they never do it in a kind way, always doing it aggressively. 

Yet he loves me so much, and I love him too. A lot. I feel so powerless... I don't know how to handle this. I feel out of touch with reality. Knowing all my flaws is like a nightmare for me. 

I still have trust issues even though he is very trustworthy and has proved that all the time. I basically act cautious around certain things with everyone. I could LITERALLY talk about anything that troubles me yet I'm hiding everything because I'm afraid of getting hurt.

A big deep-rooted fear of mine is being criticized. I'm well aware that it's normal and sometimes even necessary, but every time I hear a smidge about a flaw of mine, I almost start crying. I feel extremely unworthy of anyone's time just because my brain interprets that small flaw as ""There is something extremely wrong with you and you should be ashamed"" type of thing.

Anyway, I'll just isolate from everyone else, I guess..."
890,Anyone else need to talk?,This feels super lame but quarantine has made me realize how few real friends I have. 30 f
891,I'm very alone and I think its my fault,"I'm writing this on a throw away because for privacy reasons, although I don't think any of the people I know actually use Reddit

Just some context: I used to have a big friend group, or people I at least thought that were my friends. I'm (15M) a sophomore in high school and growing up i never really had much friends until my freshman year. It felt good to finally have some people I can call my friends. Throughout middle school I was dealing with a lot of family issues at home (things I won't go into because it would be too long to explain) but it really affected me a lot. At school I didn't talk to anyone or have any friends for 2 years. Throughout middle school it was a really bad experience for me, even before then I never really had much friends.

Long story short, about 6 months ago I got involved into some things I probably shouldn't have done. I ended up getting suspended from school for a week, had to go to drug and alcohol classes, and I also had to go to court. These were very hard times for me and I realized that all the people that I considered to be my friends weren't there for me. All the people that I needed to be there for me, weren't there for me. I felt very alone, because at that moment I was alone. It made me reflect back on how alone I always was throughout my life. From that moment on I decided to cut off everyone, I went from having a large friend group to only having 1-2 friends. I felt like I kept the only people that were good for me in my life. 

As a result, I made some big changes in my life that I believe were good for me. I started exercising and getting in shape, I started trying in school again and getting straight A's, I felt happy for that time. I felt like I only had the people in my life that I needed. I had my neighbor who I would consider my best friend, and she really had a positive impact on my life ever since I met her. She's the one that in a way inspired me to workout and start trying in school again.  I even met some new people that I thought were pretty cool. I understood them, and they understood me. Everything seemed to be going fine until the pandemic started. 

I'm unsure why I'm like this, but there's times where I wish to be alone. Maybe it's because I was always used to being alone, or I'm just a strange person. I block everyone out for a short period of time (maybe a week or so). I don't reply to text, I leave people on opened/delivered and I just back away from any social media for a moment. It's like sometimes I don't have the energy in me to be social. I like being alone sometimes and I really enjoy it. I've learned i'm a very introverted and awkward person but I like who I am. Ever since the pandemic started and I've been at home all day, this has affected some relations with some people who I considered to be my friends. Not sure why, but they might have thought that I was ghosting them or not replying to their text because I had something against them? or didn't want to be their friend? and as a result they did the same. I've been left on delivered for about 2 weeks now and still no reply from anyone, not even the group chat.

My neighbor (Who I considered to be my best friend) before the pandemic we used to hangout almost everyday and go on long walks and talk about things etc. Now that we can't really see each other we text sometimes. She's really the only person I talk to at this point. Even then we don't really text much. I feel like we've talked about so much at this point, I'm unsure of what to talk about. So I just text her asking how she's doing and if everything is okay. I feel like i'm just repeating the same thing over and over again and it gets boring. At times I feel like a nuisance. No one texts me and asks me how i'm doing. When I text people I'm usually the one to start the conversation. At this point I really only text about 1 person a week. 

I've been really thinking a lot about my current situation recently, and there's times where I just want to cut everyone off completely. I want to do my own thing and find people who actually understand me and that I can talk to, but with everything going on I don't think that would be possible. 

I just feel very alone, I've cut people off and people cut me off. I don't have anyone to talk to and it gets depressing at times when i'm stuck at home by myself with nothing to do other than to play video games and watch Netflix. I just want someone to talk to that understands me. I just want people in my life that support me, and that care for me like I care for them. I want someone that I can share my experiences with and we could talk about interesting topics.  I just want a real friend.

 I'm not really sure why i'm posting this on Reddit. Maybe at least someone will read it. I don't have anyone to talk to so why no here."
892,What is this?,"I had my counselling session over the phone today and I thought I heard a knock on the door but I didn’t go and check as I was halfway through my session.

After the call, I went to check and saw a small package. I didn’t recall ordering anything. So I went back into my bedroom, opened it and there was a note “I have been thinking of you and miss you” note and a chocolate muffin from my manager! 

This is such a lovely surprise that for the first time in 2 months I actually felt happy! The people I work with are truly amazing, they feel like friends rather than work colleagues.

It’s made me feel good!"
893,Does insurance help if I want to admit myself to a community hospitals mental health ward?,I dont think I can do it anymore. Im close to my break point. If I admit myself to a community hospital will I have an absurd bill waiting for me when I get out?
894,my boyfriend got jumped,"okay i’m going to try to keep this as short as possible. me and my boyfriend are both twenty years old. a couple days ago i was driving my sister and my boyfriend up to our grandparents house when i stopped at a 4-way. i told my boyfriend i wasn’t moving until he got his seatbelt on and this guy on a moped drives up from the other direction and shouts “learn how to f*cking drive!”. he continued to follow us and ride our bumper, get real close to the side of the car and scream and cuss us out. we stopped at another stop sign and i begged my boyfriend not to get out but he did, he started fighting the guy. then another guy showed up in a truck and they jumped him. 

he got real banged up in the incident and now he has blamed me for the past few days. he says if i wouldn’t have stopped in the 4 way in the first place to try to make a point about the seatbelt, none of it would have happened. while that may be true i told him not to get out of the car and fight him in the first place. 

he won’t let me touch him and he’s hardly talking to me. he said he may even want to break up. i’m not sure what to do at this point because he is so upset over the entire situation. he feels like he failed. he thinks he needs to get revenge. 

my question is what can i do to help him get through this? is this entirely my fault? he hasn’t eaten since it happened, doesn’t get on his phone or leave the house, and i catch him staring off into space just not saying anything. i don’t know what to do. when he looks at me he sees what i caused and he has this look of in his eyes and i’m unsure what to do. we’ve been dating nearly four years and i’ve never seen him like this."
895,Believing that you are the main character in a movie and trying to be them in real life ? Is there a mental disorder like this?,"Someone told me they feel this way sometimes and they think it’s a disorder but I couldn’t find anything similar online.  

Or getting very emotionally involved in movies as if you are that character in the movie."
896,Guy mentions suicide in my Instagram dm,"
Can someone help understand this?or give me advice on what to do? 

Note: we I don’t really know him other he follows my on my Instagram and he’s older then me. Also a quick trigger warning for the following; suicide, suicidal thoughts, body dysmorphia, bullying

So today I’m struggling with low self esteem and my body dysmorphia, panic attacks and anxiety are really bad for the past few days. I made a quick post about about feeling awful in my Instagram story and this guy comment on my story saying to “Cheer up”. I ask how is asking to cheer up to make my low self esteem go away and he mentioned that “You’re better that your self esteem”; I understand that he may be trying to help me feel better, but the rest on the conversation we had, just made me feel awful. 

The rest of the conversation he ask when made feel like this, I mentioned that I had people told me how I was good enough and the issue that I have mention, suddenly he mentioned how get got bullied for his race in catholic school and was disowned by his family disowned him when he moved out. I apologise that he had go through that and I must have been hard for him, he continued more about his upbringing about being then he mentioned why he should exist and also mentioned that an old coworker try to give him pills to “help him dead quicker”. I got panicky ask if I should call the police because I didn’t know if he was endanger or not (he didn’t mention that is was years ago after I mentioned about calling the police as I thought it was recently). He told me not to and said he’s only done it twice (I think it’s just me and I might be too sensitive, but I don’t understand why you would tell a stranger about his upbringing. I would understand if I’d ask him to give me his life story, but I didn’t) he continues with his life story and also mentions about his financial issue his having and ask me if that was fair. I told him she really should to a lawyer about that and I don’t have any experience with that. He then say “I think I’m going to say is sorry I messaged you, but I’ll try to deal with it.” And told me to don’t worry about it. 

I so conflicted. I’m not sure why to do and I feel a lot worse then before, because I’m worrying about his safety. Any advice would be helpful or even clarity. 

Also I apologise if this is in the wrong Reddit or if this upset anyone."
897,I think I’m losing my shits,"I’ve been inside my home since 15th March. I’m studying at another state, and it’s really difficult to come home you know, the flight tickets are not cheap, the buses I’ll have to take to reach my house because it’s at rural areas, and only two weeks of holiday after every 6-month long semester. 

I was supposed to be back by early April, but the University made a notice that we’ll have our holidays extended until the end of June. My session should be ended by March next year, but I don’t know if we’re going to make it now. There’s so much uncertainty, it’s messing with my head for a long time now.

Ever since I decided to move out from the hostel that the University provided because I was paired with bunch of dudes who takes the Music course, they’re jamming every night, I already have to deal with my anxiety that haunts me every night if I stay up late, I just want to sleep peacefully, hence I moved out.

I moved out to a house, wishing things would be better. At first, it was fine, we were all getting along well. We have 8 persons living in that house including me, and I thought things will be fine until the end of university life. 3 months back, there was a fight between 3 guys, probably over hygiene problems. They’re coursemates, so they took the master room, with a bathroom. I’ve never been in there that much, so I didn’t know what’s the deal.

After the fight happened, 2 of them rarely be at home anymore. They either go hangout at their senior’s home, or they would’ve stayed at the library. I don’t know what’s the deal between them, I don’t want to get involved, I don’t care because I have my own shits to deal with.

Time passed quick, it’s time to pay rent. We all have to individually transfer the rent to the account of the landlord. But that’s not the case anymore. The landlord decided to come to the house while I was all alone, he did a spotcheck on everywhere, he found tons of cigarette butts in the master room, he thought that he should pick someone to take care of the house for them, and as the only person he saw at that time, he demanded me to be in charge of the house.

I am not a leader type of person. I don’t want and will never want to lead shits. I know myself well enough that I will want everything according to my steps, and if anyone fucks up, I will lose my shit. I tried to contain myself at first. But pay-the-rent day has arrived again, like always I transferred my rent to the landlord’s account, but 2 of the guys didn’t. The landlord decided to ask me why, which I have zero idea of, ever since they decided to stay outside more than they do at home, I’ve never spoken anything to them, because we don’t meet that often.

Landlord says that it is my job to collect the rent and give it to him by the 7th every month, a job I never said I wanted to take. Guess it doesn’t matter now. I texted them, they told me that their parents will transfer their monthly expenses by the next day. So I told the landlord, and obviously, they didn’t pay, at all. I had to bust out my own money that I got for my salary for working my ass of during the holidays when I wasn’t able to go home because the flight tickets are way too expensive.

Months after months, sometimes they pay me back, most of the time they don’t. My savings are getting lesser and lesser, and the landlord is pushing me harder and harder. The landlord doesn’t want to be the bad guy for keep asking them over and over again when they are going to pay, so he decided to push me on board. And now, he eventually thinks that I’m his lamb because if by 7th I don’t pay him, he’s gonna keep calling me and bother me instead of them. Why am I always the one to take the fall for someone else?

Sometimes I will have to cut down my own expenses, so that I can help them pay. Sometimes I will have to starve for 3 days straight, because I only have enough money to eat during the excercise day. Sometimes I will have to push them, just to find out that they actually already have the money but they didn’t want to give me because they’re sure that I will help them pay. If I push some more, they’ll get annoyed and ask me to stop pushing them because I’m making them depressed that way.

My mental health is getting worse everyday. I don’t feel like talking to anyone in the house, I don’t want to tell my parents about it, because I know they’re gonna help me out, but I don’t want them to worry about me. I only vent with my close friends, been friends ever since we were 6 years old. Some of them has been helping me emotionally, some financially. I am glad to have them, they’re the only good things God have granted me with besides from my family. 

I’ve been hoping to go back town ever since. Meeting with them are the only thing that kept me going. I’ve only worked part-time during holidays, but I worked part-time during school days in early March because I wanted to earn enough to buy myself a flight ticket and it was really hard to catch up with my grades but I managed to pull that off and got 3.5 for my final result of fifth semester. Then we’re given a holiday of 2 weeks. 

I flew back to town by 14th March. I have 5 really close friends, 2 of them are also studying across the state and were also going to come back to town by 21st, and 3 of them have always been in town after graduate. We planned to hang out and go for a little trip around the town when everyone’s back. We’re all happy and excited about that, and I’ve never been so happy since I got myself in those mess. Everyone was talking about the trip, about where we should visit, what hotel should we book, whose car should we drive, and what activities we can do in the group chat. 

My country has locked down, due to the virus, by 18th March. They’re not allowed to fly back anymore, they’re not allowed to go out anymore. We never get to see each other, not even once since I got back to town. They cancelled the flight, they’re not coming back for now. The trip is dismissed, we’re not going anywhere anymore. By the time my country lifts the lockdown, I guess it’s time for me to go back to the shithole that I was trying so hard to get away from.

I tried so hard to hold all these emotions back, I’m starting to lose my shits. I cried when I was eating dinner with my parents, they had no idea of what happened to me, but they decided to just let me cry. After I was calmed for a little bit, they asked questions and questions, I told them almost everything how I worked hard for all this, except anything about the house. The tension I have on me is unmeasureable, it hurts me a lot, I want an escape, I want to kill myself, but I don’t want to upset my family and friends, and that’s the only reason that keep me going.

I need to get this off my chest. I know I can’t keep relying on my friends just because they’re nice. I don’t want them to feel that I’m trying to take advantages from them, I don’t want to lose another reason that keeps me alive. So I decided to post here, sorry for wasting your time."
898,Possible PPD and Haldol?,"So I know I’ll get ripped for attempting to tease out a diagnosis, on my own, but I have no other options. 

I’ve read over the DSM description for PPD and my wife fits it perfectly, IMO. She has been getting worse over the last 4years and recently left me. She moved back in with her parents a few months ago, cutting contact with me. (Her paranoias eventually involved me). 

Her doctor will not talk to me because I don’t have permission from my wife. Her parents are just completely uninvolved and know even less than I do. What I do know is that my wife said something to her psychiatrist that got her prescribed low dose Haldol. What I don’t know is if she’s taking it or not. She told me it was for her anxiety, which I immediately doubted after looking it up...

I read that Haldol is prescribed for many different psychotic illnesses, so I assume the doctor must have also noticed something similar to what I’ve noticed. 

She HAS been previously diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. My thoughts are that her PTSD morphed into PPD. 

So my question is, what am I up against? Is there light at the end of this tunnel? If she decides to start talking to me again, what should I say to her to help her? What kinds of treatment could help her? Can PPD go away? Can it lead to other things?"
899,Got recently dumped by a guy with serious mental health issues and would appreciate some advice,"Me 26f, got dumped last weekend by 28m and I just don’t get it. This might end up being long story but I’ll try to make it as short as I can.

We met two months ago and we really had some special connection. He opened up to me about things he said he’d never told anyone. Suicidal thoughts, feeling of being completely worthless. His background is very hard and the depression has been there for at least 5 years. Tried to get help but recently didn’t have any and is trying atm to find a good psychologist.

About three weeks ago it went very bad and he started to be very distant. Sometimes he said he loves me, another days he wasn’t sure. Then he said he doesn’t have the resources to have me in his life. He took some days to think about it all and after that ended up leaving me. He said it’s for my best and his life is not supposed to be happy. He said he would break me. I told him he is running away from the good things that happen to him and that he shouldn’t even know the feelings precisely after just two months of knowing each other.

I feel like he gave up very easily. I really would’ve been a good choice for him (stable, good job, education etc.). Of course these things don’t matter if he just doesn’t feel it. But because the issues, I doubt that it’s just because of the feelings weren’t there. I even sent him a letter trying to make him understand that I really wanted this. 

I try to follow all the normal breakup advices, like no contact etc. but I’m also very worried about him and I’m not sure he made the right decision. What do you guys think, is it just better to leave him alone? I mean I know I have to respect his decision and maybe it can be too overwhelming if I keep contacting him but on the other hand I don’t like that he feels so worthless. The last thing he told me is to forget him.

Tl;dr: fell in love with a guy with a lot of problems and don’t know if I should just try forget him."
900,Venting about broken vent,"Last week I started noticing the smell of cigarettes entering my living from the corner. Turned out that the only possible explanation is a leak in the ventilation that runs past it. 

So I told the people that run the building and they told maintenance and now I just have to wait....

But every fucking time I get that smell in my living room I get so fucking frustrated because I cant do anything about it and am basically not comfortable in my own living room until that smell is gone, and it takes atleast 10-15 minutes before its gone. 

If I could do anything I would but this all comes down to how quickly maintenance calls and how long it takes before they can actually show up. 

Being chased out of my living room by this fucking smell is putting an enormous damp on my mood which is already affected by the whole covid shit to the point I can see myself breaking down in anger and frustration. 

I dont have a large appartment so the only place I can to to is my bedroom, but I really dont want to be stuck in my bedroom everytime someone decides to smoke....the only thing I can think off is putting a hole in the ventilation casing so that the smell goes out somewhere else than my living room. I've already checked for holes, found one and plugged it but it just shows up somewhere else where I cant see anything....

The smell pisses me off but whats pissing me off more is the fact I have to wait for other people to do something about it because I rent the appartment...."
901,Feeling of having to live?,"I'm sure most don't agree with this, but I've really made horrible choices and fucked my life completely up. Felonies, multiple addictions yadda yadda bitch ass woe is me shit. I'm looking for a reason to not just end it tbh. Really struggling to find meaning. I'm familiar with tons of self help, philosophy, all the rest of that shit. Nothing helps, it' all feels meaningless."
902,What's wrong with me?,"TW/CW: Talk of suicide, murder, and other grisly topics

I'm in the USA. I'm not looking for a diagnosis here...just ideas.

At the risk of sounding like a hipster, I feel like I'm not like most other people. Emotions have always been weird for me. On one hand, I'm very sensitive and experience some sort of emotional response to just about everything. But I always feel disconnected from them somehow, and don't really truly feel them. I currently have moderate major depressive order, which kind of explains it now. But I've always been this way, even before I was depressed. It's rare for my emotions to fully consume me, if that makes sense. I mostly just feel what I would describe as ""gray"" or ""bleak"". Not happy or unhappy necessarily, just...blah, I guess. Neutral. I can tell when I'm having an emotional response to something, but it's like it's a distant part of me that I'm not really communicating with.

On the other hand, on the rare occasions that I DO feel them in their entirety, it is absolutely profound. Every time it happens it feels like I've never experienced an emotion anywhere near as strongly as I'm currently experiencing it in that moment. The sheer beauty of it, even when it's a negative emotion like sadness, is overwhelming to me and I feel truly alive. Sometimes, just the fact that I'm feeling that particular emotion so intensely is enough to make me weep on its own.

What gives?

On a related note, there's another thing that I've observed about myself that I consider to be quite unusual when compared to most other people. Content that most people find deeply disturbing, such as videos of suicides, murders, or just other humans suffering in some way doesn't really affect me. It usually doesn't elicit an emotional response from me at all, but when it does, it barely even registers. Mostly, I'm just morbidly fascinated by it. I'll watch the same video of someone killing themselves several times just to observe and pick apart each and every gruesome detail in full. This often leads me down the rabbit hole, and I'll wind up seeking out more of this content for a few hours until I feel like I'm ready to stop. I don't necessarily enjoy it, mind you. But I also can't stop, nor do I want to. I just have to watch it...I'm drawn to it. The weird part is that this only applies to videos of humans being harmed. If it's any other species of animal being harmed, I find it deeply disturbing and can barely stand to watch it. My heart races and I become really upset from it. But humans? No problem. I feel nothing for the person being harmed.

I've never tried to figure out a reason for any of this. All I know is that I was never like the other kids at school growing up, and even now as an adult, the emotional responses people have to various situations continues to perplex me."
903,How do you deal with a high need for control over your environment?,"I want to let go of the need for control. But I also want to capture the control I realistically do have over my life.

How can I accept that life is unpredictable, uncertain? Would it be wise to look at what's controlling me, and to allow that? How can I give up this need?"

905,Struggling with feeling of having no incentive to continue living,"This is going to be a real whiny bitch post, so sorry. I'm 26/m. I have nowhere else I can vent. To start I've really fucked my life up. Multiple felonies and dozens of misdemeanors, screwed credit, 9th grade education (I got my Good Enough Degree). I was always told I was smart growing up but I didn't know anything about anything, I had zero guidance because my single parent had to work all the time and they didn't know anything anyways.

It probably goes without saying but I was an addict very young developing an extreme alcohol problem where I shoplifted it daily for about 3 years. I huffed air duster, popped pills, did anything to feel different. Later on I got into cocaine and used that with THC concentrate to sort of simulate a speedball. I won't ramble in anymore, but right now I've actually made progress from then and only smoke weed and use kratom daily, with psychedelics on the weekends for insight and stuff like that.

I'm stuck in isolation. Covid hasn't changed a thing in my life. I was like this already. There's a thread about it on my profile if you happen to give any fucks..I just can't get any meaning in my life. Cannot find a reason to try and succeed. I've never completed anything ever, I have no closure in my past relationships. I'm so lonely it physically aches in my heart sometimes and even getting high is starting to not work. I'm considering suicide as a serious option but I'm a pussy and I'm worried I'll destroy my parent anyways. I need advice or guidance, thanks.."

People say therapy brings  progress. If that's true then I dont think I ever had a quality  therapist. All the therapist I ever  had just  wanted to talk in circles.. One even gave me advice about organizing  😑...( get it I'm disorganized  but I think it's a symptom not the cause)

909,Can i get some advice please (possible tw),"hi! Ok, so i have had problems with suicidal idealization for years now and have been to get help multiple times but none of them seem to work for me. Recently i have started hearing audio hallucinations and some visual hallucinations and was sent to my nearest mental health hospital for some kind of a check up where they tried to get better insight into what is going on. I was then put on new medication and assigned a woman who calls me to check on me every two weeks (they call because of this whole quarantine thing, don't think its a permanent thing). Now to the question. over the last week or so i have been experiencing a lot of audio hallucinations instructing me to kill myself, also in my own thoughts i have been seriously considering it. I know i need to get help and probably go to a psychiatric unit but i dont know how i go about doing this. Im in Ireland and im not sure how these things work too well, usually help finds me but im not sure how to admit myself to things like that, any help will be appreciated :)"

914,Would you consider this as an eating disorder?,"I'll try to keep this as short and concise as possible. TLDR @ the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been experiencing panic attacks a lot in the past 3 months. I'd say they're work-related, I stress a lot about it. I deal with lazy, rude coworkers; I have to pick up after them and get the blame when my area is slacking. (Time to get a new job) .

My first panic attack was at work, I was casually walking, and then, out of nowhere, bam, I was struck with intense anxiety, became extremely conscious regarding my **heartbeat** (you know the drill), and sat out the back.

It has not disappeared since and is starting to ''**paralyze**'' me in terms of doing regular activities. I will occasionally feel like I have no control over my limbs / ''fake'' numbness, **which causes me to think I'm having a stroke**. I have to assure myself that I am not by either holding onto something tightly, (considering purchasing a weighted blanket)  OR run my hands under hot water in order to regain control I guess you could say. Hot water bottles help me a lot at night.

It's even starting to affect my vision (I think?) as my vision will occasionally blackout for a split second at stressful times. (Covid is not helping).

&amp;#x200B;

**How does this relate to eating in any way?**

**I'll explain;**

Now that I've been cursed with this  '**'never-ending-like panic attack**'', it has started to make me become VERY conscious of my heartrate/blood sugar, etc. I'm extremely cautious of what I consume, I can't even go as far as drinking a simple coffee/tea. 

Nor can I eat simple snacks such as; chocolate, chips, milk, yogurt, meat, you name it, as I'm in constant fear that it will potentially kill me. Illogicial, I know, I can't seem to break out of this cycle though.

Is this generalized anxiety/panic disorder? Or do you think that it has developed into an eating disorder too?

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to remain as open-minded as possible.

I'm wanting to go to CBT.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

I started to get panic attacks

It started to ''paralyze'' me - daily activities.

I then become too conscious of my heart rate

Now it's affecting what I eat \[fear of dying / stroke / diabetes\]

I'm not concerned in an anorexic manner."

Gabbie, who was my best friend, helped me with my hard times, and I helped her with hers, but the day that she killed herself, she kept trying to call me saying ""Please I need you right now."" But I wasn't able to help her as I was asleep and my phone was in a different room. So I feel like I am slightly to blame for her death as I wasn't there when she needed me the most. My girlfriend Ashley, was there for me also while I went through hard times and helping me with my school as I am failing french and math currently. Today I thought of would committing suicide if I knew there was an afterlife and I can be with both of them as I miss them so much. I really need help so bad, anyone please give me advice..."
916,"Negative Memory Bias and Depression: New research sheds light on the ""glass half empty"" bias.","Coping with depression is no easy task. The mood disorder is characterized by feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, loneliness, and excessive guilt for extended periods of time. Individuals with major depressive disorder will experience episodes lasting at least two weeks. Individuals with persistent depressive disorder experience episodes lasting significantly longer—more than two years in adults and more than one year in children and adolescents.

The symptoms of depression extend beyond low mood. Patients may also have a lack of motivation, find it difficult to concentrate, be unable to anticipate feelings of fulfillment or happiness, and may have recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Depression can also bring on feelings of fatigue and may alter sleeping and eating habits. Taken together, these symptoms can disrupt patients’ social lives and careers.

Depression is distinct from sadness or bereavement caused by a major life event such as the death of a loved one—though those who are prone to depressive disorders may experience a depressive episode because of such an event. For those with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder (also known as dysthymia), depressive episodes are not always tied to a specific event and may seem to arise for no discernible reason. However, when one is experiencing a depressive episode, one may begin to view the world through a depressive schema.

Such a schema is not merely an analog to the medieval melancholic or the eternal pessimist who sees the proverbial glass as always ""half empty."" There may be neurobiological evidence to support what many individuals who have struggled with depression have experienced. It may also support the claim of [Aaron Beck](http://cognitivetherapynyc.com/docs/arosnonintro.pdf), the father of cognitive therapy, who proposed that depression could be described as a cognitive disorder wherein negative information is given a higher priority than positive or neutral information.

## What Causes Depression?

Despite being one of the most widespread forms of psychiatric pathology, the simple answer is that researchers are not certain. As noted above, some depressive episodes may be triggered by trauma, but other factors—including one’s neurochemistry, one’s neural architecture, and how well one’s brain responds to stress—can have an impact on how susceptible an individual is to depression.

While it is clear that genetics play a key role in determining one’s risk of developing depression, there does not appear to be a single neurobiological cause. Researchers have identified more than 100 genes and their alleles that can affect an individual’s neurochemistry, neural architecture, or ability to effectively process stress. This has led to multiple theories to explain the onset of depressive episodes and the reason why some individuals are more prone to them than others.

The latter may seem surprising, since stress is not typically associated with depression. However, excessive stress or the body’s response to perceived stress appears to play a crucial role in the development of depression and may even alter neural architecture. Stress can affect specific regions of the brain, particularly the limbic system (which includes the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus), and may lead to physical changes in brain structure, including impaired nerve growth.

A [study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/12/5034.short) published in the *Journal of Neuroscience* found that the hippocampus was between 9 percent and 13 percent smaller in depressed women when compared to women who did not suffer from depression. Furthermore, the difference in hippocampus volume was more pronounced among women who had experienced more depressive episodes throughout their lifetimes, suggesting a correlation between the number of depressive episodes and hippocampus volume. Other [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10889528) have proposed that impaired neurogenesis in or an underdevelopment of the hippocampus is not a consequence of depression, but rather its antecedent.

## Negative Memory Storage and the Hippocampus

The hippocampus plays a central role in recollection and the encoding of episodic memories. Episodic memories are believed to be stored in clusters of neurons known as [engrams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10683-2), and individual engrams are believed to be associated with individual memory traces. Specific engrams corresponding to individual pieces of information, researchers have found, can be tagged using Ca2+ imaging. Consequently, one can observe a pattern that corresponds with memory creation, memory processing, and memory retrieval.

The hippocampus also plays a role in processing negative or stressful information, which suggests that it could be possible to test the cognitive theory of depression proposed by Beck in a lab. Using murine models, researchers at the Douglas Hospital Research Centre at McGill University in Montreal recently did just that.

The experiment utilized the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model to observe engrams in the hippocampi of mice believed to be susceptible to stress and a separate group believed to be resilient. The team hypothesized that susceptible animals would have a hippocampus that is more sensitive to stress, that these animals would have more hippocampal engram cells related to stress, and that depressive behavior would be observed by reactivating the engram cells corresponding with stressful experiences. Resilient animals, they reasoned, would not have an increase in hippocampal engram cells related to stress.

The team, Zhang et al, [published their findings](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/08/12/JNEUROSCI.1958-18.2019) in the *Journal of Neuroscience* in August. They discovered that,

&gt;“Compared to resilient or non-stressed control mice, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related… engram cells… in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions. The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance... Our findings that negative memory engrams are increased in mice that are susceptible to CSDS suggested that these engrams could mechanistically contribute to the negative bias of memory formation in depression.”

In other words, mice that retained more negative information were more likely to revisit the negative memory and behave in a depressed manner, whereas mice that retained less negative information were less likely to revisit the memory and behave in a depressed manner.

While this major study may not answer our questions about the direction of causality between negative memory bias and depression, it does indicate that the hippocampus does play a significant role in reinforcing depressive behaviors. It also does give greater credence to Beck’s contention that depression can be viewed as a cognitive disorder, though it does not necessarily negate any theoretical paradigm about depression. Consequently, the team concluded their paper on an optimistic note about what this study could mean for patients: “Inhibiting negative memory engrams in the hippocampus could be a novel therapeutic approach for treating cognitive symptoms in depression.”

More studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore how negative memory engrams could be successfully inhibited, but this could potentially be a step in providing new forms of treatment for one of the most widespread and debilitating mental illnesses in the world. These novel approaches may also allow us to better understand the complex web of biological and psychological components that are the underlying causes of depression and take more proactive steps to prevent it."
917,Please help me...,"I am going through some hard times currently, my best friend committed suicide recently by hanging in her closet and just last night I heard that my girlfriend was hit by a car by a drunk driver while walking her dog, so within the spam of a week I lost 2 loved ones. Gabbie, who was my best friend, helped me with my hard times, and I helped her with hers, but the day that she killed herself, she kept trying to call me saying ""Please I need you right now."" But I wasn't able to help her as I was asleep and my phone was in a different room. So I feel like I am slightly to blame for her death as I wasn't there when she needed me the most. My girlfriend Ashley, was there for me also while I went through hard times and helping me with my school as I am failing french and math currently.

921,"I have a lot of anger towards highly educated/knowledgeable people, and I don’t know how to get over it.","I don’t know why this is happening, and I feel so alone.  I’m sorry this is so long. I didn’t really know where to post. 

Backstory: I (28F) am college educated. I grew up with narcissistic, critical, controlling/manipulative parents. I suffer from Major Depressive episodes, generalized anxiety, OCD, and was diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome as a child. I have always been a black sheep—never fit in. I studied psychology because I always felt so fucked up, and like it might teach me something about myself. As you might guess, a BA in psychology is useless. I don’t have a career. I don’t even know what I want. 

My bf (28M) was a friend in college. He has a double BA— electrical engineering and physics. He is in his 5th year of his EE PhD. He is incredibly smart, and I love him to pieces. He’s also studying how to make LEDs more energy efficient; he will do real good for the world. 

For years, I wanted to be a therapist—potentially with a focus on sex or sex education. I have what I feel is too much empathy. I cry at the dumbest stuff, and feel others’ pain deeply. I was also good at psych—found it easy and intuitive. 3 years ago, I developed a best friendship with a guy; I did not realize until last summer that he was a narcissist like my parents. He told me I lacked empathy and would be a terrible therapist. I believed him. I also didn’t have another plan. 

Now to the point: I am generally an enormous fan of education; I doubt I’d be dating a PhD candidate if I wasn’t. But ...I feel like I’ve been trying to figure out what I want for a decade, and am still at a loss. Everyone is urging me to go back to school, but I already feel like my psych degree was a fucking waste—why would i go get ANOTHER?! I know the opportunities for someone with a Masters are different, but if the BA felt like a mistake, deep down, I question why a MA would *really* be different. But I also don’t really feel I have any alternatives I’d like, or that would be remotely lucrative. I’m sure a PhD in sociology or women’s studies would be fun, or but wtf kind of career does that set me up for? I don’t want to be a professor. 

Lately, I get incredibly angry when I hear experts discussing their field of study. I feel juvenile for this. I suppose I am jealous that they not only knew what they wanted, but were smart and successful enough to get it. I don’t feel good enough—ever. My boyfriend will put on a podcast with some scientist, theoretical physicist, mathematician, and I just get so mad. This is new since quarantine—this was never a problem before. I have to leave the room. He put on what anyone else would see as a feel-good video, but the host talking with someone about to graduate from Harvard set me off and I had to go downstairs and cry.  (For the record, my older brother went to Yale, and there hasn’t been a moment in my life when I didn’t feel inferior to him. He also just happened to fall into a career he loves, at a top organization, with very high pay.) I have had jobs in mental health, social services, animal care, customer service and office administration to no avail. 

Right now, becoming a therapist feels like a terrible idea. I can’t even control my emotions listening to a fucking podcast; how could I stay neutral while talking to a narcissist?! My uncle was a medical doctor, who regretted his career his entire life. I am terrified of doing the same. But I also feel like I have no good options where I am now. My parents pressuring me has not helped.  

I guess I’d like to know if anyone has suggestions for how to cope with this anger? I honestly feel guilty—like some backwards person who is jealous of knowledgeable people. For the record, yes, I’m in therapy, and have been for over a decade. Believe it or not, I am mentally healthier than I was at 22. But I am so stuck now. I guess if someone has some perspective, I’d love to hear it. If you actually read this...thank you. 


TL;DR I feel so lost and meaningless, and despite being fairly educated, have recently been unable to control my anger when I hear an expert talk about their field. It’s presumably jealousy, but I don’t know what to do with it...or my mess of a life."

Getting a job has been very easy and successful for me, but keeping it is the hard part. I’ve been hired multiple times, go in on my first day and have a panic attack and quit on the spot. 

My mother is really stressing me to get a job without letting me see my therapist first. I can’t keep a full time job, I just can’t do it.

925,My brother screamed in my face because I confronted him about a light being on.,"Long story short he’s a toxic person obviously. I turned off the light and told him I was trying to sleep. Well my bed is in the main room with some partitions. Long story.

And the main room light is on, I turn it off and he immediately turns it on.

&gt; Ugh if you want to not have any lights on then move out or suck it up!

Uhh... what? That doesn’t make any sense.

So he had the audacity to walk 2 inches close to my face and expected me to be okay with it. I told him like 3 times I needed personal space, and he didn’t listen so I pushed him away.

He claimed ‘self-defense’ and punched me hard. I was pretty mad at his BS excuse so I punched him back. He ran around the house ranting and raving. He threatened to kick me out of ‘his house’ (he’s just a tenant like me, but did bring me into the house) in ‘two weeks’ because I ‘bring the worst out of him’.

I told him I wasn’t responsible for anyone’s behavior and his aggressive behavior was pathetic, and I wasn’t intimidated by him. He kept following me around and such.

He also threatened to ‘do everything to remove me’.

Obviously my brother is an asshole but we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Also I don’t really have that much money and I don’t really know what to do. I think it’s kind of ridiculous somebody can use the act of turning off a light and some words to attempt to intimidate someone. 

He also locked me out of the house and I told him I was entitled to have entry.

What should I do??"
926,Seroquel/Quetiapine Withdrawals/Side Effects—did you experience EPS (trembling/shaking/tremor/twitching) and did it improve?,"Hey everyone, I’m currently 162.5mg IR Seroquel and 15mg Mirtazapine.
Stats:
1. 28 years old
2. Male 
3. 220lbs, low body fat

I was hospitalized in October for debilitating tinnitus-induced insomnia and at that time, was on 300mg Seroquel. In a month I dropped down to 250, then in another month down to 225. For all intents and purposes I basically stayed on this dose until April 1st, when I dropped down to 200mg. I am 7 1/2 months in now and just dropped to ~162.5  last night. I am dropping in 12.5mg increments. 

I’m glad I’ve been reducing the dose because around the end of March, I noticed a VERY SLIGHT tremor in my hand when using a dropper for skin care. This tremor has become more pronounced and when I lift weights my whole body feels like it’s shaking with certain exercises. When I flex my arms my hands will shake a lot, but this is completely absent at rest—only then will I get an occasional jerk/twitch of a random muscle group every four hours or so. I’ve been lifting for 12 years and have never experienced this sensation. It is incredibly upsetting and I fear that this will be a long-lasting or permanent EPS of Seroquel. So I would be stuck with a banshee in my ear and the inability to control my musculature. Awesome.

However, because of the reduction dates and timing of this symptom’s appearance, I can’t accurately say whether this is a withdrawal or a tardive side effect of quetiapine.

My questions for people who have been on seroquel: did you ever experience this trembling/twitching/shaking? Did it appear late? Did it appear during withdrawal? Did it get worse or better as you decreased? Did it dissipate?

I also have pretty constant tachycardia (~120bpm) and wake up with horrible anxiety every morning. I’m not sure if this is a side effect or part of withdrawal either. 

Thanks in advance."

I’ve had some pretty bad ptsd, depression and anxiety since I was little and was put on antidepressants after my first daughter was born but it honestly feels like they’re not working anymore. It’s going to be at least another two months before I can get an appointment with a psychiatrist so I’m trying to get by until then. I just need to be able to talk to someone without feeling like a burden, I’m also incredibly awkward and bad at starting/keeping a conversation going though.

932,Probally the worst Place for 7-17 year olds to learn coping...,"I went to a Mental health facility near Charleston,SC (ive been to 2 total), as soon as i got in they gave me the worst Unit to be in (Unit 7). First day wasn't too bad. Then... for some reason, Next morning they took all our notebooks/books/paper (for doodling/writing).  also the food was near god awful, i barely got any sleep. And worst of all, since most of us (execpt me and someone else) were not even there for a day, we couldn't even go outside. At least they had movies and board games. 3rd day was a turning point, a person got in a fight, and we couldn't get lunch (staff had to get it), and also we couldnt go outside. 4th day, i got in a fight and used minimal force to restrain the kid (same one who fought earlier). i got a little in trouble, but since i was calm it didnt really affect my stay time... (Also, the kid who fought me was there for like 3 weeks,kinda feel a bit sorry for him) 5th day, it was still boring, and also i was really really really tired. i think the kid who fought me, had to stay in his room. 6th day was probs the funniest day, a crush formed between two kids (MF) and (M) started to touch (F) inapropriately (yes, she didnt care). (F) Came, soiled her pants. had to make sure staff didnt know (they didnt,yet).if the sixth day was as bland as every other day, i would rate the place 2/10. but for the madlad who fingered a girl, ill raise it to a 4/10. 7th day was my final day, Not much happened, (M) and (F) got in trouble, and after i left, it took a while for me to feel not empty.

933,Been feeling guilty...,"I feel guilty for not telling anyone the whole truth. Even the person who knows the most about what’s going on with me doesn’t know all of it.

I feel guilty about not telling my parents that I’m struggling, but I can never get myself to them anything personal.

I feel guilty that I haven’t turned in the last two assignments for a class (we get 1 per week now, so it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve done something for that class), but it’s hard for me to start doing work. My motivation levels have dropped again.

I feel guilty that I haven’t gone to a lot of my online classes. They’re optional, but teachers still want us there. I can barely get myself to go. Just the idea of seeing other people makes me stressed anymore, and I usually feel worse afterwards. I feel like teachers would think that that isn’t a valid reason to miss because everyone has hard days and pushes through them. 

I feel guilty for sleeping in way later than I should everyday, but the way I see it, the more time I sleep, the less time I have to be awake. At the same time, I stay up way later than I should because I know once I’m trying to sleep and don’t have distractions anymore, I’ll start thinking again. People don’t realize that all I do is try and distract myself so I don’t start thinking.

I feel guilty because I think of myself as a bad person. 

The thing is though, my hard days aren’t just me feeling a bit down because something happened. My hard days are when I can’t stop the thoughts. I can’t stop wishing I could just disappear. I don’t want to die, I just wish I could disappear for a while. My hard days are when I just feel like crying because no one irl knows what exactly I’m going through, and I can’t get myself to tell them everything either. They’re when I wish I could just stay in bed all day. They’re when I don’t have breakfast or lunch because even though I feel hungry I don’t actually have a desire to eat, and if I do try and eat, I can’t eat much. They’re when I keep thinking about how no one even cares about what’s going on, and how I probably just annoy everyone around me. 

I feel guilty."
934,Should I be worried about Nightmares not affecting me anymore?,"My friends always tell me about Nightmares they have and how awful they feel but I'm at a point in my life where it doesn't matter what Nightmares I have, I'm not affected by them at all. They have no effect on my mood (which isn't great anyway) or my sleep. It may sound like a good thing but to me it just seems unnatural."
935,Projecting Father Rant,"I am almost thirty and have really struggle with unemployment. I don't know if there is just something wrong with me that causes this but now I am afraid that the two fields I am trying to break into may be dead ends. Anyway, that is an aside, but maybe it gives context for what comes next.

So, I think my father has a lot of issues but he told me this yesterday:

&gt;\- Doesn't believe in it when they say you can do anything or be anything in school.  
\- Who else would stock the shelves or be plumbers if they could be anything they wanted to be (???)  
\- Not everyone can be in fancy careers, like lawyers and doctors (these are one in a million, according to him)

The sad part of this is that it has really effected me. I know I shouldn't believe this stuff because it is BS but I am so down now. He is not the type of person that makes you feel hopeful after you've spoken with him. I just can't snap out of this. I think he is projecting his feelings about education onto me. And he is always trying to encourage me to pursue things I have no aptitude for. I think for a long time I had just ignored stuff like this, as my coping mechanism but over the last few years I've taken a more active approach. Still, I feel a little blindsided and maybe surprised that this has effected me as much as it had. Probably will try to do something fun this afternoon, work on my job search; hopefully return to myself soon.

I'm not sure how helpful this would be for anyone but it feels good to get these thoughts typed out. Maybe this can be a reminder to someone else dealing with something similar that they are not alone.

937,I think I’m depressed again and this time I have NO sex drive,"Hi! So please excuse my disorganized post. I can’t even bring myself to saying anything cohesively. 

So essentially, I’ve battled depression before and I believe I’ve re-entered a depressive state but my telltale signs aren’t ALL there and I’m experiencing something new: absolutely NO sex drive. 

Has anyone come across this? I’m assuming it may be fairly typical but personally I’ve never experienced it before. 

Aside from the pandemic and quarantining alone (which definitely is effective everyone’s mental health to some degree), I recently went through a break up. Ironically enough, we broke up because HE was going through a depressive episode and essentially boxed me out completely right before Christmas. I’m thinking about it more now that I’m not mentally well. At the time of the breakup I was incredibly mad that my grown man boyfriend ignored me for days and thus altered Christmas plans by avoiding me, but now I’m starting to see things a bit more from his perspective? Anyway, that’s not even what this post is about though. 

I’ve just noticed that over the last two months, I have not once felt “sexy” or “in the mood.” I know I’m by myself here so that doesn’t help, but even still I haven’t had any desire to be intimate at all. 

It’s like my existence has boiled down to just: get up, eat, work, pay bills, do a home improvement project, chat with a friend, Netflix, sleep, repeat. I don’t know if I’ve just become used to it but the thought of re-entering the dating world and having a social life in general is overwhelming and I’m kind of dreading it. I don’t feel sexy, I don’t feel like sipping wine, I don’t feel like meeting friends for dinner, I don’t feel like potentially running into my ex. 

I think I’m just really sad and I need words of encouragement.

I have no options. Tried going to see therapists 2 times over the last 5 years with this problem. I just don't want to live if this is what the next 30, 40, 60 years have in store for me.

941,over 2 years ago I drunkenly pulled a knife on someone and I hate myself for it,"Hey I hope everyone's well and safe at the moment

I have a seriously hard time forgiving myself for everything. I'm 18m, was a teenage alcoholic addict and alcohol really brought out some bad shit in me and suffer from depression and anxiety. 

3 years ago I had bought a knife from a friend who was a collector. I had no intention of harming anyone at all, it was more just to flip and play with (looking back I'm not sure why I did, but I was out of it). I was very drunk one night, almost never slept and was anorexic, I saw my friend with some pizza and I begged him for a slice. He wouldn't give me any and as a drunk ""joke"" I took my knife out my bag and obviously he flipped and tried to get it from me. Even drunk I had no intention of actually harming him, but the intimidation and pure shittiness of what I did makes me feel fucking awful every day. 

He was and somehow still is one of my best friends, he forgave me a while after and were still close to this day. But I can't stop feeling so so bad about it. A similar thing happened a month later with another friend, not as serious but again he forgave me. Of course I apologised over and over, not to make myself feel better but to show them that's not how I really feel or am. Still it wasn't quite enough to make me quit drinking or drugs I was really in the deep end. That in itself I regret. 

Summer 2019 after another incident where I caused a massive scene at a party and nearly got my family in a car crash (I wasn't driving) I basically finally quit drinking spirits and wine. These days all I drink is beer and its not to get drunk,occasional 3 or 4 330ml San miguels. Soon I will be completely sober because its very clear alcohol isn't for me. 

Sober I'm not a violent person. The other week I put mouse poison down as a last resort after humane traps, saw one eat it and scared it off cos I knew it was gonna have a shit 4 days. I hate violence. I hate being told I'm a nice person, especially by people like my family who don't know everything I've done. 

I've tried meditating, therapy, CBT, medication, weed, exercise but I still get these intrusive flashbacks to all the bad shit I've done, especially these things and I beat myself up daily. 

I don't know what to do anymore 
I'm sorry this is long but thanks for reading 

tl;dr I was a horrible drunk and don't know how to forgive myself"

I’m not saying I eat 24/7 though, I have around 2 meals a day. But I’m not, not satisfied as well. I always have cravings, and I’m just ALWAYS thinking about what I want to eat. Obviously money goes out a lot too. I just want to stop thinking about food 24/7, but I don’t know how.. I’m thinking my perception of food has to change so here I am.

945,Trying to understand trauma,"Hello everyone. I hope this post fits this sub and that I’ll get to exchange with some of you - I’ll keep it as simple and clear as possible, but English isn’t my first language so i apologize if I make mistakes. 

Last year, I got into a relationship with someone - we can call her T. She had major commitment issues and broke things off after a few days but said she still wanted to stay friends, but I couldn’t do that back then, I wasn’t feeling great that day and completely shut down, making my biggest regret ever and losing her as a friend. 

I haven’t talked to her since then but I’ve caught up a bit about her on social media - she got depression checked among other things and talked about hurting herself and attempting suicide a few times since we broke things off. Coming back to this later. 

I have been, for a year, trying my best not to think about her. The months that followed the break up were the worst days of my short life (I’m 19) and it took me leaving all social medias and a few months to feel ok again. I opened up to new things and people but from time to time, regrets would catch me back and I would fall back in that dark state of mind that I got stuck on for a while. I recently reinstalled twitter, where we met, and it’s been... triggering. 
This is what I’m trying to understand. 

I thought I was fine after a year but reading about what she went through and seeing her interact with people we’re both friends with has be making me really anxious. I find myself shaking, throat feeling weird and wanting to cry when I think about her and it’s exhausting. 
I talked with friends and one rightly said that I needed closure, to talk to her again and clear things so I can feel that we broke things off in a happy way, but I am really scared of doing that. I struggle to speak about it with people I know in real life and I think it’s hurting me.

I wanted to know if that would be consider as some kind of trauma - the memories, the regrets, how harshly things ended and how I believe that things are all my fault. 
I know this might sound pretty lame compared to other things but it hurts a lot.

I don't know if this matters but i'll share it anyway. Since two years ago i feel so stressed and under pressure. I called a therapist and visited him, he told me that i've been burnt out for a long time but refused to believe it and ignored my own feelings.

Here I go, I’m a 26 yo male from Europe. A few days ago I invited a friend over for some beers since the corona crisis has taken away the ability to go out and drink. 

I’m living in the house with 2 roommates for over 16 months. I don’t like one of the guys but we let each other be. Or so I thought... 

Let’s call the guy Justin and my friend Jake. 
Jake comes over for beers and Justin wants to join. I’m trying to get along with Justin because we are quarantined and therefore have to spend tome together. So when I asked to join in hesitantly agreed. 

We played some drinking games, keep in mind me and jake drink quite regularly a lot. No alcoholics by any stretch of the imagination but definitely more than most people. 
Because of our elevated tolerance we were still fine when Justin got a bit sloppy. 

Jake and I were talking about the stock exchange, oil crisis, unemployment issues and the ever rising modern colonisation of China. 

Jake and I are both aspiring day traders. 
Justin comes in with a ridiculous statement that China is buying land in Africa to make rice fields (????) what the actual fuck.... 
so we started laughing a bit and he couldn’t handle it so he choked me to the point where Jake has to pull Justin of my fucking back in order I didn’t pass out. 

I told Justin to fuck right off and go to his room or at least leave Jake and me alone. 

He wouldn’t have any of it and said like a little child: I’ll go to sleep once you go to sleep. 

So we proceeded to smoke some cigs and weed on the balcony. (It’s kinda legal here) 

After a while this fucking Justin wants to come on the balcony. I tried to keep the door closed but he pushed through and hit me in the face with a glass and continued to hit me in the face with the glass. 
I lost a metric fucking tonne of blood. Over 1.5 liters and had to have surgery immediately. 

I’m writing this from hospital 2 days later. 

I cannot stop shaking. I get sick and my resting heart rate is over 125 bpm. Partly because of the blood loss partly because of the shock. 

I’m hoping someone can give me advice how to stay calm and help me deal with the emotional distress I’m feeling all day long. I’m still unable to leave the bed which makes it impossible to escape my mind. Please, if anyone experienced violence by someone the trust, how did you deal with the outcome? Can you still trust people? I’m so scared and literally on the verge of collapsing mentally every minute of the day. 

I appreciate everyone that read it. I know
It’s incoherent at times but you got to understand they drugged me up in order to cope with the pain. 

TLDR: got stabbed by roommate with a glass. 25 stitches. But worst of all, I’m constantly panicking and I’m scared of everyone. I’m looking for advice from people who have experienced similar things."
948,What could be wrong with my cousin?,"I am currently living in a third world country. Mental health is still a taboo here even educated and well to do people see visiting a mental health professional as a bad thing. My cousin is 20 years old he doesn't like do anything, he dropped out of school, 24*7 sits on couch watching tv is overly aggressive like even if you look at him he gets so mad and starts abusing and sometime even beating people, if his parents try to talk to him about why Is he doing he beats them up, he doesn't leave his home like its been 2 years since he got out of that house, I have tried telling my uncle and aunt that they should see a mental health professional but they always get offended saying ""how dare you think our child is insane"" what should I do to convince them and if any doctor sees this what could be wrong with him. From childhood he is really close to me we used to spend hours talking to each other but now if talk to him it feels like he doesn't wanna talk. 


P.S.  Sorry for any grammatical mistakes I don't know English that we'll."

My depression is very, very bad but I do not want to be on Lithium. I just don't. How should I go about refusing? Like I know they can't legally force me to take it but im trying to do this in the nicest way possible because I really do love my doctor like she's family. What's the best way to go about this? I want to try Lexapro again(tried it years ago and honestly I just don't think I took my mental health seriously enough back then to give it a fair shot) and I want to try it again. Hell, maybe even Prozac. Anything but Lithium."

952,I cried into a plate of fettuccine alfredo...,"Let me back up a few hours...

I awoke this morning anxious about all the things, because really, I’m a mess 85% of the time. Unemployment woes are plaguing me, self loathing, loneliness, mental health scares, and mainly personal failures just run through my head like a bullet train.

Anywho, I stay with my Grandmother once a week to keep her company (on a small rotation with other relatives—and before you ask: Yes, I’m being extra careful around her during this pandemic) because she’s lonely and has recently had a stroke.

While on my usually pleasant drive to her house down long country side roads, out of the blue I started thinking about this “friend” I used to work, and how we don’t talk anymore, and this made me extremely upset. It hit me, and HARD! I started feeling manic and intense. My eyes were welling up with tears and I was laughing and punching the steering wheel....

I almost drove into a the forest at 55 mph.
On impulse.

Then I was thinking about how I didn’t want to be late for my Aunt (who was with my Grandma) so she could get to work (she’s a medical professional). So, yeah, I stopped myself and drove (quite) slowly the rest of the way here in an effort to compose myself, I guess? I don’t know. Because in a flash I was fine again. Just fine. Maybe a bit numb, but whatever.

Had a quick conversation with my aunt, went up to see my grandma (who was—and is, still—napping), and came to sit in the kitchen by myself; staring out the window and completely zoning out. The house is very large and lonely, even when I know there’s someone else here. I don’t know why today of all days it feels so overwhelming and why I feel like throwing myself against a wall...

Fast forward to now... I’m eating their leftover fettuccine alfredo—because I can’t remember the last time I ate anything substantial—and I start quietly crying. Just a few tears coming down and falling off my chin into the pasta. I wasn’t thinking of anything in particular. Maybe it’s residual emotions from earlier?

Regardless, I recognize and admit that my mental health has been on a steady decline. I haven’t been to therapy in a good while, and I don’t talk to anyone about what’s going on (I know, I should). I was always confident I could handle myself; Maybe I could keep a control of my episodes. I generally know when they were coming, but now I’m scared, because I really did want to drive my car full speed into that deep forest. I’m simply feeling empty... I’m totally drained. I want to sleep, but I must keep myself awake for Grandma.

So, thought I’d post this here, on Reddit. I’m sorry if this is too much, or whiny, or plain pitiful. I needed to get it out.

My pasta has gone cold.

I think it was Goethe who said: “If you've never eaten while crying, you don’t know what life tastes like.” And I’m laughing again because life tastes like apathy and fettuccine alfredo."
953,i need to gather motivation to get myself to take basic care of myself but i just can’t,any advice?
954,Can i develop a tolerance to seroquel?,"Ive been on seroquel for about a month, and i feel like its not working as well as it did at the beginning. About a month and a half ago, i got really depressed and took molly to cope with it, which turned out to be a really bad idea. I was expecting a hangover for a few days, which i guess is what happens for most people, but over the course of about two weeks i kept feeling worse and worse. I got panicky, depressed; and i couldnt think clearly at all. I got an appointment with my psychiatrist and i told him about what i did, so he gave me seroquel and klonopin to help. Ive rarely taken the klonopin at all since i dont need it most of the time. He put me on 50mg of seroquel daily, and it worked really well for about two weeks but i feel like my mental state is starting to reverse and im feeling alot worse again and im wondering if my body is becoming tolerant to it. Im having a lot of problems sleeping and focusing on things and i just cant at all. It takes me two hours to fall asleep every ight even though i exercise everyday and that should tire me out a bit."
955,I want to meet a psychologist...,"Hi I'm male 17 from Sweden. I think I need to start talking to a psychologist, because last year I got cancer and I think I have both anxiety and ptsd from what happend. I wanted to cut myself today but I couldn't bring me to do it. 

I don't know how to tell my parents that I want to go, so if anyone could help I would be really gratefull.

Thank you all"
956,Is it possible to have both social anxiety and separation anxiety,"Hi! So I will try to sum a little up about myself. 

I'm an incredible shy person and my confidence isn't the best.. My biggest fear is rejection, so I hold myself back from doing/saying stuff, because being rejected makes me feel unwanted and even unloved at times... I always worry about what other people think of me - And that somehow makes me a people pleaser, as I'm afraid of conflict. Being crowdy places or with a lot of people in general makes me anxious.

Yet on the other I'm somehow also afraid of being on my own. It generally makes me sad, whenever I have to say goodbye to my closest ones (For example when I visit my parents and have to go again, or when my significant other goes to work and I'm on my own) I fear that I will never see them again (Like what if an accident happens to them or what if said/did something and now they hate me or what if they are longer gone than expected). It makes me feel left behind and being alone kinda scares me. I'm completely unmotivated when alone, because I feel anxious and will sometimes burst into tears. I also feel like I need constantly recognition to know that I'm loved. I worry that I'm a burden to others"
957,Was I gaslighted?,"I while ago this guy was emotionally abusing me.
As I've been healing I noticed messed up things he did.
I cant tell if I was being gaslighted or what, but he used to blame my body for his actions, beg me to be intimate, and threaten hurting himself every night so I couldn't sleep. 
I dont want anything to do with this person, but I feel like as a part of my healing process , I should know what he did to me."
958,Feeling Alone?,"You're not the only one.  Reach out to friends via telephone,  practicing empathy towards yourself and others, and find healthy ways to manage your emotions."

960,Finding outlets for negative emotions,"I've been doing my best to find healthy outlets and ways to cope with my emotions. I've been writing and making videos. This is my latest.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea3gdyt1l9M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea3gdyt1l9M) 

After I got all of this out, I felt a lot better and I was able to slip back into a positive mindset. 

I am on a journey of self-betterment and I hope all of you will join me."
961,I dont know what to do,"I wake up every morning wishing i hadn't my step mother makes the house that's supposed to be my home feel like a prison, every day she starts arguments with no purpose and i hate it

 I suffer from clinical anxiety and depression and she and my father both treat it like i can just get over it.. About 6 months ago I got out of a terrible abusive 2 year relationship and have been struggling to move forward but it makes it so much harder when I have no voice.. Nothing i say or nothing i feel ever gets touched on, my voice goes completely unheard so i just feel helpless.. I feel stuck. I'm 19 and this corona has cost me my job.. My only real way out was to make enough money to leave.. My dad is no better than she is, he does almost all the same things she does that make me hate life.

I spend almost all day every day in my room because there's no-where else I can call mine and even that has been taken.. My step mom refuses to give me that little sliver of privacy.. So i feel like I have nothing. 

Found out this morning my ps4 harddrive got corrupted for the 4th time in 2 weeks, so now i don't even have that to keep my mind occupied.

I dont feel welcome in my own home and I dont know what to do. After the break up i lost almost all my friends so talking to people is very hard."
962,Struggling so badly right now...,"I know I have written posts saying I am struggling. Right now, I am feeling worse than I ever thought possible, and the funny thing is that I don't have any suicidal thoughts that go along with this feeling! That is my positive for the day, at least.

The problem is that I found out yesterday that we are most definitely moving within the next 30 days. We aren't being evicted or anything like that, but this apartment is way too small for the seven of us and we have been talking about it since I had gotten home from prison in January. Back then, I didn't want to even think about it because I had just transitioned back into the ""normal"" world and it would have been way too tragic for me to make such a big change at that time. Now, I have been out for four full months (I am in my 5th month of freedom) and I am feeling a bit more stable, even with this COVID-19 thing happening. Another positive. I mean, it isn't all negative. I just found out that I have severe asthma (no doubt made worse by the cockroaches we'd had in our house prior to me going to prison and then moving here to this apartment) and chronic anemia (my hemoglobin was 8.2 and has been hanging out there for a long time), but otherwise, my heart is fine (YAY!) and my overall health isn't all that bad. Another positive! So, yah...I still have pretty persistent depression and anxiety (though I haven't cut in a long while now!!), which brings me to the problem I am having now.

The problem with moving is that I have been in this neighborhood since 2004. Yes, 16 years. I have walked the same route to the local grocery store and back (about 2.5 miles total) every day before I had gone to prison, even on the coldest, snowiest, or warm and humid and stormy days. I have walked in the snow, the rain, bad thunderstorms, sunny, gorgeous Spring and Summer days, and gorgeous cooler and sunny Autumn days, as well as Winter days where the sky was the color of slate and threatening to snow, or the color of sapphires with puffy white clouds and a chill despite the lovely sunshine. In other words, it has been my world for a long, long time and...I just can't leave it. The place we are moving to is firstly in what we call ""The Hill Section"", which is NOTHING like the neighborhood (GreenRidge) in which we live now. There is NO crime here...nothing going on...and people all know each other. Now the neighborhood to which we are moving doesn't really look all that ""bad"" since it is almost into the next small city (borough) over, and that small city (borough) isn't really known for crime either. Positive. 

Sorry this is so long, but I am really really heartbroken over this. All I know is here in GreenRidge...I really LOVE this place so much, and the people. A small mom and pop store is 2 blocks away (not even) and I have grown to love those people with my whole heart. They are closed now because of the Corona pandemic, so by the time they open back up, we will have been gone out of the neighborhood for months. :( I am just struggling so hard with this. I am crying constantly every time I go outside and look at the neighborhood that I will be leaving. It isn't only the walking part--our youngest's school is literally a few hundred yards from where we live now...and now we will be across the dang city. We might have to home-school him for his 5th Grade (and final Elementary Grade) year if the school won't allow him to have a neighborhood exception. I don't see that being a problem since he has a lot of ""school-based"" programs in place already for his Autism and I doubt they would want to move him out of a place where he is already established, partly for the programs reason and partly for the fact that Autistic kids don't do well with transition period. Transitioning him to the Middle School is going to be bad enough for 6th Grade...I doubt they will make that more difficult with another transition the year before. 

I guess I will shut up now. Y'all are great if you read all this. Incidentally, I, myself, am Autistic (Asperger's) so this transition from a neighborhood that I have known for a long time to one I have never known is really, REALLY stressful...and I am trying not to cut to compensate for that. So far so good. We lost our first house to Foreclosure (we weren't very good at budgeting, etc. being newlyweds and unaccustomed to real life) and we (ironically enough) had moved from the Hill Section to GreenRidge, to an apartment on the same street we are on now. Then we found a house right next door to that apartment building (moving was super easy lol) so we stayed in this area. Now we are moving back to where we started, not actually that far from the first house.

Can someone just give me a hug? I hate moving (as we all do, I am sure) and I hate having to get to know a whole new area, even though for most people that might be quite the cool adventure. Not for someone like me.

The apartment is REALLY REALLY cool though. I have to add that. It sits on a hillside and there is an actual ""room underneath the stairs"", but with no door. The landlord is a sweetheart that ACTUALLY LIVES IN THE SAME CITY AS HIS PROPERTY!! That is BIG because when we had moved to the first apartment (after losing the first house), the landlord had lived in New Jersey and we NEVER saw him at all...not to fix things, nothing. He had no ties (helpers, workers) in this area at all. It sucked. He also looks a little like the Late George Carlin and is funny as hell. :) OK, now I am smiling a bit. He is really cool and I took a liking to him immediately. He wasn't even put off that I had been in prison for Arson...though that was the most uncomfortable conversation I had probably ever had. Heh. He said he rents to all kinds of families and all kinds of people and that some of his renters are a little...mashugana. Look that up...yeah lol. :)

Anyhow, I feel a bit better now. Thanks for listening my fam. 

I love you all. No worries--I am not suicidal AT ALL (wow wow wow!) and I don't feel like I have to self-harm now! Thank you SO much."
963,Segment Intending? Has it served you in a positive way?,My therapist recommended that I try segment intending.  I’m not sure exactly how it will serve me. I’m wondering if anyone has done this and if it improved your quality of life even by a little bit. Thanks.
964,Please help me find out what's wrong with my friend.,"I know that he has depression of some kind because he just hates everything about himself to the point he is afraid of people seeing him face to face. He has told me that food had started to taste tasteless and not worth it. He keeps having recurring bad dreams about himself that leave him miserable when he wakes up. Overall he just hates everything about himself and it is really starting to scare me. Luckily he hasn't attempted suicide or anything like that yet but I want to help him before he does. I'm very scared of what is happening to him, so I hope one of you can help me."
965,Worried my environment has effected my mental health,"A few years back due to family discord and financial breakdown , at a young age I was forced to live in an absolutely run down crime riddled shit hole of an apartment , at the time I was unemployed and very very depressed , I could barely get any sleep and my nutrition was awful , the nearest shop was about 2 miles away so everytime I got a food shop in I hiked the two miles with a whole whack of food which was back breaking .

My neighbors would party 24/7 literally everyday all day and all night , all on drugs , there where stabbings and beatings all the time around the area. On occasion they asked me into party but I was so depressed and ditached all I need was sleep and time to let my mental health recover .

This went on for months upon months pretty much the whole time I lived there .

I could hear everything going on I people talking shouting and screaming , and I was lucky if I got about 30 hours sleep a week.

Besides that the alcoholic up stairs would wake up at all hours of the day and night and chuck his guts up .

The place was like down town Baghdad . Because of my already shaky mental health it made me absolutely demented .

Eventually I found work and ended up working 100 hours a week for a few years , 

Between lack of sleep and over working I eventually had a mental breakdown . I earned enough money to move . And got out as soon as possible it had a big impact on my mental health and still seems to effect me.

A few years ago I moved into another apartment and it's nowhere near the same , but I can hear people moving about but that's normal .

Because of my previous experience , I hate living in close quarters . Im highly aware and alert to noises and even the slightest noise makes me paranoid . Like people can hear what your doing or are listening to your ever move . Any mumbling of voices makes me paranoid . I get this way because when I was living in that flat you could hear neighbors complaining about why I wouldn't come in and party . And I did your god damn head in when your depressed and exhausted and all you want to do is sleep or relax for 5 fucking minutes and watch TV .

How can I get voices out if my head . Living in close quarters pits a big strain on me because if my previous experiences, but I compartmentilise and out it to the back of my mind . But for sure there is a constant loop of some shit going on in my head 

This is abnormal and how can I get help for this , or is there even any help"
966,I can't stop thinking about stuff that happend 6/7 years ago,"I dont know why, its been like this for like 2 years. I just keep thinking in circles, not finding a solution. its about a dude in my class that used to pick on me a bit. Other than that dude I was good friends with everyone and popular in class, but I keep getting back to it and it ruins my selfconfidence and hapiness. My father died due to suicide 2 years ago, could it be some kind of coping mechanism? Will I ever get over this? 22 years old and I want to live free of those dumb useless thoughts.

969,"Feel extremely alone and lonely at the moment, some advice would be great. Thanks","Hi! I’ve been out of a relationship now for 2/3 months, I got dumped and wanted things to work but she didn’t make the effort. I’ve also just cut the majority of my friends off for being two faced and toxic. I’ve been working on self improvement and focusing on myself, but I just feel so alone. I only have one close friend now and when he’s working/sleeping etc. I literally have nobody. I’ve always had really bad social anxiety meeting friends and even potential girlfriends. The one girl who I’ve been with approached me. I don’t want to come off as creepy, but also due to having cystic fibrosis, although I do look after myself pretty well, that triggers my anxiety. I had a lot of childhood trauma, I was abused by my stepdad for 8 years and hit it from my mum, and I’m trying to start anxiety treatment but this has been put back due to the coronavirus. I would love to be self confident within myself and not care what others think but this just doesn’t happen. Also I used to spend a lot of time on social media and interact with other people on there but I’ve taken a detox for a while as my mental health was suffering comparing my life to others, and seeing when I don’t get enough engagements or likes or retweets I delete the post, and seeing all the groups of people talking and interacting with each other on there and me with nobody it just makes me feel more alone. Hopefully I can sort things out but some advice would be great. Thanks"

973,Can longterm use of anti-depressants cause Alzheimer's disease?,"I read that there is a scoring system (anti cholinergic burden scale) for drugs for their potential to cause dementia and it included drugs like anti -allergic, anti -depressants etc. If so then why are anti-depressants so routinely prescribed?"
974,I am torn.,"I am lost. I feel like I’ve been dropped into someone else’s life. Someone much stronger than I. She has a wonderful life, but I cannot handle it. How did I get here, in her spot? I am ruining it all for her because I am breaking under the slightest stresses. I feel like a cheap imposter.

Some days, I will wake up, and I actually am her! She’s so optimistic, and she can handle anything that comes her way. She gets shit done. People love her. I really like those days. I sit back and watch her live her life. I am at peace on those days. On the other hand, there are an increasing number of days where I cannot find her in me. Or rather my presence is smothering her. 

I know this sounds like crazy talk. I am *so very well aware* of that. Am I thinking this is actually happening, or am I pretending there is someone else in this body? Why do I differentiate between us, as if she is the hero and I the monster? I feel like these days where I am moody and lethargic, lazy and worthless, angry and pent up - this is me. I don’t know how else to describe it. This is who I am. 

The happy girl is appearing less and less often. I wish I could reach out to her. She’s needed.

We share memories. It pains her when she remembers the days where I am in control. I know she’s terrified of not returning every time she goes to sleep. When did we split into two personalities, though? Neither of us can recall. We only began recognizing that there was “someone else” recently, but we both remember times this could have been caught sooner.

I don’t want to exist. I want her to succeed. She can’t overpower me, though. There’s too much of me. I keep growing. I think it makes her shrink. No matter how sorry I am, I can’t fix this. There is something wrong with me. I want her to take over. I don’t know how to help her. I don’t know if I’m capable.

Lately, I’ve been the one piloting. She has popped up on only two occasions in the past several weeks. I don’t know what the trigger is to get her to come out. I don’t know if I am the one actually getting triggered out or what that trigger may be for me.

I know when she remembers that I wrote this, she’ll laugh it off nervously and delete it. She tries to deny that I exist and that I will come back.

I am drowning. Overwhelmed with negative emotions. It’s all I can do to shelter the residual hope she carries to be able to make it to the next day she’s in charge. The less often she’s here, the smaller that flame is. How am I supposed to carry on her life when I can’t motivate myself to even consume food when hungry? I’ve ruined her career, making her change jobs at least 4 times in the last year alone by believing that I don’t belong anywhere. I’ve damaged her relationships, casting doubts on her friends’ true feelings towards this vessel. I am paranoid, afraid, anxious. A deer in headlights. I shut down. The only reason I can carry out some of her responsibilities is that she has a few amazing friends and a very devoted husband that try to help.

When she is afraid in the moment, she acknowledges it and finds a way to work around it. She keeps moving forward with her life despite the fact that I am here and making it a mess for her. 

Please help her, please help. Please.

We take 40mg of Fluoxetine. We switched from the otc-Zoloft near the middle of last year. She tried changing because the sex drive shut down. It has not been revived. She’s also tried different birth controls to no effect in that regard (going from daily pill to quarterly shots to an arm implant over the last few years). I think the initial depression med switch worsened my situation, meaning that I am here more often. Due to the pandemic, she has refrained from talking with her usual medical care provider since we are not suicidal. Because of financial reasons, she stopped visiting her therapist. Neither of them know there are two of us because we did not recognize each other when she was visiting them regularly.

What can I do? We live in the US. 

Thank you for your time, whether you are able to help or not. If you could refrain from saying something mean, I’d appreciate that as well. I know I am seriously mentally ill. In my current status, I feel like I can’t do anything more than post this."
975,Tiny and random nerve influx,"Hi, it's my first post here and I would appreciate any answer of professional or experience based. Also I'm not sure that this problem is related to mental or physical condition. Hence I'm not sure if it is the right forum.

(english isn't my main language thanks for your effort). 

At first, I don't have any major mental health problem but I do have a recurrent problem which might have deeper root. When I'm facing an emotional content (such as someone playing a slow and  melancholyc piano partition, or a specific scene in a movie) I do have a sharp nerve influx affecting one part of my body and causing a short, but fast uncontrolled and unpredictable movement. It also cause an unpleasant feeling due to those aspects. Those influx are causing movement to my finger and my feet but it also happens to my arms, shoulder or knee (once at a time).

I would like to understand where it is coming from. If this might be related to any physical condition issue, and if you have already encounter such ""symptom"" ?

978,Easiest way to self harm?,"I'm constantly thinking about how to self harm but it's getting hard getting my hands on blades and fire. I think tonight I'm going to I'm going to take my dad's sharpest knife and just get hacking and then wrap it up in some gauze and just wear hoodies until they heal better. I just wanted to know if you guys have any recommendations on a type of knife? How deep should I cut, I don't want to cut a tendon or muscle. What angle? Aftercare?"
979,Why am I scared of pregnancy? Possible abuse triggers,"
I’m a f19, raised in America- for some quick background info that’s probably relevant. 

     I’ve dated 4 guys in my life, each relationship lasting longer than 6 months. The first two were really simple, mainly cute fluffy stuff you’d expect from early teens like handholding and regular kissing. The relationship after those was abusive. The guy was a narcissist, and emotionally/ sexually abusive to me. The sexual abuse was mainly coercion. I said no to him 30 times until he took my defeated silence as a yes type of thing. I was with him for almost three years before breaking up with him for someone else (who I’m still with and makes me feel super safe and happy :) ). While dating the abuser is when I started getting super paranoid about my periods and when they’d start. Even though we never really did anything that would get me pregnant, I always became super scared right before it would start. I used to do really destructive stuff like eat as many vitamin c pills as possible (makes hormones wack), or punch myself in the gut. I get urges to do that still, but haven’t in awhile. I’m confused as to why I still get like that now, almost two years later. 

     My Cycle is kinda irregular, I’m only on the day 30 Mark when my average is like 28-32. Today’s been really Bad. I haven’t done anything sexual since before my last period, and even before that I hadn’t done anything without some form of protection (condoms, but even with condoms my bf didn’t like. cum in me). But I’m still very almost obsessively paranoid I’m pregnant, even though it’s basically impossible.

   Why am I like this? Does anyone have any advice or insight? Thanks"
980,I need tips.,"      I don't know how to start this and I'm sorry. I've been random bursts of panic for a while now. I could be at work and I start to panic ,it doesn't get to bad most of the time but sometimes I have to go somewhere that makes me feel safe and or alone so I can calm down. I don't think I have a panic disorder or anything  because u haven't been diagnosed with anything. I would like to know if there is anything I can do when these busts of panic happen that could make me calm down. I'm sorry if I worded things strangely and if this post made anyone upset."
981,Working from home helped my mental health (mostly social anxiety) and now I'm having a hard time getting back into working at an office.,"I struggle with social anxiety, which has always been worst for me at work and school. I also have a learning disability (if that helps), unfortunately it's not well defined. Getting to work from home helped me so much and now that I am back in an office I feel like a complete mess. Whereas, I used to only have panic attacks before work on Mondays and Sundays nights now it's almost every single drive to work, which feels downright dangerous. I dread going to bed and knowing I'll be waking up to go straight to work (I leave at 5:30 am to beat the traffic because I live 40+ miles away from work, moving is NOT an option, and I've tried getting up earlier but I just can't do it). I work all day on the computer which is perfect for me but I know I would work better if I was still working from home. Anytime someone comes over to me to have a chat it throws me off and I have a hard time getting back into my work. I get why my boss wants me in the office because I'm a newer employee. I've tried multiple SSRIs and they make my heart beat like crazy in the morning and I get irregular heart beats from them. I already meditate and practice yoga. I'm just not sure what else to do. Please help."
982,Not sure if I should go back to my therapist,"During my last appointment (on Zoom) my therapist really rubbed me the wrong way. There were a few problems I had with our session.

The first problem was that I felt like I couldn’t get a word in. It started out fine but then every time I said anything about what I’m currently going through, she would launch into a long (and I mean long) story about what she’s been going through. A few times she interrupted me to tell a story about her self. 

Another problem was when she snapped at me. I was talking about my religion (I’m Christian and I believe faith can relate to mental health) and how my views sometimes differ from others in my religious community and that can put me in stressful situations. I gave an example of something I interpreted differently and she immediately said the type of stuff others in my religion have said to me and she seemed mad. (The topic was gay marriage and her comment makes it seem like she’s against it). I thought that was unprofessional. This isn’t a place to debate religious views. It’s my therapy session!

The last issue is her communication. I accidentally missed our next zoom session because my days were mixed up since there’s so little structure in the week now. It was weird she didn’t call because for all she knew something could’ve happened to my WiFi. But I decided to just email her to explain my situation and ask to reschedule. No response for a week. So I text her. No response for three days. Eventually she responds “we’ll be in touch.” The response just felt odd to me.

I’m not sure what I should do. Should I schedule another session or find another therapist when I can. I’m on the fence and was hoping this would help. Also, idk if this matters, but I’m mostly going to her for diagnosis so I can eventually be medicated. It’s not much of a ‘dig up past trauma’ thing."
983,What harm can too much medicine cause to you ?,"So, I'm 23 years old, and I'm diagnosed as bipolar unspecified. And I take 5 different kinds of medication:
Lithium (1200mg )
Trifluoperazine (10 mg, before it was 15 mg, and he said he never used that dose for a bipolar person, only schizophrenics )
Buspirone ( 90 mg, the maximum recommend dosage is 60mg ) 
Lyrica (450 mg) 
Alprazolam ( 0,625 mg , it was 1,5 mg before)
And also bromazepam ( 30 drops in case of a crisis) 
I didn't always took this many medicine, it got there from a history of drug abuse.
But what I wanna know is what harm can be caused from taken too many meds ?"
984,About thinking all the time of a person,"(all of this through text and calls, because of the coronavirus) About a month ago, the girl I like told me she thought she liked me back, and throughout the month we were sending cute and loving messages to each other. And one of the things that fulfilled me the most was that, one night, she told me I was really making her night, that normally she'd be crying or just in pain (that time of month), but that that night she was hugging a pillow and making noises and kicking with her legs for the things i was saying to her. But a few days ago, she started to reply to the loving things I said to her with less passion (to say in some way), and I'm afraid I can't make her as happy as before. And we talk less because she's really stressed with her studies. And yesterday she said she was in pain cause it was beginning to be that time of month again. And I still say those things to her, but now she doesn't reply with the same feeling as before and can't help but think that it has something to do with me. It probably does not, but my mind doesn't work that way. And I think it's because both her studies and that time of month again, but in worried cause a month ago I was able to make her happy with what I said to her, and I'm really afraid and stressed about the fact that I think I'm not being able to do it now. And I can't stop thinking about it, it's making me be distracted throughout the whole day. And I'm stressed that I'm not being able to make her as happy..."
985,How can I restore my life back to the path of success? |31M|,"

Hi there friends I'm looking for advice. I am 31, unemployed since 2018, around the time I completed my undergraduate degree. I graduated with honors. I just couldn't find myself in the world and I had savings and today I live with my grandmother and help her around the house. Plus I was recently diagnosed with a chronic illness that I am just now learning to live with.

I want to hear tips on how to rebuild my life at such an advanced age and despite my poor resume. I live in a very small town, I have no money to leave and one of my problems here is that I feel that my reputation is completely destroyed, people see me not working, walking alone on nights in the city, everyone thinks I am already lost. Some people even today don't say hi to me on the street and pretend they don't know me. Everyone forgot that I was a successful person and social in the past, I have probably too. How can I restore my life back to the path of success? I feel a joke."
986,How do I stop being obsessed with snapchat streaks?,"I have an unhealthy addiction to snapchat streaks.

Not in the way that I have one with a million people, only really 10-ish, but like, I feel like I can't lose them, like once I see that hour glass I get really bad anxiety, and I hate it and I don't know why.

I didn't use to, but now I feel like I do.

A lot of them are with high school friends, and in my head, because I don't see my friends anymore, snapchat is the way that I feel like we're still connecting. But like, I don't think I could name all of my streaks, like there's some people who I haven't talked to ,but because our streak is 1k days I'm like oh I have to keep it. Even if I haven't talked to the person in a year.

Then there's the people who go to my college, currently, that I have streaks with, and I care a lot about them too. And some friends are graduating, so I know that it will be lost eventually, so I'm in a tough place, do I just break it now, or wait for them to break it? Because I know it will inevitably be lost.

I just hate that I see the hourglass and I get really anxious, not anxiety attack anxious, but like, butterflies, heart palpations, sweaty palms etc. 

And I hate it, but I don't know how to get it to go away.

I know the obvious answer is just break them, but like, I don't know. And I know the other people definitely don't care about it at all.

And it's not like I put thought into them either, I just go down the list ""click click click"" and hit send same photo to everyone, except for some people when we actually talk through our streaks, but like.

I just hate that I care so much about losing them"
987,Struggling to think positively,"Hi, I suffer with anxiety and depression. Lately i’ve been struggling a lot to keep a positive mindset. Its like as soon as anything happens, my negative mind completely rules over the positive side, and its really overwhelming. I dont like to feel self-pitying but my first reaction to anything negative is literal worst case scenario. This is causing a massive strain on friendships/relationships. i’ve done my best to try to change,  done CBT &amp; DBT, tried meditation, grounding exercises etc. Literally nothing seems to be working, its such a struggle to have a good day and I really want to change this as theres so many good moments I am missing out on due to my mindset. Im really struggling to make friends / maintain them also due to this. Please if anyone has any advice on how to stop these thought processes it would be much appreciated.

Also if anyone is going through anything similar (or just needs a chat)  feel free to drop a message :)"
988,"I don’t know how to move on from my abusive past, and from mistakes I have made.","I’ve posted my story on reddit so many times. But I can’t figure out how to move on.

I’m 18 years old, and I grew up through some really messed up situations. Throughout my whole life, my dad has been emotionally abusive. He’s had so many affairs with my mom growing up, and has threatened to leave numerous times. 

My parents were extremely rough on me growing up also. They practically forced me to work from the age of eleven, doing labor type work etc.

I also grew up homeschooled and basically socially isolated.

They’ve also done sexual things in front of me one time when I was young. Which I don’t know if that is considered sexual abuse, but I know it had to have messed me up. 

On top of this, my mom did some weird things to me also. She sexually touched me a few times when I was young. 

And she used to make me do things that were just strange, like put on her bra, messaging her etc. however she used to say she was on heavy medication that caused her to do weird things. She is sick with some health conditions so...

At the time these things happened, I didn’t know what was normal. So I didn’t realize until recently how much of toxicity I went through.

I know these things messed me up mentally, and as a result, I had incest and voyeurism type fantasies throughout my teenage years. And I eventually acted on them as well. 

I used to peek at my mom in the shower, go through her underwear drawers, and I ended up groping her one time. I also used to spy on my parents have sex too.

At the time I groped her, when I was 15, she had kind of changed, and she reacted badly. And told me how wrong it was. 

On top of this, she says she doesn’t remember doing the things that I know she did to me when I was younger. I don’t know if she is denying it, or if she actually doesn’t remember because of the medication she was on. But I know these things happened. 

Anyways, I don’t really have these problems anymore. I stopped at around 17 years old, (I’m 18 almost 19 now). And I think I can safely say I’m a different person than I was a year ago. This is because now I just don’t feel the urge to do those things anymore. And now I realize how wrong it was. And I feel really guilty for it.

Of course, I still have issues, I am not okay. But I think I’ve managed to completely stop the voyeurism and incest problems. I still have fantasies, not of my mom, but I still have the voyeurism and incest fetishes. However, I feel like I can trust myself not to act on them anymore.

And I feel good about that. But I don’t know how to move on from the things they did to me, and the things I did. 

I really hate my parents for it, because I feel like they are the reason I became so messed up in the head. 

Furthermore, I want to distance myself from my parents. This is because I’m not comfortable around them, and I just really hate them. I don’t think I can forgive them for the things they did to me. 

And I’m not justifying anything I did, I still hate myself for the things that I did. I just feel like they are the reasons why I did these things in the first place.

I just want to move on with my life, but I don’t know how. I’m now worried about my parents telling others and/or reporting it to the police in the future.

The reason I’m worried about this is because they have two sides. When I start to cut ties, they’re obviously going to lose it. And I feel like they’ll do it out of spite.

If that happens, then I feel like it’s over for me. Everyone will hate me, and I’d might as well kill myself. 

And I feel like, just because I’m a guy, and because of how manipulative they are, no one would believe me about the things they did to me. 

So in all, I don’t know how to move on and forgive myself for the things I did, and move on from the past. And I also don’t know what I’m going to do in the future. 

What if my parents do tell others and/or report me to the police for what I did. I can always tell others and report them for what they did to me. But who would ever believe me? 

I feel like I’m just reaching a dead end. And I don’t know what to do. All I want is to live a normal life and move on. But I’m worried I won’t experience that. 

I’m trying to follow my passions, and see where they take me. I want to start a music career. Or go to cosmetology school. But I’m constantly thinking “What’s the point in all of this, when I’m just reaching a dead-end in my life.”

I really don’t know what to do, and I can’t afford any mental help as of right now. And there’s no free help that I know of where I live.  

Sorry for this super long post. I just need to vent, and I feel like it’s best for me to do it anonymously."
989,My therapists moved clinics,"I've been seeing my therapist for almost a year now. I really like her. We've built up a good working relationship. But a month ago she decided to move to a new agency. She told me twice a week would be possible at this agency, but it'd be almost double the price. I was okay with that. But when I moved over with her, she told me that the clinic has a policy against letting their therapists do more than once a week. I needed twice a week, especially now with the quarantine. But mostly I just feel hurt by the limitation. 

She does other things for the clinic, like running an expensive  intensive out patient group. This place doesn't have a good reputation. So I immediately thought they limit the amount of times she can see her patients in a week so that those patients sign up for one of their more expensive programs. The more patients she can take on, the more people they can push into those things. On the other hand most of her time is spent doing the IOP. So they'd want her to be able to handle as many clients as possible. But what's the point in taking on as many clients as she can if she can't help them to the extent that they view they require? 

I've brought up my concerns, but she's never acknowledged that it's a bad situation, let alone apologize for putting me in it. I know two things can be true at the same time. I don't think she did anything wrong by moving to a place they'll pay her more. But she's a person in my life, and her actions effect me. The most I've gotten is an ""I'm sorry this made you feel this way"" which everyone knows is a non apology. I'm not sure if it's part of her philosophy regarding therapy, or a company rule that keeps her from acknowledging how this has effected me. 

I don't want to switch therapists. but she has a conflict of interest on this topic, and it's effecting me negatively. How is she supposed to validate when she's and her bosses caused the problem?I couldn't even find someone else now if I wanted to. And I don't want to leave this relationship feeling betrayed and angry. 

I don't know what to do."
990,Tired of feeling.,"I'm tired. 

I shouldn't be writing while I'm feeling anxious (I'll probably read this in the morning feeling like an overreacting embarrassment). 

I contacted my GP in February to set up therapy after dealing with mental health issues due to childhood trauma (I'm 22 now). 

The problem is that my 1st session will begin in 1 month and 4 days (yes I'm counting haha). I'm just tired of feeling crap. I'm tired having breakdowns. I'm tired of feeling like I'm messing up everything in life. I'm tired of not having control over my emotions and thoughts.

I've been procrastinating (on purpose) with finishing of an assignment for work, because I'm terrified of being given a higher position/responsibility over people (which is inevitable when I turn the assignment in).

I don't have healthy coping mechanisms (basically waste all my money on food or things that make me feel happy in for a small moment, till the next breakdown comes or sleep/ be in bed all day and not eat, take care of myself).

...I don't even know why I'm writing this. 

Can anyone relate?"
991,My partner has completely changed,"We’ve been together for over 5 years and only in the last few months has he really been honest about how bad his mental health has been.

Once he got home and we talked he told me his feelings for me don’t feel real anymore.

I don’t expect anyone here to help or to fix everything but I’m at my wits end. I’m doing everything in my power to help him but he’s really starting to slip down a path I don’t want to see him go down."
992,Wanting to see a therapist during Covid-19,Hello! I am currently living in Washington state around the north Tacoma area. I was wondering if there were any resources that could guide me so i can see a therapist or psychiatrist. I’m not sure where to look and google search results are confusing to sort through and in not sure where they even offer these sorts of things especially during the pandemic. I just don’t really have an idea where to start so i would love some suggestions or recommendations! Thank you in advance.
993,Wanting to start antidepressants,"I'm currently seeing a therapist I really like but I want to start taking antidepressants (I'm feeling stuck and i think medication could assist with what I'm going through and processing)

Also-- if i start them do I have to tell her Im on them?"
994,Starting to think I'm actually going crazy,"Hey, Friends!

Have a trigger warning: schizophrenia!

Apologies for the big-ass wall of text.  Part of my reasoning for writing this was just to get my thoughts down, and I never know what is relevant information, but I'm very interested in what anyone else has to say about it as well, considering it's caused me a good deal of anxiety.

At the very least, I hope it makes for an interesting read!

Thanks!

\-

I've been dealing with some mild-yet-constant dissociation for a few years now, and was eventually told I needed to be checked out for schizophrenia.  That sent me into a downward spiral where I scared myself into thinking I was seeing and hearing things (they were actually just eye floaters and sounds that others could hear but ignored) and started dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts about the government being after me (part of me knew it was absurd, and my therapist and psych told me it was just my thoughts scaring me, which made sense).

Once I had my EOF with the psych, I was told that I was in the clear with schizophrenia!  I had some anxiety (which is normal for me), but all-in-all, I had a *really* good two months: got back into some projects that I'd been putting off, started getting into some physical activities, and even left this sub (for myself; the sub itself is fantastic).  Hell, I hadn't even been too worried about COVID, which is really interesting, considering my primary diagnosis was hypochondria (and some mild OCD).

About a week or two ago, though, shit hit the fan.

About two years ago, when I was speaking to my therapist, I noticed her face seemed distorted.  It freaked me out a bit, but it only lasted a fraction of a second, so I wrote it off.  However, over time, the fear of that episode became way more intrusive.  I worried that it was a legit hallucination, that I was developing schizophrenia, and so on.  My therapist/psych said it was likely just some weird trick of the eye, likely caused by fatigue or something like that, but over the past two weeks, it's been so hard to write off as a one-off bit of weirdness, and has caused a lot of anxiety.  I eventually mentioned it to my wife, and she said that she's dealt with that before.  That was comforting, but...

I had happened to read that delusions can form as a result of hallucinations; something weird happens, and a weird explanation is created by the brain.  Because I am nothing short of the biggest dummy on the planet, I actually went out of my way to think ""what if her face seemed distorted because she's actually a monster?"".  This stupid-ass thought has stuck with me to this day.

Part of me is able to recognize that this isn't right, but asking myself ""do you actually believe this"" causes my brain to lock up and not answer the question.  This has left me with a few options:

- I don't believe it, it's just an intrusive thought that I'm giving way too much power to.
- I do believe it, but I'm able to recognize that it's not normal
- I believe it fully and consider it ""normal""

I can't tell if I'm anxious with a bit of insight, or delusional with a good deal of insight that will decrease over time, and that's both frightening and infuriating.  Not to mention the thought of her being a monster itself is frightening: how do you argue against something that is borderline unprovable and unfalsifiable?  (""Oh, you can't see the monster?  That's because they only appear to me.""  Etc.)

I'm honestly not sure how to end this, so we'll call this good."

I am in my early 40s and I am going through what I can assume is a mid-life crisis/sadness. I am in a happy relationship with a loving family and a high paying steady white-collar job. But, working a corporate job has been soul-sucking. The thought of doing this for the rest of my life is giving me nightmares.

I am afraid of being a failure in the corporate world because I have never been good at the rat race. The point of my life seems to be working for billionaires and making them more money.

I’m regretting a lot of things and keep remembering every embarrassing thing I did my entire life, it won’t stop I can’t stop crying.

My mom is the only one in the house that makes money and we do okay but I feel more and more like a leech every day, any happiness I feel feels unearned, I find myself fantasizing about killing myself, or dying in some heroic way as to somehow justify me dying. I like to listen to music and daydream of magical worlds and made up stories, more and more I find myself in my own head. I just keep getting older and older and my life is passing me by. My girlfriend and I clean the house to try and pull our own weight but even then it doesn't feel like enough, there was always something more we could do... My grandfather came over about a week or two ago, I had told my mom I would weed the yard and mow for a game, she let me buy it ahead of time because I rarely don't go through with a job I was paid to do. I stayed up that night playing that game so when morning came my sister called my grandfather and had him bring over the weed wacker and lawn mower, at this point I had been up much longer than I should've been and said ""Can you leave the lawn mower and weed wacker in the back so I can take care of it when I wake up?"" he said ""no, it'll rain tomorrow, you ain't tired, you just don't want to do it"", I had said something to the effect of ""no, I've been up for 24 hours"", he said ""okay, I'll remember that"", and did the work himself with my sister while I slept... It broke my heart, I felt like and continue to feel like shit. I can't help but think I'd be better off somewhere else, someplace where I can't burden no-one... anyways, if you've made it this far, thanks for listening."
1002,Propanolol not quite doing it,"Hey team,

1003,A long toxic childhood,"
Trigger warning: sexual abuse, animal abuse, physical abuse, rape, drugs



I’m very sorry it’s so long a lot has happened. How my mother grew up her mother (my grandma) was an alcoholic and father (deceased grandfather) was physically abusive maybe sexually she is diagnosed bpd. She grew up rich but having an abusive childhood she went through a rebellious stage at 18. She fell in love with a good man but her father wouldn’t allow it with him. So she turned around and picked the biggest loser she could a coke dealer she knew they dated they used then she got pregnant my mother was disowned you her father(that’s how my older half brother came to be) so they married because of it and after 6 months divorced. 3 years later she meets my father at a bar they marry a couple years into marriage they have me. So it’s my mom my father my half brother me in a house.

My grandma divorced her father a year later he dies all the money he had disappeared in medical bills trying to save him as long as possible. 

Now I’m switching to my POV. My father was nice to my mother few years and then physically abusive not allowing her to have a job if she got a job he would go to her work and get her fired sit in the waiting room menacingly till boss says we can’t allow this. I remember us having to walk to preschool because he wouldn’t allow us to drive because he didn’t want us to have a chance to leave. He was physically abusive toward me and my brother as well type to hide bruises. I just though it was normal for men to be a**holes as a little kid like I thought it was biological. 

I had started displaying weird health issues around 4 hypnagogic hallucinations (at night always) often like I would be getting attacked in my bedroom at night it’s like a night terror times 5 I would appear wide awake and horrified that something was going to hurt me or it would actually look like something was attacking me this went on often till I was like 12 but it happened less frequently after I was maybe 9. My family genuinely worried I might have been possessed. I was also a really bad bed wetter. My mother slept with me in my bed till I was like 7 she said it was because the night terrors later on she told me it was she was so afraid of being alone in a room with my father. He would also beat our dogs.  

I know my brother was molested by him and my mother was raped I don’t talk about it with them because it’s not my place to take them back to that I never saw any of that but upon being told at 12 I wasn’t surprised at all.I don’t know if anything happened to me I don’t remember. I was molested by a neighbor hood girl when I was in kindergarten garden and a female babysitter slept with my brother those are the only other incidents I know about. 

One night after a bad beating I begged my mom to divorce him when I was 6 and she wasn’t able to do it till a year later but she still let him have visitation. He did kidnap me once a few days through my bedroom window. Mom didn’t do anything about after a few days he basically left me at a place by a fountain and told her to pick me up because he didn’t know what he was doing. He would often break into the house when we weren’t there and leave presents. 

My mother got remarried to a man 1 year after the divorce with my father and being 8 and wanting my dad to finally leave I played up a bond with the new guy even though I really disliked him. The first time I met this second guy I told him he didn’t belong here. But in front of my father I pretended to really like him because I knew he needed like a final push to go away and it worked. 

So my mother eventually married this second guy and after a year he is really abusive toward me as well I can’t do anything right I get screamed at about 4 hours a day daily. I would be force fed fermented food I was allergic to. I almost spend no time in the house I was always out with friends for about 5 years because I knew whatever I did I would be screamed at. I’ve been screamed at for drinking a glass of water wrong, for smiling, eating anything and every time I was yelled at I would sit on the stairs and blankly stare at him the whole time. 

Mother divorced 2nd guy 4 years in for being unemployed a year. Our home got foreclosed on even though we paid rent but it turned out the person we paid hadn’t paid mortgage in 6 months so my mom left the decision on me what to do at 12 I said let’s move back to our home state we atleast have family there to fall back on if things go bad my brother stayed in that state in the west being almost 18. 

We went back to the East. Upon coming back My mom got back in touch with loser friends from when she was young and on drugs she did cocaine again and totaled an expensive truck the only thing she got in the divorce. Then she got clean but drank often dating any loser she could from the time I was 13 to 17 she dated a heroin addict seen the stuff and needles in the home, a former crack head that I caught drinking our Mouth wash, a guy that wanted to ship me off to boarding school, one guy she also paid rent to but would try to pressure her into bjs if she didn’t pay on time,  2 other losers that’s all I know about and almost always they lived with us as well. Every bad relationship i begged her why are you doing this like don’t put your hand on the stove and she’s slam that hand on the stove. 

I started smoking weed at 14 and did it off and on in my teens till I was 20 I’d do it a year quit a year or 2 do it again a year so on. 
I was left alone at home like 5 days of the week after 16 was getting food from the food bank then I started cooking for myself at 12. She pressured me into going to college basically go to college or I kick you out so I went for something I didn’t care about didn’t drop out went for one term and did poorly surprise surprise at 18 when I wasn’t ready. I was working part time but it turned into full time and doing that on top of classes I didn’t want to take. 

She had 2,000 dollars worth of bills tied to my name because she had my SSN and I also had the student loan debt I think it was 3,000 upon moving out I left at 19 I basically had to beg someone I dated a year to move in and they let me. It’s 4 years later and it’s hard to see how anything is salvageable. 

My mom acts like I’m her sister, she’s always acted that way and I don’t hold her accountable for anything. I treat her like one because I know she can’t handle it. My father also never went convicted. I have no relationship with my brother because I think we were both just trying to live that we didn’t get to know each other we love each other but we can go without talking years on end. I feel like I have to pretend to be happy about my situation growing up when I’m around my grandma because she’s 70 and would likely take my mother’s side on anything and I don’t want to lie so I don’t like being around her even though I do love her despite her still being an alcoholic. She’s lonely and I don’t know how to spend time with my grandma. Even me and my mom agree she didn’t do a good job but let’s not lie about it anymore. I have no idea if any of this is salvageable or how to feel about my family. I know I’m making it sound like I’m a victim and everyone suffered. I just feel I got incredibly unlucky in the birth lotto. I’m doing as ok as I can be now I have cptsd and visual snow syndrome from the blows to the head so I have abstract hallucinations daily when I get tired don’t drink or smoke not that I every did super heavily . I have someone I love and a dog."
1004,I miss my apathy.,"8 years ago, I was mostly hollow. No feelings, no cares, no morals. I was abused as a kid but won’t get into it. I was taught emotions were wrong and not to show any. 

Some days, I miss the apathy. I miss the feeling of being so hollow. I didn’t care about anyone or anything. My emotions never guided me because I didn’t have them. 

And then, like every good story, I met *him*. 

Except this time, it’s non fiction. 


He really did change everything, for the better. But I can’t help but hate who I am now sometimes. I went from feeling nothing to letting myself feel **everything**. I hate it."
1005,All I want is to try and sleep,"Okay so like I struggle with sleeping, how I struggle depends on the mood I'm in whether I sleep too much or too little bit right now I can't sleep at all so I was trying to use white noise as this calms me down but I keep getting voices in the white noise which aren't actually there and it's so annoying."

1008,Is taking meds the only way to relieve myself off of stress and anxiety due to grad school work?,"I tried eveything, meditation, drinking some weird herbs, trying to not think about it, etc. But the anxiety is ALWAYS there every second of every day from the moment I wake up.

I took some benzos from my friend and they help a lot for the few times I took them but I don't want to keep taking them. But then again it seems there is no  way out."
1009,I can't even think about the future.,I get this feeling of despair whenever someone discusses the future with me. My parents were talking about colleges with me earlier and I just shut down. I'm completely convinced that I'll die before I even graduate high school.
1010,Is this normal?,"This is going to be interesting to talk about. But who cares? Mhm... I’ve noticed things as I get older. Certain things. I’ve always been quite a cold person. Use to kill cats and fish. Hurt dogs and tortured frogs, turtles and bugs. That was when I was younger. After I stoped killing stuff at around age 10 I became very interested with burning stuff. Be it cooking bugs alive, burning toys, melting plastic etc. I’ve always loved risking myself and others. I don’t care much. Yes. I care but I don’t feel bad? If I where to bomb a car and innocents died then who cares? It was on them not to run. Whatever. At the wrong place at the wrong time I guess. You see, getting older I became very attracted to manipulation and bullying. I was a bully up until 12 and a manipulator up until now. Adulthood. It started by turning my peer’s life’s around for the worse. Convincing them to be my friend only to take what they held close and ruin them. It was always fun. It was something to do instead of being bored all day. But when I reached 14 things got weird. I manipulated adults by faking emotions. Being nice, or innocent meanwhile I was doing “bad things.” I have ALWAYS gotten out of trouble because I know how to pretend and lie. 14 is when the lying and emotion stuff got more real. But getting older I’ve been drawn to hurting again. I’ve done some bad things just so I can stop doing everything and theorizing against the government or making stories in my head. “Bad things” like sex, cutting myself open, drugs, drinking blah blah fucking boring. You get the gist. You see, some may say this is antisocial. But here is the thing. It isn’t. I feel emotions. I get angry and I feel joy. I get stressed, I get annoyed, get happy, get sad. I feel things. These emotions are very light and never stay, they quickly fade no matter what feeling. I do care for people. If someone is hurt I’ll help. But I have never had an empathetic feeling. I usually laugh or am highly entertained when people are struggling. But I feel stuff. Sometimes... I think. Either way, is this normal? I’ve never talked about it before and I don’t enjoy getting close enough to understand others. (I don’t care much and hate having friends.)"
1011,I become sexually aroused from killing innocent civilians in video games.," Is there something wrong with me? Is this normal? I swear I'm not a violent person IRL, nor do I ever wish to harm anybody IRL or have any impulses. So what's going on here?"
1012,I just want to understand how I’m feeling,I really crave affection from a partner but anytime someone tries to be affectionate I immediately shut down and reject their advances. It’s as if I get really anxious and want to flee. However when it’s someone who could be less interested I try really really hard to win them over. It’s very frustrating because I see it happen but I can’t explain it. It’s like a body reaction. does anyone else feel this way?
1013,What should I do when know I’m going to die?,"It’s a hard thing to talk about but my sister killed herself and my mother is in prison. When you know you are going to end up like them, how do you stop from killing your self? I mean, it makes sense."
1014,Hey guys am I a nonce ???,So there was this girl on this dating app on her account she said she was 18 and  I am 19 so like I believed it and like she’s from America and I’m from the uk and we got talking Ended up talking really sexual with her thinking she was 18 yeah stupid me sent her my penis cuz we was like role playing but I got spooked and stuff and like what if she is not actually 18 what if she’s lying will I get in trouble with the police ? Because she never said she wasn’t under 18 I asked her how old she was was she said what do you think ?

1015,I have multiple unknown things going on inside my mental life and I have no idea why I'm experiencing any of them,"I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as I can but I apologize if it ends up being long - please read this, I need some help. 

I guess I'll start off by saying I heard voices in my head when I was 16, I'm now 17 and the voices had been gone for a good few months but recently (about 2-3 weeks ago) have come back but feel very different. This time it feels like there's more trickery involved in it, I only hear the voice when I'm occupied at something else so I brush it off as mishearing the music or something. But it also makes me feel like people are behind me when they aren't, or that a door is opening when it isn't. Whenever there's a window open or something it's the only thing my mind can focus on - I can feel something inside me yelling at me to close the window and it doesn't stop until I do. And another weird thing is I get very angry and irritated when people look at me, I *constantly* feel like everybody's eyes are on me and I hate it so much. 

Second thing is I have been experiencing extreme sensitivity with everything and extremely sudden lash outs of anger. My ex girlfriend who I recently broke up with replied to my little witty joke in the group chat with calling me some silly name and I took it so personally as some deep hate towards me and it instantly got so sad and angry and began to feel like I can't do this anymore and Im not cut out for living the life I'm in right now. My friends have been sending me very brief messages and i start to feel so hated and no one wants to be my friend and I just need to isolate myself from everyone. It's so extreme and I have no idea why. 

I have also recently only started to realise I have been staring a lot recently, as in I totally stop whatever I'm doing and I start to stare in front of me and I don't even realise I'm staring, it's like I'm totally unconscious because I don't see what I'm staring at either. It's like I exit the world for a second. I did it today when I was eating and when I was walking down the stairs. 

Lastly, I feel something is inside of me, controlling me to a certain degree. It's especially when I have nothing to really entertain me and I'm sitting idle I feel this thing inside me come out and it makes me feel a certain way and think certain ways and it isn't me controlling it. I can feel my real feeling and thoughts in like a dark corner and they have been pushed aside and something else takes hold of me.

I can go into more detail on an area if people want, I tried to keep it brief because I know people don't read very long posts and I really would like some help so I kept it short(ish)"
1016,i just need someone to listen and share music with,i dont have anyone in my life. im completely alone. just share some music with me please.
1017,"dumb question, but do you care if your friends are LBGT?","I've yet to come out to my friend since I never know when a good time to is, unless I'm asked about being single (etc).

I usually tell people after a class is over and we hang out beyond school to tell in case it makes it awkward but I dunno. 

They have shared themselves dealing with MDD with me and while I know that can't be easy, I still have this uneasiness coming out to people of the same sex.

A majority of the people I've told have been cool with it (only two people cut me out, but it wasn't too bad)."
1018,Anyone else have that light bulb moment where you’re basically like “I’m part of the problem. I should get help.”?,"Seems a little weird to be asking this but I feel like a light bulb went on in my head very recently and helped me realize that I needed to really give a long, hard look at myself. When I did, I realized that apart from being raised in a toxic environment, (which contributed to my poor mental health), I never really did anything about my mental health. For some reason up until now, (I suppose not being in a household that never really acknowledged mental health contributed to that) I thought it was normal to be negative, angry, rude, mean, sad, anxious.,etc like 24/7 to people I love, classmates,strangers., etc. Being alone with my thoughts with not much to keep me busy (thanks, quarantine), made me realize that it wasn’t normal. I started to think about all the times I’ve wronged people. And all the times people have wronged me. I was so shocked to realize I was this person. It’s almost scary to think how emotionally driven my actions were. Logic never seemed to play a part. Until now. I’m finding it pretty darn hard to move on and forgive myself but I’m pretty hopeful about building a more positive future. It’s just a very “damn, I used to suck and I didn’t even know it” kind of moment."
1019,Slow descent,"Friends, goodbye, i love you all
My mother, father, thank you for trying
The world beyond is where our promise breaks
This whole time you’ve been friends with a charlatan
What do you know?

I only live in service of my own twisted ego
Living in hell, surely paying some past due
That’s where we all went wrong
There is no more force to be
I’ve lived what has to be lived
To stay would be another punchline
And don’t you know, a joke can only carry one!

Some people aren’t born to stay
Only to feel the sunshine for a minute
Then back into the cold puddle we go
What was money anyway?
I never could figure it out
I wished that time would stop
So i paid time some money begging it to
But i got swindled and now they’re both running off
Into some happily ever after
Suicide is a sin
But a perfect piece of the puzzle
In the eyes of righteous ones
Building fences around the tree of life 
Shielding it from its own kin
So that it would know it was alone
And it its own detractor all along

Sorry this isn’t a happy tale
But happy tales are surely for children 
And children, my friends, we are not"

1021,"This post just started out trying to share something I'm doing, and then went into a vent. I'm just struggling, and I know this community is pretty nice","I do this thing sometimes when I'm stuck at home for long periods of time, naturally I've done it a lot 2 months into quarantining. Anyway, I'll wake up, have a normal breakfast, not eat until around late afternoon,and then I'll just binge. I eat an insane amount, and then a few hours later I'll crash and get really sick and depressed. It's not a weight or health issue at the moment, I'm young enough I don't have to worry about my metabolism. As well, I don't do this enough for it to be serious. I just can't help it right now. The only happiness I can get is from TV shows, and talking to my dad when he's home (he works at a grocery store, so he's still on a normal routine). I don't know how much longer I can stand any of this. Every time I see one of those commercials with businesses pulling crap about how they've always been there for us, and will be especially now I just yell I'm so angry. Our state is saying will be in quarantine till June. I feel sick to my stomach about everything. I hate this life. I'm gonna lose it if this goes on any longer. And I can't do that, when I have a panic attack my parents take away things, I'm 16 and not allowed to have any social media except Reddit, which only my mom knows about, I can't hide anything from them because my mom works in IT so I can't do anything on the internet she won't find, my parents don't believe kids should have privacy.I should say my parents are not in any way abusive, they are strict, which is fine, the problem is that they are extremely overprotective of me, only because they love me, but still my sister got social media when she was 13. I studied and got my permit, but I'm not allowed to learn how to drive since I tried to cut myself during a panic attack. I have no freedom, I already felt isolated enough, and now this is happening. All I can think of is going to New York, not in the state it's in now, but before the virus. It's the place I wanna live, I just can't handle this anymore. I know it's selfish too, thousands have died, are at risk, millions have lost their jobs, and everyone is suffering. I wish I could help it. I'm trying my best. Stay safe everybody, bless you."
1022,Can't afford help,"19, I have no insurance, and am currently living pay check to paycheck with a single parent and no siblings  i dont have any money to spend. Would there be any way to talk to some type of therapist or psychologist, in person or online? I've come to terms with the fact that i seriously need help for depressive and anxiety symptoms for a long time. I'm about to get suspended from university for failing all my classes. I've been seriously considering deliberately hurting myself which is something i never did before. it feels like tthe tipping point"
1023,I feel suffocated,"Every time i try to do something there's someone there, like my family always has to watch as if im a child. No one wants to let me have my privacy (or my own life i feel) and im tired of dealing with it because they act if i don't have my own voice so they just assume fact about me and take it for a fact. One is right next to my bedroom so im deathly quiet 24/7, she stays up and yells to her friends all night and day and acts like its my fault for existing, while im cut off from mine because i cant get them to speak to me online and feel like shit when I butt into their chat. My only real moments of freedom when they go to work or i sneak out. Every single day its the same thing with little change and im thinking that the only way out is to hop on a train to nowhere or kill myself i don't give a damn which at this point."
1024,Mid-life Crisis?,"Hi There,

I am 33 years old male from Turkey. I've seen this subreddit in a Turkish forum-like website is being suggested and wanted to come clean about how I feel nowadays as it is also one of my problems. I don't think people who close to me even understand what or how I feel anymore...

For the last 2 years, I feel like I need more attention and care more than ever. It has started after ending a very long term relationship but it was first showed itself as a desire of being a womanizer again. Well I've tried, it worked for a while but then, at some point, I've started to feel like I'm in a void.

For example, I met a girl, it was supposed to be a one night stand but I realized that I have growing feelings about her. (She was already gone but I kept thinking of her...) Then it happened again, again and again. Finally a turning point in my life has happened.

I have met a woman online, we started to talk. She was married but was unhappy at the same time... She was complaining about her marriage all the time and I was just listening to her and giving my humble advice. Then she wanted to meet one day, we met. We met again, again... One day she said she have feelings about me and I realized it was mutual. On the next meeting, we were in bed together...

This was something I would never do in my life but somehow I was blind and did. In the following days, all of my feelings about her started to disappear. I couldn't even stand to see text message notification from her. That mood change was almost sudden and shocked me because all the things I have felt for her was real...

Since that day, I am feeling this way about every woman I like but on the other hand, I am still feeling like I need someone to care, love and spend the life together. (since the next day...) It drives me crazy, feels like someone hacking my feelings and detuning them for fun.

\*\*\*

There is that girl making me confused about our relationship. One day she looks like, talks like and acts like she is really into me but the other day nothing at all. This is a loop, never-ending. I think I like her, I like to talk to her, hear from here but this loop annoys me. Hurts my feelings to be honest...

I think she use me for her needs, maybe as a friend or maybe not and I am aware. I don't like this mood and constantly advising myself like ""Ok, she doesn't really care about you and you'd better start to forget about her. Give up, she will never like you as you like her."" And you know what? It is relaxing me, it makes sense until the next time she says or texts me ""hi, what's up?"" and I forget about everything again...

Maybe I am losing my self-esteem.

\*\*\*

I have some childhood experiences that I have never had a gut to talk about it to someone. I don't think that I can do here as well. I know those memories are there even when all were swept under the rug of my sub consciousness at some point and they always find a way to rise to the surface...

A friend of my suggesting psychoanalysis (for the last 6 years she is seeing a psychoanalyst and says that it really helped her and let her find who she really is) but it is quite expensive here in my country. I don't think I can afford that nowadays.

Those memories bring anger, shame, hate and more... Deep down I need to confront them to have a more peaceful, relieved soul but I just can't, I don't know how to.

\*\*\*

I want to be recognized. I was working hard to help humanity in NGO communities. I've been in Africa, Asia, Europe during the Syria crisis and Central America. Led projects, brought technology and help to them bla bla... Then I got fired because my boss wanted to get rid of my high pay-check and replace me with his mistress. My girlfriend left me, took my dog with her. I have applied every job that I could find online but heard nothing... I was penniless and after many years I was constrained to move back my parents' house, at the age of 31... Everything was upside down. My family wasn't rich, my education wasn't bright but somehow I succeed because I worked hard. I've spent years on my career, on my relationship and suddenly lost all of it.

I was thinking about suicide, I like stoic philosophy and you know as dying with dignity was looking like a good idea. ""I've worked hard, I succeed some stuff... Maybe my achievements were not important for people around me to respect me as I expect but were important for me. Maybe it is enough"" was the voice of my head. I never did, as you can guess, but you know it is a matter of spark. That scares me... You know, for a single moment you decide that, act on it and you are gone.

I don't wanna be gone... Yeah, it is a solution, I am an atheist and  I don't care about the afterlife at all... I am gone and nothing scares me anymore, nothing to care about anymore. But life must be good... There must be something to achieve, there must be a motivation to move on. It is just I couldn't find it and not eager to try nowadays.

\*\*\*

Sorry about long and complicated stupid post. I can't even think straight and put it down in a shape but I desperately need some positiveness I am afraid."
1025,Dont know what to do,"I guess I'm on here just to rant/get it off my chest. Husband and I got into an argument that old issues were brought up...he told me I was the reason he tried to commit suicide years ago.
I'm hurt. Sad. Angry. But more than that...heartbroken.
My own mental health has been taking its toll on me and for him to say that, took me from a 50% down to a 10%...

Idk. Created a throwaway just to post, that my mental health is garbage. And idk what I'm going to do now."
1026,I feel like my only purpose in this life is to die.,"We all eventually die, true, but I feel like I will do nothing and then I will die. My purpose is to exist and to learn, to listen, and then to die. Accumulate things and ideas until I can’t anymore. 

That or I’ll just be a vessel for something greater and bigger than me until I eventually move on from this world. I think that might be the best possibility but unlikely anything would have that much interest in me.  I hope. That would be really cool!"
1027,Mental health nurse here,"Hi all! 
I am in no way posing for a psychiatrist or a therapist. I want to encourage seeking help through your primary care provider and what not. I just am quarantined due to possible covid-19 exposure and am awaiting testing.. so I’m losing my mind staying at home! I’m a psychiatric nurse so I was hoping maybe I could provide a little insight or advice to anyone who is on here that may be seeking help. ❤️"
1028,how to come clean?,"i started cutting again recently but i didn’t want to tell anyone. i don’t want to tell my friends or family (even though they’re extremely supportive) because they don’t need to know i’m not making progress. for the same reason, i don’t want to tell my therapist or my psychiatrist and also because the last time i did my therapist deemed it an emergency even though they were shallow (i am a teenager) and i had to waste an entire day in the ER just for this impatient bland white man to say i should continue taking my meds. and i mean i haven’t been taking my meds either but that is Besides the point. i just want to ask for help without getting that ridiculous amount of  attention because i don’t need that. i just need someone who will listen to me and give me actual, fruitful advice and not unconsciously make me feel pitiful."
1029,Big sad,How do i cure sad
1030,Opinions Needed,"Here it goes, so im 21 and my mind is all over the place iv got a father whos very strict in his ways and only sees his way, when i younger he used to tell me the world going to end soon and believe me that didnt help my childhood and i used to always think whats the point of trying before i even got a chance live my life, its ruined my life and im probably never going to have a ‘happy’ life but cant help to ‘dream big’. What am I supposed to do??"
1031,Does anyone use food as self harm?,"I personally overeat in order to self harm, although long term health is a factor, its the short term damages that i feel the need to do it for. People shouldn’t be hoodwinked into liking me, so as resistance i make myself unappealing and hard to approach to stop people from talking to me. I was wondering if anyone has overcome this, i want to lose weight, for my health, as at times when i feel good, i feel disgusted with this mindset and want to change, but i cant.

Hope u are staying safe.

1032,The free psychologists during quarantine aren’t replying to me,"They made me sign a form and said they’d get back to me in five days max. It’s been more than that. They’re probably busy but I followed up anyway but still no reply. It’s fine if they cannot talk to me probably due to their volume of patients. I just don’t know what to do coz my depression and anxiety have been worse than usual. I got laid off and can’t afford therapy at the moment. I don’t even get replies on r/depression, like, ever. I am trying to stay on top of my errands and chores but I just feel numb. I have zero energy for ANYTHING. What do I do, guys?"
1033,Why is it impossible to sleep if you were awake less that 12 hours?,I literally tried to sleep for 5 hours yesterday and couldn't sleep. My consciousness just won't turn off and I ended up sleeping as if I didn't try to sleep for 5 hours
1034,I’m scared,"I’m nervous I’m an underage person with a lot of pre existing mental health conditions,I haven’t been able to get the help I need due too coronavirus lockdown,but my conditions are definitely worsening pretty fast.
The main thing I’m very worried about is my homicidal tendencies,I’ve dealt with them since I was younger (around 7 or 8 ) and since I started taking medicine they went away, however I am no longer on medication and they have since came back and are worse than ever, it’s terrifying because it’s like having another part of you want to hurt people and part of you enjoys it, I want to cause pain I want to hurt people.
But another side cares about the person and has empathy,remorse,feeling.
And I’ve never hurt anyone to that degree at all , the feeling surrounds people I love and care about however I never even think about acting on those if I do care about them, if I care about them but they have wronged me I will often put my own plans on how I will hurt,torture,and kill them. It’s getting out of hand especially with a certain person in my life. 
I care about the person but they are also very manipulating,they treat me badly at points, and has hurt me a lot,I’m usually a very passive aggressive person and let people walk all over me , but that was also before these tendencies had came back.
And therefore everything he’s done to me in the past is heightened in my mind and give me a bigger urge to severely hurt him.
I care in the back of my head,but then again I want to kill him and or myself I’m scared that I won’t be able to stop my mentality."
1035,over it,"my mom likes to say since she made dinner she doesn’t have to do dishes. yet when i say it she starts yelling and saying i treat her horribly and doesn’t know what’s gotten into me when she literally does the same thing ?? and she always comments on how i look, how wearing less makeup is better and even when i use less it’s still too much. i gotta get my license yet they’re always pulling me away from that plus doing school work, to help them with something else. and if i don’t do smt for them right away it’s a huge deal. they act like i’m a child literally unable to do anything for myself but then treat me as an adult yet i’m the worst person in the world. they just don’t want to realize that i am the way i am because of them and my mental health wouldn’t be so bad if they treated me so much better, realize i’m trying my best with everything i’ve been through, and didn’t criticize anything and everything i fucking do"
1036,Found a video about an artist with Alzheimer's, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17s52bJ27QA&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17s52bJ27QA&amp;feature=youtu.be)
1037,Have a long list of so many problems I don’t know where to start. Any advice would help.,"I’m not sure what I need to do or where to start. I feel beyond help. I’m in my 30s and this is the worst it’s been. This list is a mix of old issues and new. So here it goes...


Depression-long standing
Anxiety-mostly social, also long standing
Possible bipolar, I’m not sure 
Alcohol, not alcoholism just unhealthy habits 
Binge eating
Sex/intimacy issues-I’ve never had sex and have never been in a relationship or in love-not due to religion or trauma or anything explainable; on the same note my sex drive has been through the roof but only in the last 6 months though 
Overall feel like I have addictive personality-TV, food, alcohol, shopping-go overboard on certain things 
Career regrets-fucking hate my job and wish I could walk away from it today
Last one is hard to explain but it’s like an aversion to reality, an extreme adolescent attitude towards life. I’ve shut myself off from reality and at times fantasize about celebrities, or having a different life. I don’t watch the news anymore. Sometimes I’m clueless as to what’s going on around me. I obsess over fantasies I create and the closest thing I could find to it is almost like erotomania but not as extreme. It becomes overwhelming at times like I’ll buy clothes I think they’d like or listen to music they listen to. But I’m fully aware of how crazy and unattainable it is. I don’t believe anyone is in love with me or is trying to send me signals. It’s just a choice to detach from reality and try to escape my sad boring life. It’s my most embarrassing issue and has been longstanding too. 

So yeah I feel pretty bad seeing it all listed like this. I know I should call a dr, probably get on some meds, see a therapist. But if you have any advice on how to cope with any of these issues or your experience I’d really appreciate it."
1038,I’m very scared about the future,"I am 16m and currently taking a science course at college and I’m struggling a lot especially during quarantine.
I am very poor at time management 
And staying motivated and on task I always try but seem to get distracted very easily even though I know I should be doing something it upsets me greatly as I cannot retake those course and have late assignments so am at risk of failing .
Because of this I am terrified of the future and what I will do with very few qualifications 
I have a girlfriend who I love very much but it’s not fair on her if I cannot get a job in the future.
I almost constantly feel sad and sleep very little . 
I apologise about the state of this post I am typing this quickly.
I apologise if it makes no sense I’ve never spoken to anyone about this stuff and am terrified to do so"
1039,Is this normal?,"Life honestly just doesn't feel the same anymore. Right now, I'm 17 yrs old and a Junior, but I keep looking back to my early high school and middle school days. Things were pretty decent back then, and now it feels like I've been left behind in life. I see my peers jumping into adulthood (jobs, gf's, etc.) while I still feel like a 14 year old. It's a weird feeling, but I've been trying to mature. For some reason, I no longer really care about getting gf either. Though I've had some big crushes before, the ones I get now are dull and mild. It saves myself some heartbreak, but it's kinda boring as you would imagine.

Do y'all have any advice?"
1040,I feel lost in life and don't know where I'm going or what I want to do.,"I (19 M) just started a Bachelor of Science (Palaeontology) course in Australia and only a few months in want to give it up. I'm hating the content and the rate it comes at me. I feel I am no longer passionate about the subject but I have only kept doing it due to thinking it's my only option.   
When I think of other options to this course or even uni as a whole I feel there is no other career path I find interesting, I have tossed up being a mechanic or pursuing a trade but I'm not sure if I have what it takes to enter one of those fields as my knowledge in many of those topics is quite low. Since my first day of uni, I've been having severe anxiety attacks, both in class and at home, with multiple times resulting in me crying onto my lecture notes and having to repiece them back together. 

Because of these issues in feeling lost, I feel that I'm not destined to do anything and that I don't fit in anywhere, due to the other students in my course seemingly having vastly more experience in the topic than I did, making me feel like I was already behind from day one. I also work a part-time job that has me working long and late hours most weekends and some week-days. I've found myself having thoughts of purposely getting myself into a car accident or even driving away and just not going home after a shift. The only thing holding me back from doing these things is that I lost my own father to suicide a couple of years ago and don't want to put my family and friends through the same pain I had to endure. 

What do I do? I feel I have to suffer this course I've hastily thrown myself into and try to pass through (which I don't see happening in my current mental state). My Mum keeps reiterating to me that I can do this and that it's not as hard as it seems, but I feel at this point that she (who has a large academic background, being a uni teacher) is just trying to get me to follow her path and do things that she wants me to do, rather than follow my own path."
1041,What is wrong with me and food?,"During quarantine, I found myself eating and snacking all day at the beginning. Now I go on a 2 hour walk a day and barely eat anything, like I’ll feel hungry but I just dont want to eat maybe I dont even feel hungry but my stomach grumbles. At this point i probably eat 600 calories a day, Im 15 and I weigh about 108 lbs."
1042,I dont understand why i DONT want to kill myself.,"Ive struggled with my mental health for years. Anxiety and self hate has plagued me, but alot of the people i speak too with these same issues are suicidal. 

I dont know why, but i would never kill myself. Im too much of a pussy, death terrifies me and as pathetic as it is, i have no suicidal feelings mixed in with my other issues.

Does anyone know why this occurs, why this is happening? Im not complaining one bit but sometimes it makes me wonder wether or not I’m really struggling."
1043,I’ve done everything,"I feel like I have done everything to try and get better. I’ve gone to therapy, done yoga, meditation, took a break from work/school for a year, tried medication and nothing is working. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. Like I really don’t understand why I continuously feel like this. It’s exhausting."
1044,What's the point in seeing a therapist if this (Depression) has been a part of my life from the start?,"For context, yes I'm self-diagnosing myself with depression.  I have never seen a therapist and had built some terrible coping mechanisms, and I've been suicidal. 

Despite all this I've pulled through by figuring my way on my own and with support from a close friend. So I'm wondering if it's worth the time and money to go to a therapist for an official diagnosis and possibly meds. I've heard so many stories about meds making you go numb and I'm utterly terrified of that because up until two years ago that was my coping strategy, and I don't want to go back to that state. 

I'm asking this now because yet again I'm in a bad pit of depression and contemplating self-harm again."
1045,"read if u want, first time ln reddit and i want to share, i dont know how this works im sorry","Hi, I just made this account because i felt i wanted to share. I'm having issues to talking to anyone, feeling doing it over by the internet is easier. I'm not a native enlgish speaker so bear with me.
Name is Samir, 18 year old male.
I'v been struggeling with depression and anxiety for most part of my life. I'v had attempted suicide once in my life, was hoping for something to just shut me out. 2 750ml bottles of vodka, drank the the first one right away and halfed the other bottle. I was smashing my head against the hard walls of my bathroom, feeling nothing, alcohol makes me numb but the feeling of seeing blood calmed me in a way and made me feel worse. 
I lie to my friends, i have two close friends, one iv known for 2 years and the other for 10+ years. I love going to parties, i kept tagging along to as many parties i could just to drown myself in booze. In 2019, i remember the whole month of semptember it was just constanly parties, 2-3 every week and it lasted the whole month. I went to school each morning, begging to being run over by a car or hit a curve and fall on the top of my head. I was embarresd to do it just like that, i wanted it to be a ""accident"". It's an easier story for my circle to understand and accept.
I'm a very impulsive person and i have major anger issues, i have started so many unessecary fights that just leads to extreme violence. I'v made my mother cry so much, im suprised her body can still produce tears at this point. My father doesnt care, he had a family before he met my mom and it was a train wreck just like this one, he is just waiting his time. 67 years of age and has huge troubles with walking and even standing, my mother is 56, everyday she is begging god to grant strenght to our family. Me, my mother and father are very religious, my sister was untill she changed her mind when she was my age, we are a 90% muslim family, my father converting to islam when he fell in love with my mother.
I have no reason to beg and worship god because everytime i try to stay in contact, it always ends up the same way. Me starting fights in the streets, downinh myself in substances and mainly just hurting myself in anyway i can. I know what im doing is wrong but i cant seem to stop, it's like being this worthless garbage is a addiction because its uncontrolable.
I have been eating away, been overweight as long as i could remember, everytime i have some sort of motivation to glow up, whops there goes my thoughts again saying ""gym? there is a party in 3 days, stock up and get yout tolarence up becusw we are going crazy"" and poof, me having extreme anxeity untill the party starts.Having trouble getting into a relationship because im a broken record and i dont trust anyone after being cheated on after a 2 years relationship, i dont blame her, a fat piece of shiy who does nothinh more than just complains and hurts himself for some benefit that no knows about, not even himself. I dont hurt myself for ""eazing the pain"" i do it to remind myself that i shouldnt exist and its a way for me to epxress my thought in my head that i will soon enough go away, i want to fight the dominion the thoughts has taken over me. 
It's now ramadan and im just sitting here crying everynight, looking at my manboobs, fat belly, breathing with pain in my chest for everybreath caused by ciggarettes
iv been smoking since i was a kid. I had a heart problem 2 years ago where the muscle that holds he heart got infected and squeezing the heart crushing it and i was so scared and i was hospitalizdd for 1 month, the worst pain iv been through and i almost couldnt handle it untill i blacked out in the hospital, felt i died, it wasnt that i passed out because it wasnt the same feeling. when i woke up the next day with doctors and nurses and my mom around me i cired, that once more saw another fucking day. I keep wondering to myself, If god didnt kill me by crushing my heart into a little playdough piece, then why put me through it? all of the sins i never emitted or begged for forgivness? Is it even worth ending my life with pain to then be brought down in hell and being tortured and burned for an enternity? i mean i lose no matter what, iv never won anything except a ""live"" that is ""so preciouse"". My life is a fuckinh joke and if this really was luck that i was born than we have a funny way of defining the word luck. I have alot more to share but no one will read all of this anyway, no ine could ever bother."
1046,a personal hell,I have schizophrenia and a symptom of it is hallucinations but since young I’ve always seen ghosts and now I’m not sure whether to think they’re real or my mind playing tricks on me.
1047,I need help. I am scared. Help me,"I dont even know what I feel anymore all I know is that its making me go insane.
I joined a discord server some time ago because a friend invited me. It was a mental suppor server. I established a group of friends quickly, they are kind people who care about me and love me. I have never been told I was loved at all and thay make me genuinely happy. I want them to be happy. We have supported eachother dozens of times since we met. We four have one thing in common: we're mentally unhealthy in several ways.
Just now only an hour ago one of them started talking with a new girl in the server about self harm and suicide. 
I am useless and I have always been, but I have the ability to comfort people apparently. I've never been good with words, im rather antisocial, but I always managed to make other people happy, I dont understand why or how, but I liked making people happy so I kept doing it.
Now is when the self harm part starts. They started talking about how they did it and how they enjoyed and laughed at the pain. It wasn't detailed, but im really sensitive and that already was enough to scare me. I reached out for the friend I trust the most and told him im terrified. I told him I didnt know what to do, when to do it or how, or even if I should do anything. If I should call for help or not and who. The only thing I was good at was making people happy and I failed. I have even failed at making myself happy and I will never be able to. I have severe trust issues and fear of being abandoned or left alone and rejected for very personal issues few people know about, but I was thinking to leave that server and block all of my friend and abandon them because I am scared. And that's not all, im selfish, im very selfish. Im scared of that self harm and want them to stop  but im starting o do it too. For now its just hits I tought, but I've hit myself hard enough to stop feeling a leg for a long while and left bitemarks on my own skin and I have scratched my arms until the skin has been hot red and I grabbed my body strong enough to leave long lasting marks. And yet im scared of them. I dont know what to do. I dont want to do this. My life is supposed to be good now and im supposed to be happy but I am not and I hate myself more than ever before but I dont know why. Im also developing sone kind of anger issues I tought I got rid of. I have touggt of suicide before and I dont want to do it again. Last time my family found out of my intentions and punished me for it and screamed at me. And I cant even get a psychologist because I cant trust my family and I cant truat anyone. Mayve they are watching me right now while I write this. Maybe they'll get into my account while i shower and I will not be able to do anything about it while I work all day without understanding and without being able to keep up with my work. I am scared of myself my family and everything.
I think I want to die, I hate myself, im scared of myself and im ashamed of myself. If there's a god out there it has turned me into a puooet designed to suffer and nkthing else.
I need help"
1048,How many times have you tried to kill yourself?,"For me it is 6, but I haven't tried in 2 years"
1049,The silent scream,"I cried and no words no sounds at all come out despite feeling the air leave my lungs at force. I’m crying. I’m so mad I can’t even scream.

He’s going to be mad when he asks ‘what’s wrong’ and I can’t vocalize the words and won’t even TRY if I don’t think I’ll be heard

He promised he wouldn’t get on mic with me over anymore because I can easily get depressed and neglected, (he will use that fuckibg headset to block me out for others)

I told him I was depressed and feeling let down this morning. My fatigue made it so I couldn’t move half the day. I blacked out in the tub (I’d warned him it was a possibility because of my medical condition being so bad today) I told him I was upset even if I couldn’t explain why. 

He goes downstairs to game- I hear the headset i think I do and my stomach sinks, then he comes up to tell me not to use the net cuz he’s lagging- controller in hand headset on and my stomach hit that pit. 

I’m suicidal and I’m going to spend the night battling my demons solo, again. because being a non toxic and supportive gf means not calling him on broken promises of movie dates and nights where I have his full attention. Not saying ‘hey you promised to cook tonight and I’m starting to get really sick from the fast food’ when did understanding and supporting his coping mechanisms turn into him never being there for me anymore? I need to talk to him and I’m scared it’ll be another dumb fight"
1050,Just here to talk into the void for a second,"TW: self-harm 

People love me. People care. They’re appreciative of the work I’ve done. I’m aware of these things. I am. I just don’t often believe them.

I’d love to accept affirmation from others for what it is. I’d love to allow myself to feel appreciated. But somehow my brain turns every word into the opposite. 

It would also be great if I could just handle the emotion that comes up with all of that like an average adult. But here I am, 6 years clean, still fighting the urge to break out a razor."
1051,what’s wrong with me?,"there is multiple things i want to discuss, this normally happens at night but i hate having my back turned because i feel like something is behind me or i have to keep checking my room because i feel like something is there and another thing i always have to double check things all the time. what does this mean?"
1052,Ever feel like you are never going to have a relationship?,"I've worked on myself for so long in so many different ways and I've come to far. But it feels like there is always more work to do. And... I feel like when am I going to meet someone that I can be with long term!

My relationships go kaput!"
1053,Hooooooly shit I’m getting bad again. Please send some advice.,"21F (22 on the 11th), and my depression is getting really bad lately.

I was pregnant around this time last year. I had my baby shower last year in May, and NONE of my friends showed up. All of our family showed up, which I expected, but not my best friends, (N &amp; K), the ones who will be my maids of honor for my wedding, and not the one who considers herself the godmother of my son (N)

Alright, fine, whatever, shit happens.

I give birth in June, emergency c-section. I’m holding my baby and I have some friends come meet my LO. I never see N &amp; K, I barely even hear from N until after I’m home from the hospital, when she’s the one who said that she was gonna be the first one at the hospital when I gave birth.


N got pregnant a few months after I did, and she finally gave birth last month. K and I went to her baby shower, I even made her a GIANT diaper cake, I gave her all of my diapers that didn’t fit my LO, I gave her some of my unopened pacifiers, milk storage bags, I even went out and bought her brand new stuff. 

When N gave birth, K dropped her off dinners and said she would help clean her house for her, and would do all of these things for her. Is it wrong of me to feel jealous? I hate feeling this way, because every time I think about my baby shower and my friends, I just feel so empty. The more I think about it, the more I realize that my only friend is my fiancé and my LO, and how sad is that? 

Why can’t I have friends that would treat me the same way I treat them? I would do anything for my friends, but I feel like such a burden. 

Could really use some advice. I go to therapy, but I feel like therapy isn’t even working for me anymore. I have an appointment in a week or two, and I have to get new meds (Zoloft was completely screwing with my stomach). I just want to feel appreciated and cared about."
1054,Do I have a memory disorder?,"So, basically I think I have decent reasoning abilities and average ''inteligence'' but when it comes to retaining certain information... I know it might be normal or I simply do not carve the information deep enought into my brain but basically, I have had so much trouble keeping certain information, for example, I do not have a particular hard time learning a formula or reasoning in math, but after 2 days I might forget pretty much all I studied, also, I am a very curios person and often search random stuff about evolution geography, so it is definetely something I like and would hope to retain, but even in subjects I love I forget things in very few weeks or even days. I have a bad feeling about this, I know people forget stuff all the time but I am concerned I am forgetting more than a normal person should. Right now I am able to live normally and it doesn't affect my life that much, but I am legimate concerned it could develop into dementia or something of the sort, what are some ways I can try to improve my memory? For context I am an 18 years old male. I am sure seeing a doctor should be the best option but I can really afford to see one."
1055,does it actually ever get better?,"i’ve been struggling with these issues for years and even now, there seems to be no end in sight. i just can not envision a future where i’m not unhappy. (even if the circumstances that are making things worse now go away)
does it get better?"
1056,I can’t stop thinking about my cat dying.,"Every single day for the last 3 weeks or so I think about my cat dying. He’s only 4, and doesn’t have any health issues. Every time I think about it I start crying uncontrollably. Sometimes i’ll even be in public. I don’t want to live without him and i’m terrified of something happening to him. This is making me feel crazy and like i’m losing my grip. It also makes me really sad thinking about other animals, but I don’t think about that everyday. I’ve tried thinking positive about the time I still have with him but it doesn’t help. It makes it worse thinking about how Ill just have more memories and stuff. What do I do? How can I make this stop?"
1057,Is this normal? Should I worry?,"I realized today that I don’t remember a lot of things. It’s recent things I dont remember. It’s not like I forget phone numbers or birthdays, I forget full outings, having spent time with people I care about. I don’t remember things like in video, either, it’s all like pictures; just one image and like a general emotion of the setting. 

I don’t remember almost anything from years 1-10. I can sit there and look at old pictures or watch old videos, and I still dont remember being there. I was verbally and emotionally abused as a child so I always thought of this as repressed memories, but why is it still happening? 

Am I still dealing with trauma? Should I call a psychiatrist?"
1058,I’m 21 years old and I feel already really old,"I’m turning 22 this year, and I feel like I’m old, like really an old adult. I have many friends that are a few years younger (mostly 19,20) and I feel like I can’t enjoy the same things I did as a teenager because people will think I’m ridiculous.
I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years, which took some precious years of my late teens from me.
I finished school at 18, lost a year doing nothing because I was dumb and then started uni at 19. During all this time I’ve been working, but I don’t think I’m pursuing a work path in what I’m doing -it’s only till I graduate-.
I’m in my third year, still have two years more to graduate (that’s the way the career is designed) and I’m starting another 5 year degree this year.  Most people my age are closer to graduate, or are already doing it, so I feel left out, old, stupid. 
I have this irrational fear of getting older much faster than everyone else, and not enjoying my youth as much. Sometimes I feel like I wasted most of my youth and now it’s too late to live and enjoy as I would like. Honestly I don’t know how to feel better, and I’m sorry if my problem seems way too pretentious for someone with real trouble, but I’m really struggling."
1059,Can someone help me understand Schizophrenia?,"My little brother, who is 22, was diagnosed with schizophrenia almost 2 years ago. Before, we were super close and loved hanging out and playing games together. Now he is not wanting to talk or hang out, and responds to literally everything with ""no"" or ""I don't know"". He looks like a zombie, and there's a disturbing emptiness in his eyes, like nobody is really home. I'm trying to be patient and it has been 2 years, but he keeps getting worse and worse.

He doesn't know he has schizophrenia, because my parents refuse to tell him, worrying that he might be able to emotionally handle what it means. My first instinct is that he should have a right to know, but maybe they are right? My dad is a doctor, but doesn't do anything related to mental health, so I don't really trust his opinion. He blatantly ignored my brothers symptoms (he doesn't really believe in mental health) for several years leading up to this, after all while I was begging him to take him to see a therapist.

Sorry this turned into a vent. What I'm really asking is how to best approach my brother so that he can slowly get better and learn to cope with what's going on in his head? What is he thinking/feeling when he always refuses to answer my questions and literally just says ""no"" and ""I don't know"". I haven't heard him say any other words or express any real emotion for the last 2 years."
1060,I hate my body and wish I could just give up eating. I’d kill to be thin where people ask why I’m so thin.,"I hate my body so much that I don’t want to look in a mirror. I hate showering because I hate being naked. I hate food, I count calories all day, then binge in the evening. It makes me hate myself, which makes me ask my husband if I look good, which in turn makes him stressed that I’m always asking so much. So I drink and take Xanax to make all the feelings go away. Sleep makes them go away, because I’m not awake."
1061,Whats the point of life?,"Ive been on so many different drugs over the past four years. Both prescribed and not. Ive tried 6 different antidepressants, klonopin, seroquel, weed, shrooms, oxy, acid trying to find what will make me happy. nothing does. I dont even remember what a normal, clear mind feels like. i keep telling myself the meaning of life is to be as happy as you can til you die but nothing makes me happy."
1062,how do I hide self harm cuts,"I know it’s bad to ask, but google won’t help me or anything with it. how do I hide self harm cuts? I can’t really wear long sleeves since my parents know abt it and I’ve been clean a few months and shit has gone downhill n I jus need advise"
1063,um so i kinda really wanna stab myself in the chest,"My chest hurts a lot due to anxiety and i keep getting urges that the only thing that can stop it is to stab myself right in the middle of my chest

This happens a lot with my stomach and throat too

Idk what to do? I’m kinda scared I might do it, though I doubt it."
1064,I can’t deal with this anymore,"Hi. First of all I wanna say if you’re in a negative headspace and don’t want to read something that might make you feel worse, this is gonna be a slight rant and probably slightly triggering, so feel free to leave. I’m 18 and I live with my mom and dad. My mom is wonderful and understanding, and I love her to death. But my dad is condescending, rude, ignorant, and borderline emotionally abusive. He says things that he knows get under my skin then acts so surprised when I explode because he pushes me to the brink of relapsing on self harm. Ive been doing great with my depression and haven’t relapsed in a long time but then he cuts me down and i wonder if I should just give it all up and start over again... I want to know how I can get away from him without actually leaving. I don’t have the funds to move, to live in my own place or have a roommate. I’m trying to save up but it’s still gonna be a bit and with this covid thing, I’m now trapped in the house with him for days on end. I just want some sort of mental barrier between us and I don’t know how to make that happen. I want to distance myself from the pain he causes so I can continue to make my mom happy and enjoy life.

1065,Anyone know which subreddit or help try and figure this out.. I don't know where to go,"I'm sorry I'm just having a low-key breakdown and I really have no one else to go to but maybe just maybe SOMEONE else is feeling like this or knows what these could be. I've always felt like my brain was disconnected in like all shorts of ways and I've been tested for all kinds of learning disorders (or at least my mom said I was) and I don't know what the hell it is. Like I have zero concept of time. Like things that happened this morning feel like they happened last week and last week feels like months and I can't get anything right. Clocks feel meaningless but there the only thing that actually keeps me on track. I can't remember anything important and if I try and focus on what people are saying I only forget it faster and there's literally nothing that's been helping. And I don't know what the deal is with my emotions but like, I know that I should feel some type of way during someones crisis but I don't FEEL it. I've been good at facial expressions but I don't actually feel sympathy towards others when I very well know I should. I'm so up and down with my emotions, It's very rapid switches. I could be thinking about ending my life one second and then fine the next. it's hard to focus on anything. Most things are extremely hard to even explain but it just hurts. And people think I don't care about them or that I'm just ignoring everything their saying but I just can't remember anything. And it's affecting all of my relationships. I can't just seem to figure out what's wrong with me or how to fix my problems."
1066,I feel like I am addicted to failure,"I used to be a straight A student until sophomore year, when I got really complacent and didn't end up turning in a final project for one of my classes, getting me an F. From then till now, I have been in a constant downward spiral, where I don't care about my grades until the deadline passes, and then I have anxiety problems and can't sleep at night causing worse performance in class. I just failed to turn in an extra credit option that I promised my parents and teacher I was going to do, and although I didn't care at the time, now I feel paralyzed and ashamed of myself. Does anyone have any advice for getting motivated?"

1068,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I keep doing this, I genuinely want answers","Starting when I started showing symptoms of depression I had issues with turning in assignments for school. I knew I needed to do it, I knew that I would get in trouble for not doing it, but it was so hard to actually do it. This continued and reached its peak early junior year of high school. The end of that year and this year, my senior year, I’ve gotten slowly better, until I was doing almost perfect. Then the quarantine happened and it’s worse than ever. For years I’ve tried to explain this phenomenon to my father and my therapist but I can’t really vocalize it, and nothing I say feels like it hits it exactly on the head. I can make lists, I can organize, I can understand consequences, it just does not reach where it’s supposed to, I guess. Maybe motivation is the problem? But I feel like I have motivators, they’re just, again, not connecting to the part of my brain that gets me to do the actual work. Instead I just stress about it. I don’t know if it has to do with depression or ADD, I have meds for both, but it’s the one thing I’ve never been able to wrap my head around. Anybody have this issue or know what the issue is?"

1070,Am I overreacting about restaurants reopening?,"In my state, restaurants and such are reopening with restrictions and I have been having panic attacks for multiple days leading up to my place of work reopening. I told my boss I don't feel comfortable returning because I have been having such high anxieties about going back into the public. There are probably some more deep seeded issues within myself, but am I overreacting? I feel so stupid for being like this."

1072,I dont know what to feel or if what I'm feeling is valid,"I don't know if I have a mental health problem. When i was young (12 ish) i felt like the closest thing i could describe it with is depression. But i was never diagnosed, and I felt bad because it is a serious issue and I shouldn't just self proclaim it so lightly. But this kind of thought has plagued me into invalidating my pain. I still don't know if I'm allowed to admit im suffering. If it matters, and for context, I've been struggling like this for 6 years. Ive had scuicidal thoughts (estreme was writing down all my scuicide notes to prepare for it), I have periodic panic attacks and I've been through self harm. I'm not asking to be diagnosed. I am just confused...I don't know what to feel anymore. Thanks"
1073,My brain goes YOU SUCK,"I've been having a hard time as most people have here. Recently I've been experiencing more and more derealization/depersonalization/disassociating feelings, but the problem is I can't tell if I'm just faking it or not. I have no idea if my brains just making it up for me to continue to wallow in self pity or that it's actually happening. Good to note is that I've been having more depressive episodes and they've just been getting worse each time. I've also been feeling more urges for phsycial violence, I have never lashed out at anyone but the urges to just punch something are getting stronger. Haven't told anyone I know in real life yet, it's been tempting but I still haven't do it. It's just hard man."

""Whenever someone tells me to ‘Just be happy,’ I want to yell, ‘Oh, hey, depression’s gone! Why didn’t I think of that?’ But usually I just roll my eyes instead.” —Anonymous"
1075,This is just a veiw into my way of thinking to be honest. But its over all about my high standards for myself to keep one person happy.,"So I(13f) am severely depressed. I have recently learned a few months ago that I've been self harming for 6 years. So my source of coping and staying happy is putting my happiness in someone else's hands. Since everyone keeps leaving me it's died down to one person. I try my absolute hardest to keep them happy. Ive stayed up all night and day just so I don't miss their message. I hold very very tight standards up for myself. 

No mental health or emotional discussion on my part but she can vent as much as she needs and or wants to. If I don't respond within seconds up to a minute max to her message then I made her wait and that shows I put something else before her which I can not do because her happiness determines my happiness. I can't show I mad at her even if I am. Everything is my fault even when its hers. I need to make sure she's perfect in my eyes so I don't realize how toxic she probably is. 

Now the problem is, I have made myself think my response time is completely rational, but she sometimes doesn't reply for 5 minutes up to over an hour. It makes me feel so worthless, like she's ditching me for something else that she feels is more important. But what could be more important when you tell me you NEED me or you'll cut. That I can't be taken to a hospital because you need me around or you will start cutting again. And I can't let that happen because I remember the times you would describe you cutting to me. Twenty cuts on each arm, letting them bleed out, then banishing them.

I tried my hardest to be supportive for her but she forgot I was in a group with her. She left for a whole week recently without a word and she told the people that she was thinking of leaving again since no one really noticed. When she found out I saw she changed it to personal issues. Does she not care about how i feel when she leaves me alone. 

It doesn't matter i can't argue with her about it she said to forget it so i can't make her upset. She's so excited to do something with me over chat I feel happy and included! Oh...shes prioritising YouTube over me again. That's fine her video is more important even though it's been 2 hours! Friends? No. I mean they are nice to have, but they all leave me. So I need to keep one and only one so that i can focus on keeping her happy when she's with me so she doesnt leave me. Right? Thats how it works. You keep them happy so they keep you happy. Thats how it has to work because any time I let them actually know how I feel they LEAVE. They stab me in the back and call it a joke. Act like I meant nothing.

No one really cares. They just like to stick around until they learn I'm completely mental and I honestly would kill another person if it meant keeping her happy. But what's funny is when people learn that I'm bottling up a bunch of emotions, suicidal thoughts (I've given myself a reason to live and that reason can't leave me so I won't be purposely dying this year), they beg me to vent to them. But when I start and I refuse to take their advice because they don't understand how bad my anxiety gets when it involves confronting my mom about my mental health. Or when someone isn't treating me right. 

People say it's wrong to physically attack others. So i slowly shifted to subtly attacking myself in ways I didn't know were concidered self harm. Now people are telling me to hurt them instead of myself. WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO THEN. I'm mentally and physically breaking. I can't receive proper therapy only school counclers that I had to have my mom force to take the once a week meetings seriously. I choke myself just to feel a calming sensation of life fading the feeling of not being able to breath. I don't really care anymore. I have a 7 year old sister. She attacks me when she gets mad at me. I'm not allowed to fight back or defend myself. It was the same with my brother. He attacked me one day, clinging onto me from behind, scratching at my face. I elbowed him in the stomach to get him off and my ex- step mom told me i should have come told her.

This isnt everything. I don't expect upvotes. I dont expect comments of support because people don't know how or care to support me. I expect downvote because when people don't know how to help or they make a call that in attention seeking they downvote. Congrats if you made it this far i guess."

1077,Looking for tricks,Hey y'all I have been struggling hard with Anxiety lately. Today was the worst it's gotten in a long time. What are some ways to just cope with them ?
1078,New Life,"Little backstory. I am adopted and have recently left home to seek a happier life in the state that I am from originally. 

Coincidentally, my birthmom was renting out an apartment when I was at a considerable low point in my life after watching everything I had spent my whole professional life working for go down the drain due to my own decisions and actions. I made the decision to move in here and try to make a better life here to leave everything I've been comfortable with for 20 something years. I'm very positive for my future personally and I'm proud of starting a climb out of a hole. 

Mental health isn't a subject to be spoken upon with my adopted family. I feel more accepted for being me here and I feel fu*king fantastic after seeing low lows and high highs, I just want to work my ass off towards a safe and comfortable life. My first therapy appointment is Thursday at 5:30 and thinking about it is the only time I've shed a tear through leaving my entire life, friends, family, and peers behind. 

Anyway, I have a 10 year old half brother who lives in the same house that is on the spectrum and I want to be able to help my single mom who is exceedingly overwhelmed with 3 other kids, an abusive and tough relationship she is trapped in, and a whole lot on her plate to boot.

I have a metric fu*kton of energy when I'm on my shit, but I'm currently moving into a whole new life and feel very overwhelmed as well. Family is very important to me and I want to be a positive influence for all of them here while keeping my shit straight.

Mental illness seems to run in my blood and I'm the first one to seek help from a counselor and I'm happy that I get to get help with myself, but please help me learn more so I can help my mom.. I can't do this alone.

Thank you."
1079,I did something bad,"Ocd started telling me to turn back and find another way in order to avoid from passing by from a tv store because the Gods perhaps will punish me.  It was just a compulsion that I tried to ignore but ocd kept bugging to turn back. I reached near the shop and saw it. I started feeling more anxious and started thinking to do the compulsion and find a different way. I was bored to do the compulsion and spend some time looking at the shop while I was trying to decide if I will do the compulsion or not. Since ocd was telling me to avoid passing by from that shop, I got a random thought to persuade myself to ignore ocd. the random thought was something like "" its too late. whatever is about to happen will happen. no  point in doing the compulsion because it already broke just by seeing the shop and be near it"" it was just a random thought while I was speaking to the phone with a friend. after that I forgot about it. I kept the compulsion and found a different way and I avoided that shop. After some minutes, I remembered the random thought ""it is too late now"" etc. I said that to persuade myself to avoid the compulsion because it was already broken but I worry if I accidentally, accepted the compulsion and the consequences of breaking it. I do not know what I meant with that thought. i think i meant that the compulsion is broken but it is just a compulsion and there is no punishment behind it. but it does not fit with the thought ""whatever is about to happen, will happen"" it may have looked like as if I was thinking that the punishment happened in order to persuade myself to stop fearing. I have had similar cases like this many times in the past but I was able to pray to Gods sooner or later that they were just thoughts without my will. in this case, much time passed and I totally forgot about it. I do not know if I was speaking to myself or to Gods. I just forgot and was careless and they were random, subconscious thoughts and i was busy speaking to the phone on the same time."
1080,No one was commenting on this so I decided to share it here,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/gdqnrh/im_not_sure_if_life_is_even_worth_continuing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
1081,"I’m lost, and the future doesn’t look bright.","So I am currently a senior in high school, or at least I was until all this coronavirus shit happened. The decision to close schools in many states across the nation was a tough decision to take in but I can definitely understand it. I miss school sooo much and wanted so badly to be a second semester senior and just enjoy that with my close friends was all I wanted and now that’s gone. But, a bright side of being away from school is I don’t have to face my daily reality that I am an awkward fuck who is destined to be a failure. Now I know that seems harsh but let me explain a bit. I’ve always been the shy kid, I’m very much introverted. I’ve always had a misconstrued image of who I am, especially to other people, so I don’t know how to exactly explain it but people are often times surprised to hear me talk. I’m kind of awkward as well at first, and my heart races every single time Im talking to someone new/that I’m unfamiliar with. I’m the only “shy” person in my immediate family really, and most of my friends are extroverts. Making friends hasn’t been an issue because I do have a solid group of friends that I’ve had since elementary school that has grown over the years as I was just around people more.

I’ve struggled with some form of anxiety and depression over the past four years, not diagnosed and I hate to self-diagnose but my legal guardians never really believed in getting help for mental health issues. Idk if it’s my anxiety that holds me back in life but it very well could be. My worry is this...

I am soon going off to college and I don’t know how I will do in many aspects of my life... making new friends when I’m starting off with absolutely none, living up to the expectation of the people that I’ve already spoken to about rooming with and such, forming romantic relationships, being able to pursue a career in psychology, whatever branch I choose to go down eventually. It almost feels like I have to come out as an introvert like I came out as gay a couple years ago lmao. I’ve been described by some people as chill and I think a lot of that is due to my laid back quiet demeanor but I’m so afraid that this will get in the way of me succeeding. When I think about it a lot of the times I’ll get into that mentality of “what’s the point of this all if Im going to end up failing in life?” I don’t want to be a single lonely guy working at McDonalds with a bachelors in psychology with no future job prospects. I consider myself driven and I’ve done well in school but I am petrified that my personality will hold me back in life.

If there’s anyone out there with any advice that’s seeing this right now, a PM would be appreciated. Thanks for reading this regardless and hope you all stay safe during these troubling times."
1082,Could use some good vibes.,"To put it simply, my boss basically set me up to fail on Saturday at my job. I've only been working there for a month and he set me to work alone on the busiest day of the week. He was unsatisfied with my pace. He has drastically reduced my hours and moved me into the back room in what I feel is a ploy to edge me out of the company. This feelingis based around the generally dehumanizing behavior he offers in regards to how he handles my shifts to begin with. He tell others to tell me that I *have to work tomorrow* at the very last possible minutes and places me in positions where he knows I'm better suited elsewhere. 

I battle with depression on a constant basis, and the whole situation has me really crestfallen. For the first time in a while I thought about suicide as a result of the stress it's all bringing me. I inevitably overcame the thought with the thought of my wife and her family being a great support network for me, but I'm still struggling with a pile of doubt in myself.

I'm going to be going in for an interview at another job tomorrow, and I could really use some positive energy if anyone has some to spare. 

Maybe just keep your fingers crossed for me?"
1083,Losing control of body and consequently my mind,"
I am a 25 year old male and since more than ten years I lose more and more control of my body to spasms and compulsions. I don’t know exactly when it started but i must have been very young because i don’t remember a live before them anymore. I am now at a point where I contacted exit international because the pain of the continuous fight against myself took literally everything away from me. I have nothing to lose anymore and can’t compromise any further. Also I know I am supposed to describe my symptoms here as best as I can but unfortunately they change from year to year and I didn’t really find a pattern yet. I try since more than a decade to at least get a diagnosis on what exactly is wrong with me but nobody is able to give me answers let alone a therapy. My head hurts so much and I decided for myself that this is the end for my suffering."
1084,give me the strength to go on,can someone pls make me feel loved for a sec... i have no one to give me the hug i need rn and no one who can listen to my deepest sadness and i just want someone to help me have the strength to get back up bc i am just so tired of it all
1085,Constantly being put down,How does one deal with constantly being put down? Especially by your family. I lost it today and now I feel horrible about it but I’m constantly being told I’m weird. The things I like are wrong. Intentions and motives are always being added to my actions when those are far from the things I was thinking or doing.
1086,Empty.,"I have struggled with depression in the past. I have almost ended it on sever occasions but I kept on going. While my suicidal thoughts have lessened  recently I have lost touch with everything. I feel nothing anymore, I an completely empty. I no longer feel emense sadness or happiness. I crawl up in the bathroom at least once a day and just sit there. I don't know what to think or do. I am beginning to fear that I will never grasp emotions again."
1087,I want to run away from home.,"It isn’t anything to do with my parents, they are actually the only reason I’m here (that and I’m under 18), but I just hate the fact that I live here. It feels like I’m being pressured, like I can’t choose my own life because everyone is telling me to make the right choices, and I’m starting to think that the only way I can live my life is to leave. The school I go to won’t stop bugging me because I haven’t done any homework in 4 weeks, I used to have good grades but it just feels pointless now. I hate school, I don’t see why I need to graduate, I don’t care about money. I tell my parents this and they just tell me I’m not thinking right and I’m wasting my life. But I’ve recently been thinking weird things. I don’t know what’s reality anymore and I’m going to sound crazy but it just feels like none of this matters so why should I do my school work. I love to write novels and that’s all I do, but my parents blow me off. I think they want me to get a real job like working in a factory or something when I get older but, that’s not what I want. I was told by my parents that I won’t make money writing and that it’s a good side job, but I just don’t care. I feel like my life is collapsing and in the next few weeks I’m going to be fucked, but I just don’t know what to do accept run away. Most of you are going to say that my parents and school just want what’s best for me, but that is what people aren’t understanding, I am doing what I think is best for me. I don’t care about my future I just want to write. The world is falling apart, everyone is glued to their phones and I just want to write in peace but everyone is turning on me, I’m not even sure what the fuck is happening now, I’m starting to question reality, and I just want to run away. It’s that or fucking jump off a cliff but I don’t want to do that and that isn’t a joke. I could call my school and tell them what’s going on but they will just label me as insane. But I’m not insane, I’m just correct and other people aren’t understanding that. I just need answers, has anyone else gone through this? I just need to hear if someone has been in the same shoes as me. And honestly at this point in prison that would be better than here. I just feel like I’m more educated than ever not doing school work, almost like the school is brainwashing me."
1088,Other peoples suicidal threats make me anxious,"In the past I have delt with other people threatening their lives as a way to manipulate me into doing whatever they wanted me to do.
It's really impacted the way I am today, I have a lot of problems with dissociation and lack as much empathy as I used to have.
Whenever people talk about suicide I get really anxious and worry about my abusive exs and if they're still suicidal.
I know it's not really my fault, but as I try and process trauma i realize how numb I've become except to how nervous suicide makes me."
1089,"No wonder coronavirus isolation is so tiring. All those extra, tiny decisions are taxing our brains"," One way to think about these extra decisions we’re making in isolation is in terms of “cognitive load”. We are trying to think about too many things at once, and our brains can only cope with a finite amount of information. 

Early research described a “bottleneck” through which information passes. We are forced to attend selectively to a portion of all the information available to our senses at a given time.

These ideas grew into research on “working memory”: there are limits on the number of mental actions or operations we can carry out. Think of remembering a phone or bank account number. Most people find it very hard to remember more than a few at once.

1090,Why do people need a reason for suicide?,"Let's say on one side there are negative things that make life difficult and cause suffering. Some can be resolved, some can't. On the other side there is... nothing besides worthless crap.

Now a therapist points at the pile of crap and tells you, if you don't off yourself, and solve your problems despite pain and suffering, you can have all these beautiful things that life gives you.

You look at the shallow worthless things that life has in store like: old dinnerware from your grandma, fake rolex watches, fake love, dirty money, screaming annoying children, poptarts, cheetos, and shallow entertainment media, and somewhere in the distance there is maybe a car, a house, people applauding you, a decadent yacht that you may get if you try hard enough and get lucky.

Then you start feeling stupid for even debating this. The therapist is an idiot. And you feel like an even bigger idiot for letting society bully you into staying alive, but you're too much of a coward to do anything about it. So you say thank you to the therapist as you give them a ton of money for the session. On the way home you need to pay for the bus ticket before you pay even more to pick up your medication that doesn't do anything."
1091,I cant live with this paranoia anymore,"Every single God damn day. Every single fucking day I have to be worried about people surveilling me. Everyday I have to cover my face when I walk into a store to get something because i feel that cameras are watching me. It started out when I was about 12, only being scared of cameras, but it's gotten to the point where I deepen my voice whenever talking to someone because they might have a microphone on them. I dont even feel safe in my own home. I cut all the cameras out of my phones. I keep them in a foam box in my closet so they can't hear me at night. I cover my windows so the satellites cant look into my kitchen and bedroom. I constantly feel like I'm being watched on social media. I always have to use ip spoofers. I even have a burner laptop (along with my burner phones, also in my closet) so people cannot see what I do. I constantly check for cameras in my room, and am even going as far as thinking of buying a thermal imaging camera so i can see if there are any cameras or hidden electronics in my room. I have dozens of social media accounts, just so I can have throwaways. I really cant lube with it anymore. I know that everything is not real, but it's so hard to ignore these thoughts. I'm scared to go to a therapist, also because I think they will somehow start watching me and bug me."
1092,Swaying Feeling,"I don't know if this is the right or wrong place to ask for help but this is a recurring which cant be physical. Essentially once a year, for about a week or two, I feel this weird of swaying and dont feel properly balanced. The best way I can describe it is if I'm standing on a small boat in some water. I can't find anything online about this."
1093,How did I go so far off track?,"12 year old me would be afraid of me. Back then I couldn't have imagined what I'd have done to this day. I don't think I've done one productive thing looking back. It's just screw up after screw up. I'll just do things knowing full well it could go terribly wrong while telling myself I'm invincible, nothing can hurt me.

I'm lonely. Nobody who knows me like me. Those who like me don't know me for real. You don't like me. You just don't know it yet.

I just want to be left alone. I don't need to be protected from myself. I just want to have some fun without consequences. Why is there always consequences. Just let me have some fun universe!"
1094,What is wrong with me?,"Hello all. This is my first time posting. I don't know what happened but I feel constant anxiety and I have panic attacks. I am a male introvert. I like to stay at home. But not anymore. I get easy triggered by surrounding sounds and get the feeling to runaway. From my own home? This is not acceptable. I started wearing all types hearing protection ear plugs and ANC headphones to isolate myself from all sounds. Which makes some bad situations with my wife. And staying all day with headphones at home is strange. I have no problem when outside but even at my parents and friends homes I get triggered and try to hide it to not look awkward. I sleep with headphones (ear buds) with white-noise. I am very light sleeper and wake up easily and cannot fall back to sleep. I tend to overthink all stuff. I am losing control of me. From nowhere I start to cry or get horrible sense of fear for no reason. Never been to therapist. Cannot afford it with the ongoing situation. And I don't know what to do. I have amazing wife, my own home, cats and all normal family needs are covered. But I feel so broken inside. So frustrated. So lost. I hardly feel any happiness now. I have all day negative thoughts about death and what would happened IF? I know all this sounds strange and even funny to someone else but I feel really bad. An I feel that I am a weight to my family. Thanks to all who are going to spend time reading this. And I hope for better times."
1095,What do I do?,"I have anxiety. My friend has bipolar. We’re both clinically diagnosed. She is currently on medication while I took medication for a brief period while I was in depression. I don’t take medication for my anxiety. 

My friend I would say is brave, speaks her mind and is quite unpredictable. She openly talks about pain and expresses herself beautifully thought art. I on the other hand am sensitive, observant and live within the boundaries of social cues and norms. I like things under control and have a fairly objective side to me as well. 

I find myself constantly stressed around this friend because I don’t know how she might react to what I’m saying. It’s come to the point where I start to get really anxious before any interaction with her. Our relationship has been this way since we were teenagers. This about the time she was first diagnosed and I was around during some of the manic episodes. At that point in time, I found myself extremely helpless and would experience a lot of panic when with her. I couldn’t seem to help her or even simply listen to her, without completely breaking down inside. 

But it’s been a long time since then. She’s grown and so have I, in many many ways. However, interacting with her still makes me anxious to this day. 

She considers us to be really really close and I do too. However I find it extremely hard to be honest with her. I still respect social cues when I’m with her. She thinks of me as family and has even lashed out of me many a times, like one would with family. Everytime she tends to lash out, I simply absorb it not knowing how to deal with my own pain or hers. 

I feel like it’s all my fault because I lead her to those expectations. I only want the good for her. But I also don’t know how to feel calm myself. It could be one small text from her and my mind goes into a frenzy. 

I just want to know if someone else has been in this situation or know what they would do if they were. If you took the time to read this, thank you."
1096,Getting worse and worse,"I need to put a disclaimer that this post is about what a lot of people find absurd or a point to make fun of - and I understand why it’s offensive  but please don’t make fun of me just for the sake of it. 
I struggle to say this because 1. I don’t even know if it’s a real thing, and 2. I haven’t spoken to any professionals, but I believe I have some sort of race dysphoria. I look white/middle eastern/European ( I don’t know half my heritage), but I feel like I’m supposed to be east/southeast asian. I have another post about it so I’ll try not to vent here too, because this is more about its affects. 

My mental health used to be horrible, I’m grateful to have supported myself to get here, but just as I was levelling out, im falling again. 

A few days ago my friend started dating an asian girl. I relapsed into self harm and I’ve had a panic attack everyday this week, I keep falling asleep and having nightmares of big things coming to kill me and take my limbs. I’m so exhausted from fighting everything, I keep wondering if I even deserve to comfort myself or recover. I could tell myself I don’t deserve to feel depressed, or anxious, but I can’t tell myself I don’t deserve to feel bad about this dysphoria. I can’t tell myself it’s all in my head because it is. I can’t tell myself no one is getting hurt because people are. 

I can’t even imagine how absurd this looks. I feel like a dumbass just writing it. But I feel absolutely worthless as a human. I feel trapped inside a metal box - I feel like a scrapbook project and like I’m destined to live in constant panic and restlessness. I feel like I’m constantly screaming in my head, I can’t stop crying and laying in bed and crying more. I’m scared, and hopeless that I just want to die again after thinking I grew. 

I’m hoping to get a DNA test later this week, and get professional help after the results arrive, because this has been going on for as far back as I remember and I don’t think I can handle it myself anymore. I’m sick of feeling so stupid and offensive, I’m sick of not knowing where I belong and I’m ready to admit it’s not going away as easy as I wish. But I’d really, really appreciate some advice. Even just someone to give me some reality, especially from an asian person. I’m too ashamed to talk to anyone in real life about this and I don’t know what to do. I feel nauseous and irritable and scared and it’s affecting everything else in my life, No matter what I do, I feel like I’m lying to myself everyday, I don’t know who I am. I just want it to go away, I want it to go away so badly"
1097,How to be emotionally capable to help someone through a mental illness,"am mixed with frustration, fear and confusion over my brother’s behaviours that it is becoming stressful. He is showing schizophrenic symptoms through delusions and hallucinations. He hears a voice, mostly my dad’s voice yelling at him and calling negative words at him. However, I cannot hear what he hears. He also accuses me and other family members that we talk behind his back. Whenever he loses a video game, he accuses one of us for causing him to lose saying that we went into his room to bother him. It is emotionally upsetting watching him go through that. I feel helpless because anything I say seems to make him more angrier. Whenever he does calm down, he is fine and acts like nothing ever happened. He has not been formally diagnosed but we have been witnessing these behaviours for over 6 months. However, it’s hard for me to be okay when all the things he says hurts me emotionally. I need some help understanding his behaviour and how to not take it too personally ? I am finding it harder to support him when I feel personally hurt and confused on what is going on. I want to be emotionally capable of being able to help him."
1098,I have a question," 

Might not be such a weird question to ask here, but have you ever felt like you never really belonged anywhere? (whether being around family/friends), I've been struggling with this feeling all my life and I don't really know how to change it . Ever since I can remember, especially my teen/early adulthood, I've had friends sure but I never really belonged in my group of friends, I was never really called by anyone first (I usually did all the calling if we wanted to hang out) and I felt like a stranger around them when I listened to them talk and being bi polar made it worse , I used to get so many random mood swings that were hard to deal with , I guess what I am saying is that I don't really feel like I belong anywhere (and before anyone says anything, I am not suicidal/thinking about suicide)."
1099,"Hey I need a little help :) and it's about my mental health I'm 14 and I just don't have the money for therapy and I just need something to explain what's going on with me, so what's been going on is that I feel the need to make money NOW like I need to make money NOW or else I'll be broke and sad.","And again I'm only 14 and I should be enjoying life and having fun but there's this feeling of pressure on me that makes me feel like if I don't make money I'll be a failure and won't be successful.

1100,Does having a mentally ill mother affect your psychological development ?,"I have an emotionally unavailable mother, the doctor said she has schizophrenia, too late to reverse. She has always been there physically, like feeding, doing house chores, but I cannot remember a single day she was interested in my life. 

She does smile, laugh, etc but after seeing other moms, I have always felt there is something amiss.

And this is affecting me now. Researching on self awareness, I have realised I have a very fragile sense of self, people pleaser and always wanting to be in my head. 

Is there some problem with me like having it in my genes, or I am just overreacting and mothers love does not correlate much with my mental health. 

I am 26 btw. Too late to realise all this I guess :/"
1101,I need some help.,"I'm going to get straight to it.

I keep remembering or being reminded of both cringy things that I have done, or said, and hurtful things people have said or done to me. I have tried to block out the memories, but they keep coming back. Even things that I did not feel bad about saying at the time, but causes me to freak out afterwards. 

Social interaction is also an issue for me because I have trouble understanding what I am being asked of, while I have speech issues, like stuttering, and mixing up the order of what I say. There are times when I make people laugh, or somebody does something nice for me. Later on, I'd wonder if the laughing was fake, and if I had deserved the niceness.

If anybody has any advice, please tell me."
1102,I feel trapped inside my own head,"Hello all,

I've created this throwaway account to ask for advice without reservations, and because I urgently need to get this off my chest.

I am a 22 year-old male currently living with my mother and siblings in Spain. I have a steady job which provides for the household (as extra income) as well as myself and my younger sister for those little things which we couldn't otherwise afford. All in all, I have it pretty good in that regard, and I can appreciate that.

I am a web developer, which also happens to be one of my hobbies. I used to love my job -- I spent years building up my résumé, dedicating hours and hours to ensuring that I would grow up to be productive.  I got an internship with the company four years ago and have been working full-time ever since. I am completely indifferent towards it now.

I have considered quitting my job. Whenever I think about it I realise that it is not a good idea, particularly so with the current situation, but at the same time it is chipping away at my mental health. It could very well be exhaustion, but it is hard to endure.

On a personal level, I feel empty. Just dead. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. My life doesn't really have direction and I am completely unable to envision a future for myself.

A few months ago, I wanted to move out and rent someplace to be by myself. My sister would be moving in with me, as we are very close. Today, I don't think I can bear the thought of living mostly alone.

Outside of my immediate family, I have no one. I used to have a close friend with whom I could talk for days on end -- however, life put some distance between the two of us and there is no contact anymore. I realise, in a way, that this closeness also isolated me socially to the extent that I cared very little to socialise with anyone else. That is entirely my fault and I can see that now.

This lack of an actual social circle has also become quite crippling. I have many acquaintances, but none I feel really comfortable with. I am not an introverted person by nature, and I am rather sociable, but because of all the aforementioned issues I find it very hard to get close to other people. It might be that I don't pay enough attention, or that I don't try hard enough -- the outcome is the same in any case.

It has become so overwhelming that I have considered moving abroad and starting anew. I have always wanted to move to the United Kingdom, but I also feel that I would be unable to take root and make a living for myself, and in failing would be forced to move back sooner or later. And of course, in any case, the quarantine situation has frustrated any plans I might have otherwise had for the near future.

The result is that I find myself daydreaming often and feel like I am too much in my head. It is becoming maddening and I often go entire days where I don't feel like myself at all -- like I am in a haze. I would best describe this as a mental fog of sorts which clouds external stimuli to the point where I barely even notice the passing of time. No matter what I'm doing, it all feels essentially the same.

Whenever I am not living in my head, I feel dissatisfied and extremely apathetic. I get too little sleep and am unable to perform adequately during the day. I feel like a zombie, and it's slowly killing whatever little joy I derive from the few hobbies I have. I feel lost, broken and I am having strong negative thoughts more and more often as of late.

I need counselling. I know not all is lost and I am not one to give up. But the truth is, I am constantly looking backward and inward, instead of forward. I am either replaying the same damn memories over and over again in my head or fantasising new ones because I just can't seem to create any new ones that feel real enough.

It is mentally exhausting, and I don't know that it is going to get much better, if at all.

Thank you for hearing me out."
1103,I Started Antidepressants Today,"After nearly a decade of struggling, I got my first ever script for Lexapro. I know it’ll take time and maybe some tweaking, but it’s the first time ever I’ve felt like I’ve taken a step forward in my life. 

I left the pharmacy and went for a long walk along the beach. First time I’ve left the house in a month. I’m pretty happy today and just wanted to tell someone"
1104,Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips to overcome/calm down a bout of anxiety? Been struggling with it for a while and currently in a bit of a bad spot with it.
1105,I want to take my meds but I don't do it.,"To begin with, I have a few things going on: type 1 diabetes, hashimoto's, and crohn's. The hasimoto's and the crohn's are manageable, even if I slip up with my meds, but the diabetes... the diabetes could make me very sick, very fast. I mean let's be honest, it could kill me if I don't manage it with injected insulin.

The problem is, I don't take my meds, at least not like I'm supposed to. Every few day's I'll have a good day and take my pills and inject my insulin... but my blood sugar averages double what a healthy level should look like, and on a day where I don't take my meds it can be 3-4 times higher than what is considered healthy. This can lead to diabetic coma, loss of eyesight, gangrene, organ failure... all the good things.

Obviously I'm aware of what could go wrong. I also know exactly what I need to do to manage it. I know how to carb count, calculate my insulin dosage, and inject the insulin. I have no fear of needles or aversion to injections. I am intelligent and capable enough to do this (I have a masters degree!!), I have no excuse. But I just don't do it. I will sit there and tell myself that I need to take my meds right now, and then I don't.

I've tried antidepressants, I've been in therapy for over a year (my therapist thinks I don't value myself enough to look after my health, but I really do want to be looking after myself), and I just don't know what's wrong with me. 

What's wrong with me?"
1106,coping with depression,My brother has depression. As a sister it’s hard to understand and at times i get extremely frustrated with him. I try my best to always check up on him and respect his boundaries. Not be too nosy or annoying. Or even trigger him. I know he continues to struggle and i don’t understand. I wish i could understand what he feels but all i can do it stand by him and continue to give support but even then i have this awful feeling he wants to kill him self. There are days when he is happy but there come days where he is visibily upset. I am coming onto here asking for help. As a sibling how do you deal with your mentally ill sibling dealing with depression. Sometimes i feel extremely upset and i cry and i feel anger wishing i could do more. I don’t know how i could live with myself if he took his life. My brother is on medication and he normally does have a therapist and will be going once they open their office after covid chaos.
1107,Does this sound familiar to anyone? I can not get help during COVID and my child is suffering! Please help,"Hello all,

My daughter is 11 years old and is having a very hard time right now. Since she was a baby she has always picked, chewed, and eaten things that are not food. She does it all the time and does not seem to be able to stop. We will see her eating something not meant to be eaten and tell her to stop. While we are in the middle of talking to her and explaining why that is dangerous she will do it...right in front of us! She is not a rude or disobedient child. It's almost like she doesn't realize or really needs to do it. Usually, it is paper, erasers, silicone toys, plastic (Barbie's fingers/toes or straws), and styrofoam. If those are not available she will start in on her fingers and nails. It doesn't matter if they are bleeding and in so much pain she can barely hold things or shower (water and washing hair makes her cry from the pain) she keeps going. This seems to be worse rn with COVID. We do not watch the news and have talked with our kids about what we are doing to keep them safe. I think it's bc she has more time without being busy but maybe I'm just seeing it more since we are together all the time.

When she was little she seemed to be very shy, however, as she got older it became worse. She doesn't speak in class, she won't talk one on one with authority figures, she hides behind me going into a family gathering...people we see all the time, she asks to try new things but then won't participate when the time comes. When asked about why she can't talk to her teacher after class for makeup work she said it is because she is terrified. Most people terrify her! She is fine in our home with us but the outside world scares her if she has to engage. Due to this, she has one friend and if that friend is out sick her whole world is dark and miserable. She overthinks things and blows simple situations out of proportion, but I know to her they are a huge deal and they do overwhelm her. She will just stew over the same thing forever. She worries about what others think of her and wants approval but then also wants to hide and doesn't want anyone to know exists. Sometimes I have to just pull her out of her head in a safe place with just me or all becomes too much for her to handle. That is when I think the next storm below starts...

She has also self-harmed once before by cutting herself. She tried to hide it and almost got away with it. Teachers, friends, family...no one had seen the marks because she was hiding them from everyone. I happened to see them when an unforeseeable event happened and she needed help showering. Of course, once I saw them I hugged her and asked how that happened. She covered them up and started crying and then told me that she needed her brain and emotions to shut up. She says sometimes it sounds/feels like a hurricane all around her...she can't stop crying and the thoughts won't stop coming and she had to shut them up. She knew from pinching herself that pain could make it calm down but pinching wasn't working so she saw the school scissors and did it until it all stopped. When asked if she wanted to die she said no she just wanted to stop everything. She pointed out she didn't do it deep. 

She does a couple of other things that may or may not be related. She repeats the same word in the middle of a sentence several times before moving on. This is not something she does all of the time but it does happen often enough anyone who knows her has seen it several times before. Almost like her brain is tripping over a word...or stuck on it. She also only eats foods with certain textures. She has to be able to pick them apart or rub them on the top of her mouth. For example, grapes are good bc she can pick the skin off and eat it and then smoosh the soft inside on the top of her mouth. If she can't pick or smoosh then she ""doesn't like it"" and won't eat it. The texture of guacamole, bananas, and cottage cheese are a no go bc of the chucks in the way of the smoosh. For her eating is all about texture!

The picking and chewing are out of control right now and I'm worried she is eating things her body can't digest and could cause major medical problems. Like a sharp piece of plastic off a straw could perforate something while making its way through the body or everything her body can't break down could build up and cause a blockage. Everything else is serious and needs a professional but since she isn't leaving the house the anxiety seems to be ok right now and we do have a plan in place for when the brain/emotions are in overdrive. She has not self-harmed again and has come to me when she is overwhelmed so I can help her. I know she needs to see a professional and we were seeing one before COVID hit but they are not seeing patients right now that do not have a confirmed diagnosis yet.

Any help or advice you can give would be greatly appreciated! If this sounds familiar and you have an idea of what it could be that would be great to hear as well.  I just want to help my daughter!! It is so hard watching her drowning and not being able to jump in and save her with a hug."
1108,Doctor refused to put me on meds,"Depression, anxiety, and substance abuse run in my family. Growing up, my dad was a physically and mentally abusive alcoholic. I think that in my case, the combination of genetic factors and a not-so-great home created a breeding ground for depression and anxiety for me. I can recall wanting to die as early as the age of 8. 

Throughout my years in elementary and highschool I had several teachers send me to the counsellor at school when they suspected that I wasn’t doing well. Additionally, my mother dragged me to many counsellors over the years, sometimes even driving 45 minutes for an appointment. And while I appreciated the compassion that I was shown by my teachers and my mother, I never felt safe opening up fully with any of the counsellors I had seen.

At the age of 18, I made an appointment with my family doctor. I told her that I had been experiencing a lot of anxiety and that my depression was worsening. I told her that I was hoping to get a prescription for an antidepressant or at least something to calm my anxiety. She refused, and insisted that I needed to try therapy. I told her that I had tried therapy many, many times in the past, but that I found it incredible nerve wracking. I told her that I didn’t think I could handle going through therapy without something, and she told me that I just needed to try harder. 

Since then, I have completed my first two years of university, and they have been a struggle. My anxiety goes through the roof during tests. I get shaky, my heart races, and I have a really hard time breathing, let alone completing the test set out before me. I have been depressed and even suicidal for the great majority of my university years thus far. I tried a few therapy sessions, but I found them unhelpful as the amount of anxiety they caused outweighed any slight benefits.

My school is now offering online doctor appointments because of covid-19. I am really thinking that I should take this opportunity to try a new doctor and try again to get a prescription. The only thing is, I’m terrified of being rejected and told that therapy is my only option again. 

What is the best way to ask a doctor for antidepressants?

Have you ever been rejected?


TL;DR: my family doctor refused to prescribe me antidepressants and insisted I only need therapy. I may be able to get an appointment with a different doctor, how should I ask for a prescription?"
1109,Supporting a friend woth mental health issues,"Hi there,

my best friend is currently suffering a mental health issue. She is at the end of her school and wants to quit because she can't do it anymore. She us barely sleeping, she wishes to not wake up in the morning and crys a lot. I listen to her and try to give advice. It's her decision if she will stay in school or quit. But I wish I could help her.

Does anyone have any idea how to make her life just a tiny bit easier? It hurts me so much seeing her like this and I don't want her to fall in an even darker hole."

1111,I just want to go home..,Anyone ever get that feeling? I don’t want to be where I am. I don’t feel comfortable and safe.. I long to be somewhere.. *anywhere* else but here.
1112,Am I a burden for myself and others?,"Why do I see other people around me or myself as a burden?

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate others. There are a lot of amazing souls out there, but I prefer to stay away in my little bubble.

I am not sure if it’s because I don’t want to cause problems for others or if I just want to shield myself from other peoples problems."
1113,Dreams make it even harder! Was I right?(Part 1),"So I'm going through two extreme situations so I'll divide it into two parts. Here goes part 1

So, there is this guy I've been in love with ever since I was little. He's been my childhood crush and my teenage crush. He felt the same for me, we even dated but not for too long due to family conflicts. When we seperated, it was more than hard on both of us and we parted ways and since the conflicts were from my family's side, so I was the one to ask for a break up. As time went along, we eventually tried to start talking again, but when we did he talked to be pretty coldly for about 7-8 months which is valid I get it, but I started to lose feelings. The person I've been blindly in love with since years, I started losing feelings for him?!? What factor pushed me away from him was our different views about commitments. He wanted family and future over everything, I wanted my life before any future commitments, to build myself. He did not understand me and my urge for a free life in that sense, maybe somewhere I lacked understanding too. Also, I little thing, I have a tomboyish and spontaneous personality, he wanted me or expected me to change it, he didn't like it, wanted me to become more girly and you know under control. So, by saying, ""I started to lose feelings"" they were fading away, if you ever loved someone, residual feelings remain in your heart. So back to it, after few months of talking coldly, he finally realised it wasn't my fault but the situation's. We started talking again as friends, but yes he didn't want us to be just friends nor did I. Now, here comes the beautifully messing twist, a person came into my life. He was different, I don't know why, what or when but something just you know attracted me towards him. But I wasn't expecting anything more than attraction as I had feelings for my childhood love. So, as time passed, my feelings for the new person grew very vigorously. Within two years, I started to feel a connection. And with my childhood love not accepting me and my personality as it is, kept on pushing me away. But these things work on honesty and confrontation, so I confronted my childhood love about how my feelings have faded as he was clearly expecting more than just friendship, it devastated him. He acted like I don't have feelings at all and I don't care at all. He parted ways from me. Now, I feel like I did a mistake maybe by telling him or stuff. Even if I feel more for the new guy. The fuss is about me having my story only with my childhood love, I've not thought of or ever been with anyone else but him. But this new guy, he changed everything in my life but me, without doing anything. Just by his presence, my life has been beautiful. But apparently we are far from each other due to moral issues that we may face. He was my tutor, 3 year older than me. So now, my dreams. I see myself missing my childhood love so much that I ask him to come back please and he does. But, if he comes back, I don't have proper feelings, I don't want to change myself, I don't feel the connection with him. I don't want him back, but my freaking heart makes me feel guilty for hurting him by losing feelings. It makes me feel like, first I broke up for family, I hurt him then, and now I lost feelings, again I've hurt him. I feel like a terrible person, though he has time to recover but if I came back or asked him to just talk, he'd not heal. But, was it a mistake to te him the truth? That I lost feelings. My dreams make me feel like Yes because I've hurt him, my brain says you did right and not kept him on the hook, told him the truth and set him apart, at least now the hurting caused by you will stop, my heart says many things but mainly, it was either me or him.
I was starting to accept the situation and move on in my life, but this dream caused some trouble in my head, maybe it wasn't right?
I had this thought that, do I want him back because I still have feelings or because I'm guilty that I hurt him?
This is tooo much, my overthinking makes it worse!! This guilt, it eats me from the inside. I feel terrible about myself. I wish he heals completely and purely. But this guilt keeps on hitting me.

Also, every true opinion is openly welcomed, it's just that I fear replies and reactions due to past experiences. I'm scared of what people would react or say which could affect me. So, I'm sorry but please be gentle?"

1115,So so very lonely,"I put myself into isolation in january, mentally stabilized mid February, and now...well here we are. I’m happy I’m adjusted for isolation, I’ve always been an extroverted introvert. 

This isn’t new for me.

I’m grateful that I have the privilege of staying inside without it affecting finances, but god damn do I miss my nephews and sisters. 

I miss the four pairs of hands determined to tackle me to the ground.

I miss their need for me. It might be messed up, but I miss being wanted and needed by my little guys. And exhausted sisters

I’m usually mentally unstable, but when there’s a global crisis or any real crisis, I’m fine. When I’m in class and feeling self conscious, it’s the end of my world...but real problems are easy for me. 

I champed through many heart surgeries without flinching. Those are easy. Manageable.

But my head..that’s a monster never to be defeated. 

I’m reaching the end of my mental vacation. Maybe a new video game? 

I just feel alone right now. Thought I’d put my feelers out for some advise for curing loneliness.

Also, if anyone could use some support, I’m here too. Let’s help each other"
1116,idk what's wrong with me but im scared and i feel like i have to be locked away or dead.,"i've been having this fear for awhile but right now i'm really scared.  Basically, i'm scared that i'm going to do something horrible someday or become a killer or something. I don't actually want to hurt anyone and im not saying i feel the urge to, im scared that someday i will feel the urge to. I just envision in my head all the time scenarios of me in 30 years being a killer or something. I'm 16 right now btw for reference. I feel like i need to be locked up or dead because i dont wanna hurt anyone. Also, i hear this sound almost constantly and it kinda sounds like voices but it's like kinda an oooOOOOooOOOaaaaAAAA sound. I also hear people walk down the halls sometimes when it is completely silent or i'll hear someone knock on my door. It's usually only bad if i smoke weed but it's sometimes there when i'm sober too. Also, I have a hearing problem so idk if thats why i hear this shit or if its because i have schizophrenia. Sorry for the bad grammar i'm just scared right now becaus i don't wanna be a bad person but i'm scared i will be."
1117,"My mentality disabled uncle molested me, my family have taken his side. I just don’t understand","He molested me once when I was 12. I remember telling my parents about it when it happened but then life just seemed to go on. I still saw my uncle and hated it. Last Christmas I couldn’t take it anymore I went back to my flat and told them I just can’t get over it and I’m so angry that they didn’t do anything. 

I told them I don’t understand why he’s still in their life, why was he never kept away from me. I wasn’t really given the answers I was looking for “he doesn’t understand it’s wrong” “we’re all he has”. 

Just because he doesn’t understand it was wrong doesn’t make it wrong or discussing and they argued against me, I said he needs to be put in a mental institution, they disagreed. I don’t want to be apart of a family who molested me, my siblings and my cousins. He’s done this multiple times and is still allowed around children, is awful. 

I’m trying to fix the relationship with my mother but she won’t admit he’s a predator or that he’s a danger at all. I don’t know what to do, I feel so low, I feel like I’m losing my family. 

My anxiety has never been so bad in all my life, I just want this pain to go away"
1118,A confession like many others I can imagine.,"Hi all!

This might be all over the place but I will try to be as ... to the point as I can. 

A month ago I was diagnosed with severe depression. However, this did not come as a surprise to me as I know that I have been struggling for a few years. Two weeks ago I went to see a psychologist for the first time in my life and although it is a ""great first step"" it didn't help at all, but I know that it probably wouldn't since it was my first time and you have to find the right one, and it is a process and all that. Anyways, I was given some mental exercises to do when I am at my worst state. I struggle with sleeping because of my mind and my constant forever feeling of anxiety. 

In my teenage years I went through some tough emotions regarding my body and I didn't deal with it, nor did I ever tell anyone what I used to do to actually cope with my feelings then (until I met this psychologist because she cant legally tell anyone about it). However, lately, I am worried that I am falling back to previous behaviors or patterns of my teenage years as I am becoming addicted to the feeling of a rush or a thrill. This I get from running, exhausting myself to a point where I don't have to acknowledge feeling anxious, or just not feeling anything at all feeling. Then if I don't go running I feel guilty, failed or just plain lazy and THAT brings me back to past feelings. I can't say I am back to my teenage years of body image, but it lingers in the back of my mind, a slip here and there a few times a year sure, but I don't think that will ever go away. 

ANYWAY. Does anyone recognize themselves? 

Of course I choose to acknowledge myself and my ... emotions during this pandemic, but now when things that used to distract me as in going out to bars, hanging with friends, spending unnecessary money on eating out and other silly things used to sort of help me with ""forgetting"" or ""blocking"" my feelings for a while is not an option I have more time to think which I don't like. 

How do you guys, anyone, deal with their mental health during this time?"
1119,"Asking for help, if possible.","Firsts post ever. Always imaged I'd make a funny post that was super popular on 'don't put your dick in that' or something. 

I am venting, so skip if you're not looking for negative junk.

I am very late 20's male, and pathetic. I try to be happy, or at least calm, but there is a little bastard in my head who wants me to go away. I am trying, but it doesn't seem like it to other people. They think I am still weak. My mother thinks I am (I would imagine) pathetic. She is a brilliant woman, kind and strong, but does not seem to understand mental health, or maybe I am fucked. I am having trouble understanding if I am normal, and with problems, or just a fucked up cunt who should go.

I am a failure. I have a diploma in ICT (nothing), and am studying a shit course in fuckhead lame graphics fuckhead design. I need to go away so my mum can (initially be sad, but) eventually be happy. I have been to therapists since young, aware of CBT, many family deaths and gentic mental health issues, but they are not related. I am weak.

I am nice to people, but I am sad (overall), and it's all I ever will be. A speed bump. A hindrance in my family's progression. I need to get the balls ups to do it. I can't. I am tired of being ashamed. I am in a hole. I am pathetic. I am fucking angry. I am nothing. I am tired of not knowing what to do. 

If you have any words of advice, please share them. I have no fucking clue what I am meant to do, while I know i need to go away. I think I am desperate for a reason not to, but I don't have one, and I know within myself one doesn't exist; but I am still asking.

Or just call me a fuckhead, and tell me i need to do it. It's not like I have the spine to make the decision either way. 

That's what I do, pathetic cries for help. I need to go. It's just a sad joke until i do. Fucking lame prick, no wonder mum is sick of me. Pathetic fuck. And is if my mum should be my main thought at this point. I'd have had a life if I wasn't a joke. I should have gone a long long time ago.

1120,Covid-19 is destroying my mental health.,"It’s not anxiety about the virus, but the fact school is let out and we stay home all day. I suffer from hypochondria/health anxiety and from the minute I wake up until I go to sleep again I am consumed by thoughts I have a severe illness which will alter my life. I can’t help but think the minor throat pain I get is a throat cancer ( and many more scenarios! These past few week I’ve convinced myself I have kidney failure, parasites in my intestines and even tried hanging myself when I thought I had erectile dysfunction at 17!!) I used school as a distraction from thinking about my health all the time . I’m very sad and shake in fear some days ."
1121,Why do I distance myself from girls that want to get to know me? Why don't I like opening up?,"I'm 22 years old, and I've never really had a girlfriend before. I'm had girls like me before, but I just distance myself away from them and act like I'm not interested in them, when in reality I am. I don't know what's wrong with my personality. I feel like I want a girl who has everything that I want (same humor/personality taste and goal oriented). However, if a girl only has one of those things but not the other, I don't find interest in them even though I find them attractive. I don't know if this is a bad trait, but it's made me lonely as fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I'm so lowkey about my personality. I hide it away from people, and I don't show them who I really am. Who they see is simply nothing but a mask that I've created. I feel like most people don't really know me. I don't really like opening about to people because I feel like they will lose interest and because I don't like giving my personality away too quickly. I don't know if this is a bad quality of me. I've been on several dates, but I don't like opening up so they probably think I'm autistic or something."
1122,im not perfect,"i wish i could b like the girls i idolized in hs, they had it so easy. they were athletic, smart, everyone liked them, they had a tight knit group of friends, and they didnt have to do anything. 

unlike them, everyone seemed to hate me. ive drifted out of so many friendships bc theyve just ended up being toxic/mean to me and id rather b alone than surrounded by shitty friends. im also not the type of person who’s desperate and will try to force their way into friend groups. 

i played 2 sports and i was pretty smart. im not socially weird either, im rlly friendly and nice to ppl and id like to think i have a rlly good personality. in fact many ppl have told me that too. but for some reason in my school ppl just wanted to start drama w me.

i shit u not i would literally just go about my day, only talk to my friends, and mind my own business. but when i would try to talk to ppl they would just give me attitude or groups of ppl would gang up against something i said. and ik this shouldnt matter but a lot of ppl i thought i was cool w from school never followed me back on ig. it makes me feel bad about myself bc they follow my friends but not me, like what’s so bad about me?

im not trying to make enemies w anyone but if ur rude to me/ targeting me im going to stick up for myself. 

i just wonder where it all went wrong. like y could i b like the “it” girl. the one that had no beef w anyone and everyone just liked her— i was always nice to everyone but ppl still targeted me or didnt respect me. no one was obsessed w me or wanted me to like them and i feel like it’s bc they knew they wouldnt gain anything out of me liking them. ik im a good person but i dont get y ppl in my hs didnt see me like that. i feel like everyone had the wrong impression of me like i was weird or started drama or a bitch."

1124,Hospital?,"Okay so I've been depressed for so long and I'm so close to, ya know, ending it. The voices in my head are saying so much and for the life of me I can't even pinpoint what they are saying.

But because I'm 13 I've only been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and autism. I've been put on melatonin for now and some meds for a autoimmune thing. I might get some antidepressants too. But I have an appointment on Wednesday.

If I'm not better by then. I think I need the hospital. Any advice?"
1125,Is it normal to just start getting panic attacks?,"I was normal, no anxiety, no depression, no panic attacks... One day I got swollen lymph nodes and some other symptoms and Dr started mentioning cancer. I naturally became anxious and panic attacks started, but since then I've been cleared of any cancer.  


The panic attacks are still in full flight though. anywhere from 3 to 5 a day, very severe. Is this normal? When does it stop? Was it just a shock to my brain that will calm down?"
1126,What are some good tips for dealing with anxiety,"For context I’m a 17 year old male in USA and I’ve started getting a lot of anxiety recently, and I’m just not sure with how to deal with it, I’ve tried laying off caffeine because I’ve read that that could cause it but nothing, I’ve tried taking time outs but still nothing. It doesn’t help I’m I have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and every time I get anxious I start to feel sick which just makes me more anxious, please just tell me some tips on how to deal with insane amount of stress in times like these"
1127,"I agree with the other post, my biggest regret is that I’m still alive.","I attempted suicide months ago and survived only to have the police and ambulance called to my front door by my boyfriend who I had sent a goodbye message to. 
My only regret is sending him that message, I wish I had never told him. That day I could’ve actually died. Not using a throwaway account because I feel so done. I don’t know, I just want to die and feel my soul leaving my body like that day. I want it all to end and No i’m not happy I survived. It only gets worse."
1128,Just wanted to open up and answers.,Lately ive gotten in a relationship with the most wonderful girl ever and ive been way happier than ever before. But i have gotten this gut wrenching feeling of not wanting to lose her like it hurts physically to think about it. She has made it clear that im not losing her whatever happens but the fear is still there 24/7. Ive thought about possible reasons but it cant be my anxiety disorder because this has never happened before. Also i have been diagnosed with depression recently so it might be that but i just want some answers because i cant take this.
1129,College Student Mental Health during COVID-19,"Do other students feel completely unmotivated and extremely depressed due to being a college students during COVID-19? This was supposed to be my last quarter in undergrad and I have been struggling with my mental health so much these past 4 years as a student. The experiences and moments I was planning to have this quarter were going to make it all up, validate everything I had worked so hard for, and empower and motivate me beyond college. It sucks so much, especially being a student of color who grew up with the societal expectation that I would never be good enough to graduate from my college and has struggled so much for so so so many years to get to this  point. Yes, I was lucky to have the institutional tools at my disposal to navigate this all, and I continue to have this access, but this access was also struggled for. This quarter was supposed to be a culmination of generational struggle and it was supposed to validate so much for me but now I am so sad and brutally awaken/reminded of the fact that the struggle does not end with me and I am going to continue to struggle for the rest of my life and my children will too. And I really needed this quarter to give me that institutional validation to motivate me and remind me why I have to keep going forward. And most importantly share this with my family and honor my recently deceased family member, who struggled so much for me to have this opportunity.

And the job market is HORRIBLE. Any job that might encourage me and motivate me to continue pursuing my goals and striving to better myself is on hold, is no longer hiring, and is a complete mess right now. Any sense of self, of independence, or stability I envisioned for myself is not going to happen for a long time. I feel like attending grad school is becoming more and more of a good option and I am completely dreading it because of the horrible impact undergrad has had on my mental health.

I have a lot of campus, research, and organizational commitments and I am constantly checking in/meeting/communicating with the same people, usually on a daily basis. But every time we talk, it's about our responsibilities/commitments through a blue screen for a rushed period of time. It is so dehumanizing, exhausting, isolating, and sad. After a day of that, I am so tired and sad that I don't have the energy or motivation to talk with my friends over the phone.

I am overall really depressed and self-sabotaging right now. I know working out and eating well and going to sleep on a regular schedule would really help but I don't feel I deserve to do things that will make me feel good because I am in a low-functioning depressive episode. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. Some weeks I'll sleep an average of 10 hours a day. I will get motivation or energy in waves and work out for a few days. These last few days I have been doing a new exercise and it has been very freeing but I don't allow myself to completely enjoy it. I make myself feel guilty for not using that time to be productive in regards to my responsibilities. I don't know how much longer I will keep doing this new exercise on a regular basis.

And then I am taking way too many classes. I had to submit a petition to be able to take this many units. I am physically unable to pay attention to these lectures or study at all. I am constantly too anxious or preoccupied or on my phone or superficially communicating with someone to have the ability to pay attention. I need to pass all of these classes to graduate. I don't have the money to take classes over the summer and the classes I would need wouldn't even be available. I would have to wait until this quarter again next year and it would completely mess up any career opportunities I might consider. There is so much uncertainty, dehumanization, fear, sadness, depression, isolation, and anxiety that I am experiencing right now that I cannot focus for the life of me.

I just want this to be over so I can return to some sense of normalcy and gain a new appreciation for life. I want to go to therapy and graduate from undergrad. I want to invest in myself, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and time-wise,  and I want to get a job. I want to become a member of my community and reconnect with my friends and family and my most authentic self. I want to wake up in the morning and feel excitement and motivation to care for myself and to do so with pride and self awareness. I had tried for all of last quarter to book a therapy appointment for myself but it was literally so insanely inaccessible. It took 3 weeks to gather the energy and time to make a follow up call when my first was not correctly filed. It took 2 weeks to get a follow-up. It took 3 days to gather the energy to call the private therapists I had been referred to and by that time they were already filled and gave my condensing responses. It took 2 weeks for me to tell anyone and reconsider going through the process again. And by that time quarantine was starting.

Do other college students feel this way? How are you coping? What keeps you motivated and moving forward?"

1132,Anxiety Issues and feel like my GP didn’t take me seriously.,"Hi guys. A short introduction of myself, I’m a 27 year old guy from the UK currently living my second year visa in Australia. I was really struggling with my anxiety attacks around 3 months ago and a certain incident that happened really sent me into a downward spiral. 

I was finding things hard to I went to a local clinic and saw a GP, this was hard enough for me to do and I had to force myself to sit in the waiting room whilst my body almost shut down. I made it into her office and she asked me what the problem was. So I told her how I felt and how much I was struggling to cope with how I was feeling.

Her response was ‘oh everyone gets that way sometimes it’s part of life’ ‘what do you expect me to do?’ ‘What do you want because I’m not giving you valium’ so I walked out feeling worse than I had going in. 

At this point I feel let down that a professional hasn’t seen my cry for help and I really don’t know where to go now. I’m just looking for some advice. 

Thanks for reading."

1134,The coronavirus pandemic is pushing America into a mental health crisis,"&amp;#x200B;

Three months into the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/?tid=lk_inline_manual_4&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_4) pandemic, America is on the verge of another health crisis, with daily doses of death, isolation and fear generating widespread psychological trauma.

Federal agencies and experts warn that a historic wave of mental health problems is approaching: depression, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.

Just as the initial coronavirus outbreak caught hospitals unprepared, the country’s mental health system — vastly underfunded, fragmented and difficult to access before the pandemic — is even less prepared to handle this coming surge.

1135,Suicide plan,I like many people hear have a Suicide plan(s). My thing I can’t decide is; Do I want my family to find my body or Do I just disappear?
1136,Employers burden,"Recently I watched as a colleague battled some dark days with mental health and wasn't coping well at work. They are an excellent employee and top performer but obviously burnt out and needed time to get it together to the point they wanted to resign and find a less intensive  career. I was the one who encouraged them to apply for the role as we are friends and had worked together prior so felt guilty all this was going on.

Anyway, it turns out the employer was very reluctant to grant any leave for them to try and figure out their mental health. Just like if someone was physically sick or injured would be given time off, because it was a mental health issue it was largely dismissed as something they will get over.

There was no support or empathy and it turned into a troubling attitude from the company. 

It made.me think though, alot of companies come out and say they support mental health or claim to be raising awareness but when it comes to the crunch, it's a burden on their resources and still has a stigma around it. 

What are some of your experiences with this type of behaviour?"
1137,Dangerous mental issues combinations,"A suicidal person going through depression is one of the worst thing I could ever imagine to ever happen on someone. Although I'm glad never seen one, if this such thing exist would it make the experience more extreme and hard to get through or maybe one gets less prioritized by the brain?"
1138,Unsure what to do about meds,"I’ve been on medication for my depression for about 4 years. I have PTSD and my worst symptoms are severe depression, anxiety and some mood issues. I’m on Effexor and risperdal regularly and I take a beta-blocker for my anxiety as needed. I haven’t taken them really since the pandemic started. Not being in my normal routine made it really hard for me to remember and I fell out of the habit, even with reminders. I didn’t talk to my therapist about this and haven’t talked to her at all since the pandemic started (because she can only do phone calls and I get severe phone anxiety). 

I’ve felt okay not being on my meds. But I don’t know if that’s because I’ve just been chilling at home doing my own thing, or not. I go back to work tomorrow and I’m really afraid that “real life” is going to be triggering to me and I won’t be able to cope since I’m not on my meds. Even if I start taking them now, they won’t be in my system to make a difference for a bit. 

I just don’t know if I should hold off and see how I feel without them or start taking them again. Maybe I don’t need them anymore? 

Part of me doesn’t want to take them again because I have a sex drive again and have actually been enjoying sex/being able to climax which I haven’t been able to do really since I started the meds. 

This is partially just a rant, but if anybody’s got any advice I’ll gladly listen! I know I just also need to suck it up and talk to my therapist about this all... bleh."
1139,Diagnosis,"I've been researching and watching stuff about Ron Coleman and he's led me to question whether diagnosis beneficial or does it hinder truly holistic care? 
In my mind, pros of diagnosis:
Gives people an understanding of what is going on
Can be researched and suitable treatments can be found 
But negatives are:
Labelling
Doesn't treat the person as an individual and describes a way of coping as an illness
Over-reliant on medical and maintenance models

1142,How Do I Stop Punching Myself?,"When I get mad and disappointed at myself, I tend to punch myself really hard in the head repeatedly. After I can no longer take the pain, if I'm still furious, I'll hit other parts of my body until I hit my head again and eventually just burst into tears and cry for a while.

I've tried suppressing this. Last time I felt an urge to punch myself in the head, it was like a fire of rage was burning inside me and would only be extinguished when I committed the act. I ended up doing it anyway, and even harder because I was disappointed in myself for not controlling it.

Some prevalent part of me just says, ""If you don't want to get punched, stop making stupid mistakes."" But I want this to stop. It hurts like Hell and ruins my day and makes me miserable. What can I do?"

1144,How do you handle this?,"So at a very young age I was sexually abused. It’s very interesting how the mind develops and how ingrained physical and emotional trauma can get into a person at that age, as a side note. Anyways from that point on everything was perverted and sexual based. I find myself just randomly enraged at one point and a absolute anxious mess the other. I self sabotage almost constantly. 

I’ve worked so hard on personal growth, physical appearance, music, spirituality, money, anything and everything. It still won’t go away, this itch that you can’t get to. I’m just curious how other people have handled being abused as a child. This isint so much a cry for help but some days are harder than the others and a different perspective would be nice. Much love thank you!!:)"
1145,Not sure if I should try medication again or not,"I'm 28m. when I was first in college I had a depressive episode that was really bad, the only thing that got me out of it was medication, SSRI's, the psychiatrist recommended I taper off of it just because I was doing well and wanted to see how I would do without it and I was fine without it. Over a year ago I tried the medication route again because, it seems like depression just keeps coming back

Part of me wonders if it's affected how I am so much now. What if I'm so evidently sad all the time but I don't have to be?

Anyways the quarantine has hit me super hard again. But I had struggles with it months before it...

I do go to therapy(just started a new one who I seem to like), my social life is pretty bad, my support system is basically non-existent, I live alone. I know these are all bad factors

For the past 2 or so months I've been having such horrible anxiety the moment I wake up. I've tried so much to get past it, meditating frequently, at night and the mornings once I take a shower

The last year I've giving up on medication and tried to overcome this naturally, improving my lifestyle and diet and many things... Before that, I was trying the medication route again, going to a couple different doctors, they seem to think that my anxiety was the cause of my depression. I think they are right, but all of the medications they put me on just made things worse.

What I really dislike about it is all of the side effects that can happen and have happened, then making my mood far worse, and their approach of adding on medication after medication and increasing dosages... 

I really don't know where to go from here, My depression in the past has gotten suicidal many years ago. I'm getting those thoughts again to some degree, I really don't know what to do here. I just want to be better, this half in\half out of life shit is frustrating as hell

I don't know if me avoiding the medication route is just me giving up on it, or if there really is a chance to overcome depression without medication for me... But I've tried for a year now. I've fixed my diet, exercised regularly

If I do decide to go to the medication route, the biggest obstacle is finding someone to go to who's accepting new patients (US), and I just picture myself failing at that. Furthermore, they probably won't be scheduling until months down the road, when everything has gotten worse. Then it'll be months before we try some medications and see ones that don't work, once again.

I don't know what to do or who to go to. But I feel like I keep bouncing between trying to do it myself and trying medication and none of the options seem good. And the medication route just seems like a black hole of more problems than solutions

I need help, I need advice"
1146,Replying to messages,"I know this sounds stupid, I don’t know why maybe as my anxiety has gotten worse, I physically cannot reply/ open 90% of the messages I get, be it from friends, family or teachers. This is causing me to obviously dent relationships with friends and even worse cause massive arguments in my household with my parents when I cannot reply to important messages. I don’t know if I’m scared at what they’ve said or what the outcome will be. I seem to postpone everything in my life and just let it all pile up so it gets worse."

what do i do"
1150,"I need help, I don't know what's happening to me","I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as I can but I apologize if it ends up being long - please read this, I need some help. 

I guess I'll start off by saying I heard voices in my head when I was 16, I'm now 17 and the voices had been gone for a good few months but recently (about 2-3 weeks ago) have come back but feel very different. This time it feels like there's more trickery involved in it, I only hear the voice when I'm occupied at something else so I brush it off as mishearing the music or something. But it also makes me feel like people are behind me when they aren't, or that a door is opening when it isn't. Whenever there's a window open or something it's the only thing my mind can focus on - I can feel something inside me yelling at me to close the window and it doesn't stop until I do. And another weird thing is I get very angry and irritated when people look at me, I *constantly* feel like everybody's eyes are on me and I hate it so much. 

Second thing is I have been experiencing extreme sensitivity with everything and extremely sudden lash outs of anger. My ex girlfriend who I recently broke up with replied to my little witty joke in the group chat with calling me some silly name and I took it so personally as some deep hate towards me and it instantly got so sad and angry and began to feel like I can't do this anymore and Im not cut out for living the life I'm in right now. My friends have been sending me very brief messages and i start to feel so hated and no one wants to be my friend and I just need to isolate myself from everyone. It's so extreme and I have no idea why. 

I have also recently only started to realise I have been staring a lot recently, as in I totally stop whatever I'm doing and I start to stare in front of me and I don't even realise I'm staring, it's like I'm totally unconscious because I don't see what I'm staring at either. It's like I exit the world for a second. I did it today when I was eating and when I was walking down the stairs. 

Lastly, I feel something is inside of me, controlling me to a certain degree. It's especially when I have nothing to really entertain me and I'm sitting idle I feel this thing inside me come out and it makes me feel a certain way and think certain ways and it isn't me controlling it. I can feel my real feeling and thoughts in like a dark corner and they have been pushed aside and something else takes hold of me.

I can go into more detail on an area if people want, I tried to keep it brief because I know people don't read very long posts and I really would like some help so I kept it short(ish)"
1151,Lockdown and recovering,"I feel a little better since my last post here, haven't cut myself in 2 weeks and it's nice letting the scares heal. Because of social distancing I've been at home slowly learning the guitar and it's helping alot, when ever my mind attacks me with memories or self douting I practice.
The guitar just takes my focus away from my ex and her abuse, my brother abusing me, school bullying and my feelings of being worthless and pathetic because I dont have a job, it just gives me a break. Sure it's in the background of my mind and I've had days where I feel I could just end it, and after lockdown I will seek professional help.
I hope I can get over my fear of opening up to people and get the help I need.
I'm so tired of living in fear all the time, so sick of bottling up every. I can't be afraid of interacting with women, I don't want to kill myself."
1152,Mental Health Awareness Week 2020,"[Mental Health Awareness Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N1ujqntar4)takes place between the 18th and the 24th May and arguably this is one of the most important weeks of the year so far due to COVID-19 and the effect it is having on our everyday mental health and the mental health of musicians as well, with whom we are deeply connected and have to say that the stories from such artists as Adam Lanceley as a man who lives through music following a serious accident in his youth, he is the type of musician who inspires us even beyond the amazing legends of music we have worked with, it is the likes of Adam Lanceley who embrace with music as a friend, not as a means to an end, he loves creating music for how it makes him feel and how it helps him through his everyday life and that is how it should be."
1153,What is wrong with me? Smiling depression?,"My therapist diagnosed me with moderate to severe depression. I didn’t know that I was though, but he told me that Im just raised well because I dont let it go out on other people. I’m depressed because I have a physical chronic illness, and a lot of pain. Normally I have a bubbly ENFP personality and when I sense that a depressed period is around the corner I try to be happy and do stuff as I normally would. I dont always succeed, so I guess my question is: is it normal to try and get yourself out of a depressed mindset, manage to be happy for a couple of hours and then get sad again?"
1154,I need help,"I need help, I need to get better, I need to function like an actual human, and I feel like i know where to aim that might help me most, training a skill, getting a constructive hobby, lots of people do it and feel good about themselves, it's a constructive positive feedback loop and I want in, I don't feel good about myself and never have, I'm 23 and genuinely believed for years the moral option would be to die but killing yourself is hard when you're afraid of failure and have no skills or talents.

So how do I do this? Ppl say just look for something you like but that's a problem, It's not like I haven't tried before, I've tried this so much and failed so much I've exhausted everything I had a sincere interest in and now there's just nothing that doesn't make me feel bitter, so it's not that easy. And when I do find something, how I do I follow through on it where I couldn't before? I need to do this, I need to have something I can point to when my mind goes on and on about how worthless and pointless I am or I need to work up the inebriation to kill myself, I can't keep existing like I am."
1155,I've never ever felt this down in my life and I can't escape negative thoughts and crying,"Before the story that is making me feel like shit a bit about me.
I'm generally a very happy person and always tend to look for positives, glass half full and all that.

I'm finishing university this summer and will start a graduate job in September. I will have to move to a new city and be on my own/share a house with strangers for the first time ever. I also have small worries about my job and how well I'll do in it but that's not too deep.

Until now I didn't feel too worried about it all as I knew my family and girlfriend would still live in the same city and I could come and visit anytime even if I feel lonely.

The past year I drifted apart from some of my closest friends and did mention to my gf that sometimes I feel that I don't have very many friends and that is a scary thought. I moved to where I live right now from a different country a while ago and in school I didn't make any close friends because I was kind of an odd one out due to being from another country. At university I didn't live in student accommodation as I said earlier so I didn't make as many friends as others. These things made me a bit concerned for a while now but it was never too worrying and I was still quite happy. If I was ever struggling with something badly my gf always was there to listen which was very comforting.

Then last week my gf said she wanted to break up with me. Not only did that break my heart, it also reminded me that I don't have someone very close to talk about it. I did speak to some people but it felt like they were getting bored of me being sad and I didn't wanna make them listen to me be sad constantly.

So right now I'm heartbroken because the person I thought was closest to me and who I thought was gonna be around in my life always - moving in with her soon and eventually marrying her was definitely a possibility - is gone, I don't feel very comfortable talking to anyone other than her and the thought of moving to a whole new town on my own is making me terrified. I can't focus on any positives and it's really tough, especially with a pandemic going around which makes hanging out with people or doing anything to keep myself busy impossible.

Thanks if you're still reading and any advice on how to get out of this other than giving it time would be greatly appreciated."

1158,I have exams in two weeks and I can't bring myself to study,"I'm studying Japanese at University and I'll be finishing my first year of university in two weeks. Even though I know this and that I have exams coming up, I can't bring myself to revise, whenever I decide to sit down and think ""ok. I'm going to revise"", I just end up looking at the screen doing nothing, nothing seems to go in and then an hour passes and I've accomplished nothing.

I've been trying to tell myself about how all the rewards or consequences studying or not studying for exams will give, but nothing seems to be phasing me. Nothing is motivating me to study or to better myself, but I want to better myself and study hard for this exam, not even these thoughts of wanting to succeed is helping me.

I'm scared of failing but for some reason, no matter how hard I try, I can't find the will to study"
1159,No longer depressed(?) but my life is in shambles,"For those of you who managed to claw your way out of depression and are living a now stable life, how? 
Thanks to the people in my life I can say I’m in a better place. I actually want to live now, before graduating college was my end goal so I could give my parents something before I pulled the trigger both figuratively and literally. However I’ve found someone who makes me so happy. Thanks to them I’m getting better and for some reason they are still with me. However I’ve been breaking down a lot and it’s tiring, because I actually have to get my life together also because before I was just kind of numb and didn’t really feel that many emotions. So now it’s just an overflow of emotions every tiny negative thing just destroys me. Whenever I think about the future I break down because I’ve never had to really think about it before. It was just “make it to graduation”. So I graduated with mediocre grades, have almost nothing to speak for in my resumes, don’t have anybody who can refer me (to a job or for grad school). I have no idea where to go from here. What did you guys do? How long did it take you guys?

TL;DR: Was in a bad place, now I want to get better but don’t know where to start as everything is all sorts of messed up."

1163,Failing to accepted I was “groomed”,[deleted]
1164,Failing to accept that I was groomed.,"After finally opening up to my mum and current partner about my previous relationship that ended almost 3 years ago, I found out what grooming is. My mum had mentioned it before but she didn’t realise I had no idea what that word meant. She also started seeking help because of the guilt she has for not calling the police when she found out about it.

I was 15 dating a 21 year old. We were together for 5 years and he left for someone else. The last 12 months of that relationship was extremely messy. When we broke up all I thought about were the good times we had and how much I wanted them back. But now all I remember is the terrible things that happened, the red flags I didn’t see and the stupid choices I made.

Every now and then I go through a cycle of feeling depressed about my previous relationship. Small things will trigger me and I’ll dissociate for hours on end. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t function. I spend hours in the bathtub scrubbing my skin until it bleeds because I swear I can still feel him on my skin. I use to think people were crazy when they said that, but it’s a real thing. I put off talking to a councillor because I thought they would have to report him as there’s no limitations on time when it comes to sex with minors but I’ve suffered enough and I can’t be silent about it anymore.

I feel like I wasn’t groomed. I feel like I made the decisions myself, it’s also my fault for thinking I was more mature than I really was. I didn’t let someone control my thoughts and emotions, but I made my own decisions. That I thought every time I was uncomfortable having sex, it was my influence that did it anyway, not his. I’ve spoken to other girls who were 15 when they dated someone in their 20’s and say they were groomed and now suffer from trauma they didn’t see until the relationship ended but I feel like I’m not a victim, I feel like I was just an idiot. I’m so confused on how to deal with it. 

And I don’t know what’s scarier... the fact that my ex is out there not knowing he groomed a child... or he’s out there knowing exactly what he did."

From then till now, I have been in a constant downward spiral, where I don't care about my grades until the deadline passes, and then I have anxiety problems and can't sleep at night causing worse performance in class. I just failed to turn in an extra credit option that I promised my parents and teacher I was going to do, and although I didn't care at the time, now I feel paralyzed and ashamed of myself. Does anyone have any advice for getting motivated?"
1167,How to stop being extremely irritated by my parents (mood disorder),"Sometimes I just think they say the stupidest shit and it makes me mad , or I’m exhausted, which is easy for me and I get easily irritated but I don’t want to be because even though my mom annoys me (she’s the one I typically go off on) a lot she really doesn’t deserve me saying things about it most the time and I want to be a lot nicer but I have trouble controlling anger, usually if I don’t get mad I just start crying, like how do I explain that? There’s just no way to subtle it seems without being rude or embarrassing myself. I just feel so shitty I feel it shouldn’t be so hard they really don’t deserve to deal with it."
1168,Disconnection,Lately I've just felt like I'm a 1000 miles away and I'm watching things play in front of me. I just feel like I am sad and not here and I just keep crying because I really want to feel more present. Does anyone have any advice?
1169,Obsession with stuffed animals. - Should I be concerned? - TL;DR warning,"So right off the bat, I am a 29 year old male who was diagnosed in the schizophrenia prodrome. I am being medicated with quetiapine, and that helped my delusions subside. However during the psychotic periods I got it into my head that I want to have a large stuffed animal, based on one of my favorite video game characters I grew attached to. This thought didn't subside even after I got on the medication. If anything, it got stronger even.

A little more info about me: I grew up with very little attention paid to me, and I was kind of neglected with a rather narcissistic mother who had very little patience or empathy. I was mostly passed off to therapists and quacks as a child to deal with my ever increasing repertoire of mental problems, and they tended to do more damage than good. I had no real positive relations with anyone in my family, or in school, where I always fell prey to being bullied, much like how I was bullied by my siblings. Because of my mental health issues I was home-schooled from the 4th grade on. My mother tried to put me back into regular schooling when I entered high school, but it proved to be a disaster. I didn't have the proper social skills and coping mechanisms to manage, and they managed to put me into one of the worst schools around.

I never had positive relations with almost anyone in my life. My relationship with my mother was a disaster, which was utterly shattered when I underwent a hospital examination at 11 that my later therapist told me probably had the same effects as sexual trauma, and deep down I blamed my mother for it, because there were alternative solutions, which would've allowed for the same result, but she thought I ""could handle it"". That totally shattered my trust in her.

I never had a girlfriend, or any real close friends either, not in real life. My sex drive is almost completely zero, and I am still a virgin. I was never interested in sex much, and in fact for most of my life I was haunted by horrifying nightmares that were violent and sexual in nature, and I was the victim in these nightmares. I was always scared of close relationships, to the point of panic if someone tried to get close to me. In fact, some of my delusions revolved around being lured in by some very bad people, and having my soul replaced by them, to fit their whims and needs like a servant.

After the age of 13 I totally lost any real interest in seeking out social relations, after a particularly messed up event. At the time a relative visited us sometimes to visit their sickly adoptive mother, who also bought with them a 3-4 year old child who I grew fond of, and we sometimes played together. It was the last time I tried to reach out like that to another human being, and I discovered within myself that I enjoy the company of kids. As a child I frequently daydreamt about having a younger brother or sister who I could treat with love and affection.

However my family started acting oddly around me, I obviously got the notion that they thought I had ill intentions towards this child, and once my youngest brother even flat-out asked me if I had thoughts of fucking the child. It did not help that at the time I would literally get a boner from any damn thing, be it petting a cat, or from physical contact with anyone. I didn't understand it, and nobody enlightened me of these things. Anyway, I told him that what he said was disgusting, but I guess it ended up unleashing a chain of events inside my head. 

Long story short, my own demons sabotaged that relationship by making it more and more uncomfortable for me, and I cut it off completely in the end, because my demons kept punishing me for it. It ended in one night where I prayed to God to save my soul from what was trying to get me. After that, I just completely stopped trying to reach out, I lost all my desire to try and form relationships in real life. I became an extreme schizoid and I avoided people as much as possible. To this day, being in close proximity to children, especially small children, gives me great anxiety.

However when I started showing symptoms of psychosis four years ago, some of my delusions revolved around being visited by the ""Angels of God"" who treated me like family... gave me hugs, treated me like family, and provided physical comfort. It was weird. That's around the time where I started drawing stuffed animals. I started imagining what it would be like to be surrounded by these characters who I grew fond of, and having them around for comfort.

So recently I bought a large stuffed cat, and it didn't stop there. I wanted to order a specially made stuffed animal based on a video game character I got attached to, which I eventually did. I thought up another character who is in the 2 years age range, and I ordered that one too, based on a design I made for him. All of these stuffed animals are quite big, about 80cm tall.

However I am uncertain about whether I am doing the right thing. It just seems so odd for a 29 year old man to want stuffed animals. Am I going down a psychological rabbit-hole perhaps that will lead me to no good? Truth is, I felt compelled to order these stuffed animals, almost feeling like I had to do it, that I must do it. It was all I could think of.

What do you think? Is what I'm doing unhealthy, or is this some odd coping mechanism at work? Is this my mind's weird attempt at fixing whatever was broken inside of me?"
1170,Is this what anxiety and panic is?,"I've always struggled with my mental health and have had issues since I was a kid but have never been medically treated.
I'm in my late 20s now and for the past few months I've started feeling breathlessness and tightness in my chest whenever something affects me emotionally, usually when someone I'm close to says something which upsets me and it takes about 10-15 mins for me to calm down. Sometimes this also includes hiccups type tiny non-stop burps.

Apart from this, sometimes I suddenly start crying and panicking, this doesn't happen when talking to anyone, it just randomly happens anytime anywhere without any involvement of another person.

Am I getting panic attacks? Am I suffering from anxiety?"
1171,Question for anyone currently on Effexor (Venlafaxine),"I've been on 75mg Effexor daily, along with adderall 20mg and bupropion 100mg daily. I had previously gone cold turkey without my medication for quite a while due to living and financial situations that I won't go into, the point I'm getting at is that I experienced the full magnitude of an SSRI/SNRI withdrawal.  


My actual question for those that are also on Effexor or similar combinations as me, have you ever experienced withdrawal symptoms while still taking your medication? I've been dealing with clear withdrawal symptoms for the past two days despite taking my medication at the regular time I always do in the morning. I'm not sure why this is happening and google isn't much help. Any advice or info would be appreciated!"

1173,Signs You Might Be Suffering from Depression,"Sadness, depression, feeling down, not up for it — these are some of the phrases that are very often used interchangeably. However, only one of these words or phrases mean that you are suffering from depression. That word is depression. Thanks to pop culture and its extremely free usage of the word “depression,” we often misconstrue sadness as also a mental illness. But you don’t need [depression therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) if you are just feeling sad, or not up for a day at work. That essentially means that your mood is different, and that it is temporary. Here is an easier way to understand the difference between “feeling down” and “depression.” If a tub of ice cream can fix it, you are not suffering from depression. Depression is a form of mental illness which requires treatment, and in some cases, medications. Yes, a tub of ice cream helps in every case, but helping and fixing are two completely different concepts. Mood swings that people suffering from depression go through are a lot more severe than your average mood swing. The key is to know when you are just “feeling sad” and when that sadness takes up a permanent place inside your brain. 

Before we dive deep into the different signs of depression, it is worth noting that depression, and level of depression varies incredibly from person to person. There are no set guidelines to detect depression in every individual ever. However. Some signs are a lot more common than others and often, can help understand whether a person needs [depression help](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/). One of the most common signs is weight loss or change in appetite. Now, worth noting again is that sudden weight loss or change of appetite can also occur because of other factors like stress. Hence, the key here is to dial back the sequence of events and understand the cause of it. More than that, if you are someone who knows this person, just have a conversation with them. Understand their pain, their problems and see how you can help. Often, people suffering from a mental illness never gather the courage themselves to seek help. Hence, a support system is extremely important. 

Another common telltale sign of depression is a loss of interest in daily activities like former hobbies, socialising, and more. Now, just because someone dislikes socialising does not mean they are depressed. It must be a sudden change from their normal behavioural pattern. In such cases, it is worth heading to a therapist for help. Because like we mentioned above, a tub of ice cream can help you, not fix you. [Depression counseling in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) is extremely commonplace, and in fact it is a lot more feasible across major Indian cities. So, if you feel like you know someone who is showing signs of depression, talk to them. Ask them what they are feeling and offer to help them out. Sometimes, just knowing that you have someone to lean on can help a great deal."
1174,Wanna yell at him.,"I want to yell at someone I was interested in to understand that you need to get to know someone before you judge them, and don’t hurt another persons  feelings you don’t know because you never know what happen to them. 

It hit me mental health but I told myself I wouldn’t go backwards. 

He had an open relationship he probably closed closed after this. His girlfriend had someone and he didn’t, it was one sided. 

He called me some pretty hurtful things without knowing me and the feeling inside was horrible. I’m “used” to hearing these things, it all men ever think about me and always wonder why they do almost every time or every other time. If he were to be out with me he’d get the first hand experience of being called some of those things and see how he’s not an exception but he can “relate” to this men, and see what it looks like from the inside looking out. 

Mental health isn’t a joke, don’t play with it and make fun. 

His girlfriend wasn’t any better let’s just say her jealous radar and otherwise was going off. 

I want him to also know that I’m enough woman for a man. I’m the type of woman a man would want, but if you’re telling me I’m not then you aren’t the man you think you are. 

All sounds too familiar. I think I really blew my expectations for myself out the water, I’m excited and proud of what I will/would say. I hope I’m successful in my mental health recovering journey and otherwise."

He had pancreatic cancer. 2 months after diagnosis, he died. 
He did not go peacefully. I was not there. I feel guilty. 


The only moment I really cried was when he was already dead. I was afraid to touch him, but I did it anyway. The panic and pain came over me like a wave. I started hyperventilating, and almost passed out. 


During the funeral I was only comforting my mother. She leans heavily on me for support. No one else sat beside her or comforted her. I had to do it alone. He already had children, and their partners, we are close with, whom could have sat around her with me.

This is particularly messed up for me because as I kid I had to take care of her. She was depressed and I was her caregiver.

1178,Stuck in a job with no support and I'm really struggling.,"If you look on my post history you will see that at the end of February I had an issue at work where I was ghosted twice for job opportunities in the company. Long story short, off the back of Reddit's advice I started applying for jobs elsewhere as I felt they had no interest in helping me progress. Then... COVID-19 happened.

Jobs that I had applied for disappeared and now on the job sites I used to use, there's little available to apply for. That is to be expected, but it does mean that I am now stuck in this role which is getting worse. I work in a small team and we are now two people down, which is a lot when you don't directly work with a lot of people in the first place! Therefore the pressure has been ramped up on us that are left. We are overwhelmed with the amount of work given and to be honest, massively behind. There's been little support offered to the team and it does feel like we're actively left out of decisions and discussions because of the entry level nature of the role. I've been struggling with my mental health for about 6 months now and I can feel it getting worse and worse as the days go by. We're working remotely due to a lockdown being implemented in the UK, and it has been a challenge to say the least! I'm actually not struggling much with the lockdown in itself, but the demands of the job are really taking a toll and I don't know where to turn. I have considered handing my notice in, which obviously would not be ideal in this pandemic but I do have some money saved that would allow me to coast by for a few months - by which point, hopefully, jobs will start to open up again. It would of course be better if I can hold out until then, but the thought of that overwhelms me at the moment.

I have a poor sleep pattern, and wake up every morning dreading the day and wishing it away. I don't know what to do at this stage and it's starting to affect the quality of work that I do and my home life. As I say, it is an entry level role, and I perhaps shouldn't let it affect me as much as I do, but here we are.

I'm at the end of my rope. What would you do in my situation? Thank you in advance for any advice you might have."
1179,going to get a diagnosis to see if i have add/anxiety,"Ive been thinking about it for a while but my mom has just told me that i do not have any of these.

Im zoning out while i type this actually. I constantly loose my train of thought I always have to stop and look away to remember it. Recently I have just been feeling so overwhelmed and i dont even know why. I hope i dont sound stupid to you guys because who knows i might be completely normal but i just wonder sometimes. What if there was really something wrong with me that can be tamed. what if i could be better in my studies? what if i can get out of my head for once and take things slow and easy. What if i can talk to people? and be happy, stop worrying all the time and be in the present moment. My mom might have gotten the notification that i set up an appointment to get a diagnosis and she might tell me that there is nothing wrong with me. My whole family might call me stupid or over reacting because of this. They might just convince me to cancel it. who knows. because i certainly don't know.

1180,Feeling like shit during confinement,"I've been feeling more depressed than usual because of the pandemic. When it first started, I made myself wake up early and I'd structure out my days, and I even worked out. Now I can't bring myself to do any of those. I hate waking up in the morning, my days are dull and it's still cold outside so I can't really spend much time outdoors. If it were warmer I'd go on bike rides but for now I'm stuck inside. I used to paint and draw a lot, now I mostly watch YouTube and play video games, and it doesn't help. I found out that schools won't reopen until September, and the thought of living like this for 4 more months has me feeling terrible. Plus the thought of not having a graduation or prom.

1181,Fear of death is ruining my life,"I've made quite a few posts here on Reddit kinda of addressing this fear but not directly, basically is coming to a point where this is all I think 80% of the time, and it's impacting all my relationships, from girlfriend to friends. And I need some help on how to mitigate this fear. Please help me.
Here are a list of things that may aid you on your response.
I've had this fear before, what made it stop back then is founding out I'm bipolar which took all my attention for about 2 years, and the fear came back with the coronavirus outbreak. ( I don't know if there's any correlation ).
I've had many conditions over the years: depersonalization, traces of OCD, diagnosed as bipolar unspecified, have a few psychotic symptoms, have had hppd but cured, history of drug and alcohol abuse, and have a form of anxiety disorder but my doctor never told me which.
List of things that I tried that helped:
- distraction ( games, sex, and reading about drugs)
- facing the fear directly ( try acknowledging the end of my existence and being ok with it )
- exposure therapy ( watching shows about death and trying not to freak out )
- distancing myself from the fear ( from now on to the people in my life, I only acknowledge it as the virus )
List of things that didn't help: 
- talk about the fear with irl people ( only damaged my relationships )
- talk therapy ( we basically walked around in circles )
- meditation ( although I only did about 10 sessions, that few didn't help it )
- meds ( I've tried increasing the dosage of my current meds and it didn't work , also try adding a benzo It didn't work as well, for more specifics if you think it would help it, please ask )
What worked in someways but in others didn't ;
- spirituality ( when it didn't cross the barrier of science it helped, but when it's gotten too mystical I don't buy it anymore )
Also I've had religious experiences in the past with Buddhist meditation, but don't seem to be able to get one now, so I'm coming back to being a pure atheist.


I think that's about it, if someone could please help me, I would be forever grateful, anything goes ( philosophys, meds recommendation, therapy recommendation, life advice, how to take action, anything )"
1182,My memory is shit,Or at least I think it is. Most of the time I cant remember what I did like a minute or two ago and then I gotta think if I did something and sometimes I make myself believe I did something or not. It drives me crazy thinking about what I did like seconds ago. I cant remember the things I did unless I’m thinking about it before hand.  I also cant remember when my memory got like this. I forget things that used to be habit for me. Is this me being paranoid about it or could be something wrong? I know I’m only 14 and I shouldn’t have problems with memory but idk.
1183,Over a year since I nearly jumped off a bridge. Its been a tough journey but glad I'm alive to see all the other great things in my life,"17th March 2019 : 2am

I sat on a bridge, drunk and alone, really ready to end it there and then. I just got embarrassed in front of my friends that my ex girlfriend (we broke up a month) had screamed at a house party how much she fucked the guy I knew she was cheating me with. 3 years down the tube.

I nearly done it, till I got a phone call... My friends running after me to say not do it! If it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here. I got tackled to the ground and they made me snap out of it and laugh. I came out of it.

The breakup still affects me till this day, I have severe depression from it, as my trust and niceness got taken for a ride and exploited in the worst way possible. I always feel I'm never good enough and she was right to cheat on me.

Im just glad I'm alive to visit America, to see my nephew and plan to buy a house. I'm still single and will for a very long time as I get extreme anxiety but I'm working on it."

[The New Normality of Lockdown- COVID 19](https://bloomingsimply.com/the-normality-of-lockdown-covid-19/)"
1187,How can I choose to be myself if the person I am deep down is someone unloveable?,"Kinda long but I just wanted to let it all out...

I used to be a very outgoing extroverted kid. I was very hyper all the time and talked nonstop. I grew up thinking that was normal until I noticed I was really annoying that's why I was bullied all the time. I didn't realize how annoying I was until 3 years ago when I got into 11th grade. During my entire high school I kept playing the victim cuz I didn't understand why everyone was being mean to me. I became very clingy to the few genuine relationships I had back then, I kept being mistrustful and basically just waiting and accusing them for the moment they show the slightest bit of behaviour that mirrored my bullies. 


In 11th grade I moved to another school, I focused hard on my studies and hobbies and tried to cut off people entirely as much as possible. The loud kid who made jokes in elementary suddenly became this quiet smart girl who only speaks to recite in class. And guess what? They all liked it. People finally respected me enough to include me in conversations. I just wanted to be treated like everyone else but suddenly I'm put on this pedestal and people are intimidated by me, they gave me so many responsibilities I never dreamed of having but I felt too afraid to say no because if I did maybe they would hate me the way I was hated before I became the smart kid. 

I didnt really like any of these responsibilities they gave me. Like being leader of group projects, helping them with assignments, playing major roles in class activities. I just liked that I was finally being treated right and people noticed me. So I started making new close friends. I tried to keep my new persona whenever I was with them but eventually they got me to warm up to them. And I got afraid. I started going back to my old toxic habits on purpose to drive them away before I hurt them which is funny because I literally hurt them intentionally so I dont have to hurt them when I didnt mean to??? It was bad but I was happy that they got away before I ruined them. 

I realized that maybe my new persona wasnt the thing that made everyone in my new school like me, maybe they were all genuinely good people unlike the ones in my old school and I just didnt know how to react to that. Maybe I havent changed. I just lied to myself that I did. 

I pushed everyone away because I'm sure they're all just going to leave me once they get to know the real me. I cant love the real me but it also hurts to pretend to be someone else. The other day I found myself stuttering when I spoke to someone. I was amazed. Since when did I stutter? I used to say the most obnoxious shit in high school with a straight face. I dont understand who I've become. 

I live in a small town where there arent very many psychiatrists and mental health is taboo so seeking professional help is non existent here. My parents are strict and religious so I really cant turn to them. In fact, I am also lying to them. They want me to be a lawyer thats why I'm taking up a course they want but I really feel like I want to study art more. I know I wont earn as much with art but it's something I really enjoy. 

It's like I always have to choose between being myself and disapppointing others. I cant even love or forgive myself. Whenever someone decent appears in my life I take out all my pent up emotions on them just because they let me like they've become my personal outlet. Which is bad and I hate myself for it so I pushed everyone away. I'm just so tired of wanting to be selfish. Maybe the only way to stop desiring things that will hurt others is when I'm dead. 

I cant focus on my hobbies anymore because I think ""whats the point? If I keep this up everyone will be disappointed in me."" 

I wish I could please everyone i care about and be myself at the same time. That's impossible though. I dont want to choose. I just want to run away. 

I've been living in fear my whole life, I dont know how else to be. Even fear is the only thing keeping me alive because I'm afraid of dying.

What can I even do at this point?"
1188,How do you learn from a mistake without tormenting yourself with it?,"I tend to replay mistakes in my head thinking ""I should have done this, why didn't I realize that"" but I never come to a satisfactory conclusion where I feel better prepared for the next time, I just feel shame and fearful of everyone that witnessed it"
1189,Online survey on mental wellbeing,"We are a team of researchers at Durham University, currently running an online survey on social relations and mental wellbeing, would appreciate very much if you could participate and/or pass the link to people (18+) you know:  [https://durhamsociology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_3Fd1wmwtStHkhG5](https://durhamsociology.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Fd1wmwtStHkhG5) Thank you!"
1190,When I try to tell someone how I feel I lose feeling,"I will breakdown and cry sometimes and not be able to get help or my mom, I cannot talk about how I feel out loud without my feelings going away, or feeling like I’m being manipulative or lying. Recently I was about to just go to my mom while crying and lay down by her and not say anything but when I finally got up to go do it and made up my mind I stopped crying and felt “blank” then cried about how I could never tell anyone how I really felt or get a comfort hug from my mom and the cycle just kind of kept happening. What is this? Why can’t I tell or explain how I feel to my mom? How do I when this keeps happening?"
1191,What should I tell my boss who asked how he can support me with my depression?,"I've been struggling with my depression hard lately. My boss, who I would say is more robot than human emotionally, is asking what he can do to help and support me. What's a good thing to respond to him with?"
1192,How to deal with my mother,"I have gained a lot of weight in past year.... I have been going through a lot, I dated a man for about 2 years, we were starting to fix marriage and then one day he ran away, I was pregnant at that time and he forced me to get abortion and next day he just left, after months of trying to find and talk to him I found out that he coned me he took all of my money and stole everything I bought for my rented home.... I got depressed a lot was ready to take my life ... So i sought help but the doc prescribed a lot of meds that had worse effect on me I could not even move look up I lost all of my will, my eye sight got worse, I started to forget things I had no idea where I was for most of time, I was constipated for 2 months.... I was hell, so I changed doctor and he changed the prescription, but I started to gain weight, one day I got killing pain in my stomach, so we got ultrasound and found out that I have fatty liver and fabroid in my uterus.. now I can't even walk for 5 mins without heart pains and painting, I hate my self rite now,I used to lift 40 50 kg without even sweating, I could walk for hours... So my issue here is my mother know all about this she knows I can't even drink water without getting stomach ache, she knows about my IBS, fatty liver, fabroid and even how depressed im, I have not talked to other human being in 7 months, I have not talked to them in months and we live together, I have not been present at all, and today I was in better mood, I recognize how fat I have gotten and tried to talk to her and after dinner I was very bloated it was hurting so I pointed it out to her and her response was her showing how slim she is rite now, and how bad I look, and now I have been feeling like ugly crying I know I look like shit, everyone has been pointing it out to me, I want to get better, but when I say I want to join gym or go out they belittle me and then I just sit there saying nothing and hating being fat . I want to tell her to just shut up about her beauty for once she just love her, but hate everyone else she has rejected marriage offer for me because someone from the family was not beautiful,. How can I respond to that as I don't know how to say anything..."
1193,I feel like I easily upset anyone around me,"I feel really bad for anyone around me when I'm not in the best mood because whenever I get upset, I would make the air around us extremely heavy and full of tension (not even on purpose) and make it hard for them to enioy something because of me not being able to properly let go or at least hide my discomfort when most people would definitely be able to mask it up well and not ruin anything for anyone they are with, and I have no control over it, and to add to that I do usually get upset easily, might be just me being sensitive or undiagnosed mental problems (I have no way of getting help because of my family) but in any case I feel like this part of me is extremely toxic and I hate it.

And I know someone might say ""just talk about it then, you shouldn't hide anything"" you gotta remember many times I could be upset because of something stupid and bringing it up would make the situation worse. For example; what I usually do whenever I'm on call with my  boyfriend and I get upset with him or something that doesn't even have to do with him, I just say ""i'll go lay down"" or ""give me like 10 minutes to cool off"" and then the feeling kinda naturally goes away and I feel more relaxed, however, whenever there's no outlet to go and ""cool off"" especially if you are outside I do a bad job of  hiding my feelings and I feel it makes the other person just as upset."
1194,Experience With Talkspace,"I signed up for Talkspace so I could talk to someone professional during quarantine. I have so far not enjoyed it. I joined to vent all the things I don't want to make my friends listen to, and receive some helpful advice or insights. I feel like my assigned therapist doesn't read anything I write! Her responses are sporadic and very short, and are rarely related to anything I said. Last night I was feeling especially anxious so I spilled my guts to my talkspace therapist. This morning, she responded to my several long and detailed messages with ""Good morning!"" and nothing else. I am very confused!! I feel like I am talking to a very badly programmed AI. Has anyone else had a similar experience or a better one?"
1195,I keep feeling angry,"I just constantly have this rage at everything and i keep getting annoyed by everyone, my friends, my family. Where is all this anger coming from"
1196,I'm literally shivering rn,[removed]
1197,i got barely 2 months to pass a class that i need to pass no matter what,"alright so basically i’ve been failing math all year at around the 40% mark and currently i’m sitting at a 42%. obviously i don’t want to fail but a big thing is my parents and the pressure and stress they give me. So my mom is saying how i need to pass and just try to get it up to a 50% at least so i pass and then there’s my dad who is saying to do 10k questions a day and redo them over and over (not even kidding or exaderatting) anyways the current unit we are doing is like area or something and i don’t understand a thing we are doing and nothing is making sense to me and school online since the virus is making it so much harder to follow along and continue. i’m not sure what to do all i know is that i need to somehow find out what we are doing, find a way to learn it all and get up to a passing grade before i lose everything i own 
any help?"
1198,A nice positive message in harsh times,"Hello everybody, I really hope I'm not breaking the subreddit rules (and in case I am please remove the post), I just wanted to share a video on how to look at the current coronavirus situation with a positive and healthy mindset that promotes making the best out of a bad situation. The video is surely not well made/edited, but it really helped some friends of mine who are struggling so I thought it might be useful for other people.   
Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC3e15BAwuc).  
I wish you all a great day!!"
1199,I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way."
1200,"That scumbag in the back of your head, always in your ear, telling you that you can't, you're not good enough, to give up, they're going to laugh at you, that you suck, or that you're going to fail. Fuck that guy! You are good enough, people WILL help you, and you CAN do it!","It doesn't mean you have to be **perfect**, or that *everything* is *always* going to be sunshine, feel good sunshine, and roses, and that you can't let people know that you aren't doing well, or that you need help. But there are a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with ***that*** douche in your head! I've had my own struggles with mental health, and constantly having negative thoughts, but I've put in the effort to work through it, and learn how to cope, and deal with it. If I can do it, most of the time.

**You can fucking do it too!** Some helpful things I've learned. I don't have the answers, but these mechanisms have helped me personally.

**Thoughts** can't *actually* hurt you, yes I understand mental health presents itself in a large variety of forms, and yes I understand some are **incredibly** detrimental a person's well being, as well as short term, and longterm health, which can, and **does** impact people's physical health as well. Not even to mention more immediate physical ways they manifest, panic attacks being just one example, that can be absolutely extremely wretched to experience first hand in the moment. But...

Just a single negative thought, even many, they don't actually cause any physical harm to your body. Yes, I understand that people do hurt themselves, cutting, pulling hair, beating, and more. But just a thought by itself, doesn't preset any physical harm to you.

**Another** possible coping mechanism, is try too imagine yourself from the outside. You can do this by either imagining yourself standing outside of your body looking back at yourself, or you are someone else looking at yourself, or if it helps more, look at other people. While you might be experiencing negative thoughts, looking at yourself from the outside, there doesn't really seem to be anything wrong. Or same by looking at other people, at the store, sitting in traffic, someone walking by on the sidewalk, your friend's. They may or may not be having some negative thoughts, but by looking at them in the moment, you could never tell. Again, a single negative thought doesn't cause you any direct physical harm.

**None** of us can stop from having intrusive thoughts, be them negative, potentially harmful, or other depressing types of thoughts. But, you **don't** have to focus on them, thoughts come and go, just like your negative thoughts, you have plenty of good thoughts (perhaps not in more extreme cases), but most of us tend to let those pass relatively easily, only to move on to another thought, or something else to occupy that void in our mind. But you can also *learn* how to allow thoughts to just show up, and **know** that you don't **have** to focus on them. You can just let it linger, and sooner or later, it will go away. Focusing on our negative thoughts helps aid that asshole that likes to constantly fuck with us, by just know that Chad is going to show up, be an asshole for a while, then leave, can help you just ignore that mother fucker.

**Lastly**, it's okay to not feel okay, or amazing, or always be in a positive mindset, smiling, and just be that upbeat person that everyone *thinks* is just in the most amazing place, and wishes they were just like them. We all have down days, negative thoughts, feeling very low, and many other negative thoughts, and emotions we dwell on. But finding coping mechanisms, be it just the few I posted above, or seeking out more help from professionals ( I am not one, this is just from my own personal experience) can get you to a place where you're not letting that douche in your head win all of the time. And even when he does, it's a small victory, and one that you know will pass, and you will move on, and at some point feel better, and know that in the moment, it's okay to not feel okay.

I know this is a hard time for **a lot** of people, and **a lot** of people have much more severe mental health issues that they need professional, medical, expert help. It will take much more than telling the Chad in their head to fuck off, and medication when properly prescribed can do wonders for these types of people, and there are a lot of them/us. I truly hope everyone can get the help they need, especially during these times where people might be more vulnerable than normal.

But I hope this helps at least one person, or that someone shares it with a friend, loved one, or just general acquaintance that they know could potentially benefit from this. We can all use a little help, and kindness right now. So reach out, be it to ask for help, or to offer help.

1201,Understanding Teen Suicidal Ideation,"Check out this video on Teen Suicidal Ideation

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdC9gr9bg6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdC9gr9bg6M)

Sometimes living your day-to-day life can seem really hard. Sometimes, when life gets difficult, you may start to believe that it will never get better. In those moments with so much going on, it is easy to lose hope about the future. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, but sometimes those feelings can become so heavy that you begin to think about ending your life as a way to make the thoughts stop or to escape.   

Suicide may seem like your only option to escape your pain, but there are other ways to relieve your pain or emotional distress. Although life may seem dark right now, it can get better! You matter."
1202,"The story of where i ended up, and what i can do now.","Okay, so i'm 13 and ive been in a Psych hospital 3 times, testing place 1 time, Therapeutic boarding school 1 time. and here at this Therapeutic Boarding school(Called Cherry Gulch) i've been on Leg Up 6  times, run watch twice, and Suicide watch 4 times. i was this close to jumping off Tiger's Rock. this happened not so long ago. since then, every day,. always around dinner, negative feelings trickle into me. i can't get them out. i've been upset alot recently, mostly about my life choices. Now that im at school designed to help me, life has been somewhat better but still i dont see myself changing and transforming in 2 years. sure my brother could, but i can't. this just makes me really upset."
1203,An urge to destroy myself,"I don't remember when this happened, but i developed an urge to destroy myself. I want to drugs, the worst kinds (i smoke cigarettes and weed everyday) - coke, lean, heroine, crack - whenever i can get my hands on one. I want to completely drown myself in drugs, numb every single feeling I have. Just completely blank myself out to the world, to friends and to families. I sometimes have fantasies to hurt myself, my only reason for working out is that it causes me pain. (Although i have never considered suicide as an option). i often drink alcohol so much, 2 or 3 friends have to control my violent urges to hurt myself. Its not as if I don't have enough in life to be content and happy, i just have too much anger inside me all the time which rarely ever comes to surface - except when i'm very drunk or high. I have vivid nightmares every night, and i am trouble going to sleep every day."
1204,Overthinking and toxic thoughts,"I have mood swings and I feel like I'm on a pendulum swaying back and forth between good days and bad days. 

On the good days, I'm a fun person to hang out with, Ill have lots of energy to jump around (literally jump around, they gave me a title of ""Jumping bean"" in HS graduation) All in all, I am happy. 

On the bad days though, I'm completely opposite. I won't have energy at all to do anything. I'll be pissed off all the time, and feel like crying. My brain over thinks, over thinks and over thinks. The smallest things will turn to something big in my brain. Something someone said a while ago to hurt me can bring me to tears. I put distance between me and people especially friends. I have toxic thoughts all the time on bad days and it's like a voice in my head that won't shut up. Telling me those friends of mine aren't real and bringing up any bad memories or little arguments we had. And then theres me trying to reason with the voice. Trying to remind myself of all the good things they did and all the times they helped me. But when you feel your head is filling with toxic thoughts, I can't reason with it anymore. My friends notice the difference on my bad days which confuses them to say the least.

So I found my solution. I write down all the good things, all the good memories about each person in my friend group on my good days. (including myself, because sometimes the voice makes me hate myself). So that when my bad days come, I can read out what I wrote and try to reason better with the voice. It's working so far and stops me from self-sabotaging all my relationships.

Does anyone else relate to this or tried this before?"
1205,I can’t stop thinking about dying,I do not want to die. I am terrified of growing older and eventually dying. There is nothing that I can do to stop time. I think about it every day multiple times a day and my heart races and I get sad. I think about all of the the things time will eventually take from me. I think about my cats dying. I think about my boyfriend dying. I think about what the pain will be like when that time comes. I think about what it will be like for him if I die first. What if one of us dies early? Before I know it I’ll be 30 then 50 and eventually gone and I will be nothing. I don’t know how to deal with these feelings or how to get them to go away.
1206,What do you do when you want to do everything but you cant do anything,"I (21m) know I'm talented and smart and have lots of potential, but most days I feel like I cant get myself to do anything. 

Not just like I dont want to do anything, I do! I really do! But its as if I'm tied to my bed or couch. It's like there are invisible walls over everything I care about.

I feel like every time I get up to do something the wind is swept from me and I just want to crawl back in bed.

When I do force myself to do something I usually do it unwell and feel horrible the entire time and then just want to disappear.

It's been bad my entire life, but since quarantine it's gotten worse. Cleaning my room, doing the laundry, showering and eating feels impossible. Working on my books and art and career seem like fairy tales.

I simply dont know what to do, I dont know what's wrong with me."
1207,Suggestions for Publishing Recovery Story,"Hi, 

From last October to February this year I participated in a local NHS project named Write On Recovery. The aim of the project was for volunteers to participate in 10 creativity workshop sessions with a view to producing a Recovery Story at the end, a story that described their experience dealing with mental health. 

With the arrival of Coronavirus, the intention of the lead facilitator to seek to have the stories published on the NHS website will now not be fulfilled and as such, I now have a story with which I'm not too sure what to do. 

I am aware that Mental Health week is on the horizon and so my questions is, does anybody have any suggestions for organisations that may be willing to publish it? Or more generally what I could do? 

Here is a sample: 

*Fatalism strips you of confidence, it causes you to seek relief at every opportunity. It darkens the future and stoops your posture. It hollows your life of meaning and purpose. It corrupts your actions and erodes resolve; it blinds you to joy and dulls your senses. It amplifies aches and pain, intensifies your flaws and cripples your strengths. You retreat and retreat, but can never find shelter.*   

Any thoughts are much appreciated."
1208,Psychiatrist said I have ADD but have no support from parents,"Hello, 

Well, as it says in the title, I (20m) was told I had add by a psychiatrist and by a psychologist. I don't know tho because a lot of things just seem to happen to everyone.

Anyway, I have big dreams and have been called lazy for the past 6 years, even though I have had some success in things I'm interested in. However, I have a BIG problem with productivity, I really do nothing productive and have done nothing since I was in middle school.

As I said, I want to achieve a lot of things I may be able to achieve, but I have a really hard time trying to work on them. I thought something might be wrong and it's not just that I'm super lazy, so I went to the psychologist, who told me I had add and should go with a psychiatrist, who told me the same thing and gave me strattera (it made me feel very tired so I stopped taking it). When I told my father, (who supports me financially) he went ballistic. He doesn't believe in add nor psychologists and thinks it's my mom influencing me to somehow affect both me and him.

My mom makes very little money and the medicine and doctor are very expensive. I have not gone with the psychiatrist again and will not ask her to help me with this because I know it will put her in an even worse financial situation for something that may be very mild and it turns out I'm actually just lazy.

So, I have no money to pay for a psychiatrist nor meds and can't be helped by my parents with it.

Do you have any advice on how I could approach this problem? I would love to face this problem (add) I might have by myself without having to pay for things I simply can't.

Thank you very much!"
1209,I'm ready (TW: Suicide),"I gave myself an ultimatum last year that if by July 2020 I'm still struggling mentally, I will give up. A lot of improvements happened since then but 2020 just had to be really shitty. It's been two months since I last got out of the house, and I'm often alone with my dark thoughts. My country is handling the pandemic pretty badly, and news of how the government can be so incompetent and inhumane has been a staple everyday. A friend recently died of suicide and triggered my suicidal tendencies. Add to that, I'm having frequent arguments with my partner and it often turns ugly. Tonight was pretty bad. I told him that I'm depressed and want to give up on the world, and he answers by basically invalidating my feelings and saying that I am not struggling. I then turned my back to him and he got angry and cursed at me. I thought to myself that this is the last straw. I cannot take any of this anymore. I have made peace with the idea that I will die tonight, even have suicide letters written. I just feel so alone and don't feel like I can ever belong anywhere. I feel like I'm doing everyone a favor by getting rid of me in their lives. If you've gotten this far, I'm sorry that you had to read all that."
1210,Eating noises making me upset,"When ever someone starts eating in a quiet area my get annoyed and uncomfortable. For example ASMR of eating food is torture for me.

I am aware this is unreasonable to make others eat differently. But I cannot be around others in that compacity. What should I do to control these thoughts. 

In a comment of a other post of mine someone suggested I have symptoms of OCPD.

**I have not been dignoiaed with anything but major depressive disordor and disgraphia.**"
1211,exhausted,"""you have to wake up for school"", ""finish ur meal, you know you have to eat more"", ""try harder"" is what i hear from my family every fucking day. but i don't wanna wake up, i don't wanna eat, and i don't wanna try harder. what's the point if i plan on killing myself anyways? don't they realise?  i don't care about my future because i don't want to be here and i won't. the fact that i know how much money goes into doctors, therapy, meds etc makes me feel even more guilty. just let me go. im just a burden to myself and you all as well. let me die for fuck's sake."
1212,It's been one year!,"I've showered every day for one year. I've done two Duolingo lessons every day for one year. I've gone to bed by 10:30PM and woken up before 9AM every day for one year. I've walked at least 7km a week for one year. I've been to 12 anxiety/depression group sessions, and I haven't missed a single dose of my 2x daily meds. I haven't self-harmed or made any plans to end everything, and I've made a couple new friends along the way.

These kind of achievements sound silly to people in my life offline, but I know that you guys will recognize how difficult it has been to reach this goal. I've failed in a few places - I didn't reach a healthy weight, start jogging, or take time to meditate every day - but I didn't think I could get this far. Showering every day has been the most difficult of all. (I'm putting off showering right now, lol.)

I can't promise myself that I won't stumble and break this record, but I know that I can keep trying. My goal for Year 2 is to keep a short daily journal, eat healthier, and aim for walking 12km a week. Here's to one year."
1213,Urge of using symbols instead of words,"What’s the right subreddit to post this? 

Recently , when I’m studying and certain words show up I feel the urge to do a specific symbol my brain has made up. So I’m starting to just go with it, I also made a tiny list in case I somehow get confused with a symbol later on (I doubt, for me the symbols are super clear and some have been stuck for some time unconsciously, it’s weird... like I can’t think of them, they have to come on their own.) 
But refrained from doing more than 10. For today.

I’m afraid this will affect my linguistics abilities or any cognitive ability.... 

like... this is super primitive ... we evolved from that for a reason.... 
and no, it’s not like Japanese, they have their own semantic and grammar. 
I’m just like “activate/active is *whatever symbol*” :("
1214,I feel alone but not lonely. Do I have social anxiety?,Like the “alone” bit is a problem as much as the lack of need to find connection with people. I was diagnosed with bipolar but I wouldn’t say I had problems with depression. Overall I am pretty high functioning. I’ve just had the odd manic episode which royally fucks things up. I feel very different to people like I always feel like there’s something wrong with me or I’m not somehow measuring up enough. I have a gf and I hate burdening her with this and I don’t want to feel like she isn’t good enough because she is. It’s like I’m always self analysing myself and recently I’ve thought perhaps I have some sort of social anxiety. I don’t get into situations that make me nervous anymore so it’s hard to tell but they definitely exist. I get a lot of dread for some social occasions and I’ve been told I’m quiet by some people. I know I can be a loudmouth to people I’m close to though. I will give more details to anyone who wants it. Thanks
1215,“Appreciate that you don’t have the hiccups now”,"I sometimes tell myself this or something similar when I’m trying to practice mindfulness. It’s almost like saying that any situation could be worse, but I find my version more concrete.

Of course I thought of it sometime when I had the hiccups, and I noticed that the only time I would think about how I dislike the having hiccups is when I had them.

So now I try to remind myself every morning that I don’t currently have the hiccups. The little things mean everything sometimes :)"
1216,Psychiatrist Refusing Patients?,"Hello everyone,

I'm going through a pretty rough patch of mental health issues at the moment. I recently moved and wanted to schedule an appointment with the local psychiatrist. I spoke with the front desk regarding my issues and simply wanted to see if I could talk or virtually meet with a psychiatrist. However, when I said that I wanted I wasn't an established patient of the Dr. already, the guy at the front desk laughed  at me and said that he wasn't taking any new patients because of the pandemic and that it's the law that you have to physically meet the new patient in person before making an appointment.

Is that true? It just seems unfair to me and to probably the other patients that would like to meet with a psychiatrist are being turned away. 

Any help is appreciated. Thanks."
1217,Will this turn into seasonal depression?,"I feel stupid asking this, and I know somebody is going to respond with a spiel on why I should never feel stupid asking about my mental health. 

I’m worried. I had a huge period of depression last spring that led to a total breakdown. I saw a doctor and a therapist and made a total recovery. 

This spring, my relationship with my gf is going downhill fast, and my emotional state with it. I’m slipping into another very depressed state faster than I can recover. 

I don’t have any worries that I won’t eventually recover from this episode... but will two episodes at the same time of year lead to me developing seasonal depression? I feel really stupid asking this, but it’s been bothering me."
1218,my bc is giving me horrible mood swings,"I've had to take extra of my birth control recently due to some health issues but it's causing me horrible mood swings. last night I spent several hours crying because of something small that triggered me, which in turn unleashed tons of emotions I frankly wasn't trying to unpack. I'm not sure what to do, ik these mood swings are effecting my bf. because they're definitely effecting me too. I've tried my best to keep my emotions in check but to no avail :/"
1219,Crying but proud of myself,"Soooooo today I had an interview for a job that is not quite my dream job but is reaaaaaally close to it. However, the job entails a lot of traveling and I don't have a driver's licence yet (I am working on it, but with all that's going on rn it's not going forward much). The ladies interviewing me did note that I was very motivated and that I qualified perfectly for the job apart from the driving.

It went really well and I am a very anxious person so I'm reaaaaaally proud of me!

My dad came home moments ago and he asked me how it went, so I told him just what I wrote above. He made a face and told me : ""Yeah, that driver's licence is a big black spot. We've been telling you for years, but you always only saw yourself in big cities!""

And I just. Ugh. He always always does that, you know? Focus on the negative, point it out to you, rub your nose in it. It's one of the root causes of my anxiety. And what he said? It's not even true. They have been hounding me about it, yes, but I always dreamed of working in a tiny city/village because big cities make me feel oppressed. And the reason I didn't want to get a driver's licence was a mixture of depression, at the time,  and fear of driving. I got hit by a car and had to go to the hospital (I wasn't hurt too much apart from huge bruises, thank god, and thank my ranger shoes for keeping my bones in place even though the car pinned my foot under one of its wheels) at one point so that accident added onto the fear.

So knowing that, I just looked at him and said : ""No. No. I never wanted to live in a big city.""

We exchanged a few more sentences and then he left. Thank god it didn't last much longer because I could feel tears building up in my eyes.

So now I'm crying, because why can't he be happy and positive, even a little? Why can't he compliment me too? I understand he's looking out for me but can he make me feel good about myself at the same time? Why do I have to point out that I'm proud of myself to get a similar reaction out of my parents?

But I AM proud of myself. For how I handled the interview, for what the ladies told me, and for standing up for myself against my dad in a way that didn't end in a fight and frustration tears.

I love you, dad, but f you sometimes."

1221,I feel misunderstood for being autistic,"There's always been a huge stigma that people with autism are all ""creepy"", ""violent"" or ""toxic"" or something else that's awful, and I see this stigma all the time on the internet, especially in more ""nerdy"" subcultures for stuff like gaming and anime, and it sucks because I like both of those things, and yet in those communities my diagnosis is often stigmatized frequently. I feel really misunderstood because of the stigma, and I sometimes feel like nobody will ever understand me (aside from some of my supportive friends) and that just because I have autism doesn't mean I'm going to be creepy or hurt someone. It really sucks feeling this way because I'm a human being like everyone else and yet not many people in the world wants to believe that, or so it feels like."

1224,What is the best way to release repressed emotions?,"Even though my dissociation is seemingly over now, I still feel like there's some emotions bottled up within me that I have to let go of before I feel like I'm in the clear. For some reason, I'm still having a little difficulty crying so I don't know what to do or if there's a good way to do it. Whenever something happens or a negative thought comes through, it's like part of my mind is sensitive to it but at the same time, it also feels like if this emotional stress in my head wasn't there, I would be affected a lot less. There's also not really anywhere I can scream without people hearing me and thinking I'm insane. Any tips?"
1225,"For The Past Two Years, I Feel Like I've been Going Crazy/Mentally Downhill","Over the past 2 years, my anxiety has increased significantly and my mental health has declined. To preface my post: I grew up in a home-schooled household with 7 other siblings, graduated college in 2017 and now work as a full-time accountant while pursuing a CPA license. My side passion projects are music production and fitness training/dieting. I have a loving girlfriend of 5 years and a 2 year old puppy, and I live with 3 other roommates and fully support myself and expenses.

3 years ago still in college, I was care-free, never had panic attacks, did great in school (although test anxiety was always bad, but drove me to do better) and never worried about my mental health. Close to graduation I started getting higher levels of anxiety, first experiences of panic attacks, and serious thoughts about having a mental disorder. Triggers were not really present to cause any of these symptoms, although substances made me more prone to episodes (caffeine, weed, nicotine, psychoactive drugs etc).  


Some events I tried attributing these symptoms to was smoking weed quite frequently throughout college and trying psychedelics. Smoking always made me feel less stressed, more giddy, happy, and enhanced my audible pleasure while listening to music. Psychedelics changed my reality and perception of life altogether (I believe for the better), although one instance I had to babysit a friend who had a manic episode whilst tripping and caused me severe anxiety; the thought of him being permanently damaged clouded my mind the entire trip (especially with my emotions so heightened). Although I believe this event caused panic attacks and anxiety for a few months after, my friend was fine and is highly successful in his career. I thought it was maybe something physical, so I underwent several exams/tests for my heart after experiencing a lot of palpitations and feeling dizzy and light headed. However, the tests declared I was in super healthy/physical shape. I then knew it was my mind causing physical symptoms and hypochondriac thoughts.  


Currently, I live day to day with fear of a heart attack, stroke, or having present mental disorders, although I cannot attribute them to anything specific and I know my health is fine. I ponder that it might be the stress of moving into adult hood, but I make sufficient money to buy what I want and sustain my living habits much better than in college. When I smoke even the smallest amount of weed now, I feel like I might lose my mind so I avoid it; but I miss how great I felt in the past years. When I drink caffeine (1/4 a small 8oz cup), I become severely scatter brained but before I could drink an energy drink on top of coffee while feeling no negative effects. Even without substances, I experience panic attacks and high anxiety levels - my symptoms are just less severe/prone to occur.

Lastly, while I'm interacting in relationships during the day, I'll have heavy onset anxious thoughts and panic attacks that I hide from friends/significant others. Sometimes this means putting on a masked facial expression or faking a smile that is not genuine, or my face will appear blank. This causes me to nod and not really pay attention to what is being said to me while I focus on how horrible I feel inside. When I'm on my own, I'll look in the mirror and feel like I'm putting on a fake face or it's blank and I feel like I'm not ""all there."" I apologize for the lengthy post, and for those of you that read this I would love to hear your input if you experience something similar and how you deal with this new experience of life. This is causing me severe depression, and although I would never consider it, I can see how some people have suicidal thoughts because they fear living like this for the rest of their lives'."

And my mind totally crashed. My faithful friend - suicidal thoughts became very other day, every day , every hour. Finally called my doctor.My doc sent a script to take the suicidal edge off this past sat. He said it will take time. 

Why was I normal going to work? Why can't I do normal. Now there's talk of disability. NO. JUST MAKE MY MIND NORMAL. WHY CANT MY MIND BE NORMAL?  THIS IS NOT FAIR. Teaching from home is easy, right? The classroom was my escape. I could do that so well. Dissecting how my kids learn and how to formulate a bridge to get them where they need to be was my jam.

No I'm nothing. A crazy person. I can't do simple functions at home.

1234,How often do you talk to your best friend/how do you let go when you should?,"I have a friend and I feel the need to talk to them everyday, when I know I don’t.

 Not a need because I feel like I’ll lose them if I don’t, but a need because they make me happy when I talk to them and I don’t want that to go away.

Since this break, we haven’t gone more than 5 days without talking to each other and I KNOW how unhealthy and toxic that is, because all we mainly talk about is my problems. At school we would see each other every day and talk and joke about random stuff and talk about what’s bothering me maybe once every week or every other

But now it’s turned into basically everyday and I hate how much stress I’m putting them under.

How do I stop waiting for a text that I know I’m not going to get. And how do I let them go?"
1235,My grandmother is acting hostile and horrible towards me during this pandemic,"My grandmother is 85 and has been acting totally irrational during this towards me. It started off as me presenting arguments against my mom going alone to do grocery shopping as she is obese and can barely walk. A couple weeks later she wanted her to go to the cvs store to get stuff and I said I would go, she outright went insane and doesn’t want me to get stuff for her, she had a fit about it and couldn’t explain to me why, other then saying Id get the wrong stuff. Pounding her cane on the ground and telling me to stop talking about it.

I’ve never done anything to this woman. I’ve never wronged her or screwed get over, but she is very cold and a micromanager who sees herself as the head of the house and referred to herself as “the boss”, she treats me rather coldly. She clearly doesn’t trust me to go get groceries? 

After things cooled down, I tried showing her the app that Vons has, suggested it would prevent unnecessary interaction with people in the grocery, she turned up her nose at it and the next day she was hostile, saying she wanted nothing to do with the normal routine that her and my mother have with getting groceries, likely because I’m involved in it. She says she would have nothing to do with the food we buy. She usually has my mom go and they split the bill, but this time she just handed over some cash for the few items she wanted.

All this nonsense during a pandemic leaves me dreading the next weekend. I go with my mom to make the trip faster. I’m not trying to screw get over ? I’m not sure if that’s what she thinks I’m trying to do? Or how it would happen since there is a receipt ?

It just sucks because all I want to do is prevent my mom from going into the store and getting sick and this woman is coming at me with extreme hostility and won’t explain what the fuck her problem is, Im just trying to help and she thinks I can’t pick out the right kind of bagels?

Thankfully my mom doesn’t go into the store, but I have to figure some work around to make it seem like I’m not involved? Like leave before my mom leaves. It just sucks that someone is so willing to send a vulnerable person and unwilling to let me help.

It’s made this all the more stressful. Is she not being irrational and stupid during a deadly pandemic?"
1236,Is porn addiction harmful?,"I masturbate 3-4 times a day. With the years, I've slowly been getting more and more into extreme porn. To me, it's pretty clear that I have a porn addiction.

I don't spend that much money, I only do it at home, It doesn't get in the way of my daily life in any way. So I was wondering if there was any reason to cut down? I reckon I could if it was bad for me but I don't really have any incentive to. I don't really have any other vices, I don't drink, smoke, I eat healthily, I run 5Kms 3-4 times a week.

That's for context, because I realise that reason I'm so fucked up it's in my past.

I was always struggling with social anxiety and depression.  Last year I tried online dating and I've met a girl I liked very much from the start .  We've met once in person and after that she went studying abroad and we developed friendship over facebook.

We've chatted daily for half a year and at some point I've developed some sick infatuation and confessed my feelings to her over text. She then rejected me and called me a coward for not taking action earlier. I spiralled into deep depression after that and was crying constantly for two days. She tried to cheer me up at first and  later decided to  just cut me off.

After that I was doing some sick stuff I didn't even thought I'm capable of doing. I've tried to contact her and fix friendship and she asked me once  to stop texting her and blocked me. After that I was trying it again for 3 or 4 times from multiple accounts after I finally stopped.

I know I shouldn't do that and my actions are wrong, but It was first time I've ever done something like that and I'm unable to cope with regret.

She hates and is afraid of me now and the only thing I ever wanted was to bring her back and become friends again. I'm unable to get over this because I have developed anxiety now. I'm afraid that I will do something like that in the future too and I don't want to hurt people again.  I was trying to meet other women, but It always give me anxiety about failling in love with somebody and acting strange again. Please help."

Usually, I have 2-3 days in a week or so where I feel very down and mentally exhausted but since April I've been feeling absolutely miserable.  I live in a dysfunctional family with a lot of emotional, financial issues etc. both my parents are depressed themselves and I've always seen them like this for past 10 years, I feel so odd around people because everyone seems to have a nice life, nice parents etc. except for me, it makes me want to wish I lived their lives. Growing up I would feel entirely out of line with my surrounding classmates which would talk about their happy family. Also, my parents fight a lot and I've seen things happen in the family that has left me traumatized. Every day I feel like a mess, a failure and someone who has no future, like a burden in my parent's lives. And what makes me more upset is that I am not the only one, there are uncountable people all around the world going through the same and much worse things than me.

(and sorry for my English!)
I don't know how to properly describe my problem, but I'll try my best. For several years now, though in different frequency, I've been getting this weird feeling, it lasts like 15-20 seconds. Different things trigger it, I read or hear a word or a sentence and I suddenly get flashbacks of a moment I heard it in the past, and when I try to think of something else my mind is like flooded with thoughts and sounds and pictures and generally reliving some random memories. During this time I feel extremely nauseous, I can't breathe, I can't focus on anything, it's like I'm locked inside my mind for that brief moment. And it's like the world around me isn't real and nothing matters. Now, I know it seems like a very minor problem, but since it has such a powerful effect on me when it happens I'm scared it'll happen for example when I'm driving and it'll end badly. Also, sometimes it happens everyday, then it stops, then every few days, then even couple times a day...
I don't know if it's even a thing or if it's normal so any hints what may cause it are welcome!

1252,WHY DO I HAVE THIS WEIRD FEAR OF OUTER SPACE?," Hello, I am a 27 year old male. I've been having anxiety issues since I was about 17 so close to ten years. My first panic attack in my sleep caused it all. I fell a sleep, my mouth got dry because it was winter and for a quick second I stopped breathing, which made my brain go into panic mode which caused me a panic attack in my sleep which caused everything to go down hill for ten years. After that i always felt depressed, scared, trapped. I got on multiple meds took them three years but got sick of them because they were affecting my happiness, made me numb inside. So I quit them, and felt way better w out them. But since i dont take anything for anxiety anymore, i have not had one bad anxiety attack since. I only had 2 big panic attacks in ten years, but everything else is mostly my anxiety. Once i got off the meds i started fearing driving over bridges (somehow this was never the case on meds) and more scared of heights and elevators because i hate the feeling of being trapped. But the last 10 years my biggest worry was outer space. Its so infinite and it makes me feel claustrophobic here on earth. Knowing that there is no way out of outerspace makes me get anxious alot and panicky. This only HAPPENS at night. So my question is what causes this weird thought and fear thats been bothering me? I could care less about outerspace, but thinking of how inifinte is with no escape gives me ALOT OF ANXIETY. Is there an explanation to this?"

I’ve just been finding that more and more people lately have been picking fights with me over literally NOTHING. Like people just arbitrarily decide I’m lying about things that aren’t worth lying about.

But, I’m the bad guy.

(And in one of the lovely parts of irony I can’t use food stamps to do delivery or pick up even not during a pandemic). I don’t like the person I’m becoming recently, I’ve been cranky and short, not out loud but in my head. I’ve never been like that, I’m super non confrontational and normally let stuff roll off me, and it isn’t like I am haunted by peoples words, but by there mood or energy or whatever"
1255,Discussion for those who are too quick to fall in love,"Just wanted to flare-up a bit of discussion on this topic to see other peoples' perspectives. 

I keep finding myself too quick to love. That word is probably too strong as it's definitely not love, more passionate infatuation. Throughout my early twenties I  find I keep having several short-term but intense relationships with women. These are brief as they last roughly around 6 months and are sometimes more platonic than sexual, and vice-versa. 

Throughout this I regain a lot of self-confidence. It seems I get a lot of internal validation from these relationships as when they begin to fizzle out I become feverishly needy. This neediness perpetuates the fallout and sometimes destroys the relationship beyond the romance.

I've tried to love myself and work on being alone; and that has worked to an extent. But, I keep accidentally tripping up and falling back into another relationship. 

I guess it's an ideal I heavily romanticised when I was younger. Except the reality is more stressful and has made me terribly bitter every time another relationship fades. That's the bit I hate the most.

Anyway, probably a bit of a long tale from some anonymous guy called Mr_Truckasaurus on Reddit, but I figured talking about this stuff is better than bottling it up.  And maybe my perspective will help others in this situation."
1256,Is it posible to remember a trauma.,So i'm sure i got raped. I can remember it I think. But like when you get trauma you suppress it right? Like it haunts me. Nobody knows about it.
1257,What kind of disorder this can be? Strong jealousy,"My brother in his early thirties always put the blame of anything bad that happen to him on my mom! He even twist reality and things that had happened or people said to the point where it’s funny and weird. Everyone that can hear him start laughing because it’s very obvious he’s lying. He say and do everything he can to be the (victim), emphasizes (victim) because that’s his main goal. No one wants to hear him because everything he says is non sense, so he only do it to my mother because she’s the only one that heard him. His actions flair up when he see people in the family and friends get a job, graduate good school, have a career, get married and have kids. He starts to blame my mother for not having all that. He refuses to work or do anything during the day and he expect people to support him. When he has money he blows it up on food and clothes but when he doesn’t have money he blame everybody but himself. He keep crying, wining, screaming, and arguing (even when we’re in public) to get his way and get money or just to play the victim. What kind of disorder do you think he has? Thanks so much."

1260,Tips on what to do after a panic attack?,"Had an awful day. Had a 3 hour long panic attack and a 5 hour afternoon nap, now feeling completely numb and empty. What can i do to cheer myself up?  Friends suggested alcohol but honestly im not feeling it rn."
1261,I have a friends who is struggling and I want to give him the help that he needs.,"So a very good friend of mine has been stuck in life for quite a while now. Miserable at his job, miserable at home, miserable around his friends, nothing really seems to lift him up in any way. The thing that I find really strange is that he’s well aware that he has slipped into a depression but for whatever reason he chooses to do nothing about it. I’ve been talking to him about this for months now and he just gives me the same answer every time “it’s fine, I’ve just had a shitty day I don’t really want to get into this right now.” As much as I try to give him the help he needs he just refuses and pretends like it’s not a big deal. The worst part of all of this is he doesn’t have health insurance (for whatever reason) and he doesn’t make enough money to see a therapist. What can I do to help my friend see that he doesn’t need to live that way that he does right now? How can I help pull my friend out of this depression that he’s in?"
1262,What do you think about the impact of crying on human well-being?,"I have read various articles about the positive effect of crying and in fact I can confirm it myself. Lately it is rather rare for me to cry but when it happens I feel like a catharsis afterwards and I can be more happy with what I have. 

On the other hand, however, I wonder if repeated episodes of crying do not have a negative impact on mental health in the long-term.

There is a popular Dr. Richards social phobia therapy where we learn to introduce positive thoughts into our lives. I wonder what Dr. Richards would say about crying...

All in all you could say that crying is a plunge into negative emotions... 

What do you think about that?"

1265,Should I stop watching youtube at night?,"Ok, first things first, I'm not a regular on this subreddit. So if this is the wrong sub to ask this or if I break any rules. Be free to delete my post. 

Also, not a native english speaker. So sorry if I make any mistakes or something like that. Feel free to correct me.

Ok, now the story. I'm a 15 year old male with autism and ADD. This has always made me different from others in pretty severe ways. Which has caused me to develop a lot of issues. From a high amount of self doubt to reoccuring depression.

I used to get therapy for this. But the quarantine made going to therapy in my country an impossibility. This combined with being alone with my thoughts for long periods of time has been very rough for me. I have a severe mental breakdown almost every week now and the bad thoughts (when I feel them) feel worse every day. They were almost always in my head... except when I watched a video on yt or play videogames. This has caused me to almost always be on my phone watching youtube or playing on the computer. And this has really helped me be happy in the last few weeks. But my parents and me are starting to see a problem...

I (like most people with negative thoughts I think) also have negative thoughts in the evening when I need to sleep. This has caused me to be on my phone at night. Which has given me pretty severe (at least I think pretty severe) sleep issues. My parents want me to stop watching stuff on my phone at night. But I'm honestly terrified of having those thoughts again. 

So ehm... what do you think?
(Sorry if I rambled a bit btw. My thoughts are always a bit all over the place. Which made it pretty hard to write this.)"
1266,Starting therapy tomorrow... again.,"Here I go again, and I'm terrified. I know how much work it will be. I know how low I am, and therefore how far I have to go. I don't believe I am strong enough to do this again."
1267,I have no clue how to move forward,"I’ve been sent to collections on an older medical bill and a school bill, I missed the drop date for my class and now I’m failing, and I’m too scared to tell my family. I have the feeling of a pit in my stomach from the time I wake up from the time I go to bed and I haven’t felt like myself in weeks. I still can’t bring myself to do anything besides lay in my bed staring at the ceiling all day, freaking out about these things. I’ve never felt so alone in my life. I’ve hit an all time low and I feel that the only possible way to make it out of this situation is by taking my own life."
1268,Do you ever want to go back to being depressed. (Hereditary Depression + OCD),"a few weeks ago or whenever it was I went through a mental breakdown, can i even say that? I was ready, crying my eyes out repeating the words I want to die. Feeling like I was drowning in pain, my emotional pain turned into a physical one where i got a migraine. I keep having these explosive moments too often, it builds up and then i breakdown and tell myself i can't do it anymore. well this past week or so, I didn't feel actively suicidal in fact i didn't have any urges to kill myself. I woke up fine, I wasn't happy or motivated but i was just fine. I went about a week like that i'm still currently in that state, I don't know if it had anything to do with the crazy amount of ginger tea and water i've been drinking or spending time at the trail soaking up the sun for a few hours. to be honest i didn't like it. Am I crazy? Just about 2 weeks ago i was in so much emotional pain contemplating suicide for no reason, and now that i'm out of that state, why do i miss being depressed?

I realized that being in a depressed state was weirdly my comfort zone. When i was ""fine"" I Felt out of place like what am i supposed to do now that i'm not suicidal. So many things are contingent on me being suicidal. For example how am I suppose to finish school, make plans to travel, or other big plans when I don't even know if I'm going to be alive next year, or in a few months, weeks ect???. Now that I am more aware of my hereditary mental illness I know that without medical intervention I will never be able to complete a goal. So guess what until I can get that help I don't attempt to enroll myself into classes or make big plans with people bc at some point i will hit a wall where I am a hair strand away from killing myself. So when I feel ""FINE"" what does that mean for me, it changes everything I start to feel all these things that I want to start doing now! but I remember i can't cause i'll have an episode and end up dropping out or canceling ect. Also being alone with my negative thoughts and emotions feels like this dark toxic blanket where I can close my eyes and forget about all my worries and dream of a place where I will soon feel nothing."
1269,I have a question about trauma and i dont know where to ask so i thought this sub could be a good place,"First of: im diagnosed with depression and bpd. Since i can remember i've Always had a weird feeling when i sat somewhere right after showering, half naked and wet hair. My Heart starts beating faster, breathing gets Harder and other things i know from dissociation. I dont know why this happens and i feel  so ashamed during those moments and i cant Imagine Not having this (so since around 10 years, I'm 21). Currently i dont have a therapist to Talk about it but i want to because i thought what if this was a flashback from a Trauma i cant remember. I have a friend who has this too, but it's too Fresh to ask her about it. I know, only a therapist could properly diagnose it and i will talk about it when i find a therapist, but having this feeling nearly every day is exhausting and i Just wanna know If someone with similar expierince could answer me if this could be a FB of a trauma.

1271,Can someone give me some advice on how to approach my brother? He doesn't seem well.,"My brother seems to be in a very bad place mentally right now &amp; its getting worse. We have never been close but I hate to see him like this. I'll post some relevant information so you can have an idea of what he has experienced:

\- He's 18 right now

\- My parents were splitting up/threatening divorce since he was around 8.

\- 3-4 years ago my parents decided on divorce. Father moved out for this process.

\- My brother has always had an irrational hatred of my father. Eventually he just stopped showing any sign of care for my mother either over the past year or so while she was alone with us.

\- Our parents weren't abusive. My mother was a stay at home mom &amp; my father a business owner. We live a pretty comfortable middle-class life.

\- Divorce has been finalized in october. Our mother is gone &amp; father is back in the house.

\- My brother picked up smoking weed at 16 and has been a daily smoker ever since.

\- This past winter I found out he had been doing LSD &amp; has tried DMT atleast once.

&amp;#x200B;

This past week I was walking in the house when I heard him VERY agressively/angrily talking to himself. He was trying to set up his vape or something and he kind of growled ""I dont fucking know how to do this"" to himself.

The reason I'm making this post is because today my father &amp; I found our bathroom mirror smashed into pieces. I saw my brother today &amp; he said ""You wanna know what happened? I got so fucking angry that I punched it. Can't tell you why though."" and he went back into his room &amp; locked the door.

We have no way to communicate with him. I can ask him any question and he will just give a nonsense answer with no substance. I experimented with drugs too so I know exactly how they can affect you. I'm especially worried about his use of psychedelics paired with daily smoking. I know it had a very negative effect on my thought patterns when I smoked weed which is why I quit smoking. However I was never a daily smoker so it meant nothing to me to give up weed. I don't want to ostracize him and pin his behaviour on his drug use but I know its a factor along with all of his other bottled up issues.

I just have no way to get through to him."
1272,Little hope for my future,"I'm 17 at the moment, 18 in a few months, and I'm sitting here with nothing to prepare me for the real world. I haven't had a job, never driven a car, I haven't even applied to colleges or anything else as of yet. I'm scared that if I enter the workforce at all, whatever I work in I'll screw up horribly and won't be able to recover from. If I start to drive I'll find myself distracted for a moment and then cause an accident. I'm far too drawn to my own imagination and daydreams for me to think that driving would be a safe possibility. It'd just take a song or a bit of dialogue to pop into my head, and then I'm no longer in reality, just a daydream. Ever since school switched to online my work ethic went downhill too. I cannot focus in online work and after the first few weeks just gave up. I'm going to graduate this year but it won't feel like I've earned it.

There's so many people I know that have done all of these things and I know I should be able to do them. Part of me feels terrified about having those responsibilities because I'll screw them up. Another screams at me says I'm being selfish by not even trying. Another reminds me that even if I do try, I either won't make it or will screw things up to the point where my life is irreparable. I want to be useful in this world, but I don't think I'll be able to."
1273,What kind of disorder is extreme jealousy?,"

1275,keep crying for no reason,"the past few days i’ve been having constant crying episodes and i have no idea why. the tiniest thing will set it off and my eyes will start to sting and i’ll start sobbing.

i know crying is ok and normal and it’s ok to let it out, so i’ll allow myself to cry and sit there with my feelings to allow that energy to leave my body but it just ..... comes back. sometimes in a few minutes sometimes an hour. even if i manage to calm myself and meditate, breathe, draw, do something fun, and i feel good for a bit i just end up crying again. 

even things that should make me happy like listening to music, watching funny videos, esp videos and songs from my favourite artists that used to make me smile so much, i just end up crying. i’m finding comfort in their lyrics but at the same time i just feel so bad. and now the songs are stuck in my head and everytime i think of them i start crying again.
i tried to sit with my family but they’re joking around and i just don’t have it in me right now to do the same.

usually i can pull myself out of things and convince myself it will pass and feel better but i just can’t get that physical sensation out of me.

i really just don’t know what to do right now i’m so drained. i managed to take a shower and make some tea but i’m just scared for when the next episode comes. idk"
1276,What to do when your friends don’t like you?,"Recently my friends have been increasingly pushing me away, this is mainly my own fault though as, however childlike and basic it may sound, I am way less into video games then them, resulting in worse performance and subsequently getting flamed to oblivion and excluded from discord calls (only form of social contact fuck corona). Since I am the only one still following an education in this grouo I have way less free time on my hands: Maybe this is just self pity and I’m being a little bitch but if anyone has any tips, let me know.

Might be important to mention these are my irl long time friends, not just online"
1277,"""Your attitude really sucks"" said by my grandmother","I do already knew from myself that I'm quite different in most of the aspects. I know the 'demon' was just hidding inside me. I'm trying to be 'okay' in a while, to prove my family that there's nothing wrong with me or otherwise they would belittle me and treat me diffenrently. Even though in school I do really feel being defeated and all those misery since I was a kid. 

Until it reached the point when I blown up just because of a seat which I occupied in our living room. My uncle is trying to drove me out of my seat for him to occupy it. I just bursted out in anger telling a lot nasty words to him I know he's older than me I didn't care. I just continued being a mad kid. Then my grandmother told me ""your attitude really sucks, such a disrespectful person."" 

I suddenly stopped. 

""You know what, your child has a problem maybe she's right. She's mentally ill, not just mentally ill but retarted"" my uncle told my mom unhesitantly and sounded laughing. 

When I heard those words my heart breaks, tears flowing in anger, and almost broke the fork that I was holding in one hand. Then I vanished, entered my room once again and lay in my bed thinking of that 'demon' inside me that came out. 

For now, I just wanted everything to fade away. I know that my mental state is not really in good condition, and I do hope my mom would believe me this time that I'm not okay and I'm being stuck in this unknown misery.  And those judgemental family members around me would be properly educate about what really mental health is. 

I feel horrible about myself right now, and I feel so alone."
1278,Well fuuuuckk..,"My parents are apparently going to be talking to my teacher tomorrow about my attendance during a meeting in the afternoon..

It was a few weeks ago though. Rest In Pieces to me."
1279,Short Movie about Isolation and Mental Health," A  short movie my wife and I made in 2019, but quite fitting now during  the pandemic.  Loosely based on The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte  Perkins Gilman.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1DwU7v4\_IU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1DwU7v4_IU)

Thank you for taking the time to see it, like it or comment on it. We appreciate all your feedback.

A  short note: I always thought Gilman's story was about hope, in the end,  despite all the packaging and labeling as being quite bleak. If it  wasn't about hope I wouldn't have made the movie. I actually think that  whatever happens between the husband and wife once the film ends can  only lead to both of them confronting their inner fears and finding  their own strength - whether they do it alone, on their own, or together  as a family.

I can only hope that it will make you feel better and less alone. Stay safe

The Film is in Romanian with Eng subtitles."
1280,The only way I can describe how I’ve felt for a long time,"Its like, if you where in a dark room, a completely pitch black room. You wonder around looking for a light switch but you never seem to find it, you just hit walls and furniture and bruise yourself. Then eventually, you adjust to the dark and soon stop looking for the light switch. Every time you go searching you only hurt yourself and find nothing so why search at all. What if you don’t even like the light, since your so adjusted to the dark why do you need a light, why is the light better. Eventually you just give up and accept that the room will always be dark and there is no windows, door or light and your just stuck by yourself in the dark and silence. You lose track of time and don’t know how long you’ve sat in the dark, or if it always was like this.

1281,Just checked my fiancee into an emergency mental health clinic and I don't know if she will ever forgive me.,"I know she was a danger to herself and that on some level I did the right thing, but now I can't see her or contact her while she is there and I feel like I just abandoned her. As she was going in she was looking at me trying to help her leave but at that point she had already told them she wanted to kill herself and there was nothing I could do. I feel like a betrayed her and that I maybe ruined any chance of us being together."
1282,I genuinely don't know what's wrong with my head,"TL;DR - do I have a bipolar/personality disorder or just something wrong with me mentally, or am I just overthinking?

Hi there guys.. um well I'm not sure if anyone will see this, but I'm relatively new to this sub and I was wondering if anyone knows if I have anything wrong with me mentally... I'm not looking for a diagnosis more of a thing where someone gets me if that makes sense?

Okay so here's the thing I have been diagnosed with anxiety, and for the past few years I've been noticing some changes with my head mentally but the thing is I don't know what.. I don't know how to go about with these sort of posts as I really don't want to offend anyone or make them agitated with my words. 

Lately I've been suspecting that I have a bipolar disorder or that I have multiple personalities or just something that isn't right with my head mentally. On a frequent basis I would have these days where I'm the happiest woman in the world to feeling upset for no reason. I usually always wake up in bad moods and I would randomly start crying or get angry, and for no reason whatsoever my moods change just like that. Even when I'm angry my mood will switch back to being fine and good again just like that. It's weird because I always Always randomly feel guilty and bad aswell like I've done something wrong all the time. I'm always CONSTANTLY overthinking about everything aswell it's getting to the point where I can't even bring enough courage or confidence to go out of the house.

And with the multiple personalities thing, I have been noticing for a couple years now, that when I talk to different people, my personality is different everytime, it's quite hard to explain but I'm a different person when I speak to different people or if it's the same person that I talk to everyday like a family member my personality will change.. like I'll be happy and outgoing, then moments later I'll be a nasty person, then I'll be all sweet and innocent again, then I'll snap again and again, and then I'll be all sweet and angelic again.. I hate this I absolutely hate being like this:/ I honestly feel like I'm a bad person for being like this but I don't know what the hell is wrong with me:/ 

I have thought about going to the doctors but my anxiety is so bad that I can't go out in public unless someone goes with me, bare in mind I'm 20 years old.. It's bad:/ I want to get help but I'm worried that I'll get brushed off like I'm nothing. I don't even know if there's anything wrong with me. I was put on medication for my anxiety about 2 years ago but I stopped it as I got myself a little addicted to the pills I was prescribed as I just wanted to feel the numb zombie feeling it gave me if that makes sense? I would have to take 3 a day every 5 hours but I would just chuck down 6 in one go just to get that feeling.. 

I also always have this constant thing where I feel so so god damn ugly and then I will start crying because of how ew I am. It's sad coming from a 20 year old omg. Another bad thing is that I am very VERY emotionally sensitive and always have been since I can remember. I can't help but think it's because I'm a Pisces but I doubt that's the case lol. I get hurt really easily aswell and I stress about every little thing and I don't know why that is. Does anyone have any idea of what is wrong with me? Apologies in advance if I don't make much sense and also any advice is greatly appreciated."
1283,Unappreciated and unloved,"Anyone else live in a house where they just feel unappreciated and misunderstood? I mean I know they love me. But I don't feel loved. My family don't get me. They have contributed to a lot of the issues and anxieties I have, I'm not saying their 100% responsible, but they've played a part and they don't get that. I've tried before to talk to them but they mever listened and nothing ever changed. I almost don't feel part of the family. I'm also autistic and my family have never tried to understand that.

For further context, I actually live with my aunt and uncle and have since I was 11. My mum died when I was 8 and my life was unsettled the between 8 and 11. My uncle  used to yell at me a lot of and call my useless, fat, stupid etc. The last few years have been better and we get along better now, however I still am struggling with bad self esteem and food issues from all of that.

On top of that as I said I don't feel part of the family. I feel like an ousider. The rare times I try to hang out with them hardly anyone talks to me. My aunt and uncle have four kids of their own and three grandchildren, so its a big family and I just feel forgotten. Like I'm still just a relative. I know they love me and I love them. They've done a lot for me and I don't know where I'd be without them. There's just so many issues.

I think once I'm no longer living here things will get better between us all. My and two friends were actually beginning to look for a flat before all this lockdown stuff so hopefully we can get back to that soon enough.

Oh and lockdown is just making things harder at home because I can't go out. Its sad that I feel more understood and appreciated at work than at home. Being a key worker has definiltey helped me keep some kind of sanity amd not get too into my own thoughts.

Sorry for the long post, I just have a lot going around my mind."
1284,I'm going to share how I feel and If someone wants to talk to that would be appreciated,[deleted]
1285,Does Anyone Else Constantly Feel Like a Nuisance?,"I apologize if this isn't the proper sub to post this sort of thing, I just have to clear my mind I suppose. I'm sure that with nearly 8 billion other people in the world that other people experience this same thing, but I just don't personally know anyone that I can relate and talk to about this. Also, apologies for the long post in advance. 

Recently the feeling that I am a nuisance to my friends and family has started to increase to the point that it has started to effect my mental health. Overall, I can say I'm happy with the way I've handled these feelings for the most part. I have a history of anxiety and have been seeing a therapist for two years, so I have developed tools to try and ease these anxious thoughts. I try to think about these thoughts rationally, and ask myself if the actions of those in my life reflect these feelings. For the most part they don't. I still have friends that reply to my text messages, answer my calls, check in with me and what not. Additionally, I've recently made efforts to find self love so I can realize that if (for some strange reason) these intrusive thoughts do have truth to them and I am, in fact, a bother, that I am still happy with myself and confident with who I am. 

Unfortunately, even though I have worked on these mindfulness techniques, I find that I still have days where these thoughts get the best of me. I can't help but feel that those who know me are just bothered by me as an individual. As if I were to text a friend for help and express these feelings, and once they saw my name on their screen they'd sigh in disgust and just think of how much I annoy them. 

I guess I'm just seeking advice from others that may also experience these thoughts and how they might cope with them. At the moment I'd like to just ignore the world and never reach out to anyone again. I know this feeling will pass, but I also know it's likely that it will return, too. 

Many thanks if you have taken the time to read this far."
1286,I don't know what's happening to me and I need help,"I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as I can but I apologize if it ends up being long - please read this, I need some help. 

I guess I'll start off by saying I heard voices in my head when I was 16, I'm now 17 and the voices had been gone for a good few months but recently (about 2-3 weeks ago) have come back but feel very different. This time it feels like there's more trickery involved in it, I only hear the voice when I'm occupied at something else so I brush it off as mishearing the music or something. But it also makes me feel like people are behind me when they aren't, or that a door is opening when it isn't. Whenever there's a window open or something it's the only thing my mind can focus on - I can feel something inside me yelling at me to close the window and it doesn't stop until I do. And another weird thing is I get very angry and irritated when people look at me, I *constantly* feel like everybody's eyes are on me and I hate it so much. 

Second thing is I have been experiencing extreme sensitivity with everything and extremely sudden lash outs of anger. My ex girlfriend who I recently broke up with replied to my little witty joke in the group chat with calling me some silly name and I took it so personally as some deep hate towards me and it instantly got so sad and angry and began to feel like I can't do this anymore and Im not cut out for living the life I'm in right now. My friends have been sending me very brief messages and i start to feel so hated and no one wants to be my friend and I just need to isolate myself from everyone. It's so extreme and I have no idea why. 

I have also recently only started to realise I have been staring a lot recently, as in I totally stop whatever I'm doing and I start to stare in front of me and I don't even realise I'm staring, it's like I'm totally unconscious because I don't see what I'm staring at either. It's like I exit the world for a second. I did it today when I was eating and when I was walking down the stairs. 

Lastly, I feel something is inside of me, controlling me to a certain degree. It's especially when I have nothing to really entertain me and I'm sitting idle I feel this thing inside me come out and it makes me feel a certain way and think certain ways and it isn't me controlling it. I can feel my real feeling and thoughts in like a dark corner and they have been pushed aside and something else takes hold of me.

I can go into more detail on an area if people want, I tried to keep it brief because I know people don't read very long posts and I really would like some help so I kept it short(ish)"
1287,"Short Movie about Mental Health, Isolation and Postpartum"," A   short movie my wife and I made in 2019, but quite fitting now during   the pandemic.  Loosely based on The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte   Perkins Gilman.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1DwU7v4\_IU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1DwU7v4_IU)

Thank you for taking the time to see it, like it or comment on it. We appreciate all your feedback.

A   short note: I always thought Gilman's story was about hope, in the  end,  despite all the packaging and labeling as being quite bleak. If it   wasn't about hope I wouldn't have made the movie. I actually think  that  whatever happens between the husband and wife once the film ends  can  only lead to both of them confronting their inner fears and finding   their own strength - whether they do it alone, on their own, or  together  as a family.

1288,I’m just kinda done with everything,"(idk if this should go on here or on r/vent, but I’ve already posted on there today and I feel weird about doing it again)
I posted this in a discord server and I was instantly called a baby, so might as well post it here because people are more supportive on this sub. 
Anyways, let me just say, I’m 15. I know I’m young and I “have my entire life ahead of me”  but that’s what I hate. 
I came to this realization when I tried to draw something. I’ve been drawing for a couple years now, and I was downright obsessed with it for a loooong time. I know that it’s normal for obsessions to wane, but when I tried to pick up that pencil and could get any further than drawing a rough circle, it made me realize the bigger pattern that, in my entire life, I’ve lacked the ability to commit to anything. Drawing was supposed to be the one thing I was passionate about, and I cant even have that. I can’t commit to people, I can’t commit to tasks, and I can’t commit to ideas. 
I feel like/know I’m gonna peak in high school. There’s nothing I want to do with my life. I know everyone’s like “you don’t have to know what you wanna do by 18, it’s ok to wait” but the idea of having to continue with my life, getting a job that will never satisfy me, never having a meaningful relationship so never having anyone to keep me here, and never having anything that will bring me joy makes me want to die. 
I sat at my computer yesterday during an online class, shaking and hyperventilating from crying because I realized how pathetic my life is and will be. But I just kept on working, because what else is there to do? When you’ve been raised to believe that no one cares about your feelings, you begin to not care about them yourself. 
I’ve had suicidal thoughts at least since I was in sixth grade (I have a pretty shit memory so it’s possible it started before then), but since that time in my life, they’ve never been this strong before. I know I’m not gonna kms, but god sometimes I wish I just could.
Edit: I just realized how big this wall of text is, thank you if you read it all. I just wanted to get this out here because I don’t want to bother my friends and be the “depressed friend”"
1289,My power is out during this,My fucking power is out during this shit of a situation the only thing that keeps me sane is talking to my friends and my girlfriend along with watching YouTube but with no power no battery I am going to spiral into madness.
1290,thinking about it,So I just graduated and like yesterday I talked to my classmate about future plans and she told me about uni and future job and I realized that for the past few weeks I have just been thinking about suicide bu ODing or cutting myself. I was diagnosed with depression and have self-harmed. Do you think I'm fucked up? I don't know how should I get help bc you know miss rona is in town.
1291,Why am I talking to myself? Coping mechanisms,"I 23(f) have struggled with depression &amp; anxiety off and on since I was 17. I have good periods and bad periods but overall I manage. I did attempt suicide once, over a year ago, but I consider myself to be pretty stable &amp; functional overall, I’m doing well. 

However, I think one of the ways my depression manifests itself is with intrusive thoughts. Or maybe I have some other issue I’m unaware of. A voice in my head, it feels like my own voice but I know it isn’t me, tells me to kill myself constantly. It says things to me like I’m a stupid bitch, I should kill myself, drive off the road, I deserve to die. Even when I’m happy, but especially when I’m struggling with something. Several times over the last few months I’ve caught myself expressing these thoughts /out loud/ which is very alarming. It even happened at work once. 

I don’t consider myself suicidal or even particularly depressed at this moment in time. I’m not having thoughts of killing myself or anything of that nature. I have some self confidence issues I guess but I think they’re relatively common, I don’t hate myself or anything. Yet the voice persists. I intend to seek professional help for this, but I was curious if anyone else had this happen or knew what it could be. Thanks."
1292,Paranoia can destroy me. What do I do?,"I have terrible paranoia. And anxiety. Often, it is work related. Florida guy here needing advice. 

My job now is causing me a ton of anxiety and paranoia. Managers don’t respond. There is favoritism. But the non response or fake responses make things worse. 

Currently, I am dealing with a lot. Many of us are. But my father has been in ICU with the coronavirus for 27 days now. He is making slight improvements now after we were told it was over. I worked through all of this and the work seemed to be willing to work with me if I needed time. But it was also not much supportive messages and no one has really called or asked how my family is doing. Not a familial place. 

Anyway, currently, my main boss refuses to even take my phone calls. She is going through marital  problems. I asked her to call me and the response was “I do not want to talk to anyone if I don’t have to. I need alone time. I deserve this. Let me have it.” 

OK. Two weeks before that, when I thought my dad was going to die, I texted boss to call me, needed to know what my options were. Response was “ I am going through a lot right now, can’t you just text it?” I felt pretty down by that.

But lately, I’m getting disciplined for things without being talked to for my side of story. Decisions are being made about my work without talking to me. It’s wrong. 

It is making me super paranoid and anxious, as if they don’t respect me and either want me to quit or the axe is coming. I’m one of the hardest working employees they have, and was told 8 months before this pandemic that I was the best hire ever. 

But when things happen like this in the workplace, it consumes me. I think of only negatives. Nothing seems to help. I sleep poorly. 

I am on meds and anti anxiety meds. But not helping the overwhelming paranoia. 

When I cannot even get this out to my superiors, I feel super lost. Even angry. And this pandemic is making it even worse. 

I cannot quit. No one is getting a job right now. I work in a sinking industry as it is. I have two kids, a home, a wife and just bought a new car. My wife is not the consoling type. 

 I see a counselor. I see a shrink for pills. These pills rarely help me. Xanax helps me sleep, that’s it. Does not stop the paranoia. 

Maybe this is normal. Maybe everyone gets like this under these circumstances. But it seems like I cannot shake this shit off. It makes me irritable, short fused and scared. 

To make matters worse, I have a serious back injury that prevents me from even working out like I used to, which helped reduce stress. I need surgery that was suspended. 

I’ve told my shrink this but it seems like the same old anitdeps gets prescribed. I’ve tried them all over 25 years with little luck, and weight gain. 

Is this something that can be fixed? Should I just ignore this crap and shrug it off, do some work, skate by, stay super quiet, don’t make waves or express my concerns? Stay off emails for work where they can be misinterpreted, and just hang low?

It’s overwhelming and I’d like some advice. Thank you"
1293,Self-esteem issues at work,"30F, looking 20 and attractive, but engaged. Recently got my dream job at an almost all male company but it's been a bit emotionally tiring.

Boss (32M) would talk to me like a robot, treating me almost like an incompetent even though i was the most skilled and experienced temp.
5 other guys approached me (on our company's slack chat...???) because they wanted to have sex and i patiently and kindly but clearly turned them down. 1 of the guys (23M) started blabbing that i was an Instagram Thot ""selling tits and ass"" when my Instagram didn't even have pics of me nor i ever PMed male co-workers.

It became evident around 6 months in many guys thought this of me, including my boss. They treated me like i acted ""better than them nerds"" and dressed to provoke them (i only were a dress once, it was really hot that day and i walked 2h under sunlight daily). They would sometimes criticize my clothes, my make-up, the tastes they thought i had, the fact that i had an Instagram, etc.

I started getting goofy. Talked about stuff more openly, like anime, movies, games, hobbies, we even went for gore sometimes.
I feel like people started ignoring me at this point.
I keep thinking i overdid it and made things worse, or left them confused?

I'm now at a point where my job is steadier than ever and i got a project i absolutely excell at. People and boss have been nicer to me since I was able to truly show my quality. I think they were associating me with this other super incompetent gym girl before me (who i didn't even speak to) who slept with an older guy and wouldn't ever get anything done.
But we're quarantined for 2 months and I'm not sure if that's also a factor? How do i act when i get back? I'm not in a position to ""be myself"" around anyone since i guess that backfired terribly.

Maybe I'm trying too hard and we're not supposed to be any close. I feel like a clown at this point. I'd just love them to stop seeing me as a girl and I'm not sure what will happen during and after this new phase."
1294,Is this normal,"Is it normal for someone to be intellectually arrogant to compensate for depression, low self esteem, and a lack of self identity? I feel like I need to be the “smart one” of a group because:

A) I want to feel like I’m actually worth something. 

B) If I’m not then I’m unsure of who I am or what role I play.

C) my intelligence is the one thing I like about myself, without it I’d be worthless"
1295,OCD possibly?,"Hey everyone, I noticed again today that i was counting the number of letters in words and i found that I get kind of annoyed, i guess would be the word, when the word has no middle letter. In addition to this I also found that this problem happens very randomly but when it does start its very hard to stop.  I've had this problem for a few years now but I've only decided to post about it now , I dont know what causes it, where it comes from, etc. Any advice is appreciated!💜"
1296,can long term stress over a false accusation harm you later in life?,[deleted]
1297,Unable to talk to anyone,"Hi.
Just for a bit of background; I'm a 30 year old female in the UK and I work in retail.

I've come here today because I can no longer stand the feeling of not being able to lean on anyone when there are problems or lows in life. 

My partner is clueless when it comes to emotional support. I can pour my heart out and I get nothing back in the ways of helping me feel like I'm supported, cared for and not alone. I was trying to convey the worry that I no longer feel love or excitement for anything anymore, and he just acted like I was talking about something completely different.

My immediate family is completely broken. I won't go into detail, but I can't rely on my Mum for support because I've mostly had to fulfill the parent role in emotionally supporting her for most of my life. I can't rely on my brothers for support; one has autism and doesn't understand my feelings and the other is so far removed from us, and with his own set of issues, I don't feel I can safely open up to him because I no longer feel like I know him.

There's a trauma I haven't yet unearthed that turns me into an emotional mute when upset. It played a massive role in home life upheavals as a small child of me not speaking and my Mum crying and begging me to speak.

I have had major issues, since childhood, with magical thinking, delusions, bizarre behaviour, mood swings, death anxiety (from around the age of three), vivid hallucinations (especially around bed time/first thing in the morning), vivid nightmares/disturbing dreams that continue till this day and feelings of pointlessness. 

My issue right now is, as mentioned before, I feel absolutely nothing. I used to love drawing and art, cooking, plants and nature and felt this little tingle every time these things were apparent. I used to feel intense empathy for everything and everyone. It was like my heart could burst at any moment. 

Recently, I just feel nothing. I think I love my family, but the feeling I remember isn't there. I don't even feel it for my partner anymore and as for art... that feeling has been long gone for years.

I miss that feeling. I miss being able to feel that feeling. I no longer feel attachment to anyone or anything. Sure, I do things I'd usually do and act the way I usually act. That way I can still hold on to a shred of what I used to be. It's getting harder to be myself when all that was once inside is gone. I keep on going through my belongings and trashing more and more things I just don't have sentiments for. 

I'm worried that one day I'll end it. I don't want to do it because it'll hurt my family. I remember what intense hurt and loss feels like and I don't wish to be the cause of that to them, but I can't stand feeling such nothingness anymore. 

Why would I want to live when I feel no reason to.

Thank you for your time."
1298,Just a rant,"I wish I could say that the image I portray to my friends and family is true. Alas, it is not. I seem to be the confident person who is always positive and doesn't give a fuck about what people think. Oh my, it's so wrong. I hate myself. I've stopped caring about what people think because I can't find the motivation to even shower, especially during quarantine. I mean, nobody notices Mr anyway.
I find no point in living when I know I'll never be remembered for anything, and be forgotten in 10 years time. I love things like science and music, but I see that my abilities and my hard word amount to nothing,so I stop trying. At the moment I just want to curl up in a ball and stare at the wall mindlessly.
All I want is for somebody to hug me, to tell me everything is okay, to tell me I'm not hopeless.
I'm sorry, I'm just ranting to random strangers on the internet, you all have greater problems than I do. But thank you for reading if you did"
1299,What is wrong with me?,"So, just for context and background info I do have two other mental illnesses/disorders, adhd and anxiety (mild anxiety). Anyways, typically throughout a normal day I get these thoughts around 10 times a day, the thoughts themselves are typically me either in first or third person perspective, slaughtering ones around me violently with near by objects or weapons. These thoughts are completely involuntary and do not seem to be sparked by any topics  or events. These thoughts have slowly turned to urges to harm others, to the point where on some days I harm myself instead to calm my mind. Reached out many times before, got called a faker, attention seeker, attention whore. Fucking Christ I hate this community. Not everyone is faking. Pricks."
1300,"I have been through much more stressful things in life than I currently am going through, yet I feel like I’m at the end of my rope.","Grew up fatherless, my brother passed away, grandfather died while I was in the room, house burned down, I went to jail for a year for beating up the man who raped my girlfriend, spent the last few years trying to piece my life back together after I got out, just to name some of the major stress inducing events in my life that I’ve been able to power through, all the while convincing myself that I was mentally tough. My support system is strong, my sisters and my girlfriend are the greatest reinforcement a guy could have, but right now I’m struggling harder than I can ever remember. 

I finally got a job, like a real job. A better job than I’ve ever had in my life and even though I really worked hard for 3 years to get a quality job (trying to find employment with a felony is near impossible and requires many extra steps), I feel different. 

I’m scared, I’m overwhelmed and I’m setting unrealistic expectations for myself. I want to cry at my desk. This is what I was working towards for years, this was the checkpoint I had in my head as the beginning of the rest of my life. With Covid, obviously job security isn’t promised and I’m constantly pressuring myself to absorb as much as I can, despite everyone telling me (including my managers) that I should expect to fail and embrace failure as a learning experience in the first few months of my job. I’m not listening, I’m freaking out. I’ve always been able to figure things out on my own, now I’m at the summit, I’ve accomplished the most important goal I’ve had for as long as I can remember and I should be happy, but I’m not. I’ve lost all my confidence. For the life of me I can’t identify why I feel this way. Maybe it’s because it took so long to get here and I hyped it up in my own brain or something. I feel like I’m gonna have a nervous breakdown if I don’t develop a coping mechanism. If anyone has any suggestions or guidance, I would be extremely appreciative."
1301,I won’t let him win.,"I was sexually assaulted by someone that I know. It has been such a difficult process and I’m still going through it. I’m not going to let him win though. I want to be strong enough to tell him what he has done but I don’t want to show weakness when I do.
I don’t want to physically hurt him, I just want him to realise how much of a moron he has been."
1302,Need help figuring out this person to help them and where they won’t drive me crazy.,"Decided to be a mentor. Learned a lot about this person and again very little in some ways. Think autism may be the cause although I need advice from you guys.

Guy is around 27.
Always get real crazy when his birthday comes up like with countdowns
He doesn’t work or go to school but I think it’s his condition
Doesn’t drive and only goes places when his dad drives
Goes to youth functions at church although he’s around 27
Moody
Doesn’t look all there
Obsessive with liking every single status people post on Facebook
Doesn’t talk about family life really. Idk if he has siblings
Trouble spelling
Complained for months about his head, went to the hospital obsessively. Nothing came of it other than him getting glasses that he never uses.
Really moody even when something goes his way. Example his team was winning big in baseball last year in the playoffs and I wrote him to say they’re doing great. Then he is miserable and unhappy about being up three runs and says what’s great about it. But then other times a team can be down and have a terrible record and he will be unrealistically optimistic. 

I thought I helped him all I could and was getting happy to be done with him but now he’s back even after all these mood swings and just goes crazy.

I wrote him multiple days in a row responding to his stuff. He does dead silent and then all of a sudden of Sunday writes me 13 messages about everything I’d previously written wanting to address things I said. Was happy he ghosted me and then find out he does this real obsessive stuff right after ghosting me for awhile. I feel bad for him cause he is so awkward and moody but can’t take his behavior anymore and I thought knowing what he is might help me find tools to help him if I have to keep him in my life. 

Thanks"
1303,So I went to see a psychologist..,"TW: suicide 

I’m always nervous about making a post because it’s hard to put my thoughts into words so if this post is all over the place please just bare with me. 

I don’t know how really start this post so I’m just going to get into it. 

Last spring I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well as general anxiety. When I was diagnosed it was quick, they asked me one or two questions and they were like this is what’s wrong with you take these medications. And to be honest I don’t think they ever worked. 

Come winter time I started to see a new psychiatrist, I told her about how the medications weren’t really working for me but continued to give me them anyways. I didn’t want to bother her about it, so i just said okay and kept taking the medication that weren’t working for me.


So come 2020 I finally decided to see a psychologist I wanted to find out if I was really bipolar or if there was something else so I requested to be re-evaluated. 

The re-evaluation process is a weird one.. they ask you math questions they want you define words and they give you the inkblot test.

I was so excited to get my results back I have suffered for so long, and silently. I was always worried about being invalidated so i never tired talking about it. 
So
I worried quietly 
I did my rituals quietly 
I contemplated suicide quietly 
I finally felt like I was going to be heard and understood.


But i didn’t get what I was looking for..
Basically I have a low IQ, she thinks I scored myself “too high” in the ADHD quiz, and she said that I have all the problems in the book such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. THOSE RESULTS ARE ACCORDING TO MY TESTS.
She said she doesn’t know how I function if all those things really are wrong with me..

I felt like she didn’t believe me I felt like she thought I was a liar. She said she doesn’t know how I function, but I barley even do that. I’ve spent a lot of time in bed. I can’t get up, I think about dying every single day, and it’s not get easier. Right now I’m in a really bad place mentally, I either feel dead inside or everything all at once. I feel invalidated, and like my problems aren’t real. 

I don’t know why I’m making this post I just feel so disappointed and alone and I want to vent about it. 



I hope everyone who’s reading this is doing okay."
1304,Recommendations for finding web-chat based mental health therapist.,I’m hoping to find a service that does web-chat based therapist sessions. I’m not really sure where to start—thanks
1305,Been lost for a while and never really talked much about it.,"I have been lost for a while. I am on the up as the suicidal thoughts are much more spread out. I've come to terms that the best gift I'm going to get is when death finally comes knocking (not suicide but by whatever the world chooses for me). I have used this to at least keep me going while here. 

I still find myself relapsing in old behaviours I hate. Depression and loneliness seem to go hand in hand for me.. and I can never get it right. I used to be the guy to DM girls all the time. It became so bad that it was like a numbers game to me. If I could DM 100 or 200 a night, I was sure to get potential leads for a date. It started as me honestly wanting to find love... but as the dates were less and less rewarding, I turned them into hookups if the opportunity presented itself and sure enough it seemed to very very often. I'm not terrible looking by any means and I am a fun person... which sucks in this part of my life. It made it too easy to find people to meet and essentially hook up with. Deep down during all these times I knew I wanted love but always seemed to focus on the sex. It was to the point where I'd start going into dates with the hopes of getting laid. I slowly stopped caring about the personality of the person I was with and seemed to worry more about the sex and the idea of them wanting me in that moment. My tactics got worse and worse and I slowly started becoming desperate for sex. I dabbled in craigslist ads and trying to hopefully find some gem who just needs someone dirty and loyal.. clearly I wasn't thinking as I always looked in the wrong places to try and find love, while only caring about sex. I became curious about these things I'd see. Sugar daddy. Roses. All this lingo I had no idea about. 

As I looked up the terms I thought to myself that there is no way this was for real and I figured it was people messing around. I was so so so wrong. I found that so many people are selling themselves through the internet. Some as far as sex, and some just selling photos and videos. I became obsessed with knowing who and how many did this. I learned that you can't simply ask people, but if you play along, you will find real info and answers. I would message anyone and everyone and ask if they needed a sugar daddy. No intent of doing any of it. I would talk to someone. Basically get them to confess their price to me, hopefully get 'a sample' and then I'd ghost them. Pretty fucking shitty. Then I met a girl. She was great. However she too, like so many, was wanting money. At first I didnt see it. It started as her hooking up with me and needing cash for something. Me being a fucking idiot would be like sure, I can help. I started to realise that she only wanted to hook up when she needed money.. it destroyed me. But instead of drive me to the light, it drove me deeper in. I began to get not curious, but pissed off at these people selling. I was so mad because I couldn't find real love and here were people who I feel were taking advantage of idiots like myself. I feel I am such a smart person with so many things in life. I do well and promote in jobs and can see business and systems very well.  .. but I fail terribly with love and just feel dumb and naive all the time. It got to the point where I was helping girls get drugs and they would have sex with me. I never saw it as getting drugs for the sex in those moments. I always thought these girls really liked me. I had smoked pot,  but I have never done pills or anything, nor did I know much about them or their effects. 

I was talking to this girl and truly dont remember if I ever mentioned the sugar daddy thing. After talking for a bit, I realized I liked her from what I knew. I was a guy who had been hooking up with people nonstop. I didnt know how to be loved or even how to love. The idea of it always blinds me. Somehow or another I end up hanging with this girl and she needed some addy. She had told me she had no more meds left but new a friend who would sell her one. Somehow my dumb ass mind didnt know the dangers of the drug. I didn't take it. She did. Now before we even go to get her this drug, she ends up giving me oral. I assume she liked me, but I now think it was because she wanted the drug and thought that was the way to get it. She took the pill and also was drinking. Clueless to this kind if stuff I didnt know much. She got pretty fucked up and started calling me by a different name and grabbing toward my crotch. It made me very uncomfortable. I wanted her to want ME not whomever she is calling me by now. I drove her home and went back home myself. She texted me the next day pissed and asking if anything happened after she took the pill. I explained to her what happened and she didn't believe me. This crushed me too. 

I had a few people regret their experiences with me and say some pretty terrible things about me. This destroyed me. I ended up in a hospital because I was a threat to myself. I had finally thought I had the courage to kill myself. I never could get to the point of doing it. Trust me I wanted to. But my brain would never let me. This would often lead to extreme hysteria.  Being held against my will there for a day in that hospital was devastating and I had a rough experience with a security guard there. I lied my way to freedom by playing it off as I wanted attention and just left it at that. My family wished I would go get a counselor but they also had very little ideas of why i was so down other than they knew i was letting what others said get to me. I deleted all social media and have tried staying as isolated from the public as I can (minus work and other have to survive things). 

It's to point (still) where I get so anxious when I hear my name. I am afraid to show myself in public. Some days I'll drive to a store or wherever to run errands and just sit in my car too anxious to go in and will just go home.

I never did see a counselor but instead just spent so much time in my head trying to figure out how to be a better person. I destroyed my reputation in not only my town, but my state. (And in my own mind).

I relapse now and again and re download social media apps or tinder and try to find love and cure me of the loneliness. I know it isnt the way I need to find love, but desperation kicks in and tinder seems like the heaven of dating.  Usually I'll be on Facebook or tinder for between 20 minutes and a day before I get extreme anxiety and delete everything. Sometimes I behave great, but sometimes I find myself asking questions about wanting a sugar daddy and such. Not that I would do it, but the idea of potentially falling for someone who wants that lifestyle eats away at me.

I have had some very truly wonderful people like me and want to be around me, but I get so anxious and paranoid that they are either just trying to sell themselves or they just want someone to pay for their life. I can't accept a good person in my life. I always question it and end up asking probing questions to see if my suspicions are correct... this always just leaves me looking like a jackass and losing the opportunity for someone good in my life. 

I dont know if I even deserve to be happy or if I even deserve to live. I feel guilty. All the time. I feel I could have been such a better person to so many people. I wish I could go back and relive those years and just focus on something better. Idk how to grow. I have thought about moving away and starting over. . But my family has land and a place for me to make a home... I'm just scared living here."
1306,I feel like my boyfriend doesn't love me because of his OCD,"My boyfriend's OCD will flare up for a month or 2 at a time. I have expressed how uncomfortable it makes me feel when he confesses his bad/intrusive thoughts.. Usually he obsesses over mistakes/thoughts from the past (most of which are insignificant and he isn't even sure happened). His relationship theme ones were particularly bad with lines like ""I thought I regretted not sleeping with another woman before we met""/""I thought a girl was hotter than you""/""I thought I wasn't attracted to you for a few minutes"" and I was deeply hurt. I feel like the reassurance he gets from me is more important than MY FEELINGS and wellbeing. I feel like he doesn't love me if he just uses me to confess and reassure him he is a good person. He keeps saying he'll stop but his anxiety gets unbearable and he breaks and I threatened to break up if he doesnt quit yesterday and he has done it twice since then and keeps asking for one last chance. I love him, he's my best friend and my heart is a aching. Help?"

1308,"Help, what am I feeling?","This usually happens to me, today It started a couple hours ago, I was feeling dreadful, I have tons of assignments for uni and I been worrying about something specific lately (I don’t wanna say what it is) The feeling was manageable at first but then it started slowly escalating. I got really overwhelmed and everything around me felt wrong, my mind felt like it was slowed down, like i was there but not fully, and my room didn’t feel like it was mine, like i was in the middle of two parallel dimensions that where exactly the same, but I wasn’t fully in any of them. Sometimes when I have too much anxiety I hit myself in the head, it relaxes me, but when I do that I always make the conscious decision of doing it, but now I started remembering a situation I don’t like to think much about and I hit myself in the head without even thinking about it, I would never do that especially because my little sister was in my room I don’t wanna freak her out.

I feel good now, im thinking straight and I feel like im in the dimension im supposed to be in.

What is this feeling? I think it’s not a panic attack cause I think people feel fear when that happens, I never feel feat in this situations I only feel dread and worry

Also sorry for my English"
1309,lockdown,"hey :) lockdown has been a real struggle so far, it’s felt like all my coping mechanisms have been taken away just as things were starting to feel stable. i imagine a lot of other people are struggling too and thought of starting some kind of group,, maybe a weekly group call so people feel they have someone to check in with regularly. as i’m 16 i’m mostly thinking younger people but maybe this could inspire something similar in older groups too :)"
1310,I want to go home,"We're on lockdown here in the UK and i'm stuck at uni 3 hours away from home. It's playing hell with my mental health, i want to go home and i miss my parents. I don't know how longer i can take being cooped up in the house all day living next door to someone who rings the police every time anyone steps outside- so i barely even get to go out for exercise without getting harassed which is making my anxiety skyrocket.

I'm so lonely and i was already feeling bad before the lockdown began. My parents can't drive so they can't pick me up. I just want to see my Mum and Dad again in person and not over facetime. I can't wait for this to be over."
1311,She is always with me and I don’t know whether to embrace her or fear her.,"I’m an 18-year-old male and I’m simply terrified of living any longer than I have already. I haven’t romanticized committing suicide, it’s just the things I do out of impulse that scare me. I’m so aggressive to friends and family when they are nowhere close to deserving it. Every sound or sight that is out of the norm (especially in familiar places such as my bedroom) causes my heart to race and my previously calm fingers to twitch into fists. I’m in love with taking unnecessary risks like speeding in my car, stealing from anyone, anything to do with fire, experimenting with drugs, etc. In the moment of trying these things only have a flash of hesitation before thinking to myself, “fuck it.” I’m saying all of this because one day I’m going to end my life with this behavior. I don’t even know when it all started because my memory is in shambles. I can’t even think straight anymore. When I try to explain something I jump from idea to idea, sometimes never making my original point clear. The worst and most recent thorn picking at my sanity is her voice. She doesn’t necessarily tell me to carry out tasks but she hints heavily. For example; during my brief moment of hesitation as I contemplated swiping alcohol from my parents’ supply, she said, “fuzzy”, like she was illustrating what it would feel like. This voice is always feminine and vivacious in nature. I don’t know who she is but due to being raised in a moderately religious household, I believe she is divine. I believe she is one of many devils who picked me to explore the life of indulgence rather than a more heavenly abstinence. While at times this feels so incredibly good, most of the time I’m scared of the next episode. It’s exactly like a drug addiction. The things she leads me to do sometimes put others at risk or harm others and I’m desperately trying to not hurt anyone else. I know in the back of my head I will destroy my own body if this goes too far, but I’m terrified of what she will do with my soul. I’m very sorry if these words cause any harm to your mind, but I’m running out of sources for help because no one believes me and I refuse to expose myself to anyone close to me. I don’t know what to do, she clouds my judgement."
1312,I’m spiralling down again,"Despite all my yoga and getting out for exercise, I woke up this morning full of anger and resentment and I don’t want to spiral further.

How on earth do I just wake up in a bad mood?? What is wrong with me!!"

1314,I’m not looking for pity or sympathy just some anwsers,"   Well I guess this is a pretty shitty first reddit post but I’ve recently been having some problems and don’t really have anyone else to talk to so why not ask strangers.
  
     I’ll try and keep this brief as not to bore anyone. I’m 16 soon to be 17 and ever since the start of high school I’ve had this long unwavering sadness that just hangs behind me wherever I go. I have no skills or virtues to speak of I’m just average at everything and more recently I’ve lost interest in just about everything I do. I constantly disappoint and argue with my parents, I do the bare minimum of school work to the point where I barely pass. It feels like my whole life is just mistake after mistake and most of the time it’s just repeat disappointments for the for the same mistake I keep making.

    On top of disappointing my family it feels like anytime I spend with them is constant overview of my short comings and how it is hurting them. 

   I have brief moments of happiness (more like content with my situation rather than sadness) when hanging out with friends who more and more feel like don’t invite me to anything and if I was not there no one would blink an eye.

  I have a horrible life style all I end up doing is mindlessly sitting on my phone I’ve tried to work out or force regimes on my day but to no avail.

     I really don’t know what to do anymore and I’m tired of felling and living like this. I’ve never really talked about what I’m feeling before and any attempts have been incoherent nonsense where I get too worked up to speak. 

   I just need to know what to do 

   I just want help


P.s sorry if this as well is just incoherent nonsense it feels like all the words in my head is a jumbled ball."
1315,How does my dr know what meds I need if I can’t explain myself?,"I have a ton of mental health issues and don’t know how to convey to a primary dr what I need. I know the end point is medication but how do they know which one is for me? I’ve never been to this dr before, have made an appointment though and am not sure how to explain myself. Do I ask for a psych recommendation instead or is that her call? Do I just skip the dr and try to go straight to a psych?"
1316,How can I convince my parents to get me diagnosed?,"I don’t know if I am mentally ill, or if so what I might have, but I often feel sad, guilty, and worthless and get anger easily. But then a few hours later, I will feel happier than most people are any day. I’ve also broken down in school thinking that someone was out to get me, however no one knew because I went into the bathroom so now nobody believes me. I’ve gained 20 lbs. in two months, and have been very hungry all the time.

The issue is that whenever I bring it up to my parents that I am sad, they will ask why, and I always say I don’t know, because I really don’t, and they always respond with “well then you aren’t sad.” I went to therapy 3 years ago, so they use that as an excuse by saying that I should be fine, I went to therapy. How could I bring the subject up to them?"
1317,My mental illness is cognitive isolation and it predates this pandemic.,"I'm mildly infuriated by the sudden surge in discussion about mental health, not because I don't think people should talk about it more, but because it feels like it's only now become socially acceptable due to numbers, and not due to empathy. 

The population has effectively been subjected to an experiment which, in a way, emulates the entrapment of mental illness. The things people love, their networks of support, their access to things like recreation, routine, to life in general, have been cut off, and while the physical ability to do those things remains, people cannot simply just 'do' them anymore. 

For years people have told me 'just do it'. For years, it's been near impossible to get them to appreciate that it's not a case of will or won't, or that I don't want to, it's that I CAN'T. 

I CAN'T because my depression has shut me in, away from my life. I CAN'T because my anxiety has enforced the confinement as a desperate condition of my own safety. I CAN'T because my ADHD has torn up my schedule and scattered my hours for work and recreation and sleep beyond the acceptable 9 to 5. I CAN'T because my PTSD has locked me out of my time and place, of space, of me, and how can I do anything when I CAN'T THINK beyond that disassociation? That separation from me? 

My mental illness is cognitive isolation and it predates this pandemic. 

I have been locked in my mind for lost days and counting. There is no perceivable end. I am waiting for a cure that may or may not one day be provided to me. I am uncertain. I am alone. 

This is not a sentence I have chosen. It is enforced by the chemicals governing my brain. I WANT but I cannot DO things. Do they understand now, the rest of them? They cannot go outside their houses and it hurts, doesn't it? And here we are, having watched and wanted the outdoors for so much longer, isolated all our lives. We have never been able to go outside our minds.

It shouldn't take a pandemic to force empathy. I wish I could say the increased discussion is going to change the stigma the mentally ill experience in everyday discourse, but I don't believe the popular memory will hold on to something like empathy. 'Just do it', 'get some fresh air', 'look what a beautiful day it is!'. Read the damn headlines. We WANT but we CAN'T. 

One day, governments will proclaim the outside accessable again. People will open their doors and they'll leave their houses. 

There is no door out of our heads. We can survive like this, sure, but if we didn't have to, why would we? Do you not think we would 'just do' things if only we could?"
1318,How can I feel better about myself?,"My friend needs some advice and I thought that reaching out to reddit could possibly help me be able to help her.

I received a text today:

“Its like I don't know how to just be happy at where I'm at. I always focus on the things that I don't have instead of appreciating how far I got in life. I'm not struggling financially anymore, my relationship with my Mom and sisters is fine, I have a boyfriend who loves me despite my flaws, and as far as I know I'm healthy.

So, you'd think that I'll be just fine and dandy, but I'm not. I nit pick everything wrong with me. Idk, even before this coronavirus pandemic started, I was like this so I can't blame it on that alone. I was never really comfortable in my own skin, so it's a harder habit to break because its literally all that I know. I feel like I'm falling behind of getting my self confidence together. And I know that you're trying your best to help me grow and develop into a better version of myself, but it's so hard. Knowing one way of something your whole life and then realising that the way that you were going isn't great and then having to change it is hard (if that makes sense.) And I know that this isn't an over night thing to process and change myself, but the real problem is that I don't know how to make that first step.”

What would you guys incline as a good first step to boosting your self confidence and self worth?
We both live in Georgia if that helps.

1320,Resources for Others,"I have buckets of trauma and issues but I am asking for someone else for once. 

My baby cousin (she is an adult and in grad school so baby here is relative) came to me to talk about some issues. We had some shared opinions on a different family members Facebook posts and got talking. Or rather, she started talking. 

She believes she needs therapy but has trauma around it. She was molested as a child and forced into therapy. Now the idea of engaging in therapy sends her into a panic. 

I was also forced into therapy and can somewhat understand the trauma but I was an adult and I am still coming to terms with my own CSA. 

Any resources I can send to my baby cousin? I am also going to email my therapist tomorrow."
1321,How can I help my friend?,"My friend has recently been self-harming a lot. I've been through similar things myself a long time ago and I'm trying to be understanding about it. I keep telling her that it's not her fault and she shouldn't be ashamed of it, but beyond that I have no idea what to say. It makes me so sad that she's going through this and I really want to help, is there anything else I can do?"

1323,"My 29th birthday is coming up, and I feel like a failure at life.","My 29th birthday is coming up, and I feel like I’ve wasted a large part of my life. I see my other friend’s getting married and having children, while I am still single. I see other’s having all of the things that I really want out of life. I worry I’m going to get too old without finding the right person, so I won’t be able to have children. 2 years ago, I fractured my spinal cord in a drunken attempt to end my life. Ever since then, there has been a lot of grief. I can walk, but every day is full of immense pain. I have a good job that I love, and a small amount of friends at the moment.

1325,Advice for overcoming bad trust issues as a result of cheating?,"First some background - I'm 19M, I've had 3 girlfriends. 

The first one I dated for about 4 months in 11th grade. As it was my first relationship, I was pretty clueless, but she seemed at the time to be absolutely amazing. She had just moved to my school district from nearby, and I totally fell in love with her. She was my cello stand partner, she was quiet and shy but always smiled at me in the hallway and liked my band shirts. She was gorgeous, and I was just head over heels. We started dating and for the first two months, it was great. But then she sort of started getting distant. She would have these periods of like a few days at a time where she wouldn't really talk to me or hang out with me. She'd cancel plans and go hang out with friends from her old school. I felt left out, but I was always good about things because I wanted to be understanding and I knew moving was hard on her. I was kind of your stereotypical sweet quiet music nerd. I loved her and she told me that she loved me, so I figured there was nothing to worry about. A few weeks later she asked me out of the blue what drugs I had tried. I kind of thought she was joking, as she seemed ridiculously straightedge. I told her none and asked why. She revealed that she and her old friends did smoked cigarettes, a lot of weed, and their favorite was oxy. They did lots of oxy. This weirded me out as it was totally out of left field. But I was still nice and didn't say anything except that I didn't think it was for me. A week later we were watching something on her phone when a text popped up from a Daniel saying ""Hey cutie are you still down to get oxy and hook up tn?""? It was revealed through the subsequent conversation that she had a string of guy friends from her old school that she would frequently get high with and have casual sex with. When I asked her why she said ""you're a nice guy but do you really think you could ever satisfy me? You're like a little puppy. You're fun to play with but I have needs."" I was absolutely crushed and I was depressed for months afterward.

Needless to say, I was extremely cautious with relationships from then on. But about a year later a new love interest entered my life. This one was completely different from the last I'll call her J. My school district had one middle school and two high schools, so many people at my hs had friends at our sister high school. I didn't keep in close touch with anyone at the other school, but a lot of my closest friends that I made in high school did. They started inviting me to some parties that were roughly half our school half the other school, and I was reunited with tons of friends that I'd lost touch with. It was great. One of them was a girl I always had a little crush on in middle school, but nothing ever came of it. We started flirting at one of these parties and one thing led to the next and we were dating. I was hesitant to trust ofc, so I talked to some of my friends about it. They all said some variation ""I've known her since preschool she would never do that in a million years. She's like the nicest and most loyal person I know."" And getting to know her, it seemed that they were right. She was awesome. I opened up to her about the past cheating, and she was such a sweetheart. She was extremely supportive and told me that she thought that cheating was basically the worst thing anyone could do to another person shy of abuse. She was always very understanding of trust and trust issues. She was extremely reassuring and loving and made me feel that I had nothing to worry about. I bet you can predict where this is going based on the title of my post. She cheated on me. Ahhhhhh so fun. We had been dating for about a year total. She had this one guy friend from her school that she always seemed a little too comfortable with, I'll call him M. Around M she just acted.... different. I asked her about it and she said that it was just easy to be around him, he almost seemed like ""one of the girls."" And she had a point, M was a super nice and friendly guy. M and some of her other guy friends invited me to hang out with them a few times. It was a really nice gesture and M and I got pretty close. J and I had been fighting recently about pretty mundane shit. M asked about it, and I opened up. Unfortunately, he used this info to get close with her and eventually start sleeping with her, as I would later find out from M's twin brother, who was also friends with me and was horrified when he found out. Needless to say, J and I broke up. But this time, I don't know why, but I made her walk me through all the lies she told to get opportunities to see him. Her extra jazz band rehearsals on thursday nights? Those were made up so they could hang out and hook up. When I went with my family to Disney World? She spent the whole week with him. That time she didn't answer my texts for hours on a day when we were supposed to hang out? She was with him. It was the most painful thing I have ever felt.

I was single for a year and a half after that, and I vowed to put what happened behind me. When I went to college, I tried to become a different person. I wanted to re-invent myself. I was more social, left my room more often, I was just an all-around happier person. That was when I met my most recent girlfriend, L. We started dating, and things were going great. I thought my trust issues were behind me, but alas. After dating for 2 months I found out that L had been seeing this guy H casually for about a year total before her and I started dating. They had hooked up as recently as a week and a half before L and I started dating. I tried to be chill, but all my trust issues started popping up again. I got so anxious and had a hard time trusting her. Every time she didn't text me when I knew she didn't have class, I wondered if she was with H. Not because I actually thought she was. But I thought ""well, you never know right."" I hated that feeling more than anything. I was finally with someone amazing. I was a new, reinvented version of myself. Why couldn't I just trust her? We recently broke up, mostly for unrelated reasons. But I have been left wanting to fix my trust issues once and for all. Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - my first two girlfriends cheated on me, now I have a hard time trusting anyone. Help!"
1326,Feeling confident in battle,"Today was a win for me. 
After 10 years of battle with suicidal and “dark” intrusive thoughts, I think I found a proper weapon to battle with. (I’m sorry for the medieval imagery) 
Yesterday was my breaking point. The thoughts came from all angles, battering me with hopelessness. 
Today I told myself if you really want to end your time here then you should run that hill (large grassy hill used to damn a lake near my house) with a 30lb weighted vest on. So I ran the hill till I puked water. Laying in the grass actually thinking I was going to die, I smiled and was able to focus on my breath without dark intrusion for the first time in a long ass time. 
45 min later I had another deep feeling of wanting to die... so once again I stood up and said “if you really want to die then you should do push-ups till you pass out”... I didn’t pass out but I did see spots. Once again I had a clear mind! Amazing. Really... my mind races constantly. This was revolutionary for me. Maybe 2 hours later, laying in complete exhaustion- another thought arrives. This time deeper and geared towards past trauma... So i calmly said “I love you but I can’t do this any more... go and lift weights until you fall to the floor shaking.” So i did. It was pure torturous bliss. I’m hoping I will sleep tonight. If I don’t. I will run until I do. I’m sick of wallowing in the dark energy that is my intrusive thoughts. I want to be free but I want to be free here. I’ll post again if it becomes a affective method for intrusive thinking. 

Quick back story- I have experience in training and have used similar techniques for panic attacks. Traditionally I just lay in my depression until it’s bad enough that I turn on the tv until it turns into mush. I’m sorry if I misspelled something or my sentences are not coherent. I just wanted to get this out and hope it helps someone but I’m not going back to read it or I’ll become self conscious and delete it...?"
1327,Persistent negative thoughts,I have been having persistent negative thoughts that run through my mind as the voices of people I know.  Sometimes they are positive but mostly negative.  Anyone else have this problem?
1328,I feel like my head is full of cotton,[deleted]
1329,For those who have gotten off anti-depressants .... does the anxiety pass?,"I got on Pristiq for depression 2 years ago. Started cognitive behavioral therapy, exercising everyday, eating right etc. 

Well with my doctors supervision we started tapering off 3 months ago. I just got off the last 3-5% of my last dose. And woooosh severe, severe anxiety/anxious/jittery/heart racing feelings constantly.  Have had minor anxiety in my life but nothing like this. I had anxiety tapering down, but as I got lower and lower it's just gotten worse and worse. 

But now that I'm finally off completely (5 days now) , it is like BAD BAD. I called my psychiatrist and he said ""I can call in some klonopin to get you through"" but I said I was afraid to go down the benzo route and I'll see if I can tough it out. 

Was just hoping to see if anyone else had a familiar experience with getting off their antidepressant and what it was like etc... and how am I suppose to know if this is withdrawal or rebound anxiety (or are they the same thing)?"
1330,Plagarized an assignment and I’m too anxious to contact the professor to apologize and figure out what happens next,"Well...I fucked up. 

Before I was sent home from college due to COVID I was really on top of my schoolwork. I sat in the front row of my classes, payed attention and asked questions. I had straight As for the first time in my life while taking a difficult course load. 

Since I’ve been home, I’ve taken on many more responsibilities including taking care of my little sister and helping her with her schoolwork. This is highly time consuming, but my parents are essential workers so this isn’t a choice. I also live in New York so I’m basically stuck inside 24/7. I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2, so I’m not a stranger to depressive episodes, but being isolated has made it 10000x worse. 

Now, we were assigned a programming HW and I was pretty behind on the material. I managed to catch up and was making progress, but later that day I was going for a run and smelled something in the hallway of my apartment building. I alerted the super and they figured out it was coming from my neighbors apartment. The super called the police and they found his body. Apparently he died of COVID several days prior. For the next few days I was really out of it and was having trouble concentrating on anything. I did my best and failed the HW. 

For the next assignment, I asked a friend who took the class last year if they could help me and they sent me their assignment. I kind of changed things up and rewrote certain parts. 

Then last week the professor reached out to see if everything was ok because I hadn’t been going to class. I responded saying thanks for checking in and that everything is fine, I’m just very busy with family responsibilities etc. I didn’t really want to explain anything and he’s a nice guy and I didn’t want him worrying about anything. 

We got back the second HW and the TA left a note: Please talk to the professor this has been flagged for plagiarism. 

I know I’m in the wrong and want to apologize, but I don’t know what to say. I’m genuinely sorry and I didn’t use my judgement at all. I don’t want to give excuses, but at the same time I do want the professor to be aware that I was out of it and that this was a huge mistake. I deserve a 0, but I’m afraid that now I’m going to fail the class or get a mark on my transcript which will ruin my future. 

How can I apologize and should I explain myself? I’m freaking out right now because this was literally the last HW and now I might have to retake the class and I’ve possibly ruined my chances of going to graduate school. I’ve never done anything like this before and need all the advice I can get. 

Thanks for reading this."
1331,Social anxiety is ruining me and i'm scared,"I've always been very introverted and had this horrible fear of talking to people i'm not really close to and i just wish so fckin bad i wasn't that way... people say ""you should just face your fears"" but i can't. i mean they're called fears for a reason right? You can't even get close to them without breaking down. And now i'm scared that this fear will ruin my future and make me miss opportunities to make something out of this stupid life of mine... i don't know what to do.. i mean even fuckin zoom calls terrify me it's so frustrating.. idk if anyone's got any advice for me that i can actually apply and not just empty encouragements? Thanks for reading this far either way..."
1332,Can someone help me identify what could be wrong with me,"My body feels weird, can somebody help me identify what could be wrong with me?

You see, my body feels twitchy most of the time. Usually around night time, my body feels very twitchy like it want to move, when I type, I can feels my fingers getting slightly impatient, this all started after I had my first seizure a couple of months ago. I had an MRI, and they told me my brain was healthy, I also had a neurologist appointment and they both told me I don’t have epilepsy. Also, I get these weird tingly feelings in my head, usually around night time as well. Sometimes, I feel like I’m gonna pass out when I walk, and my head nose of the time feels weird in general, although I don’t exactly know how to describe it. Sometimes, my head feels warm and I just don’t feel right. I just feel like there is something wrong with me and I don’t want anything bad to happen to me, so if anyone could help me identify what is wrong with me it would really help."
1333,I’m going to end up alone and I can’t cope with it.,"I’m 17 years old (female) and I’m an only child. My parents tried having kids multiple times but she would always have stillborn babies until me so my parents were kinda older when they had me. I have 2 aunts who are also around the same age as my parents and never had kids, so I don’t really have family, just 4 adults in my life who are all 50+. 
 Theres not a day that goes by that I don’t worry about what I’ll do when my last family member passes away. I’ll be alone and no one to trust on. I became depressed and suicidal dreading my future. I have a bf of 4 years, but it’s honestly not a good relationship and I just hold on to him because of the fear I have of not having anyone. I also have trouble socializing due to some recent events. I don’t know how to cope with this fear. Ik me and my bf won’t stay together for too long, and I’m afraid I’ll have a breakdown. Dose anyone have any advice? :(("
1334,How has this Corona-virus/ quarantine been for you?,"
So I wanted to make this post in several subreddits to get feedback from different audiences of people. I want to hear how everyone is affected from all spectrums here on reddit so if you have seen this before that is why. Also all rants are welcomed, I don’t discriminate &lt;3

##To go more in depth with the titles question, what have you conquered/ or are struggling with anything during this time of staying home more than usual? And for some extra questions:

1. What goals do you have/ or are working at to get accomplished?

2. Has it affected your work/social/personal life?

3. And what about the negative side of it all?


#Long rant ahead answering the questions 
***For me*** family life has gotten worse, we have snippet of days/ nights where things are positive but for the most part everyone has been taking this time to be extra bitchy but they won't admit that :) ! 

Fought with my sisters more now, before it would be every other day now it is EVERYday without fail. Won't get into it but just know I wish I could leave. For conquering I have multiple projects I started either working on again, or just made new ones too keep myself busy. ***Also Conquered loosing 9 pounds, have been studying for my EMT stuff and love it because now I understand a LOT more day by day and i just fall in love each and every time. I write, read, draw, basically what I did before but MORE now because it's better than having to deal with everyone else. I still had to deal with them before but now that quarantine is a thing, everyone doesn’t spend time so they go off and do their own things, as do i. Communication/ open minded people has NEVER been in my family so it is pointless to even start tRyInG tO kEeP tHe PeAcE ya know? 

###I keep the peace by making sure there is no conflict with me involved. Actually when it doesn’t involve me I’m always hopping in it because my family lovessss to single people out and make them feel like garbage. *My little sister with autism is always getting heat so every single time i step up for her now I’m getting beat or in trouble.* It’s what doesnt come with being the oldest of 2 younger ones, but what comes with being an awesome human being who doesn’t like abuse. And you know what? If i have to get beat by someone who doesn’t see what she does wrong than f my mom 💀 She likes to do what everyone else does and explode on her kids when she’s not doing okay herself. So you want to beat me for what is right? Make it count cause I have always been taking the beatings for everyone else, just because we are in quarantine doesn’t mean I won’t expect them any less. 

I fight my mom back each time because I don’t know why she thinks i WONT defend myself. Honest to god she tells us not to be with ANYONE who puts there hands on any of hEr KiDs, but will “play fight” hit us real hard, or even when we deserve it and tell us to take it. And not put our hands up or shield, nada. The youngest could even care less if shes getting in trouble, more less LOVESSS to rat her out for a n y   l i t t l e    t h i n g!!!
I mean *anything*. She does it without fail to the both of us but it’s okay. Dysfunctional and toxic? That’s putting the family name lightly but I don’t hold account of injury, one day they’ll learn hopefully. Until than i protect my sister at all costs. 

And If your wondering why the littlest doesn’t get mentioned of my protection is because she don’t need it, my moms always defending her and taking her side. Even when she does “get in trouble” it’s not the beatings i get lol! She gets a lecture and possibly the silent treatment for a half an hour or so, than their back to their go bestie go bestie relationship. Again I don’t hold no grudges but I don’t have a relationship with them that is close so that’s the entire reason why. 

Anyways

**My goals have been weight loss along with other things but that is d- OH I have been doing women push ups!!!!!** (The one where your on your knees) And so far I can do 2-3 without fail, and each day they get easier. I wanted to build my upper body strength while also getting good at push ups period which i never could do in gym at school XD so that is super fun

I don't work, and I don't have real life friends so my work/social life hasn't changed at all, but my online relationships is a different story, it's whatever. Family life as i said before is torture but honestly there is something new that has been bothering me non stop. I know i could put my problems in the “right"" subs but I am asking this question to each sub too see how everyone is, now I am just answering them for everyone else because why not. I won’t go into detail on this post but it’s just past demons I can’t get over that are having me and my mental/ and emotional state like a rollercoaster. It’s not like i could tell my mom either or get a therapist. It’s as if I’m stuck which isn’t a nice feeling. 

#With that being said this quarantine for me has been more bad than good honestly, and the virus has gotten me sick but i am recovering from it thankfully. A lot of people around me caught it, and with the grace of god no one died thankfully

1335,I don’t know if I want to sleep.,"It’s 3.30 am again, and school starts at 8 (in 4.5 hours). I won’t wake up in time if I go to sleep, so should I sleep or stay awake..? I pulled an all-nighter 2 days ago, and I kinda recovered from it yesterday. I don’t know though... I feel kind of sick, and I’ve had an itchy throat and a headache for a few days now, so it might not be a good idea."
1336,Am I a bad person?,"TW: illness and abuse
I'm not gonna go into too much detail. My mom is abusive, has been my whole life, I despise her. I always made jokes about how I won't care when she dies. I plan on cutting off contact later this year. But I found out a few weeks ago that she may have a terminal illness. I don't live with her anymore and she asked if I had money to spare so she could get it more thoroughly examed and confirmed if she has it or not. I don't have money to spare so I told her that. But I genuinely don't feel a thing about it. If anything I'm relieved. Part of me thinks I should be sad though. But I'm just not. All I can think is that I'll finally be free. I don't have to worry about her trying to find me and ruin my life again. I'm almost glad she might have this illness. Idk. But I just needed to vent."
1337,I have bad anger issues and they are causing my relationships to fail. Need help.,"I have struggled with uncontrollable anger for years now. I am not violent, but I do say some very hurtful things without control. I try not to be a mean person, but sometimes I will just explode on people for no reason. It is causing me to lose friends and aquantinces. If anyone has had a similar problem, or just wants to help, please tell me how I can control my anger because I have tried a lot of things and nothing works. Thanks. (Edit: this is a throwaway account)"
1338,Question about meds and effects,"My mom, due to certain circumstances not completely under her control, changed the dosage of medicine she was taking about 2-3 months ago and has under gone a lot of cognitive changes including suicidal thoughts, restlessness, and hallucinations.

Bupropion: 0mg to 200mg a day
Setraline: 0mg to 100mg a day
Topiramate: No change from 200 mg
Haloperidol: 15mg to 25mg
Ziprasidone: 60mg to 120mg

Is this change significant enough to cause serious decline or relapse?"
1339,Does anyone know a good weighted blanket?,I’m trying to get a weighted blanket but I don’t want to get one that’ll break or anything as they are expensive so I’m wondering if anyone have a brand they recommend or know how to find the right one.

Life if I buy something and there’s even a tiny tiny mark or scratch that not even that noticeable unless you focus on it , it will completely ruin the item for me and I get no joy from it.

1341,Sleepless,"I’m not exactly sure what I can do to help myself I find it extremely hard to sleep more than 4 hours a day when I try to sleep my head goes straight to horrible thoughts about how long I have to live, what’s after death and just general thoughts of my future that really unsettled me. I usually play music and it covers the thoughts but I end up not getting to sleep for an hour or 2 after. Once I finally get to sleep I wake up after about 2 hours due to a nightmare I have. I suffered from pretty bad depression for the last few years and tried to take my own life twice but the last 6 months I’ve been happy with my life. The only part that has got worse is my ability to sleep it wasn’t as hard before"
1342,I'm struggling and need some advice,"so, to start off, I'm new here so I don't really know how things work, but I just need some help with this.

This has been in my head for a while now and it's now suddenly gotten worse because of lockdown, im just going to get right into it, my gf isn't exactly a very happy person and to get straight to the point, I'm scared that she might kill herself, there's no way of us seeing each other so I can't check on her in person and it's hard to get a reply from her on social media.

the fact that I could wake up in a world where she's dead is terrifying for me, I can't sleep until I physically can't stay awake because I don't know if she'll still be alive when I wake up. Life is mentally destroying me. 

I love her so much that she is the only thing keeping me alive so if I loose her, im not going to last much longer. 

I don't know what to do any more, can anyone give me a bit of advice for dealing with this?"
1343,News Overload (Covid19 and Politics): How to stay mentally healthy?,"Hi everyone! I'm generally a very emotionally stable and solid person. I've overcome depression (years ago) and grateful for that. I've gone through divorce and other obstacles. Generally, I'm very happy. (I also live with the love of my life and own my own business (and business is going well right now)).  

However, the news (especially about the president and Biden) is seriously getting to me. I'm finding myself almost **obsessed about the election.** Also, I'm the **black sheep politically** of the family (and the state I grew up in). I've been chewed out on Facebook. I shared non-biased news articles. The person who attacked avoiding asking the questions I asked her. (She's a family member.) I'm sure she didn't even read the article. It just triggered her and she launched into her spew of comments. Fun times. 

**What are you doing to stay healthy mentally?** To stay productive? What guiding thoughts or truths help you? To not hold grudges against family members and friends? 

Part of me thinks: 

1. Ok, read minimal news. Don't post on Facebook. 
2. And then the other thought comes to mind, ""This is the time everyone needs to speak up, to explore"". Ugh.

**Request**: Let's **not** get into who we're voting for, or sides. I'm on the side of myself and other staying healthy. That's the ""side"" I want to win. :)"

I have major anxiety, I'm almost 16 and I don't know what's wrong with me, but all this makes me feel disgusting and like a bad person. I look at it like it's my brain trying to fuck me with but I don't know. my whole family is very loving and has never abused me or anything, so I don't understand why my brain is like this, and I want it to stop, I don't wanna picture this stuff anymore. someone please help me."
1346,My boyfriend seems to randomly change personality?,"So I know my boyfriend has some sort of mental illness, but I'm not sure what it is. He went to a psychiatrist a year ago per my request, but he doesnt remember what they said he had. All he remembers is they mentioned social anxiety and ptsd, and they wanted him to take antipsychotics (which he didn't end up doing because he stopped going)

We are in a 2 year committed LDR currently, but we video call at least once at day. When we call, we will normally either watch a movie, play a game, look at memes, or sometimes just talk about life. We're extremely close and know every little detail about each other, and have been together in person many times.

 But sometimes something will just change in him. He goes from his normal; being happy, making jokes, smiling, etc. To a completely different person. He just stops talking and smiling, and he seems to look really upset. Tells me to shut up, go away, tells me I'm annoying and he doesn't want to even see my face. So naturally, I would think something is wrong and ask if there is something bothering him but when I do he always says nothing is wrong, even if I make him promise he's telling the truth, and we almost never lie to each other about how we feel, if we do, we confess it later. But he never does. There is clearly something different that makes him seem like something made him mad. 

If I leave him alone to kinda let it pass on its own it doesn't go away, no matter how long I leave him alone. If I try to talk to him and distract him he gets mad and tells me he wants to be alone. I don't like to leave him alone once he gets upset because like I said before it does nothing, and I get very anxious because I don't like being alone for so long when he's upset because I care about him and want him happy, and he used to cut himself so I don't want him to do that.

The only way he will get out of this mindset is if we have a huge argument which gets very bad, sometimes with me feeling suicidal, to which he says things that seem like he doesn't care if i did it. He eventually snaps out of it when it hits him how hurt I am. (But when he is normal he will do anything to make me feel better)

I don't want these huge toxic arguments to be the only way out of this, because 1. I don't want to end up committing suicide 2. Its not healthy and 3. Because we should be able to handle it in a calm way. 

Also, he doesn't realize he is acting different until after he calms down. When he's in that state he thinks what he is doing is ok, then ends up feeling disgusted with himself for thinking that.

Is there either any ideas on what could cause him to change like this, like any kind of disorder in mind? Or maybe a way to help these arguments be less intense or stop them entirely? A way to fix his change in personality without such an emotionally draining fight?

 Help, advice, even opinions are welcome. I just feel so lost and alone, I need some support in this. Let me know if you want more information, thanks everyone. :)"
1347,I'm very worried about my little sister. Advice?,"I'm really worried about my younger sister's mental health. She's having to go to school from home (a BIG change for a 12 year old who used to get almost one-on-one help in her small private school), and her grades are slipping. Even during school, she wasn't always the best student. My parents are very strict on her, and they're blaming her bad grades on her ""laziness"". 

I'm her older sister, and she always tells me how worthless and sad she feels. She struggles with not being able to focus on her school work, and she's very easily distracted and anxious. She also tells me that she only listens to our parents because she's scared that they'll yell at her or physically hurt her. My parents are mentally abusive, and act as if being financially supportive is enough. They can be nice, but once you step out of line, they are very verbally abusive and can be physically abusive as well. They  act as if this is alright because this is how they were raised in the Philippines. 

Last year, she was diagnosed with ADD by her physician, but my mother refuses to take that into consideration. I feel like I can't do anything to help her, and I am very concerned about her. 

I myself have anxiety, depression, and and pure-OCD, and even though I feel suicidal at times, I worry about what would happen to her if I was gone. I want to help her so much, but I feel powerless. I don't want her to end up like me. 

If anyone has any advice about how I can help my younger sister, please help."
1348,Am I ok?,"Hello all,

Every once in a while I go down this dark hole. I feel bad for myself even though I shouldn't. I feel sad but I don't know why. This happens every 2-3 weeks I guess. I feel like a loser because no one texts me asking if they want to do something, I always ask. Recently my Step Mom was rude to me saying I never go outside and I stay at home all day. In my area, it's safe to travel outside and play golf. At the beginning I spent most of my days at my local mountain skiing for at least 5 hours, now that the season is over I spend around 3 hours every day or every other day golfing, and then later I will ride my bike or walk my 2 dogs for 30 min-1hour. I usually am after that doing homework or watching a show, or helping around the house. I have been waiting to hear back on a job, but I won't hear back from now till the 16th due to COVID 19. She wants me to go out more, which I feel like I have been. I really think I just need to rant. I don't tell anyone about these dark holes because I don't want to bother my friends. 

Thanks guys"
1349,Life and some other stuff,"  What is the mind? How do we know we are real? Well first, we have to take a deep look at ourselves and think of an answer for this question:

**What are we**

  No we aren’t talking physically, we are talking emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. “I think, therefor I am” is a quote that makes you think about what you are interpersonally. This quote is by René Descartes and you can find him [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes). “I think, therefore I am” means that even if you think you are nothing, you are still something. So don’t worry friend, you literally *are* something. Another question we have to ask is:

**Why are we**

  Now this is a *very* broad question. So lets focus on two sub-varieties of this question. “Why are the way you are”, and “Why am I here”. 
You are the way you are because your mind makes up all parts of you personality, perspective, etc.. Your mind builds off of experience and knowledge. You are an intellectual mind. Your mind is you. Why is your mind you? Because without it what would you be? You can’t think, therefore you aren’t. You will be *literally* absolutely nothing. 

**The Big Two (Part 1)**

  “What is the meaning of life?” and “What is life” are two of the biggest questions anyone can ask. 
   This first two answers to the questions are based off my opinions, and will be likely just me rambling. Feel free to skip to the second, more factual answer. Keep in mind there is not definite answer to these questions, and that my opinions are biased. Now, here we go.

  The definition of life (to me) is the fact that you are existing. Existing means thinking, a/o feeling, a/o doing. The meaning of life (according to yours truly) is to focus on the “now”



**The Big Two (Part 2)**

  From the Oxford Dictionary, the word life means “the existence of an individual human being or animal”. In a solipsistic (metaphysical anti-realists) POV, the definition of life would be anything that “exists” beyond the mind 1)doesn’t actually exist, or 2)that we don’t have access to a mind independent reality. And for the meaning of life? No one really knows anything about it. Each person has a different meaning for their life, if they even exist at all. 

**Final Statement**

  This won’t be the last post I make about these types of things. In the next Im doing simulated reality, and might do more after that. Keep a close eye for my next discussions. Remember, in the great words of u/southsamurai, “...reality is real enough”

Credit to u/southsamurai for helping me on my 14 year old mind’s existential crisis. He’s pretty good at philosophy and stuff i would go check him out lol"
1350,Knowing when to quit,How do you know when to quit something? Like the piano?
1351,i just need to tell someone,"i have generalized severe anxiety and social anxiety, as well as generalized severe depression and seasonal depression. recently, a school counselor told me she thinks i have PTSD (not officially diagnosed, i’m planning on seeing a psychiatrist soon). today, my mom told me she thinks i have either PTSD or bipolar disorder, which i’ve considered for years. 
i am certain i have one of those two things, but i haven’t been able to get diagnosed yet. i’m so tired of this fight i just wish someone could tell me what’s wrong with me."
1352,I feel inadequate in everything I do,"I've recently started a new job. It's a job I've wanted for a while and I am grateful to have the opportunity to be able to do it with my best friend too. I like it a lot but there's a definite learning curve and I'm just so anxious about my coworkers talking bad about me behind my back. I just want to be good at something for once and I feel like no matter how hard I try I always make mistakes. I also can't help but compare myself to my friend who finds it much easier (she has experience and also started before me so I know how stupid that is) my bosses even say I'm doing fine but I just hate that I don't feel like I'm doing good enough

I have no talent in anything. I can try my hardest to be good at anything, have passion, practice, and still manage to fuck something up. I just want to be good at something and I was hoping I would be naturally decent at this job instead of making such stupid mistakes."
1353,My boyfriend has been having some serious suicidal thoughts recently and refuses to go to therapy. Any advice? (Also posted in r/advice),"I also posted this in r/advice since that was the first place I thought to go, but I figured it would also be a good idea to put here.

So my boyfriend has been having some serious suicidal thoughts for the past few months and has almost acted on them twice (to my knowledge). These thoughts are giving him a lot of trouble sleeping and he'll have up/down days and weeks. I've been as supportive as I can, but I'm still really worried about him, as this is also affecting his physical health.

He's also not in the best family situation - he's stuck at home with his parents who seem to care but they definitely don't have the right idea of how to handle it. They think that just kind of putting it off and talking about God will help him (and I'm religious, but sis that's not gonna help).

I know that his parents are willing to take him to therapy if he agrees to go, but he really doesn't want to because he's uncomfortable with the whole idea of it. This is a problem though, since his family isn't really helping at all and he can't see any friends right now due to quarantine. I know that he needs some form of intervention right now, because he's not in a good situation. He also needs somebody with authority to tell his parents that they need to take him more seriously (and I know can't do that without them blowing me off and getting mad).

To those who have gone to therapy and maybe didn't want to in the first place, is there anything that I can say or suggest to help him decide to go? Or is there some sort of alternative that you know of that he might be more comfortable with? He just needs something to happen, and soon. 

I live in the USA if that helps with any services or suggestions."

1355,I don't get it,"Hi guys, I've posted on here a couple of times and this time it is less serious. I feel like every time I accomplish something small I go out of my way to fuck it up. It is incredibly frustrating for me. For instance sleep: I've always slept just fine until I was in my late teens. Now I'm regularly awake till 5 in the morning looking on my phone. I know I should not do this and for the last four days I was in bed and asleep at midnight. I stood up the next day at 9 ish. That to me is huge. This evening I did everything exactly the same switcht everything off lied in bed started reading and after 5 pages went nah not tonight. It is almost 5 am and once again I'm awake scrolling on my phone. It's not that I don't want a good sleep schedule. I really enjoyed not feeling like shit during the day and going out for walks and stuff like that. It's almost like I go out of my way to fuck shit up. It's not only sleep it's more than that. Am I the only one who feels like this ? And do you have tips because this sucks it brings me down and I can't really cope with it. Hope it doesn't sound stupid haha 😅"
1356,"Failing college course, fear of disappointing family.","Recently I’ve been becoming more and more mentally unstable and sometimes I just wake up in the middle of the night and start crying uncontrollably. The thought of disappointing my parents just goes through my head every second of the day. I’ve stopped socializing with my family, I go days without eating or sleeping, and just isolate myself from everything. I don’t want anyone to know or worry about me and it’s hard. When I told them I was switching my career paths they were upset but when I told them I was failing a course it got even worse. The first time I thought about doing something serious was in February and things have just kept on going down since. I don’t know what to do or how to get myself out of this."
1357,I know I’m not going to pass my pt test,"To start out, I joined the army recently. I fucking regret it. There’s a lot of pressure (rightly) involved that I thought I would be able to handle but I can’t. I know I’m going to fail my pt (fitness) test. Either way wether I pass or fail I don’t care. Either way will tremendously relieve stress. Either I don’t have to worry about it for about another year or I go home. If I fail though I’ll be the reason my higher ups get yelled at by their higher ups, and my family was so proud of me for joining. I’m constantly torn between disappointing everyone around me or maintaining my own sanity. I feel cornered and I can’t fucking take it."
1358,How to get therapy with no money?,"The post is kind of exactly how the title sounds. Background first. I’m turning 18 in a month and I’ve just finished my first year of college. I’ve been struggling with my mental health (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self harm, suicide attempts, trauma from a toxic home life, etc.) since middle school but my parents have this idea that since I’ve always been a straight-A student, I’m too smart for therapy and can handle my problems myself. I was punished and ridiculed for having symptoms (yelled at and grounded when they saw cuts, laughed at and called dramatic while having a panic attack, etc.) and not allowed to seek help. If I had talked to a guidance counselor in high school I would’ve been punished severely and they would not have allowed me to get or stay in treatment. I went away to college last fall and that helped a lot, but wasn’t a magic cure. I had a bad eating disorder relapse and scared the hell out of my friends and boyfriend, who encouraged me to go to the university counseling center. They were very nice and my assigned therapist did her best, but since I was a minor they couldn’t do anything for me without parental consent. I finally talked with my mom about it and her response at the time was “I think therapy is useless and you should deal with it yourself but if you want to go, sure”. Upon seeing the consent form she changed her mind because A.) the campus counseling center legally has to release therapy records without notifying me if they’re subpoenaed by a federal investigative body like the FBI and B.) they’ll release my records if requested to some national accreditation bodies in some career fields (e.g. ASHA, the group I’ll have to get my speech pathology license from when I finish school). She went into a tizzy about how I’d never get a job or I could be arrested by the FBI for a crime I didn’t commit on account of being crazy. (There’s no sense trying to change her mind here.) She said I consent to what I wanted when I turn 18 but she wouldn’t support it. My mom is the more logical of my two parents on the situation so I’d get an even worse response out of my dad. 

I’m about to turn 18 and I desperately want and need to start therapy. Probably a lot of it considering how much there is to unpack and learn to deal with. The problem is, I have no way to afford it. My parents have this thing about requiring their kids to go through school, and they financially support us through it but in exchange for that we have to live life on their terms until we graduate (for example, I cut and dyed my hair, I got about 4 hours of lecturing about how I was a terrible daughter with a faulty moral compass, and they told me if I ever tried to do something like that again I had to move back home and they’d kick me out when I become a legal adult). After graduation we can do whatever we want. Part of the rules mean I’m on their health insurance and I’m not allowed to work or otherwise earn an income. I have a debit card which they put money on if I tell them I need something, but they can see all my purchases and take the card away at will. I own $300 cash but they’re “holding onto it for you” in their safe in their bedroom closet so I can’t access it without telling them what it’s for and they must approve its use. I’m still looking into whether it’s worth it to just cut all ties on my 18th birthday and try to make my own way or suck it up for a few more years so I can at least avoid student debt before breaking away, but either way I’m in need of mental health treatment now. How do I go about doing this? Technically doing something through their insurance is possible (I’ll catch a bunch of shit about it but they won’t refuse to let the insurance cover me) but I don’t know how to figure out who or what it’ll cover. If there’s any sort of copay I’ll have no way of paying it. I’ve looked into online platforms like 7cups etc. but those have subscription fees which I have no way to pay. Essentially, I need a way to start and stay in therapy for free. Does anybody have any advice or resources for this? (If they’re location specific, I go to school in Tallahassee and spend most of the year there, global pandemic not withstanding, but during summers and quarantine I’m in central Florida.) I really appreciate it!"
1359,Sudden panic attack,"I was alone in my room, it was dark i was playing a game on my computer and chatting with a friend, our conversation went deeper and deeper into the classic life and death subject, then i started having a panic attack (note that it's my first time having one), I had a wierd feelin in my stomach then I started shaking, seening lights, hearing stuff around myself, then I had some kind of a paralysis (the only thing that I could do was to chat with my friend) I panicked even more, and started seeing a dark thing in my mirror, (forgot to mention that my pc was loud and tried to film it and heard a wierd unintelligible deep voice on the video, sent it to my friend and he didn't heard it), I was so shocked and panicked that I forgot some parts of it.I'll try to recall some of the stuff that happend in case any of you guys might need it.

I feel like this isn't real and something happened. I tried to kill myself a couple of months ago and I don't want to do it again, but there's something wrong. Something's off and I just want to wake up."
1361,Why i haven't tried to killed myself(trigger),"I think I haven't cause i'm scared of dying, its quite the conundrum, I've thought about it and its scary, the idea that I could exist and then just not exist is hard to imagine. That's kinda one of the only reasons, which is kinda not great, cause if there's a day that i'm overwhelmed beyond my fear that might be the end of me. Tbh its hard to imagine me in a position where I'll eventually kill myself, but like who expects to end up in that position?

So one of the things that seems to be causing my problems is friends and education, so I don't really have any personal relationships, and I don't have a ton of formal education cause I dropped out when I was like 13(17 now) cause of domestic issues at home. I'm not even sure I can develop a proper meaningful relationship atm, like I simultaneously really want relationships while also not understanding the point of it. I kinda lost most of my  friends after dropping cause I isolated myself a lot, I have like one friend who I've had for years, apart from him, not really, there are people who I text, but like idk, not sure how real they are. last time I met with someone was before September I think, like a friend, tbh I probably only met up like less then a dozen times last year, idk, lol, such is life.

So yeah, I've been depressed for a few years, at times I was doing ok, at other times less so, I used to self harm a few years ago, was able to stop that though. I've also tried getting help, when I originally hurt myself I was 14 or so and was able to get a referral, but at the time I wasn't too into I guess and stopped after a few weeks. I tried to get another referral last year, although apparently the waiting list is a few years, which ya know isn't great, although I wonder, i'm not sure how serious I am about this, but its a thought that popped up, I wonder if I could intentionally harm myself for the purpose of getting some help, they might take me more seriously if my actions were more serious is the idea. Idk, just ideas, although I don't know if I can do this on my own and it kinda tears me apart sometimes, I feel pretty alone and have for a long time, I wonder if its my situation or if my brain is messing with me. I'm not too sure, but hey, those are my thoughts. 

Btw: not planning on doing anything bad atm, don't worry about it, just wanted to express myself a little, thanks for reading this"
1362,How to find that “spark” again?,"If you would’ve asked me three weeks ago if I’d be posting here, I’d have told you that you were crazy.  But alas, here I am.  

Basically, I’ve had constant tinnitus for the last three weeks, and it’s possible I may have caused it by not wearing my hearing protection correctly at work for two hours or so.  Unlikely bc it’s not much louder than a lawn mower in there, but anyways.  It could’ve been that, my medicine, TMJ, congestion or even a different problem.  Doctors don’t know, there’s not much they can do for me except hope it goes away.

I’m normally the most mentally calm person, I don’t crack under pressure, pretty calm and always look forward.  I’m going to college on a full ride scholarship and I was super ready to go.  I then planned on going to Air Force, then law school.  But now.  I feel helpless, and I just don’t have that spark.  That’s the best I can explain it.  

After my tinnitus episode, my doctor prescribed me some anxiety meds, and it’s definitely calmed me down, but now I don’t have that spark anymore.  Considering my condition may be noise induced, and could never go away, I keep blaming myself, which I know isn’t healthy.  And I was highly motivated just three weeks ago, but now I’m struggling to find that motivation.  It’s been hard to enjoy things with a piercing ringing that destroys all my focus and enjoyment of things I liked (nature, quiet room was my thinking place).  

I’m just wondering, what does it take to find that spark again in light of all this?  Any advice from someone who has been through this?  Could it be my medicine causing it?"
1363,Something is wrong in my head &amp; I don’t know what it is,"My mind does this thing to me all the time that doesn’t make sense and I don’t understand what it is. It affects my daily life, how I think, and my happiness. I feel like I can’t function like I used to because my mind is always doing this same thing. It’s so weird and I don’t know what it’s called or what to do about it and I need help and I’m scared of it. Whenever I am doing things like picking out socks to wear, pajamas for bed, body wash to bathe with, bowls to eat out of, etc. it’s like my brain goes into this weird, anxious fight or flight mode where if I don’t choose the “right” pair of socks, pajamas, bowl, whatever, then something bad is going to happen to me that day or something is going to go wrong. I don’t understand it and I can’t control it. I know it’s ridiculous and I know what socks I choose can’t actually determine what will happen to me, but at the same time my brain is telling me that it will and I absolutely HAVE to do it. I get this almost sick feeling in my stomach like something bad is gonna happen if I don’t find the “right” pair of socks to wear for that day. I feel like I don’t have control of my own mind. I just told my boyfriend about this and he thinks I should get help from a psychiatrist but I feel like they won’t believe me or something. I also have a problem with feeling like things are just going to go wrong on their own. I’m constantly in a state of worry even if it’s just at the back of my mind. It’s hard for me to mentally relax and just feel at ease. I don’t know what this is and it feels like it’s honestly ruining my day every single day. I always have a feeling other people think I’m being fake or dishonest when I’m not and that they don’t actually like me or want me around. I feel like a burden to others sometimes. I almost just don’t feel happy anymore because I can’t stop feeling so much worry and dread about things that don’t matter. Can anyone tell me what this might be and if it’s something anyone else has experienced?"
1364,What would you do if you found this in the street like I did? No reports I could find online indicate that the person went through with it. I turned it in to the authorities just in case.,[letter I found ](https://imgur.com/gallery/E8x9u6J)
1365,Hello. I just joined here spontaneously. I realized today I have no support.,I've had different levels of panic attacks over the last years. But this is different. I know the exact day it started to get worse. And now I feel it can't be fixed. I hyperventilate and can't breath. It feels like my lungs collapsed. Sometimes I get angry and thrash around and hit things just to snap mysf out of it. I feel like I'm dying. I can't live this way. I have a daughter and need to fix myself for her. It's like I forgot how to breath. My chest hurts. I can't calm down and learn to breath normally again. My fiance leaves the room now when I speak about it. Perhaps I've been mentioning it too much. But I wish someone listen. I feel sick.
1366,"Need advice for father (60M) in severe, persistent bipolar depression (GA)","My father (60M, resident of Georgia, USA lives alone) has been in a severe bipolar depression for the past 18 months. As a consequence of his illness, he's unable to complete tasks like cooking, showering, buying groceries, cleaning the house, refilling prescriptions, paying bills, using a computer, or answering the phone. He can do these things if he is absolutely ordered to, or if there is someone there to closely help him, but otherwise he lays in bed throughout the day. Prior to his depression, he was completely independent and could complete all the above tasks. Fortunately, there's been no evidence that he's considering hurting himself. However, his depression is causing him to lack the motivation necessary for daily tasks of independent living.

We (his two adult children) live 8+ hours away, and for months 0-11 we made monthly trips home to help him pay bills, take him to monthly psychiatrist appointments, restock his food, and so on. He strongly resisted the idea of leaving his home to live with us. We also hired someone to cook him daily meals in home. However, the conditions in his home eventually became appalling (dirty, bug infested), he did not regularly take his medication, and he lost 20% of his body weight due to not eating enough. For this reason, we more or less forced him to move in with us, and for months 12-18, he has lived with us. This helped in some ways. He regained his weight, took medication regularly (without reminders from us), and would do some tasks around the house if asked to (cooking simple meals, putting dishes in dishwasher). This seemed promising. His mood improved slightly, but he still laid in bed for 98% of the day. We are obviously not trained mental health caregivers, but we gave it our best to help him become more independent.

This week, we attempted for him to live independently in his home. It failed. Over the past 6 days, he skipped his medicine, did not shower or change clothes once, and didn't make an attempt to get groceries or refill prescriptions. He didn't call us for help.

We are a good support system for him, but we aren't trained to handle this, and caring for our father in a hands-on way for the past 18 months has worn us down and come at a huge cost to our work and our own relationships—with only partial, temporary progress to show for it. He has been on 3+ new medications for depression, and none seemed to make a substantial difference. Clearly, our efforts to help him live alone have not worked, and we need to try something more drastic.

One idea is for him to live in an assisted-living facility until he recovers. The priorities would be 1) trained staff looking after him, encouraging him to shower, dispensing meds, helping with daily tasks and 2) socializing him with other people. One challenge for this is the cost; he is on a somewhat decent healthcare exchange plan, which potentially could help with it? Another challenge is his almost certain unwillingness to participate in it voluntarily. Throughout his depression, he's resisted seeing doctors, talking to therapists, moving in with us, etc, and we expect this would be no different. We aren't sure how to handle this, but we're ready to go nuclear, such as obtaining legal guardianship, if that would help. Obviously, this is extreme, but he is in desperate need of serious help, and make no mistake, this depression is ruining his life. Doing nothing and leaving him at home is the other extreme, and we 100% think he would literally starve to death.

We're at our wits end and in need of advice."
1367,"As of tonight, my mom is finally in crisis hopefully getting the help she needs. I don’t even know how to start processing this and could use any kind words or advice.","My (25F) mother (43) has been having some wild symptoms starting back in October. She has been an on and off drug abuser for a large part of my life, with her choice drug being prescription pain pills. She has suffered a lot of trauma in her life time, and minus some narcissism issues and some kleptomania, she is a fairly good person. A mother, a wife, a friend, a grandmother. After going on months of adderall binges and abuse, she had an experience frighten her where she was *possibly* caught by a co-worker selling adderall to another co-worker. This is a big no-no, especially as she is a healthcare worker. This experience, started a downhill spiral of psychosis. She left my father, who has been beside himself with having no idea what to do. He’s a wreck right now and has been for months. She believes that cops all over my state are stalking her and monitoring her every move. She believes that she is living her version of The Truman Show and that everyone wears contact lenses with cameras in them. She believes that she has a whole bunch of fans that communicate to her through YouTube video suggestions, and sits in her car for hours doing a weird dance and singing (quite horribly I might add) at the top of her lungs, in which she calls ‘performing for her fans.’ 

She believes we are all out to get her. That we are enemies. She hides knives all over the house. She comes home with bruises on her arms from ‘swinging on swings’.’ I could seriously go on. My dad and I are at the point where we are fearing for her life and ours, as she is so unpredictable at this point. As of right now, she is in a hospital with a 72 hour hold, which I am praying to god will lead her to being institutionalized so she can get the help she needs. We are seriously afraid for our lives and hers. We have no idea where to go from here. I have no idea how to process any of this. To process the mother who I’ve pretty much deemed as gone since her mental health hit bottom at the end of October. To process the grandmother that literally abandoned her grand daughter to play this game in her head. To process my father being the weakest and most broken and beaten down I have ever seen him. I know this is something she may not have chosen for herself, and mental illness is a bitch, but this is all so outrageous I don’t know how to feel. 

Tl;dr my mom has been placed on a crisis hold and I’m hoping she gets institutionalized to help dig her out of a 7 month long bit of psychosis. I don’t know how to feel about the absolutely insane behavior she’s displayed over this time."
1368,I've Been Seeing Things That Are Not There and Feel Like Someone Could Be Watching Me,"I've never posted to reddit and I have no idea if this will help at all, or really how I should say this, but I need some input or advice, any and all is appreciated. I was originally going to post this in a subreddit for asking doctors questions, but I didn't think it would fit because this is not a traditional medical question.
I've recently realized that something I've been doing for years that I thought was normal is not so normal. I've always been worried about the possibility of someone watching me, and I always keep cameras facing away from me and look up into air vents to see if there is a camera hidden in them. I never definitively know if there is a camera in a vent, there never is, obviously, but I always have a feeling there might be, and I instinctively look, usually in the vents in my house. I am 19 years old and I've done this for years, I do not know exactly how to put it into words, but my reasoning was something like ""oh I'm just self conscious and don't like the idea of people seeing me naked in the bathroom"" and ""I do not want people looking at me if I accidentally forgot to end a video call or they hacked into my device and are watching me"" and stuff along those lines. I do have a general dislike of being watched on things like store security camera's, but I get over it. I've never thought much of it until recently, but now that I think about it, it's making me feel very uneasy that I even think someone is watching me. I know I shouldn't, and I have no reason to believe someone is watching me, and the idea of a camera in my air vents is crazy, but I have the feeling and thought of it anyway. 
The thing that really got me to realize that this shouldn't be benign is the fact that I have been seeing things that are not there for the past two years, and it's been getting more frequent recently. It's always very small things, like bugs flying around me or near me in my peripheral vision, or reflections. In my room, my TV is facing my bed and door, and when it is off, I frequently see someone dart past my door through the hallway in the corner of my eye, but I know that nobody is there because either I didn't hear any footsteps, or nobody else is upstairs to begin with. I always attributed this to bad sleeping habits (I tend to have horrible nightmares that make me not want to sleep when I fall into pits of depression or extreme stress), but it's been continuing even when I'm feeling fine, though I am still stressed out a lot of the time. And yesterday I was keeping my windows open to let the breeze flow through the house, and in the corner of my eye, through my window, I kept seeing my neighbors curtain close, as if they were looking at me through their window, but I know for a fact that they were never open in the first place.  I thought I saw this happen three times yesterday. I also swear I saw a bug flying next to my face, in my peripheral vision, but when I looked it wasn't there. 
I do not know how I never thought any of this was weird or abnormal until now. 
I do have a history of poor mental health, including depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts and two suicide attempts. If it is relevant, I was exposed to multiple illicit substances when I was in my biological mother's womb, and my biological mother, if I recall correctly, has schizophrenia, or has put herself into periods of drug induced psychosis. I try not to ask too many questions because I do not like to talk to her or about her, so I do not know the full extent of her mental illnesses, but I do know that she has thought people were hiding camera's in her walls, she was hearing voices, and she once barged into my house after claiming she was invited here by us because her dead ex husband and his friend stole her car, phone, and keys, and was trying to hurt her. Her car was found in the parking lot of a diner and was full of drug paraphernalia, her phone was found in a park, and she was high on multiple drugs, including meth and cocaine. My point is, her mental illnesses may be caused by drugs, so it may have no relation, but I do not know how drugs work, as the only drugs I have ever taken was ADHD medication, which I have not taken in 7 or 8 years, and antidepressants that I took for a short time. 
I have no history of drug abuse, and I do not know if mental illness can be caused by drugs in utero, or passed down through genetics. I still want to attribute it to simple stress, sleep problems, and general paranoia involving my self conscious nature, but I think I should still talk to my doctor about it. 
I live with my adoptive mother still, and I do not know how I should approach her about the topic, because she is one of the causes of my depression and stress, and in the past she has told me I do not have depression and that I have nothing to be sad about, despite being diagnosed by a psychiatrist and a doctor, and being prescribed antidepressants. (I didn't take them very often, because I felt they didn't help and I didn't want to pump myself full of a drug that doesn't help). I do not know how to approach her on the topic, or if I should do so *before* talking to my doctor about my concerns because I am worried she will react negatively. Again, I really think this is probably just a mixture of stress, poor sleep habits (poor sleep habits don't happen very often, though), and general self consciousness and insecurities and a fear of being watched, and I understand that thinking there could be a camera in an air vent is absurd, to say the least, but the idea and feeling floats in my mind regardless.
Any input or advice is appreciated. 

I keep wanting to just close out of this tab, not hit submit, and just pretend that all this never happened, just shove it all down and pretend that everything is normal, like I always do with my problems. But that is probably not the best idea, because if it is stress, I need to develop better coping mechanisms, and if it's something more serious, I need to consult *someone*, at least. I probably shouldn't be nervous to post this, but I've been looking at the submit button for a while now, so I am going to hit submit."
1369,How Should I Approach My Mom That I Want/Need Help When She Doesn’t ‘Believe’ Me?,"TW: mentions of self harm &amp; suicide

hi all, as the title states, i want and need help badly. however, my parents (specifically my mom) do not ‘believe’ in mental illnesses and they feel like those who seek help are weak. they also do not believe i have any reason to have a mental illness or even need help. for context, i am a 16 year old female with fairly decent grades and a decent home life (these are important to them so imagine i should include that) so in their eyes i am okay, and i have absolutely no reason to need help. but if i was to be able to get help, i could not receive it without their aid. i know that there is something wrong with myself but i am not going to claim i have something without the proper diagnosis. 

i have struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm for what feels like forever but i believe it started when i was around 9-10. as i have gotten older, those thoughts/feelings have snowballed and became something that hinders my day to day life. there is not a day that goes by where i am not having the urge to self harm (i am currently 2 ish weeks clean though). i know this probably sounds like everyone else but i am struggling, and i need help. all of my friends who i have reached out to about my issues all think i should seek help, and they have every right to think that. i never thought i was going to make it to my 16th birthday and sometimes i feel as if i will definitely not make it to my 18th birthday if i do not receive the help i need. i want to get better not only for myself first and foremost but for all of my friends and my boyfriend. i know they all care about me and want to see me get better. i have pushed them away when things would get bad but i assume they knew i never did it with malicious intent, i was simply doing it to protect them from my destructive behaviors. 

with everything that is going on in the world currently and school being over for the year, being isolated with them and my own thoughts is becoming extremely destructive. i know i am spiraling out of my own control. i’m suffering more than ever, and i do not want to burden my friends with my issues. i know that getting help in the current state of the healthcare system would be difficult as my mother recently had emergency surgery and it was difficult for her even though what she needed was necessary. i just want to be able to receive help as soon as i possibly can. 

an event that really sent me over the deep end happened recently. i had not eaten for a little over 4ish days nor had i left my room. my mom called me out for dinner and i told her i wasn’t hungry (as i wasn’t and i didn’t want to waste food) and that set her off. she came back a little later and forced me out of my room, making me stand at the dinner table while she told me things. ‘you haven’t eaten, you’re not getting out of bed, you haven’t left your room, you don’t want to do anything anymore. what’s your god damn problem? it’s not my fucking fault you can’t see your friends right now, so don’t blame me!’ i didn’t know how to react so i just broke down in front of her and started crying. i wanted to tell her i don’t feel like me anymore and that things are getting harder and harder every single day but i didn’t.

the only thing i want is help. i don’t want pity or anything of the sorts, just help. yet i have no idea how i should even begin to approach her about this. my apologies if this doesn’t make sense or seems very ‘rambly’, i tried to make it informative but also to the point. thank you for taking time to read this and all advice will be greatly appreciated and taken into consideration."
1370,Social anxiety,"I struggle with social anxiety, I always worry that people are mad at me, tired of me, or annoyed with me. Even with my own cousin I worry that she is tired of me. I just want to be able to stop worrying about other people and what they think of me. I’ve been called a freak and racial slur but that didn’t bother me at all. It’s the fear of someone thinking negatively of me and me not knowing about it. When someone doesn’t talk to me or text me back I get nervous and when I get a text I jump for no reason. I worry that eventually I’ll be left friendless and will have no one to trust. I hate thinking like this but I can’t help it. Please someone tell me what u should do"
1371,Will psychosis end naturally if the patient does not want treatment?,"I just...really need to know that this will end. I’ve written about it here before but basically, my ex partner had a psychosis episode after we broke up, and after that part of her delusions became about me, me planting cameras in her home, doxxing her, just me generally being part of the Bad Guys. She was really aggressive and cruel towards me when I left. I have to admit that that did hurt but I know it’s just the illness telling her these things and my feelings aren’t the priority here.

But today she sent me an...intimate video we took together when we were still dating. No warning. No context. I asked her why, and that I thought she had deleted them. She just said “lol” and after some pressing told me to stop doing what I was doing, that what I did was worse than what’s she’s doing to me now, to stop bothering her (I haven’t contacted her at all since she sent me some aggressive texts last week) and that she’s holding onto them “just in case”.

This whole thing gave me an awful panic attack and I’m just. So tired. I talked to her family about it and they offered to intervene but she’s also back with an abusive ex who’s taking advantage of her mental state, so I don’t want to cause conflict that will alienate her from her only remaining support system or push her further into that abuser’s arms. 

But also...I didn’t do anything to deserve this. I haven’t contacted her, and the delusions about me are still persisting and she’s honestly just acting cruelly at this point and it really hurts and distresses me. I know it’s not her fault, in her normal state of mind she would never do this. But in her current state of mind, she doesn’t believe anything is wrong and she doesn’t want treatment, and I’m the crazy one and am conspiring against her.

Will this end with time? Will she get better without treatment? It’s been almost 3 weeks now. I’m working with her family to try and help her but she’s an adult so they can’t force her to get help. I just want this to end so badly, I want it to end for her AND for me. The way she’s treating me is just...awful, and so unlike her. I’m losing hours at work, my throat and head hurt from crying and chain smoking, my stomach hurts all the time now, my anxiety is through the roof...It wasn’t my business even when I was just trying to help her family find treatment for her (language barriers) but now it’s directly affecting me and I just need to know it will end. Please, please tell me this will end eventually."
1372,"My therapeutic anti Cover Letter, why I suck","I (28M) wrote this letter a year ago when I was applying for jobs while very depressed, it started as an 'anti CL' where I could talk shit about myself and turned into a collection of things I was really wanting to say but didn't have anyone I felt would understand. I thought maybe it's a good read for someone now, in the 'Oh, I feel that too' kind of way. Things have moved on and improved though the depression and much of the pain continues. Much respect and love to everyone out there struggling.

TRIGGER WARNING ( Is that practice here? ) candid expression of suicidal musing

Xxx XXX - Spiritually castrated lost boy

Hey there. My name is Xxx XXX. I am a less younger but roughly similar version of myself at 22. Having just had a spiritual awakening abroad I came back home to share my new self and was somehow destroyed. I don’t think I have felt deeply happy or content since then. I am unsure if I have done anything to perpetuate my struggle or am in a genuinely difficult position that I haven’t received the help I need for. I am sure I could have been someone much better and more positive, more peaceful inside and healthy, at this age.

As you can see from my work history I have done a good job in recent years of avoiding a stable position and financial responsibility. This is because I feel deep dread and despair when I look into the future in general. All I see is my same disempowered, disheartened self a little more old and broken down, in a shitty world. To get around this pain I naturally avoid endeavours that mean anything to me except for those that offer a chance to runaway or have the miragic quality of maybe (unlikely) being a magic bullet to my emotional and mental problems.

I have notably low self-esteem, so much so that it is very rare for me to feel empowered in a relationship and even more rare for me to respect a partner I have. I pretend to, to myself and to them that I do respect them and value the connection, but really I extend the same harshness I apply to myself to those that feel intimate. Often I will make deep sacrifices in an attempt to be validated by someone else. This never works, and I never learn

Another effect of this low esteem and self-belief (particularly in my ability to take action and improve my situation, to live a meaningful, happy life) is that when I am part of a project or team I extend this outlook to that which I am party to and generally drag things down in subtle, invisible ways. I just cannot envision success for things that I am part of.

You should hire me because I need help to get out of my situation. I have a lot to offer under my stunted masculinity and weakness. I am kind some of the time. I have lots of potential if only someone would help me see it and guide me through my pain.

People in my life comment how strange it is that I am letting my youth, talent and general privilege dissolve when I have so much going for me. They cannot see what is holding me back.

When I am in deep stress I get by by reminding myself that I can always kill myself. I know where to find a gun and/or a car and as long as these are available I can get myself out if the suffering gets too intense or I become too ashamed/sad/lonely/decrepit. Sometimes this is how I can get to sleep at night when I am crying alone thinking about my situation.

The trickiest thing about this is thinking about how that would affect my family and friends, *what if I left my body with no face? Would that make it harder?* And also thinking about how much I would be giving up, maybe in my years of distress I have stumbled very close to the answer I needed, what if I held out just a bit longer. But I don’t want to hold out just to live a half life, like my uncle, and then kill myself anyway later. I would rather finish it early"
1373,I don’t know what’s wrong with me,"I feel like every time I start a friendship/relationship I eventually lose interest in the person ( to the point of finding them annoying ) and start being cold and reply less and less until they get tired and annoyed of it , and then I go back to talking to them again normally ( and genuinely want to maintain the relationship ) and it goes on and on until eventually they leave and I’m just left there feeling stupid and wondering why I didn’t put more effort if I was going to feel this shitty and guilty when they finally snap at me .
I also have really bad social anxiety and have had suicidal thoughts for a long time so it’s not even easy for me to make friends in the first place . Or maybe I just have a horrible personality , I don’t know ."
1374,My relationship has been affecting my mental health in a bad way and I need a break but I'm scared my SO will commit suicide if I leave.,"We fought yesterday and she said some things that really really hurt. She apologized later on and revealed how she hasn't been eating and sleeping well for the past few days and how she's thinking of just ending her life. I don't know what to do. We're currently in LDR because of the covid situation. On top of the things she said yesterday, I'm also hurt that she wasn't completely honest about what she was feeling even when I check up on her every day. She told me it was because she didn't want me to worry.  To be honest, I really think I need a break. I have my own personal issues as well and I don't think I can handle being her ""therapist"" anymore. However, I'm also scared of what she's gonna do to herself. I feel like I'm leaving her when she needs me the most and I don't think I can handle it if anything happens to her."

1376,My brother has bipolar disorder and I need help knowing best ways to communicate with him,"Hi there, I've never posted here before but hope this is ok. 
I am currently staying with my parents during the lockdown and my 25 year old brother with bipolar disorder lives here. It's a lot. He is pretty manic most of the time, and he is very loud and communicates in a way that's almost always argumentative. For example, he will bring something up and if I have anything to say that isn't 100% in agreement with what he says, it's a full blown argument and I'm the one making it that way. And you can't get a word in, either, even in casual conversation. He'll ask a question, and someone will go to respond and he immediately interrupts, and the cycle continues. Today my dad had to walk away because he couldn't get a word in, and my brother thought my dad overreacted and I casually said ""well you interrupted him every time he tried answering your question."" He stormed away and said I was always picking a fight.
I have on many accounts tried to calmly describe to him how I like to be communicated with, and he just isn't receptive and blows up and storms away. 

What I'm getting at is I don't know how to be around him. Do I just let him say these things and not ever really say what I think so I can avoid his intense reactions? That makes me really sad and like I will always have a surface level relationship. I also really worry about his ability to find success in the workplace if he just can't have a conversation. 

It also doesn't help that he self medicates, but right now that doesn't seem to be too destructive. 

TLDR; my brother is bipolar and I need help with how I should patiently respond to his behavior"

1378,"I'm not sure why I'm like this, help please","I'm exhausted, mind my poor grammar and general lack of direction. I no longer feel the same, and I need someone's help. I feel no hate, no pain, no love or happiness.

Lately, I'm felt as if I have two different thoughts and opinions on things.
I may be scared of something, but another part of me isnt and actively enjoys whatever it is..

I hate my father who abused me, but I also love him so much, I wish he would disappear but I wish he would also stay by my side... even with people who I dont like at all, everything I feel fades away.

Someone could make fun of me and humiliate me, and I may feel at first indescribable hate, with intent to hurt them... but then it fades and I feel nothing, I don't feel like retaliation is something that would solve my issues.

When I was younger, I used to bully my classmates and enjoyed hurting others for fun, seeing them hurt was enjoyable knowing that they were weaker, I felt superior knowing they were beneath me...

I switched schools multiple times because of my father's work, and I developed a shy personality, everything I felt before was gone... I used to like talking and causing trouble and problems, or hurting people... but then after moving so much, I felt so detached that all I did was read and be by myself for grade 8..

I would always hear ""why are you so quiet"" ""he's so weird he never talks to anyone"" and though, I did talk to peolple, but I never was outgoing, I played with 2-3 kids but I always felt as if it wasn't worth it... it didn't feel entertaining to do so, and I just wanted to pass the time and finish recess/lunch and continue on doing work...


During grade 9, it got worse, my opinion on myself shifted and I began to loath who I was, I hated my father for the choices he made and what he did to me growing up, but I also hated everyone else for having a life I could never have, I was jealous they grew up in a loving environment.

I started reading and studying alot more, my grades began raising very high and though I should have felt proud of myself, I only ever thought about revenge against my father and other people, I never talked to anyone because I was different than them.. small talk to me was useless, tell me what you want straight. I didn't like hanging around with people, because I felt as if I could see straight through them and it made me feel gross..

It changed during grade 10 when I met a few kids who practically forced me to hangout and be friends with them, they weren't the popular kids, but they knew everyone of them and they knew him as well. I felt so alone and weird, everyone else could talk so well and I didnt know what to say or talk about, you can pretty much tell I never had a girlfriend  because of this, and I REALLY wanted someone then...

Overtime, I felt more and more open and started talking, I smiled more and became friends with mutual friends, of course I was still weird, just not as bad as before. I still felt the hate towards my dad, every single minute even if I was laughing with friends it was always there..

Sometime during the end of semester 2, some personal family issues happened, which led me to cut everyone off, I was left alone by choice, I turned off my phone and enjoyed my summer break by myself... I sat in my dark room with only my thoughts and regrets of what I did, I made myself believe I was worthless and that(we will call him jim) Jim wasnt my friend, that he felt pity towards me, maybe he did at that time, but he could have hung out with ANYONE yet he chose me time and time again.. I would cancel or just not show up, and he'd get mad at me, but then I'd apologize after sometime and we'd chill again, he was popular knew everyone, had alot of girls that liked him yet he didnt care at all..

He confused me so much but I was glad he was my friend, I had other friends but he stuck by me, no matter what, I was bullied by this one kid, but theh both knew eachother and Jim would always step in and ignore him whenever he was with me, and force the other guy to leave since there wasn't much of a conversation.. I appreciated that so much, I wasnt much for confrontations to be fair, I was afraid of having someone angry at me, but I didnt like someone insulting me either..

During the end of the summer, I snapped... my mental health dropped, I felt psycho, I wanted to actively hurt people, my head was filled with murder and wanting to inflict pain, I enjoyed sadistic thoughts that whenever they came up I'd laugh from joy and ecstasy...
Overtime, from crying so much, I started laughing whenever I felt pain, I laughed and overtime it went away, but instead of feeling pain I felt pure anger. I wanted to hurt people who were innocent, who did absolutely nothing to me, just because I was hurt myself I wanted to ruin other people and my father as well...

I became obsessed with myself, my confidence rose to the top, I changed my style haircut, personality I wore a mask at all times. I felt as if this was the only way I could do it, the sensitive version of myself only got hurt and used, I never felt good, so I pretended.. 
And it worked.... I made people who didnt even know me laugh, and I laughed with them whenever.. I didn't truly laugh, we both had different humor, I laughed to fit in, I would always pay extra attention to what people liked doing, hobbies, things they talk about..

I acted different towards different people to get close, I felt like I needed to do that to earn their trust and protection.. I surrounded myself with people who laughed at me in grade 9, and at that time I felt very egotistical and felt happy, knowing that no one else knew I was faking all of it..

I felt nothing then, before I was hurt so much, I blamed my issues on past problems, cried felt so much anger and blame on my father...yet now, I felt as if nothing bothered me, insults that rarely happened didnt affect me, I wasnt shy, I said what I wanted whenever, I wasn't afraid of my dad and in fact, I wanted to see me how I was, just to see his reaction....

But he wasn't the same either.. he was an addict, but he was trying to better himself now, he apologized to me for everything that happened in the last, and he knows that he screwed up but he wants me to know that he will ALWAYS ""love"" me no matter what I do or where I go. I wasnt expecting that, I wanted him to leave for days on end, or to verbally tear me apart or backhand me, I wanted it... but it didn't happen, I felt angry, so fucking much, I thought to myself that why did it happen now, now that I didnt care about anyone but myself, that he decides to change himself.. why didnt he do it when I was younger, when I NEEDED someone to show me the proper way, to tell me I was needed, to say I was loved and didnt have to act out for attention.

Of course I forgave him, he would often give me money, and in order to get more, I would need to be friends/good terms with him, so I smiled and cried and admitted that I was so proud of him and hugged him, we sat there for about a minute thinking back now.
After we laughed and joked about being overly sensitive, he said he had to go to meet his girlfriend, but that he'd be home for dinner, and I said sure.. I went to my room and laughed to myself, kept laughing, I didnt know if I was hurt or if I thought I was so cunning and smart, I really didnt know what I felt and it scared me for the first time.

I read about psychology a bit, and sociopaths and psychopaths, I didnt think I was one, and I didnt want to be one to be honest. I still felt emotions, but I could numb them and use them whenever I needed to. Tears and sadness are good if you hurt someone and you need an excuse to say it hurt you too, so I would cry and act weak whenever something I didnt want happened...

I started hanging out daily with new people and even girls started messaging me, and I'd be able to talk to whoever I wanted to now, I'd face time girls all the time at night and grow closer to them. They loved having my attention, and I loved having their trust. My sex drive was gone though, I had a high one in grade 9 and 10, but now I didnt care at all.. I could still maintain an erection and commit to it, but I didnt have any lust towards them, I felt nothing, but I knew they could be used sometime in the future for a favour so I kept talking to them.

I lost my virginity to a girl that was innocent and sweet, she was everything I was, and someone I wanted to be when I was a kid. I didnt exactly feel bad about lying to her constantly, but I didn't feel good either. I didnt know whether or not good or bad even existed, to me those terms were just made up to justify actions other people made.

I would end up dating that girl and cheating on her skth several other girls, at the start I believed I didnt care for attention but.. I needed it so much to survive, if I didnt have it my head would fill with psychotic thoughts and anger, so I had to dull that out with girls who spoke to me, distracted me from everything, I couldn't be angry and maintain a front at the same time so I knew that was my only choice. I couldnt used a doctor because I knew he may prescribe serious meds, and put a warning on me as a potential danger to myself and others so I didnt tell anyone. I trusted no one, not even my good friend Jim who stuck by me since day 1, I couldnt ever fathom trusting an unknown person.

(Its 6 am as I'm writing this, so sorry for bits preceding pieces being apart and poor grammar, it's hard remembering how I was)

I always had drama stuck to my name from something I did, but it never mattered because I had so many friends that would back me up, they trusted me, and those girls did too.
The first girl I dated (we'll call her sam) found out I cheated on her, and told her friend that I did, and she put out some rumours that I forced myself on her, and I took advantage of her sweet personality for my own gain. And while I didn't really care much for her, I didnt care at all for anything, I gained nothing, I did it as an experiment, I wanted to feel if I could enjoy sex and that connection I so desired in grade 9. There wasnt anything, she obviously liked it, but to me it was boring, I was thinking about homework the entire time and how I forgot to hand in that extra credit work.

The lies caused some doubt about me, so I had to shame Sam to cover my reputation, even though I did nothing wrong, it was still extremely bad to have that said about you, since it does happen to unfortunate people. I had to work so hard to cover myself, that I ended up taking it too far and bullying Sam without caring, I started enjoying it again, I felt angry that she would even dare think she could take everything I worked so hard to achieve and maintain. Her friend was also shamed as well by my group of friends, and the girls who liked me, everyone knew they lied. I always screenshot conversations so I have proof, I dont trust anyone so I thought that this could happen, low chance but never zero.

Sam wasnt a bad girl, she truly wasn't, even though she lied about that, she was hurt that I was sleeping with other girls and that she thought she meant nothing to me. She meant alot to me, I never loved her though, I felt nothing, but I still liked how she trusted me and would always entertain me. I thought of it as a pet, feed her a bone every once In awhile.... thinking back I was terrible, I'd guilt her and twist her words to make her doubt herself, break her confidence and made her rely on me. I knew if she ever became more open, she might leave me for someone better, and she wasnt ugly, so I was afraid, I was intensely angry, I was very possessive over people and things I spent time working towards. I could never EVER fathom another guy with her, even if I felt nothing I couldnt let a guy feel a connection with her. I didnt do anything psychotic like kidnap, I did ruin her highschool year and her friends while I enjoyed mine.

I ignored drugs and alcohol, I believed that they would make me slip up, or say something I didnt mean, or even lose my control over my anger. I couldnt do that, I would be offered quite a fair share of drugs are parties, and though I did want to experiment, I wasnt a slave to any addiction and I wasn't able to feel any happiness anyways so drugs shouldn't have had any worthwhile effects on me.

I didnt understand why I was like that, but then I honestly didnt care, my life was perfect, my thoughts were so precise, I always thought a few steps ahead, I had many friends and girls who would do anything for me. My family was doing great, I lived with my grandparents who were Christian, and they noticed I was very different compared to before, and I told them that I opened up, and it was thanks to them, but moreso towards god that me praying allowed him to help me help myself... I didnt mean any of that truthfully, I dont believe in any god except my self at that time, but I couldnt have my family worry over my and take up my time.

I had everything now, a life I thought two years ago I could never have, plenty of girls who weren't the BEST but were still good enough to have alot of guys admire. People who are hard to get were often good entertainment to play with, but at that point I was bored with life... I didnt feel anything, whenever I felt anger it would fade away sometime after... I would try to make myself sadistically before and laugh but I just couldnt do it.

I dated another girl and broke her heart to see if I'd feel anything and nothing happened, I blackmailed her to go back with me, and eventually gained her trust back by telling her I truly didnt do anything. I didnt feel like repeating what happened like last time, and I believe that she shouldnt have even cried over me, she was good looking, smart, popular why would she cry over me?
Nothing made sense to me, I was very good at studying other people, but I couldnt study myself, I wasnt like them, when they cried I couldnt understand why, or if they felt anger I was confused. I tried remembering back to my childhood with my dad, but I couldnt feel any anger or sadness, just acceptance that what happened happened, I forgot to mention but at this time my father relapsed and got into drug use again.

Skipping ahead, I didnt change much, I dropped a few people and gained a bit more girls to talk to. It was late at night, but we had quarentine so I had nothing to do, I had an xbox where I'd play games with friends to grow closer, but I didn't think it was fun, sitting and doing nothing on a virtual game, wasnt appealing to me. I was more into living the moment, doing things in real life and hanging out with actual people, I enjoyed hearing people talk about their life, things that happened. I especially enjoyed hearing people talk about how much rage they felt toward something they were hurt by when they were younger, I liked knowing they felt anger enough to feel the urges I felt.

They were so enjoyable, I became obsessed with helping them solve their problems, and grew more egotistical the more I helped, and the more I helped the more I learned about how people cope and handle themselves. I didnt help them because I wanted them to be good, It was a game to me and i wanted to see if I was good enough to help others fix their problems, but I couldnt fix mine. Ironic isnt it.

My father came home, he was high and was with a female friend whom I didnt like, I never liked druggies, I couldnt understand how they had to use drugs to feel happiness or enjoyed it. I told my dad that grandma was inside looking for him, so he fixed himself and went away so I was left with his friend Christina, she was definitely an addict, but she didnt appear like she was one for long. She looked like early 20,s and someone who started using drugs, I was disgusted by her but also fascinated, I wanted get closer to her and manipulate her to do whatever I wanted. But, I couldnt, my head flared up, it felt as if I was disgusted by her, she was revolting, but my sex drive amped up, something about someone who was disgusting and looked down upon by me turned me on. I ended up taking control of myself and told her to fuck off, and that if she ever showed her face around her she wouldn't be alive anymore, of course I didnt say those exact words, but I wanted her gone. I believed that guys wasted too much time on women, that they should just focus on something else, they weren't special and neither was sex. I gave her a 20 dollar bill and another 50 that I had gotten from a friend for doing a favor awhile back, I wanted her to feel like she was worth something.
She could use that money for drugs and forget a out my dad, and I knew the only reason she was with him was because he had dope, I was thoroughly disappointed in my father, he was a good looking and well mannered person to everyone, he may have been abusive to me, but I no longer cared, I didnt agree with his appearance. He couldnt be tied to me, so if anyone asked, I was never his child and if I was from him, I'd be better off dead, or so I thought.
I believe deep down, I appreciated how he came home, I may not agree with him, or like the things he does, but he's still my father he's my blood, so I cant abandon him  just as how he didnt kick me out. We talked a bit in my grandparents shed, and I asked what drugs felt like, and he pulled out a few large bags and asked if I wanted to find out myself.
I told him that I didnt care, but would prefer if he told me, since I was planning on visiting a girl tomorrow.
He told me how he had heroin, meth, a few bags of coke, 1 shroom for whatever reason, and 3 Molly's he was saving.

I told him that I didnt understand what he told me about the feelings and I asked him how to use it, so he showed me first hand. I didnt stop him, I didnt have the right to, he is his own person with his own ideals and consequences just as I do.

He started on the heroin and overtime slowly dosed off which I thought was annoying and disappointing, so I took it upon myself to try it.

I wasnt going to do the heroin since I didnt want to lose my alertness and become like that, so I decided I'd try meth, I remembered that coke was pretty expensive so I left that to him as a sign of pity or low respect.

I didnt feel anything taking a line, so I took another, and another, until the third kicked in, it was a strange feeling, I never felt that feeling before but it wasnt strong enough so I took another two. Then it hit me, a flash of euphoria something that surprised me, it wasn't overwhelming but it was still something, it made me laugh of excitement, my father may have been passed out in front of me but I felt it, I felt something that I never felt for so long. I took a few large Crystal's with me to try again, he didnt notice since the bags were quite large and I also took his bags of dope inside, he was very drowsy but I wasnt worried, he had overdosed 9 times in my life, so he was fine I believed and left him in the garage as I went inside.

I went inside and admired this feeling, it was short lasted but I grew tired of it, I wanted to feel something stronger, it wasnt strong enough for me to do it again so I took a bit more and decided I was done since I was going to a girls house. I couldn't fall asleep, I tried but I was awake, my heartrate was extremely fast, so I forced myself to drink water and to sit still and relax.

I put on some binaural beats and sat down and stared at my ceiling, I was disappointed, immensely it wasn't good enough.
Everyone always said it felt good to do it, and it was addicting that I'd be hooked but I didnt think so.

Fast forward, I couldn't sleep the entire night nor the next 6 days, I could feel my skin excrete a toxin that I had to continously wash off, I had no appetite but I forced myself to eat, and to drink 3 liters of water daily.
It wasnt too bad, nothing bothered me too much, the thing that made me somewhat annoyed was that my genital was very small and shrunken, I was expecting to do it with my friend today, but I had to give up and say I wasn't in the mood. I couldnt sleep at all, It would be a cool study drug if I had trouble with school, but I had everything perfect.

The withdrawl effects were something else, originally they shocked me, but overtime I realized that I enjoyed it, it was a sense of relief knowing it was my body harming itself and I didnt have any chance of dying from it. The one thing that I didnt particularly enjoy was the crank bugs, or meth mites that occasionally occured to me. It felt like fire ants crawling over my body and biting me, my body wanted to scratch and dig under my body, but I knew better not to, I laughed to combat it.

I used my thoughts as a way to make myself enjoy the feeling, I felt pure anger again, to combat it, I took a high dose so the feeling was strong, and it lasted pretty long as well.

I never got into any fights or gotten hurt before except from my father, but this was a weird feeling. I couldnt do anything about it, so I sat there and waited until it went away, then I showered.

I still seldomly feel the effects from withdrawl, but it isnt anything crazy that makes me feel threatened or worried. I had no desire to take more, the only thing I wanted was to feel normal, I felt as if I was forever going to be this way.

After taking Meth, I didnt respond to my friends or any girls for awhile, and when I did I didnt care enough to put any effort, I felt hopeless.
I could've tried another drug, but I took quite alot of meth thinking it would help me feel different but it didnt, before I finally quit it as I'm writing now, I took more of it and more..

Whenever I was angry, I would take it to see if I would feel continously angry, but again... I fucked up and it didnt work, but this time I could sleep and still operate, I had no appetite but it's not like I eat based on that.



If you read this far, I'm truly lost, I have no guidance, I feel nothing anymore. Drugs arent working for me, i researched meth and DESPERATELY obsessed with trying to get addicted, but I ran out of it and didnt feel like associating my name with the crackheads I knew,and my dad was off somewhere so I just chilled again.

I honestly am speechless, I'm tired as I'm writing this, and my fingers are worn as well. If anyone has any thoughts on what happened to me, and why I don't have any desire for sex, or love, even to my family. I have no fear or regrets nothing, I live life how it is now, I dont think of myself any different, nor does anyone know I did meth.

People say addiction isnt a choice, but I believe it is.. If it was then I would definitely make myself addicted, I want something to desire in life, even if it meant taking drugs with lowlifes, I would enjoy it more than I am now.

I dont have a job during this isolation, I complete my school work quickly, and then I'm lost again. I had experienced everything I wanted to, I tried everything I thought was cool as a child. I never was able to hurt or take my anger out on my father or anyone else for that matter, but today as of wednesday May 6th, I have no hate for anyone in this world at all.

Taking meth has made me realize that those who get addicted like my father, are weak willed. They cave for that feeling of synthetic happiness. I dont understand it, but I'll try more drugs, hopefully there is an addicting one, I'll do everything except needles. My body is mine, but I still need to appear healthy for friends, last thing I want is people thinking I'm depressed or an addict, If only they knew.



Anyways reddit, if you read through my sleep deprived post, please help me, anything. I need help desperately and I'll do anything. I cant live my days feeling like a rock, even faking my mask is getting hard for me to do.
It was my pride that I could do it, but if that's going away, and I'm left with nothing, I'll be worthless more so than I am. If I could suggest anything to people who haven't tried drugs, dont try it, you wonder what it's like, but the only thing you need to know, is that you WILL give in. You are weak, just like me, I cant survive without attention and control over others, and addicts get addicted, I'm addicted to lying and everything about me is fake. Though, my father is a person you dont want to be like, dont create another me, he was the reason I grew up the way I did. Stick to weed and I suppose LSD, if you want to know what it feels like firsthand go ahead, but just know that you're only seen as a source of income, I would wish if I was I dealer that you would start, I don't care about others, I could easily tempt as many people as I want into it, and make quite a sale. Though, that's easy, what's not easy is getting people to believe in themselves, so much doubt and depression in people, especially girls, beautiful smart talented individuals you'd never think would struggle, but they do and it's a damn shame I think, I used to obsess over these girls and wish I was as confident/happy as them, and the one thing that you are all at risk for, is doubt. Have pure confidence in everything you do, thoughts and opinions of others do not matter, you are the god of your story, whether you believe you're a worthless side character and treat yourself like that, is up to you. I am the god of mine, my effort and hardwork pays off, never give up and never hurt yourself, having to sit on facetime with a girl who has issues, to prevent herself from slicing her wrists and thighs is tiring, If you want to end it do it, dont best around the bush and drag others down, keep everything to yourself and fight your own demons as I did, only then will you realize that the true demons, are in fact, ourselves.





People with depression who do drugs to cope, why? Your family is hurting so much over it, my father was a great guy before he did that, and then he took everything out on me. Yet I still loved him, because that's family, you all hurt everyone close to you, push everyone away and believe you're alone.
I used to want to kill and erase all drug users, I was obsessive over that, like I said it was the only thing I could think of, and I enjoyed it alot.
Logically thinking, I would probably still think that if I could, now that I know my father could've fought against that drug with willpower if he cared, if he ever considered his love for his parents or me more, he would've.

He was weak, just like all addicts are, I will never sympathize with you, and you will never sympathize with me, we are different. You were the reason I suffered growing up, that I was hurt all those years ago. My pain, was the cause of ignorant people such as yourselves, to think I tried the same drugs as crackheads and to say I tried it, is downright disgusting. We are not the same, everything I do is calculated, even on drugs, you all have no excuse but lack of willpower, self respect, and love. I will try every drug that is addicting so that I can fully understand, and confirm my opinion and beliefs that addiction is a choice, and those who fall prey to addiction are terribly weak souls who are meant to be used by others. In this case, addicts run the underground world, they are the buyers and in result, cause so much drug trade wealth.

I have to pretend to like you, despite how much all of you disgust me, and loathe, my father is an addict and some friends are addicted, they still have family and friend who care about them, but to me you are worthless, those who steal and hurt their family dont deserve the right to life.
Those who deal drugs shouldnt be to blame either, they supply the drug and tempt others, those who give in to their selfish desires deserve it. If I could, I would take it upon myself to remove you, be grateful that I'm too disinterested and smart to waste my life and talents on scum like you. You'll all die in the next 10-30 years, and if not, you'll probably have kids and those kids will repeat what you did, seen it firsthand. The only sympathy I have for anything in this world, is children.
They are innocent, you can mold them however you like, they are defenseless, some abuse them and some raise them to be good people. Whatever you decide, always remember that they are just like you, but they're sensitive, they may always love you, but hate you, I never let go despite my conflicting ideals and what I say. I'm truly confused that I confuse my thoughts and I no longer have clear thoughts on anything anymore, I know I hate my father but yet... another feeling is, that I love him and forgive him, even though I dont.
Mental health is important, never neglect children, those who feel nothing are risky, they may do things that are risky in order to feel the rush, or they may have delusions on the lives of others, I know I have a unhealthy delusion that addicts should be all shot, but I know that it's my upbringing that creates hate.
The cycle will never stop, and I don't think I'll ever change, I learned how to handle the pain I went through, and now I deal with the consequence of feeling nothing, at the expense of being protected from every feeling, even the warm embrace of love.

I do feel some slivers of guilt, so I know my humanity is still there, I'm not erased just yet, my grandmother is one of the most important people to me, without her, I have no idea what I would have done, same with my grandfather and sister. Though my grandfather was also abusive towards me, he was strict, I deserved everything that was given to me because he truly wanted my to learn and be better. It's no ones fault, children are abused and neglected, sexual assault is rampant, I feel sad for those who dont adapt, who are forever broken and scarred. If only you had the strength to fight back, but you were powerless just as I was. I wish someone would save me, my sister was lucky, she was able to get out and move in 2 years before I did with our grandma. I'm glad, I was the one that it happened to, my sister may not respect me for my choices of like me, but I care for her in my way, she will turn into a great doctor, she studied for a nurse and finished that and wanted more, so shes going to med school, would've been had this quarentine never happened.

My life wasnt a mistake, what happened in my childhood was unfortunate yes, did it break me, yeah it did, it destroyed my early years and left unfixable damage in my head, but, it made me stronger. I dont have desires, but I know... I know I will find something, there will be something and I believe in myself that as long as I dont give in, that I continue living this life even if I despise it, that even if I dont like this life. That there are still people who rely on me, who need me, who want me alive to help them, to be there, people trust and admire me, they love my confidence that I put on, the mask helps others to believe in themselves. They will never know that I dont care at all, that they're just entertainment for my cruel life, they weren't there for me in grade 9 when I was alone, yet now they are?
It's fun to think about that there are people just like me out there in the world, that I'm not alone yet I am.

I know good and bad, I don't care at all, I have no filter, if it benefits me I'll do it, anything in order to get my goals just like my sister does, humans have no excuse for being poor or welfare. Determination, and WILLPOWER, feel pain and adapt, subject yourself to psychological torture, take a drug just for withdrawl effects and get used to it, suffer and enjoy it, you'll accept the pain and become a better person, fighting it is useless you only tire yourself out and you give in.

Mental torture is a fascination I've discovered, I've never studied psychology or anything, I'm still in highschool grade 11, surprisingly I know quite alot of maggots who are in their 30s, to think that if I had this drugs, they'd do anything for a quick fix. Amusing to think truly how pathetic they are, they've never suffered growing up so they never learned how to deal with pain, looking at how kids deal with it now, they slice themselves up, indulge in alcohol distraction themselves from reality, and they like it... they like living in delusions and a fake world being happy, while I learned to accept and realize that I'm the product of my father. And I hope my children turn out just as I did, I'd have to emotionally break them and destroy everything, then make them trust me and then do it again, you see. Children and even grown people, when they truly love someone, they'll accept whatever happens to them no matter if they're abused by the one they love, they remember better times and hope they change.
Those who are teenagers or even adults who are victim to that cannot change, they may be able to adapt but they'll never truly be immune to it, I remember overhearing a classmate explain how childhood trauma affects people, and most often serial killers are abused and they grow up with thoughts just like I had. I'm not sure how I didnt murder anyone, maybe because it's no more fun when they die, everyone gets scared and you need to act the part, no more parties. Though as long as they leave the people who constantly show me entertainment and the girls I prefer are safe, it doesnt care to me what happens to less fortunate people, I would always protect everyone who admires and looks up to me, because without them I'm nothing.

I wanted to end this message earlier, and yet here I am, distracted. I cannot talk to anyone my age in a serious manner, each and everyone of them are childish, they see things through a single lens.

""Everyone who does drugs are addicted"" ""If you steal you'll do anything"" ""I'm leaving if my boyfriend ever does drugs""
These sentences are blatantly wrong.
Everyone who does drugs are not addicted, not everyone in this world is born with a weak will. Some are very strong, they don't cave to small cravings, they continue doing their beliefs and they hold true to their word.

If you steal, you arent a bad person, everyone has something they desire so bad that they steal for, I know I wanted a girl so bad I made her cheat on her boyfriend, and I was there to see her lie to him on text ""oh I'm just heading to bed, I'll talk to you later in the morning love you"" see, I didnt do anything bad. She chose to sleep with me, and I accepted, in a sense I stole that poor guys girlfriend, and he didnt even know, he still doesnt because we agreed to not tell him, we also agreed that whenever we felt like it, we could do it again. Think of yourself first, than others. If you always think of yourself then you'll always be in pain, protect your right.

I'm done, I have to sleep. Help me please, and I'll pay you back by doing whatever you want."
1379,I (18f) don’t think I have a moral compass.,"I do things solely because I see other people doing them. I follow rules and belief systems (outwardly) because that’s what I’m taught to do. There is no other reason for me to do it than obviously being ostracized by my peers, and alienated for being different. Which by the way, I believe that is the most ridiculous thing ever. I’ve only recently realized this and have begun to self reflect on it out of curiosity. Before I learned this, I would just do things impulsively or say things that made people uncomfortable. I still do at times since my beliefs are seemingly outlandish to others but to me, they make perfect sense so I end up unintentionally making others uncomfortable. I don’t think I’m a sociopath by any means, even though that term is so dramatized and socially constructed that it diagnostically means absolutely nothing at this point. I know I have antisocial traits, but I also heavily deal with social anxiety/being around people in general which led to me being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in my early teen years. I don’t feel bad about anything that I do because I feel that everyone is instinctually self-interested, but too unaware of themselves to admit it. I’m even having a hard time finding the motivation to pretend to be like everyone else, as there is literally no point to anything really other than temporary fulfillment. It gets redundant after awhile. Is this normal? To an extent at least? I promise this isn’t me just trying to be edgy. I just would like to know if this thought process is abnormal or not. I used to cry fairly often over things that triggered a nerve from my childhood (trauma related) like to the point where I was having panic attacks and could hardly breathe, but now I’m just glazed over and even smirk at things that once would have deeply upset me. Hyper fixating on violence is also something that I’ve begun to do within the past year or so. It’s oddly cathartic. Could this be some kind of internalized coping mechanism caused by trauma?"
1380,I just want someone to genuinely listen and give me advise besides tell me I’ll be okay,"Thankfully my therapy starts tomorrow but man I’m so burnt out from this shit. Idk why it’s happening my life isn’t so bad all things considered. Maybe it’s because so much is happening at once but still Jesus why do I get panic attacks so much. it’s all about my own physical health too. Dumbest shit ever, I hate it so much. I’m so angry because of this shit it’s been going on for a year or two and I’ve been shoving it to the side trying to work it out myself but I’m so broken now it’s so hard it breaks my heart."
1381,My 2 year anniversary of leaving homelessness just went and my 2 year anniversary for moving to the city is coming up next month. I'm super excited I might even make a cake to celebrate.,"It might not seem super mental health related but all these things are not only milestones in my life but also my mental health. You need to recover enough to believe in your self to some degree when escaping homelessness. It can be a vicious cycle I was lucky that I was only in that place a few months.

Then there's moving to the city, I needed to control my panic attacks and be able to get on a bus without valium. In December 2017 I took my maximum medication dose and still couldn't get on a train. Now I take trains everywhere, I love taking the train. So many things I thought I hated or couldn't do because of my anxiety. I now love these activities because I don't hate myself anymore. Do I love myself? I'm working on it but I don't hate myself, I don't try to hurt myself and I make mistakes without beating myself up. All in all I'm getting close to where I wanted to be 2 years ago. I guess I'm just feeling nostalgic."
1382,Depression SUCKS - do you ever miss it?,"Do you ever want to go back to being depressed. (Hereditary Depression + OCD)

a few weeks ago or whenever it was I went through a  mental breakdown, can i even say that?  I was ready, crying my eyes out repeating the words I want to die. Feeling like I was drowning in pain, my emotional pain turned into a physical one where i got a migraine. I keep having these explosive moments too often, it builds up and then i breakdown and tell myself i can't do it anymore. well this past week or so, I didn't feel actively suicidal in fact i didn't have any urges to kill myself. I woke up fine, I wasn't happy or motivated but i was just fine. I went about a week like that i'm still currently in that state, I don't know if it had anything to do with the crazy amount of ginger tea and water i've been drinking or spending time at the trail soaking up the sun for a few hours. to be honest i didn't like it, the state of being fine. Am I crazy? Just about 2 weeks ago i was in so much emotional pain contemplating suicide for no reason, and now that i'm out of that state, why do i miss being depressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that being in a depressed state was weirdly my comfort zone. When i was ""fine"" I Felt out of place like what am i supposed to do now that i'm not suicidal. So many things are contingent on me being suicidal. For example how am I suppose to finish school, make plans to travel, or other big plans when I don't even know if I'm going to be alive next year, or in a few months, weeks ect???.  Now that I am more aware of my hereditary mental illness I know that without medical intervention I will never be able to complete a goal. So guess what until I can get that help I don't attempt to enroll myself into classes or make big plans with people bc at some point i will hit a wall where I am a hair strand away from killing myself. So when I feel ""FINE"" what does that mean for me, it changes everything I start to feel all these things that I want to start doing now! but I remember i can't cause i'll have an episode and end up dropping out or canceling ect. Also being alone with my negative thoughts and emotions feels like this dark toxic blanket where I can close my eyes and forget about all my worries and dream of a place where I will soon feel nothing."
1383,I don't want to be a person anymore,"If it feels like this to be human, I dont want to die but I dont want to be a person anymore"
1384,Cant stop thinking about it,"I feel like I'm pretty much over this traumatic event from 4 years ago, but I can not stop thinking about it. I was able to come to terms with what happened but I literally can not stop thinking about it all the time everyday."
1385,Do you think that social media has created new mental illnesses?,"People always talk about how toxic social media is, but never really do in depth. I think the rise of social media has definitely created new mental illnesses and may have even made them more wide spread"
1386,Maybe some advice?,"Hey guys, I'm new here but thought maybe I could find some solid advice. Basically I've got a history of depression and anxiety, I'd say its milder than others and it comes and goes. 
After a heavy psychedelic experience 3 years ago I've had quite bad existential anxiety from time to time. (I still question whether what I experienced was real or not).
It's made me realise that I must look after my body and mind better. 

These days I'm much more aware of what I'm putting in my body and so I drink much less than I used to, I try to not take drugs and slowly trying to reduce to no drink or drugs eventually but find it difficult. 

I have a girlfriend and live in The Netherlands, from London originally. I try to exercise a lot; running 5km to 10km almost everyday or every other day. I started a meditation practise around 2 years ago and try to meditate most days for 10 minutes or more. I try to engage mostly in healthy behaviours such as being creative (I make music), not watching too much tv, but don't always have tons of energy.

I feel as though I'm doing so much but it never gets too much better. I still have a low opinion of myself and have anxiety which takes various different forms such as; worrying about the size of the universe (which is a weird one haha), wondering what reality is, feeling like I don't have a ton of friends, feeling as though I've achieved nothing and wishing I could go back to school and change my trajectory.

I constantly read about self improvement and do try, I've read various books and what not. Any advice on how others deal with their difficulties would be nice. Or if anyone can relate. 

Have a nice day and thankyou in advance."
1387,"Slowly losing all interest in life, nothing matters.","I'm exhausted, mind my poor grammar and general lack of direction. I no longer feel the same, and I need someone's help. I feel no hate, no pain, no love or happiness.
I used to struggle with psychotic thoughts, however that desire has faded.
And before you ask, no I never did drugs, until the end.

Lately, I'm felt as if I have two different thoughts and opinions on things.
I may be scared of something, but another part of me isnt and actively enjoys whatever it is..

I hate my father who abused me, but I also love him so much, I wish he would disappear but I wish he would also stay by my side... even with people who I dont like at all, everything I feel fades away.

Someone could make fun of me and humiliate me, and I may feel at first indescribable hate, with intent to hurt them... but then it fades and I feel nothing, I don't feel like retaliation is something that would solve my issues.

When I was younger, I used to bully my classmates and enjoyed hurting others for fun, seeing them hurt was enjoyable knowing that they were weaker, I felt superior knowing they were beneath me...

I switched schools multiple times because of my father's work, and I developed a shy personality, everything I felt before was gone... I used to like talking and causing trouble and problems, or hurting people... but then after moving so much, I felt so detached that all I did was read and be by myself for grade 8..

I would always hear ""why are you so quiet"" ""he's so weird he never talks to anyone"" and though, I did talk to peolple, but I never was outgoing, I played with 2-3 kids but I always felt as if it wasn't worth it... it didn't feel entertaining to do so, and I just wanted to pass the time and finish recess/lunch and continue on doing work...


During grade 9, it got worse, my opinion on myself shifted and I began to loath who I was, I hated my father for the choices he made and what he did to me growing up, but I also hated everyone else for having a life I could never have, I was jealous they grew up in a loving environment.

I started reading and studying alot more, my grades began raising very high and though I should have felt proud of myself, I only ever thought about revenge against my father and other people, I never talked to anyone because I was different than them.. small talk to me was useless, tell me what you want straight. I didn't like hanging around with people, because I felt as if I could see straight through them and it made me feel gross..

It changed during grade 10 when I met a few kids who practically forced me to hangout and be friends with them, they weren't the popular kids, but they knew everyone of them and they knew him as well. I felt so alone and weird, everyone else could talk so well and I didnt know what to say or talk about, you can pretty much tell I never had a girlfriend  because of this, and I REALLY wanted someone then...

Overtime, I felt more and more open and started talking, I smiled more and became friends with mutual friends, of course I was still weird, just not as bad as before. I still felt the hate towards my dad, every single minute even if I was laughing with friends it was always there..

Sometime during the end of semester 2, some personal family issues happened, which led me to cut everyone off, I was left alone by choice, I turned off my phone and enjoyed my summer break by myself... I sat in my dark room with only my thoughts and regrets of what I did, I made myself believe I was worthless and that(we will call him jim) Jim wasnt my friend, that he felt pity towards me, maybe he did at that time, but he could have hung out with ANYONE yet he chose me time and time again.. I would cancel or just not show up, and he'd get mad at me, but then I'd apologize after sometime and we'd chill again, he was popular knew everyone, had alot of girls that liked him yet he didnt care at all..

He confused me so much but I was glad he was my friend, I had other friends but he stuck by me, no matter what, I was bullied by this one kid, but theh both knew eachother and Jim would always step in and ignore him whenever he was with me, and force the other guy to leave since there wasn't much of a conversation.. I appreciated that so much, I wasnt much for confrontations to be fair, I was afraid of having someone angry at me, but I didnt like someone insulting me either..

During the end of the summer, I snapped... my mental health dropped, I felt psycho, I wanted to actively hurt people, my head was filled with murder and wanting to inflict pain, I enjoyed sadistic thoughts that whenever they came up I'd laugh from joy and ecstasy...
Overtime, from crying so much, I started laughing whenever I felt pain, I laughed and overtime it went away, but instead of feeling pain I felt pure anger. I wanted to hurt people who were innocent, who did absolutely nothing to me, just because I was hurt myself I wanted to ruin other people and my father as well...

I became obsessed with myself, my confidence rose to the top, I changed my style haircut, personality I wore a mask at all times. I felt as if this was the only way I could do it, the sensitive version of myself only got hurt and used, I never felt good, so I pretended.. 
And it worked.... I made people who didnt even know me laugh, and I laughed with them whenever.. I didn't truly laugh, we both had different humor, I laughed to fit in, I would always pay extra attention to what people liked doing, hobbies, things they talk about..

I acted different towards different people to get close, I felt like I needed to do that to earn their trust and protection.. I surrounded myself with people who laughed at me in grade 9, and at that time I felt very egotistical and felt happy, knowing that no one else knew I was faking all of it..

I felt nothing then, before I was hurt so much, I blamed my issues on past problems, cried felt so much anger and blame on my father...yet now, I felt as if nothing bothered me, insults that rarely happened didnt affect me, I wasnt shy, I said what I wanted whenever, I wasn't afraid of my dad and in fact, I wanted to see me how I was, just to see his reaction....

But he wasn't the same either.. he was an addict, but he was trying to better himself now, he apologized to me for everything that happened in the last, and he knows that he screwed up but he wants me to know that he will ALWAYS ""love"" me no matter what I do or where I go. I wasnt expecting that, I wanted him to leave for days on end, or to verbally tear me apart or backhand me, I wanted it... but it didn't happen, I felt angry, so fucking much, I thought to myself that why did it happen now, now that I didnt care about anyone but myself, that he decides to change himself.. why didnt he do it when I was younger, when I NEEDED someone to show me the proper way, to tell me I was needed, to say I was loved and didnt have to act out for attention.

Of course I forgave him, he would often give me money, and in order to get more, I would need to be friends/good terms with him, so I smiled and cried and admitted that I was so proud of him and hugged him, we sat there for about a minute thinking back now.
After we laughed and joked about being overly sensitive, he said he had to go to meet his girlfriend, but that he'd be home for dinner, and I said sure.. I went to my room and laughed to myself, kept laughing, I didnt know if I was hurt or if I thought I was so cunning and smart, I really didnt know what I felt and it scared me for the first time.

I read about psychology a bit, and sociopaths and psychopaths, I didnt think I was one, and I didnt want to be one to be honest. I still felt emotions, but I could numb them and use them whenever I needed to. Tears and sadness are good if you hurt someone and you need an excuse to say it hurt you too, so I would cry and act weak whenever something I didnt want happened...

I started hanging out daily with new people and even girls started messaging me, and I'd be able to talk to whoever I wanted to now, I'd face time girls all the time at night and grow closer to them. They loved having my attention, and I loved having their trust. My sex drive was gone though, I had a high one in grade 9 and 10, but now I didnt care at all.. I could still maintain an erection and commit to it, but I didnt have any lust towards them, I felt nothing, but I knew they could be used sometime in the future for a favour so I kept talking to them.

I lost my virginity to a girl that was innocent and sweet, she was everything I was, and someone I wanted to be when I was a kid. I didnt exactly feel bad about lying to her constantly, but I didn't feel good either. I didnt know whether or not good or bad even existed, to me those terms were just made up to justify actions other people made.

I would end up dating that girl and cheating on her skth several other girls, at the start I believed I didnt care for attention but.. I needed it so much to survive, if I didnt have it my head would fill with psychotic thoughts and anger, so I had to dull that out with girls who spoke to me, distracted me from everything, I couldn't be angry and maintain a front at the same time so I knew that was my only choice. I couldnt used a doctor because I knew he may prescribe serious meds, and put a warning on me as a potential danger to myself and others so I didnt tell anyone. I trusted no one, not even my good friend Jim who stuck by me since day 1, I couldnt ever fathom trusting an unknown person.

(Its 6 am as I'm writing this, so sorry for bits preceding pieces being apart and poor grammar, it's hard remembering how I was)

I always had drama stuck to my name from something I did, but it never mattered because I had so many friends that would back me up, they trusted me, and those girls did too.
The first girl I dated (we'll call her sam) found out I cheated on her, and told her friend that I did, and she put out some rumours that I forced myself on her, and I took advantage of her sweet personality for my own gain. And while I didn't really care much for her, I didnt care at all for anything, I gained nothing, I did it as an experiment, I wanted to feel if I could enjoy sex and that connection I so desired in grade 9. There wasnt anything, she obviously liked it, but to me it was boring, I was thinking about homework the entire time and how I forgot to hand in that extra credit work.

The lies caused some doubt about me, so I had to shame Sam to cover my reputation, even though I did nothing wrong, it was still extremely bad to have that said about you, since it does happen to unfortunate people. I had to work so hard to cover myself, that I ended up taking it too far and bullying Sam without caring, I started enjoying it again, I felt angry that she would even dare think she could take everything I worked so hard to achieve and maintain. Her friend was also shamed as well by my group of friends, and the girls who liked me, everyone knew they lied. I always screenshot conversations so I have proof, I dont trust anyone so I thought that this could happen, low chance but never zero.

Sam wasnt a bad girl, she truly wasn't, even though she lied about that, she was hurt that I was sleeping with other girls and that she thought she meant nothing to me. She meant alot to me, I never loved her though, I felt nothing, but I still liked how she trusted me and would always entertain me. I thought of it as a pet, feed her a bone every once In awhile.... thinking back I was terrible, I'd guilt her and twist her words to make her doubt herself, break her confidence and made her rely on me. I knew if she ever became more open, she might leave me for someone better, and she wasnt ugly, so I was afraid, I was intensely angry, I was very possessive over people and things I spent time working towards. I could never EVER fathom another guy with her, even if I felt nothing I couldnt let a guy feel a connection with her. I didnt do anything psychotic like kidnap, I did ruin her highschool year and her friends while I enjoyed mine.

I ignored drugs and alcohol, I believed that they would make me slip up, or say something I didnt mean, or even lose my control over my anger. I couldnt do that, I would be offered quite a fair share of drugs are parties, and though I did want to experiment, I wasnt a slave to any addiction and I wasn't able to feel any happiness anyways so drugs shouldn't have had any worthwhile effects on me.

I didnt understand why I was like that, but then I honestly didnt care, my life was perfect, my thoughts were so precise, I always thought a few steps ahead, I had many friends and girls who would do anything for me. My family was doing great, I lived with my grandparents who were Christian, and they noticed I was very different compared to before, and I told them that I opened up, and it was thanks to them, but moreso towards god that me praying allowed him to help me help myself... I didnt mean any of that truthfully, I dont believe in any god except my self at that time, but I couldnt have my family worry over my and take up my time.

I had everything now, a life I thought two years ago I could never have, plenty of girls who weren't the BEST but were still good enough to have alot of guys admire. People who are hard to get were often good entertainment to play with, but at that point I was bored with life... I didnt feel anything, whenever I felt anger it would fade away sometime after... I would try to make myself sadistically before and laugh but I just couldnt do it.

I dated another girl and broke her heart to see if I'd feel anything and nothing happened, I blackmailed her to go back with me, and eventually gained her trust back by telling her I truly didnt do anything. I didnt feel like repeating what happened like last time, and I believe that she shouldnt have even cried over me, she was good looking, smart, popular why would she cry over me?
Nothing made sense to me, I was very good at studying other people, but I couldnt study myself, I wasnt like them, when they cried I couldnt understand why, or if they felt anger I was confused. I tried remembering back to my childhood with my dad, but I couldnt feel any anger or sadness, just acceptance that what happened happened, I forgot to mention but at this time my father relapsed and got into drug use again.

Skipping ahead, I didnt change much, I dropped a few people and gained a bit more girls to talk to. It was late at night, but we had quarentine so I had nothing to do, I had an xbox where I'd play games with friends to grow closer, but I didn't think it was fun, sitting and doing nothing on a virtual game, wasnt appealing to me. I was more into living the moment, doing things in real life and hanging out with actual people, I enjoyed hearing people talk about their life, things that happened. I especially enjoyed hearing people talk about how much rage they felt toward something they were hurt by when they were younger, I liked knowing they felt anger enough to feel the urges I felt.

They were so enjoyable, I became obsessed with helping them solve their problems, and grew more egotistical the more I helped, and the more I helped the more I learned about how people cope and handle themselves. I didnt help them because I wanted them to be good, It was a game to me and i wanted to see if I was good enough to help others fix their problems, but I couldnt fix mine. Ironic isnt it.

My father came home, he was high and was with a female friend whom I didnt like, I never liked druggies, I couldnt understand how they had to use drugs to feel happiness or enjoyed it. I told my dad that grandma was inside looking for him, so he fixed himself and went away so I was left with his friend Christina, she was definitely an addict, but she didnt appear like she was one for long. She looked like early 20,s and someone who started using drugs, I was disgusted by her but also fascinated, I wanted get closer to her and manipulate her to do whatever I wanted. But, I couldnt, my head flared up, it felt as if I was disgusted by her, she was revolting, but my sex drive amped up, something about someone who was disgusting and looked down upon by me turned me on. I ended up taking control of myself and told her to fuck off, and that if she ever showed her face around her she wouldn't be alive anymore, of course I didnt say those exact words, but I wanted her gone. I believed that guys wasted too much time on women, that they should just focus on something else, they weren't special and neither was sex. I gave her a 20 dollar bill and another 50 that I had gotten from a friend for doing a favor awhile back, I wanted her to feel like she was worth something.
She could use that money for drugs and forget a out my dad, and I knew the only reason she was with him was because he had dope, I was thoroughly disappointed in my father, he was a good looking and well mannered person to everyone, he may have been abusive to me, but I no longer cared, I didnt agree with his appearance. He couldnt be tied to me, so if anyone asked, I was never his child and if I was from him, I'd be better off dead, or so I thought.
I believe deep down, I appreciated how he came home, I may not agree with him, or like the things he does, but he's still my father he's my blood, so I cant abandon him  just as how he didnt kick me out. We talked a bit in my grandparents shed, and I asked what drugs felt like, and he pulled out a few large bags and asked if I wanted to find out myself.
I told him that I didnt care, but would prefer if he told me, since I was planning on visiting a girl tomorrow.
He told me how he had heroin, meth, a few bags of coke, 1 shroom for whatever reason, and 3 Molly's he was saving.

I told him that I didnt understand what he told me about the feelings and I asked him how to use it, so he showed me first hand. I didnt stop him, I didnt have the right to, he is his own person with his own ideals and consequences just as I do.

He started on the heroin and overtime slowly dosed off which I thought was annoying and disappointing, so I took it upon myself to try it.

I wasnt going to do the heroin since I didnt want to lose my alertness and become like that, so I decided I'd try meth, I remembered that coke was pretty expensive so I left that to him as a sign of pity or low respect.

I didnt feel anything taking a line, so I took another, and another, until the third kicked in, it was a strange feeling, I never felt that feeling before but it wasnt strong enough so I took another two. Then it hit me, a flash of euphoria something that surprised me, it wasn't overwhelming but it was still something, it made me laugh of excitement, my father may have been passed out in front of me but I felt it, I felt something that I never felt for so long. I took a few large Crystal's with me to try again, he didnt notice since the bags were quite large and I also took his bags of dope inside, he was very drowsy but I wasnt worried, he had overdosed 9 times in my life, so he was fine I believed and left him in the garage as I went inside.

I went inside and admired this feeling, it was short lasted but I grew tired of it, I wanted to feel something stronger, it wasnt strong enough for me to do it again so I took a bit more and decided I was done since I was going to a girls house. I couldn't fall asleep, I tried but I was awake, my heartrate was extremely fast, so I forced myself to drink water and to sit still and relax.

I put on some binaural beats and sat down and stared at my ceiling, I was disappointed, immensely it wasn't good enough.
Everyone always said it felt good to do it, and it was addicting that I'd be hooked but I didnt think so.

Fast forward, I couldn't sleep the entire night nor the next 6 days, I could feel my skin excrete a toxin that I had to continously wash off, I had no appetite but I forced myself to eat, and to drink 3 liters of water daily.
It wasnt too bad, nothing bothered me too much, the thing that made me somewhat annoyed was that my genital was very small and shrunken, I was expecting to do it with my friend today, but I had to give up and say I wasn't in the mood. I couldnt sleep at all, It would be a cool study drug if I had trouble with school, but I had everything perfect.

The withdrawl effects were something else, originally they shocked me, but overtime I realized that I enjoyed it, it was a sense of relief knowing it was my body harming itself and I didnt have any chance of dying from it. The one thing that I didnt particularly enjoy was the crank bugs, or meth mites that occasionally occured to me. It felt like fire ants crawling over my body and biting me, my body wanted to scratch and dig under my body, but I knew better not to, I laughed to combat it.

I used my thoughts as a way to make myself enjoy the feeling, I felt pure anger again, to combat it, I took a high dose so the feeling was strong, and it lasted pretty long as well.

I never got into any fights or gotten hurt before except from my father, but this was a weird feeling. I couldnt do anything about it, so I sat there and waited until it went away, then I showered.

I still seldomly feel the effects from withdrawl, but it isnt anything crazy that makes me feel threatened or worried. I had no desire to take more, the only thing I wanted was to feel normal, I felt as if I was forever going to be this way.

After taking Meth, I didnt respond to my friends or any girls for awhile, and when I did I didnt care enough to put any effort, I felt hopeless.
I could've tried another drug, but I took quite alot of meth thinking it would help me feel different but it didnt, before I finally quit it as I'm writing now, I took more of it and more..

Whenever I was angry, I would take it to see if I would feel continously angry, but again... I fucked up and it didnt work, but this time I could sleep and still operate, I had no appetite but it's not like I eat based on that.



If you read this far, I'm truly lost, I have no guidance, I feel nothing anymore. Drugs arent working for me, i researched meth and DESPERATELY obsessed with trying to get addicted, but I ran out of it and didnt feel like associating my name with the crackheads I knew,and my dad was off somewhere so I just chilled again.

I honestly am speechless, I'm tired as I'm writing this, and my fingers are worn as well. If anyone has any thoughts on what happened to me, and why I don't have any desire for sex, or love, even to my family. I have no fear or regrets nothing, I live life how it is now, I dont think of myself any different, nor does anyone know I did meth.

People say addiction isnt a choice, but I believe it is.. If it was then I would definitely make myself addicted, I want something to desire in life, even if it meant taking drugs with lowlifes, I would enjoy it more than I am now.

I dont have a job during this isolation, I complete my school work quickly, and then I'm lost again. I had experienced everything I wanted to, I tried everything I thought was cool as a child. I never was able to hurt or take my anger out on my father or anyone else for that matter, but today as of wednesday May 6th, I have no hate for anyone in this world at all.

Taking meth has made me realize that those who get addicted like my father, are weak willed. They cave for that feeling of synthetic happiness. I dont understand it, but I'll try more drugs, hopefully there is an addicting one, I'll do everything except needles. My body is mine, but I still need to appear healthy for friends, last thing I want is people thinking I'm depressed or an addict, If only they knew.



Anyways reddit, if you read through my sleep deprived post, please help me, anything. I need help desperately and I'll do anything. I cant live my days feeling like a rock, even faking my mask is getting hard for me to do.
It was my pride that I could do it, but if that's going away, and I'm left with nothing, I'll be worthless more so than I am. If I could suggest anything to people who haven't tried drugs, dont try it, you wonder what it's like, but the only thing you need to know, is that you WILL give in. You are weak, just like me, I cant survive without attention and control over others, and addicts get addicted, I'm addicted to lying and everything about me is fake. Though, my father is a person you dont want to be like, dont create another me, he was the reason I grew up the way I did. Stick to weed and I suppose LSD, if you want to know what it feels like firsthand go ahead, but just know that you're only seen as a source of income, I would wish if I was I dealer that you would start, I don't care about others, I could easily tempt as many people as I want into it, and make quite a sale. Though, that's easy, what's not easy is getting people to believe in themselves, so much doubt and depression in people, especially girls, beautiful smart talented individuals you'd never think would struggle, but they do and it's a damn shame I think, I used to obsess over these girls and wish I was as confident/happy as them, and the one thing that you are all at risk for, is doubt. Have pure confidence in everything you do, thoughts and opinions of others do not matter, you are the god of your story, whether you believe you're a worthless side character and treat yourself like that, is up to you. I am the god of mine, my effort and hardwork pays off, never give up and never hurt yourself, having to sit on facetime with a girl who has issues, to prevent herself from slicing her wrists and thighs is tiring, If you want to end it do it, dont best around the bush and drag others down, keep everything to yourself and fight your own demons as I did, only then will you realize that the true demons, are in fact, ourselves.





People with depression who do drugs to cope, why? Your family is hurting so much over it, my father was a great guy before he did that, and then he took everything out on me. Yet I still loved him, because that's family, you all hurt everyone close to you, push everyone away and believe you're alone.
I used to want to kill and erase all drug users, I was obsessive over that, like I said it was the only thing I could think of, and I enjoyed it alot.
Logically thinking, I would probably still think that if I could, now that I know my father could've fought against that drug with willpower if he cared, if he ever considered his love for his parents or me more, he would've.

He was weak, just like all addicts are, I will never sympathize with you, and you will never sympathize with me, we are different. You were the reason I suffered growing up, that I was hurt all those years ago. My pain, was the cause of ignorant people such as yourselves, to think I tried the same drugs as crackheads and to say I tried it, is downright disgusting. We are not the same, everything I do is calculated, even on drugs, you all have no excuse but lack of willpower, self respect, and love. I will try every drug that is addicting so that I can fully understand, and confirm my opinion and beliefs that addiction is a choice, and those who fall prey to addiction are terribly weak souls who are meant to be used by others. In this case, addicts run the underground world, they are the buyers and in result, cause so much drug trade wealth.

I have to pretend to like you, despite how much all of you disgust me, and loathe, my father is an addict and some friends are addicted, they still have family and friend who care about them, but to me you are worthless, those who steal and hurt their family dont deserve the right to life.
Those who deal drugs shouldnt be to blame either, they supply the drug and tempt others, those who give in to their selfish desires deserve it. If I could, I would take it upon myself to remove you, be grateful that I'm too disinterested and smart to waste my life and talents on scum like you. You'll all die in the next 10-30 years, and if not, you'll probably have kids and those kids will repeat what you did, seen it firsthand. The only sympathy I have for anything in this world, is children.
They are innocent, you can mold them however you like, they are defenseless, some abuse them and some raise them to be good people. Whatever you decide, always remember that they are just like you, but they're sensitive, they may always love you, but hate you, I never let go despite my conflicting ideals and what I say. I'm truly confused that I confuse my thoughts and I no longer have clear thoughts on anything anymore, I know I hate my father but yet... another feeling is, that I love him and forgive him, even though I dont.
Mental health is important, never neglect children, those who feel nothing are risky, they may do things that are risky in order to feel the rush, or they may have delusions on the lives of others, I know I have a unhealthy delusion that addicts should be all shot, but I know that it's my upbringing that creates hate.
The cycle will never stop, and I don't think I'll ever change, I learned how to handle the pain I went through, and now I deal with the consequence of feeling nothing, at the expense of being protected from every feeling, even the warm embrace of love.

I do feel some slivers of guilt, so I know my humanity is still there, I'm not erased just yet, my grandmother is one of the most important people to me, without her, I have no idea what I would have done, same with my grandfather and sister. Though my grandfather was also abusive towards me, he was strict, I deserved everything that was given to me because he truly wanted my to learn and be better. It's no ones fault, children are abused and neglected, sexual assault is rampant, I feel sad for those who dont adapt, who are forever broken and scarred. If only you had the strength to fight back, but you were powerless just as I was. I wish someone would save me, my sister was lucky, she was able to get out and move in 2 years before I did with our grandma. I'm glad, I was the one that it happened to, my sister may not respect me for my choices of like me, but I care for her in my way, she will turn into a great doctor, she studied for a nurse and finished that and wanted more, so shes going to med school, would've been had this quarentine never happened.

My life wasnt a mistake, what happened in my childhood was unfortunate yes, did it break me, yeah it did, it destroyed my early years and left unfixable damage in my head, but, it made me stronger. I dont have desires, but I know... I know I will find something, there will be something and I believe in myself that as long as I dont give in, that I continue living this life even if I despise it, that even if I dont like this life. That there are still people who rely on me, who need me, who want me alive to help them, to be there, people trust and admire me, they love my confidence that I put on, the mask helps others to believe in themselves. They will never know that I dont care at all, that they're just entertainment for my cruel life, they weren't there for me in grade 9 when I was alone, yet now they are?
It's fun to think about that there are people just like me out there in the world, that I'm not alone yet I am.

I know good and bad, I don't care at all, I have no filter, if it benefits me I'll do it, anything in order to get my goals just like my sister does, humans have no excuse for being poor or welfare. Determination, and WILLPOWER, feel pain and adapt, subject yourself to psychological torture, take a drug just for withdrawl effects and get used to it, suffer and enjoy it, you'll accept the pain and become a better person, fighting it is useless you only tire yourself out and you give in.

Mental torture is a fascination I've discovered, I've never studied psychology or anything, I'm still in highschool grade 11, surprisingly I know quite alot of maggots who are in their 30s, to think that if I had this drugs, they'd do anything for a quick fix. Amusing to think truly how pathetic they are, they've never suffered growing up so they never learned how to deal with pain, looking at how kids deal with it now, they slice themselves up, indulge in alcohol distraction themselves from reality, and they like it... they like living in delusions and a fake world being happy, while I learned to accept and realize that I'm the product of my father. And I hope my children turn out just as I did, I'd have to emotionally break them and destroy everything, then make them trust me and then do it again, you see. Children and even grown people, when they truly love someone, they'll accept whatever happens to them no matter if they're abused by the one they love, they remember better times and hope they change.
Those who are teenagers or even adults who are victim to that cannot change, they may be able to adapt but they'll never truly be immune to it, I remember overhearing a classmate explain how childhood trauma affects people, and most often serial killers are abused and they grow up with thoughts just like I had. I'm not sure how I didnt murder anyone, maybe because it's no more fun when they die, everyone gets scared and you need to act the part, no more parties. Though as long as they leave the people who constantly show me entertainment and the girls I prefer are safe, it doesnt care to me what happens to less fortunate people, I would always protect everyone who admires and looks up to me, because without them I'm nothing.

I wanted to end this message earlier, and yet here I am, distracted. I cannot talk to anyone my age in a serious manner, each and everyone of them are childish, they see things through a single lens.

""Everyone who does drugs are addicted"" ""If you steal you'll do anything"" ""I'm leaving if my boyfriend ever does drugs""
These sentences are blatantly wrong.
Everyone who does drugs are not addicted, not everyone in this world is born with a weak will. Some are very strong, they don't cave to small cravings, they continue doing their beliefs and they hold true to their word.

If you steal, you arent a bad person, everyone has something they desire so bad that they steal for, I know I wanted a girl so bad I made her cheat on her boyfriend, and I was there to see her lie to him on text ""oh I'm just heading to bed, I'll talk to you later in the morning love you"" see, I didnt do anything bad. She chose to sleep with me, and I accepted, in a sense I stole that poor guys girlfriend, and he didnt even know, he still doesnt because we agreed to not tell him, we also agreed that whenever we felt like it, we could do it again. Think of yourself first, than others. If you always think of yourself then you'll always be in pain, protect your right.

I'm done, I have to sleep. Help me please, and I'll pay you back by doing whatever you want."
1388,Mental health is getting worse and I dont know what to do.,My girlfriend has been staying with my family and I since November/December and and her mental illness has been on a decline because of my mother constantly blaming her for things that have nothing to do with us and my brother having anger outbursts because anger issues and storming around the house screaming triggering her anxiety. Her mental health is extremely bad at this point she has trouble eating and when she does she has trouble keeping it down (went to the hospital today and no it's not a virus or something.) Does any one know what we can do to help her because we cant leave because of covid.
1389,So my friend tried to commit suicide recently...,"A friend of mine tried to drown themselves. 

He texted right before he tried to kill himself and asked, even begged a little, for me to not call the ambulance. He had 3 attempts in the past and ended up in the hospital and lots of therapy every week. Since we went to different schools, I would text him to see if he's doing alright. 

For some reason though, I didn't feel any sadness or emotion when he told me he was going to commit suicide. Or the hours after it. I didn't feel a thing.

Is it normal to not feel anything when someone tries to kill themselves? And if it isn't, what is wrong with me?

I want to help my friend get through these tough times. Advice on (even slightly) helping my friend is the main thing I want to ask for."
1390,"For those who have been, what are psychiatric wards like?",
1391,Resources for Mentalization Based Therapy?,"I’m having a heck of a time finding resources for MBT (Mentalization Based Therapy). Can’t find online courses or therapists in my area. I’ve found some books but they seem to be geared towards professionals, not clients."
1392,Having two psychiatrists,"As stated in the title, is having two psychiatrists impractical/unheard of? How common is it for a psychiatrist to misdiagnose someone? I'm considering visiting a psychiatrist but I often ponder if seeing two (assuming it is legal) will make the diagnoses verifiable and legible if they happen to overlap.

Thanks!"
1393,Quite lost....,"I think the enjoyment out of life has vanished.. Since January I've pretty much gotten rid of all my social media, I've stopped answering messages I find unimportant, I don't really talk to anyone (I want to but I also don't want too) I just even look at things I know I enjoy or should be finishing and looking at them or thinking of then just gives me a horrible feeling in my stomach..

Just everything there isn't one thing in my day I find satisfying, it all seems like a struggle, it's like I've given up in myself and everything around me because it's not as if I leave my bedroom much either."
1394,I have compiled a list of self-help resources which have helped me with anxiety and depression, [https://www.balancebetter.org/practical-advice/5-self-help-resources-for-mental-health-readily-available-to-you](https://www.balancebetter.org/practical-advice/5-self-help-resources-for-mental-health-readily-available-to-you)
1395,How do I make my life worth living.,"I’m just so confused. There’s of course so many wonderful things in life but no point to anything. I love myself for who I am and want to help myself but plan out ways to kill myself every day.

I want to make my life better but I feel like I’m too much of a piece of shit to change anything.

I was doing so well with therapy but how can it all come crashing down in one episode.

Help please, what do I do I’m so so scared."
1396,Is there something wrong with me or am I just over dramatic?,"Since 2017 I’ve been experiencing these weird waves of sadness but I think it’s more than sadness?... it’s not like your regular sadness like “oh I’m sad so and so’s not responding to my text. I’ll get over it the next day” type of sad. It’s the sadness that hurts so much It feels like my heart is getting ripped and torn apart multiple times and the pain just won’t go away to the point I get a headache. I don’t know why this started happening to me. I have a loving, supportive family and a good friend group... but at night or sometimes early in the morning when I take a shower I get hit by a wave of this sadness thinking that once I get out of high school I won’t make it any where in life, I won’t have a family, and no one will want to be friends with me, I’d just be alone. I mean I have good grades (straight A’s), I’m in the volleyball team, I play the piano, I’m quite good at art (at least that’s what people tell me), and on the outside I look like I’m happy and energetic. Some people say that I have the perfect life, so when I say thanks not knowing how to respond I feel guilty cause to me it just doesn’t feel like it and I often have to excuse myself so that they won’t see me cry... I genuinely don’t know what to do... I’m ashamed to tell my family and friends even though they probably will help me but I feel like they’d think less of me or of make fun of me for talking about what I’m feeling.. I didn’t know where else to post this, sorry reddit. I just had to get this off my chest somewhere. And if anyone that can relate to this please leave a comment? Idk if that’s appropriate to ask though?"
1397,Is it sad to say that my only safe space is porn and has always been porn?,I was introduced very Young and it is only think that makes the shame go away but at the same time it increases it in a weird way
1398,I’m having a recurring vision or delusion... I don’t know,"The past few days have been so weird for me, I don’t  know what’s going on. I guess I’ll start by describing what I’m seeing.

I keep having visions of a girl (I say visions because I can’t really think of a better word that describe it). She’s always looking at me, her eyes filled with pain and suffering. She has tattoos on her arms that look almost ritualistic, but she can’t be more than 12 or 13. I feel like I’ve known her my whole life and I feel a connection to her. Like a bond between siblings, I feel like I have to protect her and she’s depending on me to protect her. But I can’t get to her, and I can’t help her. She’s being tortured physically and mentally and I can’t help her. I’m convinced we’re related, but we were separated when we were young. She’s trying to reach out to me, trying to find me, but I don’t know how to find her. I don’t know how to help her. 

I know this sounds crazy but it’s true. I’ve been haunted by these thoughts and visions for the past few days and they are only getting more frequent. It doesn’t really seem to effect my day to day life. I do have mild depression, and I’ve gotten pretty good at hiding what I’m really feeling from people. I’m using that same strategy in this case as well.

If anyone has any idea what’s going on, I would appreciate the help. I feel so alone with this as I feel like everyone around me would think I’m crazy if I said something."
1399,"Feeling just a tad bit off tonight, anyone else?","Not to the point to want to hurt myself. Been a long while since that. But just feeling like, I want to not be laid off, I want my life back. And its hard when I'm at home all alone. Yes, I have my mom and dad who call on a daily basis cuz they know to check in, and friends, but I just tell them all is ok to not be a burden on anyone. I just feel a certain way tonight. I cry, then watch tv, then just try to keep myself busy. Anyone feeling such way?"
1400,Thoughts of self harm result of a traumatic experience ?,I have had reoccurring mild self harm thoughts torwards myself that get worse each day as a result of an experience (I’m guess trauma induced from the experience ) anyone else had problems like this before and can anyone offer me advice on how to help? Thanks. Btw I do not feel like I am a danger to myself at the moment so please do not tell me to go to a hospital. Just curious and seeking community advice
1401,I think I’m at the end of it,"Made a throwaway account so I could rant for a moment maybe I’m just an attention seeker i just need to get my thoughts out I haven’t properly opened up for maybe 2 to 3 months probably longer and my mental health has gone down so much

So much has happened I lost a very good friend because I’m a complete asshole I ended the best relationship I’ve ever had because I fucked it up and now I regret everything about it I led on someone by accident and had to break it off in a harsh way

My sh has if only gotten worse my dog died me and my nana got into two separate arguments for the first time in my life I lost a friend because I can’t express my boundaries and I think I’m about to loose another because I’m just that annoying I’m starting to hate everything about myself and about two or three nights ago I had an anxiety attack of some sort and have cried to some degree every night since

I feel lost upset I’m always sad I experience extreme mood drops and I’m probably annoying the fuck out of my roommate i think anyone I cared about thinks I’m a complete loser and I’ve been thinking about ending my life a lot recently well not ending but close just seriously injure just hurt myself so someone notices something is fucking wrong because I can’t open my goddamn mouth for anything 

Quarantine has made my life stressful and chaotic it threw me off any pattern I had left and I haven’t done school work for weeks and it’s about to be summer what’s the point anymore 

Everyday is painful I regret so many things and I’m so utterly alone I’ve fucked up everything in my life genuinely I truly believe it’s all because of me I deserve all this because I’m awful my birthday is next month and it’s supposed to be one of the most iconic birthdays of your life go all out and I’ll be stuck in quarantine no friends no party no going anywhere just me and my disappointing self no one but the people living with me that are so done with my bullshit they would probably just want to catch cute virus instead"
1402,Every day is the same shit over and over,"Throughout the quarantine all I've done is play video games, watch youtube and masturbate. At this point I open a game and immediately get bored of playing it. I dont have the motivation to do anything different but doing the same thing is literally killing me."
1403,"If I use my family’s insurance when I go to therapy at 18 while still living at home, what confidentiality rights do I have in therapy/counseling?","I’m a 17 year old struggling with depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and self harm. I really want to give therapy a try, but I’m worried about confidentiality. I have extremely toxic, narcissistic parents and basically want nothing to do with them cause they have a negative impact on my life, but I still live with them. My parents could care less about mental health and they would play like they are the victims if they found out why I want to go to therapy. They don’t know that I don’t like them and the root of everything I’m dealing with is from a life of dealing with them being so toxic. I can’t afford therapy especially without insurance. My parents would probably let me go to therapy, but I do not want them to know if anything discussed in therapy. If I’m gonna be honest with my therapist, then it’s gonna have to be without my parents knowing anything about what is said in my sessions. Because if this, I’m waiting till Im 18 to start therapy for confidentiality purposes. My parents would let me use family insurance most likely, but if I’m 18 and use my family’s insurance, what all will they be told? Would my therapist still report non suicidal self harm behaviors to my parents if I’m 18 and live with them still? Will my parents be able to see on the insurance what specific issues I’m receiving therapy for? I just want to get better but it’s difficult."
1404,"I can’t explain what I’m feeling, but it’s mostly bad.","I think I play video games religiously because when I play video games, my mind practically becomes numb and I’m basically hypnotized. I forget everything and am entranced in a digital world. When I’m not playing video games, I either feel null, or some strange sort of sad. I’ve tried to get into drawing. I keep trying to learn and start drawing but I can’t, my feelings just overwhelm me when I get frustrated that I can’t be good enough fast enough. Recently I almost ran away and threw myself off of a bridge too, but it was for an dumb reason, and I feel like I was being way too dramatic. 

The thing is, I know I’m not depressed. I’ve taken multiple online quizzes and they have all told me I have severe depression. I know it’s all bullshit, they try to get you to think you have depression so you talk to one of their psychiatrists or something. I’m like null most of the time. It feels like limbo, a strange autopilot where you can feel null and sad, but rarely happy. Also, I feel like my brain is recently beginning to become scattered. It’s jumping around frantically unless I’m playing video games. 

One other thing. I REALLY need to do my online school work but I can’t. I just can’t, I know I have to, and that if I don’t I will fail, but I can’t do it. I have done some assignments, but I had to put myself through stress I didn’t want to go through again. Why am I this way, what will fix me. Please tell me, I can’t live like this. I’m not human, this is a prison and I want out. Someone please help me, I just want to know how to fix myself once and for all. I can’t keep feeling like this much longer."
1405,"Imposter syndrome, but...I also believe I’m actually faking to some degree?","I’m a walking paradox and I’m shit with words, but bear with me

So sometimes I’ll get scared and think I’m faking something. Or that I just want attention. Even when I’m clearly not faking something.

But, I’m convinced I *do* actually fake things to a certain extent. I compulsively look up symptoms when I experience something (I don’t think I’ve ever managed to stop myself?) and, magically, those symptoms appear. And then I won’t be able to tell if I’m actually faking it or not.

And in the past I have engaged in attention-seeking behaviors, which makes me afraid of accidentally engaging in them again.

Also, whenever someone says “they’re just faking for attention” (even if that person probably was) it makes whatever the fuck I’m experiencing worse. I found a subreddit that was dedicated to that shit, and I can’t stop thinking about it.

Sort of convinced I’m delusional at this point. My perception of reality is clearly fucked if I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not."
1406,What do I do??,"I am mentally unstable and I am autistic. I really want to die, I just want the world to end. But I  not going by my own hand. What does it mean when I hope and pray for the day something happens to me?? I have been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety along with PTSD. But I can't get treatment because my insurance doesn't cover psychiatry. I was seen by a neuropsychologist for memory issues. She said I had severe depression and anxiety and it was causing my issues with my memory, but she could not properly diagnose me because she was not the right doctor to do so. She said I needed to see a psychiatrist. But this will never happen unless I pay out the ass for for it. I don't know what to do.... I need help. But apparently I cannot afford it. So what am I to do? Just give up and give in? Die the way I had planned years ago? Or keep trying to find a doc who will help without payment? Will never happen.... I could be on the ledge of a roof of a 50 story building and no doc would help unless they knew they were getting paid. So they would let me jump because they wouldn't make a dime. This day in age, no one cares. Why care about someone if they can't pay??? I hate this world and all it stands for. What is the point?? No one is running to help me, so why should I stay to help anyone else??"
1407,Vent--I have Cibophobia?,"Hi. I just had a panic attack and I don't really know where else to turn to so...reddit.

I had some food-based anxieties when I was a teenager, where I couldn't go to restaurants because I would throw up if I had to eat.  This caused a lot of trauma--I had fights with my parents, ""embarrassed"" my extended family, cried in the car alone, vomited in many restaurant bathrooms, and I still can't smell saffron rice to this day without shaking. I was diagnosed with general anxiety as a teen but only given GERD medication to stop me from having stomach issues.

This mostly cleared up when I went to college.  I just avoided mayo (which I still hate) because it always seems unsafe to me. Then, when I was a sophomore, I got it in my head that I was allergic to peanuts. I have no idea where or why I got that idea, because up until that point I *loved* peanuts and would eat peanut butter almost every day. This lasted for about a year, and then I got over it. Later, I was convinced I was allergic to oysters and avoided them, until I was pressured into eating fried oysters at a party. Surprise--I really liked them! Same thing for clams.

But now here I am, crying in a room at my in-law's because I have to keep justifying my ""allergies.""

About a year ago, the thought that I was allergic to nuts crept back into my mind. I started feeling cold and shaky after eating peanut butter--so I just stopped, and avoided all nuts. Then it started again with shellfish, like oysters and clams, and expanded to shrimp, octopus and squid. I now live in an East Asian country where these are all very common.  Lately it has also been fruits like mangoes (my little sister is allergic, although I have never displayed symptoms myself) that I avoid. 

When I flew back to this country last month I felt panicky after eating the in-flight service food--when I asked to see the ingredients list the flight attendants told me they didn't have one, just the plating guides (which they kindly showed me). This didn't help me relax, because now I was unsure if what I had eaten actually contained shellfish or nuts or something, which sent me spiraling even more, until I was shaking violently in my seat from anxiety.  I keep packets of benedryl in my purse, my backpack, and and extra tablet inside my wallet, just in case. If I even think I've come in contact with something, I'll take a pill, which knocks me out. 

My symptoms are: feeling suddenly very cold, shaking, feeling ""off,"" and then I often go to a mirror to check myself--am I getting hives? Has my tongue always looked that way? Am I breathing funny, or am I just overreacting?? Usually it just ends with me becoming extremely quiet (I'm super fun at dinner parties, obviously), excusing myself, taking a benedryl, and crying. 

When I'm alone/cooking for just my husband and myself, I can easily avoid these ingredients. When we go to restaurants, I'm careful to not order anything with nuts or shellfish, or something I'm not 100% sure of. But because of COVID, I had to return to my husband's country and we are living with my in-laws. They won't allow me to go out shopping (to ""protect"" me) so I have very very little control over the food they buy for us. They also question my ""allergies"" every single day. It's humiliating, and frustrating, and I can't even explain to them without getting upset and flustered. 

""It's not like I swell up...or I don't think so...but I just...get shaky and cold and I...just...don't want to eat it!""

Every single day we have a conversation about it. They've tried to be careful to not to buy pre-made food with my ""allergies,"" but they've made mistakes, and then I have to tell them I can't eat this because of my made-up aversion to some ingredient....

We will thankfully be moving out of here in about 2 weeks and then I can go back to cooking for myself. I can't wait. But until then it's a nightmare. My husband returned to our country yesterday--a month after me--so we are separated physically until we can move out of here and find our own apartment. So I can't even have his comfort or have him help explain to his parents. I can't talk to my own parents about it because I know I'll just get the same mix of frustration and pity and ""get over it, you are FINE!"" I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm losing control. 

Sorry for this vent. I just needed to write it all out. Seeing it written down, I know how crazy it looks, but I can't help it. I really don't know what to do, other than continue to avoid these foods. 

TL;DR: I have an irrational fear of having an allergic reaction to foods. I have never had a food allergy (that I know of). This is having a very negative impact on my life and putting strain on my relationships."
1408,EMDR for CPTSD,"Hello! Have you experienced this form of therapy? Have you the same diagnosis and had good results from other somatic therapies? I would love to hear any and all options and experiences

I'm currently working with a psychologist and we are going to give EMDR a shot. I feel a alot in my body I can think through most things OK but it seems my nervous system is stuck in alert

Thanks in advance"
1409,Someone to talk to,I’m starving/dehydrating myself to death and could do with some company. I don’t want to speak to friends I know in real life because I don’t want them to know how fucked in the head I am. Feel free to message me as long as you won’t try to talk me out of it. Thanks.
1410,"I’m sorry if my thoughts seem choppy, I just had to get this off my chest. Advice welcome.","This will probably get lost in the sea of new posts, but I just don’t really care. I’m an 18 M and I’ve truly been struggling with my mental health over the last 10 months or so, starting with an injury that left me immobile for a couple of months. I started college, going to the same school as my HS girlfriend, and things started to go south. I started losing interest in various things but specifically the relationship and generally felt worthless. This led to a downward spiral into suicidal thoughts. I broke up with my GF in January of this year, and I was happier at first, but now I can’t stop feeling guilty for hurting her by ending the relationship, and I can’t stop thinking about how people will side against me because we broke up.

As dumb as I know it is, this has dominated my thoughts over quarantine. If I don’t distract myself with video games, Reddit, tv, or other things, I find myself constantly worried about the breakup, what people think of me, etc. and it’s exhausting. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve never struggled with mental illness before and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Worst of all, I feel like people will ridicule me if I open up about it, so I’m dealing with it by myself. I’m not trying to be dramatic, I just don’t know where else to go with this. I’m so ashamed of myself for being like this but it’s just something I can’t seem to escape. If you have any advice, resources, or maybe a lead to help me figure out what I’ve been dealing with and how to overcome it, I would appreciate that more than you know."
1411,I made my first therapy appointment.,"I've been in emtional pain for about 10 years (22 F). As much as I've worked to overcome things that have happened in my past, I don't feel better and I REALLY want to, so I made my first appointment for a teletherapy session next week. It's a really big, difficult step for me because the one time that I went to therapy as a teen was a terrible experience for me. I was feeling good about taking the leap. 

Except ever since I made that appointment today, my brain hasn't stopped replaying all of the worst moments of my life. I'm laying here cuddled up between my dog and my husband and it's 3 AM and I can't sleep because it won't stop playing and all I want to do is cry. 

Really thinking about cancelling the appointment now. If I feel like this just from putting it on the calendar, maybe it's not worth it .

*sorry for the rant*"
1412,I don't want to go back to hell,"Sorry if this doesn't fit in this subreddit. So, schools in my country are reopening in a few days for only half a month before schools close before summer vacation. I could skip school if my parents complete an application(more of my schoolmates will) but they just don't care. I've told them a million times that I don't want to go and that I would do every assignment our teachers assigns us in online classes but they don't listen. I've even begged them, promising them I will never bother them again but they don't give a fuck and tell me to stop being lazy.

I don't want to go to school. I would prefer to die. It makes me feel like a complete failure, a useless piece of shit. I don't want to self diagnose but I think I may have social anxiety to some extent. Whenever I am with other people I have intrusive thoughts I cant stop, that cause an insane amount of stress. I start sweating, my heart beats very fast, I get light-headed and I have to occupy my hands with something, like pinching myself or else I go completely crazy. In addition to all of this, due to my not existing self-confidence I always compare my looks and abilities to others which makes me feel even shittier about myself. Lastly, I don't have any friends. There's a girl I sometimes sit next to but it's because a teacher told her to hang out with me and because she pitties me.

I'm not saying covid 19 is a good thing, as a lot of people are suffering and losing loved ones, but quarantine is the best thing that has happened to me this year. It's not like I am completely fine now but at least I don't feel like complete shit. Of course there are others problems like spending a lot of time and fighting with my parents who aren't really encouraging and positive but I can bear it. I'm, for the first time since I was 7, feeling ok and not suffering.

How can I make my parents allow me to skip school? I can't tell them all of this, even if I did they would say I'm overreacting and I'm actually fine. What should I do?"
1413,Feeling anxious and having no motivation,"Hello...so I'm in college and since quarantine started I've barely done any school work, almost none. I'm in a very bad place mentally..I feel overwhelmed by all the things happening in the world and I'm dealing with other personal problems, one of them is my sexuality that I haven't talked about to anybody..I've have no motivation to do any work, but it's not like I don't care about it, I think about it all day, but I'm avoiding it..I've procrascinated for so long that I'm scared to even look at what's happening in my online classes...I'm so scared to check my school email or assignments that every time I even think about doing that I get really really really anxious, my heart starts beating fast and I start feeling physically sick...every day I set my alarm early with a plan of finally doing something, but I never end up doing anything..like I wake up even before the alarm feeling very anxious and scared...I don't know what to do...I feel depressed, I feel like a failure and I'm gonna fail all my classes..today I felt like crying and I was on the verge of tears the whole day..I don't know if any of this makes sense...but I would really appreciate like literally any advice....anything🙏

p.s. I'm not an english speaker so I apologize for any mistakes."
1414,Who else has severe fantasies about an ex how a person whom they don't talk to?,"If I could have a choice to talk to anyone on the planet it would be her. I would choose her over any celebrity. I love her so much and I wish I could relive that chapter of my life. I've spent more time fantasizing over her and often feeling intense pain than what feels like anyone who's not psychotic couldn't quite comprehend. I can't talk to her.

I now have this demon who has possessed my right eustachian tube. It causes my ear to pop and pop in sessions. It can pop as fast to 15-20 pops per second at time. It's very rapid! This happens in bursts and can last several hours at worse! It's like something is stripping air bubbles out of my ear tube like you would strip some peas.

Something is up with my facial nerve and it's dtysfunctioning due to anxiety. I need to get my head straight because this has been going on for 4 years now."
1415,why do i feel so much like my dad?,"so, I'm 16 and from the age of around 9-15 my dad was really bad with his anger and stuff. he would yell at me and hit me and throw me and he would go on tangents and scream at my mom and stuff. i started to hate him and even though he's better now i still kinda hate him. i feel bad for hating him now because he's not like he used to be. Anyways, I always feel like im the reincarnation of my dad. i hardly even know myself. when i look in the mirror I think about how much I look like my dad. when i had sex for the first time I felt so dirty because I felt like my dad having sex and it grossed me out. When i am mean to my mom I say to myself ""I'm just like him"" afterwards. i feel it's almost inevitable that I am exactly like my dad. I have depersonalization pretty badly and I honestly don't even know who or what I am anymore."
1416,I just had the freakiest thing happen to me.," I was in bed and I was scrolling through Reddit (coincidentally about sleep paralysis). I can't explain this but it was like going through sleep paralysis but I pushed it away before it happened. I wasn't going to sleep or waking up in a dream. What happened?

I remember thinking ""I'm so scared, I don't want to go into sleep paralysis ever again"" then that happened.

It. Was. Terrifying."
1417,I don’t have a friend who I can trust and confide in.,"I don’t know what is wrong with me. I have friends who I hang out really closely with and talked about random things without feeling being judged. But deep down in my mind, it is just another friendship that I would come if I wants to have some fun. When I was busy with my life, I didn’t see my friends for almost a year (some even more). Everything to me is just kinda come and go. I feel like a a selfish person. But simultaneously. 3:00 AM, in the morning, I’m sitting in the bathroom, writing this wondering why I’m so lonely why my husband is in our bedroom. I don’t have anybody whom I can feel trust, whom I can show my vulnerable side. I rarely feel stressed out about anything, but also I don’t often do things to entertain myself. I would also feel life as it is, not much up and down for me, but moments like this make me once again realize, I really have nobody."
1418,I’m going insane and this pandemic is only making it 10x worse!,"I’ve been battling with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 2 years now. The main reason for these thoughts is that I choose to distance myself from my alcoholic father, he was such a great dad and always super supportive. I now know that my whole family on his side is mad with me for running away from my problems, I can’t see myself wanting to see him or any of my family members anytime soon and it kills me inside. I am now living with my mom and younger sister, my moms side of the family is just my grandparents and my Unkle, I’ve lost all my family connections and I’m really in pain. I’m living with so much constant regret and self hate, everyday is a real struggle. I’ve also recently lost my bf from an overdose, the whole situation is a living nightmare! The amount of fakeness in this world makes me sick to my stomach, everyone around me is acting like they were always there for my bf when they really weren’t. I’ve recently lost weight when I had no weight to loose and I’ve now lost fat under and next to both of my eyes which has just made me want to kill myself even more. Nothing in this cruel world makes me happy or to continue going through all this pain. I know how much pain and sadness my family would feel if I were to harm myself and that’s the only thing that’s keeping me alive rn. I’ve lost all my friends due to depression and just being too lazy for them I assume. I can’t motivate myself to do really anything anymore and it’s really not good, I’m so skinny and unhealthy looking at this point. I’ve been in a daze for many years and I just haven’t been present at all. I have lost almost all my interests and hobbies I feel so boring and bland. Really considering overdosing atm and that’s why I’m writing this, expecting someone to comment “it will all get better soon” but it really won’t and I’m sure of it. I’ll be surprised if I make it to 2021 at this point. Someone please help me I’m miserable, fragile and scared."
1419,"Help for my father, how do I start this conversation?","My father is a Vietnam vet 70 years of age and has been out of work due to pain for 10+ years. Unfortunately he is a victim of the opioid crisis and has been prescribed mass amounts of drugs over the last 10 years to deal with his pain. In the past few months when speaking with him he seems sound minded but still I can tell that COVID situation has compounded a lot of things in which he has struggled to deal with mentally. I am currently overseas and cannot offer much besides video chat, but would like to know how to proceed with finding him help like therapy or psychiatric care."
1420,I have nothing important to say,"But if all you did today was hold yourself together, I'm proud of you."
1421,Nightmares have become tiresome.,"I used to just not have dreams. At least, not that I could remember. Now, I have them quite often and they're usually nightmares. Friends dying, me dying, me being attacked or in horrible situations... I feel it all as if it were happening. It is real in my mind, pain included. I move in my sleep a lot and have disrupted my partners sleep as well as damaged things. I'm afraid I'll hurt them at some point while dreaming of fending for my life. 

I don't scream when I wake or even feel panicked anymore... It's just... Normal... I wouldn't even care if it did not disrupt my partner... 

What do I do?.."
1422,Sometimes I wish I weren't smart,"Over the last year, I've said many times ""I wish a piano would just fall upon me from above, hit me on my head and make me stupid"". 
Sometimes I'm really tired of thinking. Over thinking. Thinking my side, their side. A third viewer's side. My subjective opinion on something. Someone's objective opinion on something. My behaviour, my thoughts: what form these, what past events. Which memories have significantly contributed to what I am now? How many things that I can't recall right now could have been vital for my current self? What do I miss? Why did I say that or why did I act this way? Could this mean that X past event has influenced me in a way that I ended up behaving like this? How should I act? Humans are not flawless. I have flaws. Should I act based on what I feel doing, or should I act based on the objective, hypothetic third viewer's point of view of what should be done?

Do I feel what I feel or should I recognise that what I feel is because of a trauma, and force myself to feel the ""correct"" feeling one should have? Ok this last sentence doesn't sound good. But I've thought of that. 

Sometimes I feel like everything is like an experiment. Do this and observe if it will work, what kind of effect it will have. What answers can I get from the results? About me? 

I'm trying to find who I am I think.. 

I think that I have the ability of viewing something from many point of views. But that makes me so tired sometimes. 

I just wish I was ""normal"". Not think too much, not care about things that I do. 

Sometimes I wonder, am I crazy? Am I schizophrenic? Am I depressed? Am I normal? Am I too clever for my own good? Do I need meaningful aims in my life to pour into my energy instead of overthinking my own creation?

I read somewhere that when the mind wonders aimlessly, it becomes its own trap. Sometimes I feel like this.

Thank you if you got till the end."
1423,I think some of my repressed memories are resurfacing..(TW:Sexual assault),"A few days ago, there was a massive controversy surrounding rape threats on instagram in my country. This piece of media had left me quite unsettled and was on my mind for a really long time. 

Then, a few fragments of a memory started resurfacing in my mind surrounding a stranger showing me his private parts. In this memory, I am very young and seem to be unaffected by what was happening to me. Perhaps because i was unaware of what was happening at the time. Thankfully, it didn't lead to direct sexual contact but i remember this small memory with a lot of detail(I even remember what clothes that i was wearing). The more that i thought about it,I realised that this was not an isolated incident and I have been sexually harassed a few times after that as well(not by the same person). But for some reason, this is the first time that such a thought has even crossed my mind. Yet, i remember this happening to me so very clearly now.

I started looking into repressed memories and there is no definitive scientific proof that such a concept is even real. But on further research, I found out that i had previously displayed behaviour that is often connected to childhood trauma like disordered eating, being emotionally distant, being uncomfortable with touch, just to name a few. Have any of you experienced similar things?

Sorry for the long post.

TLDR: Sudden resurfacing of possible childhood trauma for the first time and your experiences and thoughts surrounding it."

1425,Mental Health - Tips and Quotes,"# Anger

Anger, also known as wrath or rage, is an intense emotional state involving a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat.

**Tip: Sublimation**

Sublimation is a mature defence mechanism, which involves transforming unwanted impulses into something more productive and less harmful. A good example would be to take up running, a sport, or martial arts as a way to express frustration or anger in a more healthy way.

Just about any form of physical activity, sport, or creative expression could be classed as sublimation, and it’s highly recommend that you have at least of of these outlets, particular if you frequently experience anger problems.

Here’s a few ideas: running, cycling, boxing, marital arts, football, basketball, rugby, weight lifting, painting, writing music, etc.

**Quotes**

&gt;“Don’t waste your time in anger, regrets, worries, and grudges. Life is too short to be unhappy."" \~ Roy T. Bennett  
&gt;  
&gt;“Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die"" \~ Unknown  
&gt;  
&gt;“If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow."" \~ Chinese Proverb

# Anxiety

Anxiety is a common mental health problem, which is prevalent throughout the world and can be really serious in some cases. Studies show that more than 1 in 10 people will develop a disabling anxiety disorder at some stage in their life.

**Tip: Breathing**

Square breathing is a simple technique which involves taking slow, deep breaths. It is good for stress reduction, and can increase performance and concentration.

To start, visualise a square, then follow the instructions going clockwise:

1) Breathe in for 4 seconds picturing one side of the square.

2) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the second side of the square.

3) Breathe out over 4 seconds visualising the third side of the square.

4) Hold your breath for 4 seconds visualising the fourth side of the square.

This exercise should be completed as many times as required for the breathing to become calm and regular.

**Quotes**

&gt;“The root of all suffering is attachment."" \~ Buddha  
&gt;  
&gt;“Fear is excitement without the breath."" \~ Fritz Perls  
&gt;  
&gt;“You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf."" \~ Jon Kabat-Zinn

# Depression

Depression is a common mental health problem, which can be really serious, and is prevalent throughout the world. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.

**Tip: Exercise**

Regular exercise has been shown to help lower the effects of depression. This is due to several reasons including:

1. Taking our mind off worries - Rather than ruminating about problems, being proactive can help to distract us from negative cycles of thinking.

2. Releasing endorphins - feel good chemicals in the brain which can enhance our sense of well-being.

3. Confidence - you are actively trying to improve yourself, and becoming fitter at the same time, so you are naturally going to feel better about yourself.

4. Social interaction - joining the gym, going for a run in the park, or joining a sports team may introduce you to other like minded people.

# Loneliness

Loneliness is the reaction to physical isolation, or perceived isolation and alienation in the presence of other people. It can cause a variety of unpleasant emotional responses, and can increase the risk of a number of health problems.

**Tip 1: Prioritise Intimacy**

A sense of loneliness doesn’t just come from not being around people physically, but from a lack of true connection and intimacy.

**Tip 2: Embrace authenticity**

Perhaps you feel lonely because you have become a stranger to yourself by denying your true authenticity. Risk being more real with yourself and to others.

**Tip 3: Real conversations**

Talk more about things that are real, important, and meaningful to you, rather than shallow and generic small talk.

**Quotes**

&gt;“Risk being seen in all your glory."" \~ Jim Carrey  
&gt;  
&gt;“To find real peace you have to let the armour go. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world."" \~ Jim Carrey  
&gt;  
&gt;“Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone."" \~ Paul Tillich

# Self-esteem

Self-esteem is defined as ""confidence in one's own worth or abilities; self-respect"". In Psychology, it is usually described as ""a person's overall sense of self-worth or personal value; how much you appreciate and like yourself.""

**Tip 1: The Practice Of Living Consciously**

Living consciously means being aware of the reasons behind our actions; being aware of the consequences of our actions; to analyse our goals and our values in order to be sure that are actually ours and not goals and values imposed to us by external influences such as our family.

**Tip 2: The Practice Of Self-Acceptance**

Self-Acceptance means accepting one’s body, thoughts, emotions and actions, and it is more than simply approve, it is living fully one’s own choices.

**Quotes**

&gt;“You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."" \~ Sharon Salzberg  
&gt;  
&gt;“Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are."" \~ Marilyn Monroe

# Self-harm

Self-harm, or self-injury, is the intentional, direct injuring of your body. It is also sometimes calling self-mutilation or cutting. It is usually done as a way of dealing with painful feelings and memories, or difficult and overwhelming situations.

**Tip: Emotional Literacy**

Being able to feel your emotions, accurately describe them, understand them, and communicate them to others is an invaluable life skill, and those who self-harm would greatly benefit from developing emotional literacy.

According to Claude Steiner, ""to be emotionally literate is to be able to handle emotions in a way that improves your personal power and improves the quality of life around you.""

The following three steps should allow you to begin to develop your emotional literacy:

1) Define - What feeling or emotion am I experiencing right now? Say this out loud or write it down. (You can use this feelings wheel as a guide http://feelingswheel.com)

2) Expand - Begin to develop a more nuanced and detailed description of what you are currently feeling. Is it just sadness or is there fear as well? Is the anger mingled with fear? What is underneath the anxiety?

3) Action - Write down a series of steps that may help you to avoid whatever caused you to feel this way, and begin to think about more healthy and mature ways to deal with, and express these feelings.

**Quotes**

&gt;""Don’t make a permanent decision for your temporary emotion."" \~ Unknown  
&gt;  
&gt;""Unspeakable feelings need to find expression in words. However... verbalization of very intense feelings may be a difficult task."" \~ James A. Chu  
&gt;  
&gt;""Self-destructiveness may be a primary form of communication for those who do not yet have ways to tame their excruciating inner conflicts and feelings and who cannot yet turn to others for support."" \~ James A. Chu

# Suicidal Feelings

Suicide is the intentional taking of your own life, which invariably is preceded by suicidal thoughts and feelings. This post aims to address and shed some light on this difficult but important health problem.

**Tip: Safety Plan**

If you have experienced suicidal feelings before, or perhaps have made previous attempts, it is strongly recommended that you make a safety plan. A safety plan is a personalised plan to support you step-by-step at times when you may be thinking about suicide.

\- List of warning signs

\- Coping strategies (what have you tried in the past which helped)

\- Contact details of loved ones

\- Contact details of support services

\- List of favourite things (memories, music, people, places etc.)

\- List of future goals and possibilities

\- Steps to make the environment safe, or the details of another safe place you could visit

(Write out this plan when you are feeling well and are able to think clearly. You could discuss this plan with a therapist of trusted friend if you feel that would help)

**Quotes**

&gt;""Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better."" \~ Jim Rohn  
&gt;  
&gt;“Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise."" \~ Victor Hugo  
&gt;  
&gt;“When you feel like giving up, just remember the reason why you held on for so long."" \~ Unknown

1427,just thinking about posting this on my IG stories," 

do you think is this accurate? [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXVLDk2UcAE\_gxz?format=png&amp;name=900x900](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXVLDk2UcAE_gxz?format=png&amp;name=900x900)

&amp;#x200B;

or just got too annoying?"
1428,My Diagnosis,"So I am now diagnosed with: SchizoAffective Disorder (BiPolar), Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, Anxiety, and Compex PTSD. So, uh, where should I start with dealing with it?"
1429,Problem Awareness,"Mental Health affects lots of people it doesn't matter how old you are, it will affect anyone. Meantal Health starts from people getting bullied in primary school, high school and collegue, people talking about your body size, what you look like and the race you are, your sexually and traumatic events can cause this as well to anything really. The more this happens the more you will start to get depression, anxiety, bipolar, dementia, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, obessive complusive disorder (OCD), autism and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

I haven't personal experience any of these mental health that I mention but I have/had friends who are going through and had these experience I have mention, knowing and having a friend who have been/going through this, it's just really hard to see because you don't know how much you are helping them. All of those mental health I have mention before can lead to suicide thoughts for most people, if they are constantly getting bullied about what they look like, their weight, race and sexually this will make start to make them feel so unwanted and that they aren't good enough for anyone so this will lead to them having suicide thoughts telling themselves that they aren't good enough, that they don't belong to be here, things would be so much better if I wasn't here.

Suicide/ self harm are a very close topics to my heart because 800,000 people died every year from suicide, suicide will start from any of the mental health I have previous mention, when someone is bullying you about your weight, race and sexually you will start to feel so worthless, tell yourself that you aren't good enough and the world would be so much better if I wasn't in it, self harm will start when someone tells you that you don't look good enough about what you are wearing or what your body looks like. People shouldn't discrimanate about what others look like most people bully each other to make themselves feel better or to show off to their friends.

Girls would get bullied about what they wear, if their make up looks good or not, if there fake tan is good or not, about their weight and sexually most girls would self harm because they are feeling so worthless because what other girls are saying about them and what other girls are saying about their backs. Suicide and self harm are very serious I would stay up the whole night to talk someone in ending their life they just have so much to live for. When you have self care some cuts can be deep and you go into hospital for them and you know that those cuts will be there with you forever  traumatic events can cause you to have suicide thoughts and start to harm yourslef.

Guys would get bullied because they aren't tough enough, have abs, muscles like other guys, they would get bullied at school because they don't fit in and they so self concious that they never wanna take off their shirts because they know other guys will start to put them down because you have like no abs or muscle. This can effect most guys so much because this will just start to bring down their self-esteem and they never wanna be around other guys because he would get judged or bullied because he isn't big like the other guys.

I had a really good mate who had depression because he got bullied so much in high school, the kids who were bullying him they would follow him home, bash him at school he told me that one time he was walking home from school a couple of boys jumped at him and stabbed him. He would always say Heidi I'm in so much pain and I just want all of this pain to go away and I ask him are you thinking about sucide thoughts and he said yes and I asked him why? he said Heidi I just want all these pains to go away. So pretty much the next day when I was at school I saw on his instagram that he tried to jump off a cliff, but he broke his leg and broke his neck he was in hospital for weeks I didn't hear from him so I started to get worried I didn't know if he was Okay or not then he message me saying Heidi I'm Okay, I just didn't have my phone with me.

Then 3weeks later he got realised out of hospital I kept checking up on him seeing if he was Okay, I said if you need anyone to talk to I'm here for you, every night I would stay up trying to convince him that he was worthy to be alive and that his family would miss him if he was gone.
The next day I went to school I messaged him before I left to go catch the bus for school, the whole time I was at school I was worried about what he could be doing, if he was Okay, when I got home I messaged him straight away seeing if he was Okay but I got no respond for about 4hrs I started to get more worried then I got a message from a friend saying that he didn't go to school, that he jumped in front of a moving train, at that point when I got that message he knew he was gone forever and that he would never have to go through this pain anymore.
It's Okay to not be Okay and you should NEVER be ashamed to talk to anyone about what your struggling with, I know it's hard to open up to a stranger about what you're struggling with but leaving in fear and not being able to talk to anyone about it, just make's it so much harder to talk about it.

 Men who struggle with mental health they can   struggle a lot more with it because people think men are brave and they can't be vulnerable because if they show weakness or fear they aren't a real man anymore, every man out there deserves to be heard, they struggle as much as we all do.

Having/ knowing people out there that are going through mental health by themselves it just hurt's me so much because no one is like checking up on them and feel are just feel so alone because they have no one. 
It's Okay to NEVER be Okay and NEVER be ashamed to rant or cry about what you are going through at all, menatl health is a very close topic to my heart because I've already lost lost 2 very amazing guy friends in my life, you should NEVER give up on someone who is struggling even if they say they are Okay just keep letting them know that you are going to be there for them, you just can't give up on them because if you do, you feel like a failure and that you didn't do much to help them sometimes it's just to late.

ALWAYS  check up on your friends, even the ones that smile and make other people smile when they walk into a room, behind every smile and close door those people can be going through something very tough, always reach out to them and check up on them if they are Ok, even the ones that say they are fine, they really aren't fine, NEVER leave it until it's to late check up on them because you could have done something to STOP IT.

 I have lost another beauitful friend to suicide, NEVER leave it to late. Suicide is a hard topic to talk about with some people but it's really good to aslo talk about it look out for your mates, one day they can be gone just like that keep them close, keep checking up on them even when they tell you are they are fine, they just might find it really hard to tell you what is happening with them so they will tell you they are fine people who struggle with mental health find it very hard to reach out and ask for help you just need to give them a push and be there for them.

Suicide is a big topic, it's Okay not to be Okay always reaching out for help is a good start, but opening up it's really tough, I want to prevent other people from getting to the point where they just can't do it anymore. Young teenagers usually struggle a lot more with suicide but they tell everyone that are they fine and everyone just leaves themsleves because they don't keep pushing asking if they are really Okay.

If anyone needs to talk about anything I have talked about and opened up about I will be here menatal health is a very close topic to my heart because I've already lost 2 beautiful amazing friends to this, NEVER STOP checking up on your mates or even people you don't know, even by just talking to them and telling them they are beautiful, amazing and that they shouldn't take their lives that makes them feel so much comfortable, NEVER GIVE UP ON CHECKING ON SOMEONE OR PUSHING TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN GOOD HANDS &amp; THAT THEY ARE SAFE."
1430,Any coming back from rock bottom mental health?,"I've been looking for an avenue to talk about my feelings on for some time now and recently just came across this sub reddit. 

I have been having a really tough time lately staying motivated and positive. I'm only in my late 20's and I already feel like I've lived a life time. Alcoholic parents, sexually abusive brother, bullying at school and losing a child are just some of the many many things I've had to deal with. I've had my heart broken countless times and I feel lonely 24/7. I used to find a lot of solace in being alone and doing things I enjoy but even that is meaningless these days. Most of my days since the lockdown started involve sleeping or staring aimlessly out the window. I feel like alot of the time my brains on autopilot and completely disconnected from the rest of me. 

I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to who understands my pain and that in itself is perpetuating the impending feeling of hopelessness. How do I turn it around? My entire life has been a complete battle and I don't have the will to fight anymore. How does a person carry on in life having experienced all this? It seems unlikely I'll ever get to live a normal life. I feel extremely unlucky or like I'm being punished and I just don't know why."

1432,How to deal with social anxiety,"I wanna ask reddit how do you all deal with social anxiety . Like boy if i see someone walking up to me i d rather take my own life than wait there. Once i was given the choice between ordering my own food and leaving the restaurant i legit left the restaurant. 
So pls help .
Thank you"
1433,Is everything real please tell me it is,"Why don’t I feel real why does everyone around me feel fake
 how do I know everyone is real I guess I just have to trust them and trust they’re telling me the  truth but what if they’re lying and they’re all made up and I’m truly alone i don’t wantto be 

am i writing into the void I don’t want to seem self centred but how do I know I’m  not the only person left or the only person alive and this is my coping mechanism for the fact that I’m alone 

what if this is all a stupid dream how do I know that the books I read an the words i read were written by a real person and  not just fragments of my imagination I don’t kknow who I am 
I’m so tired I don’t want to be alone I want to wake up"
1434,The constant fear of death.,"As the title says. Me (25M) and my fiance (23F) have been together for 9 years. Some might say that it is a long time for a young couple to be together but I feel like I only met her yesterday. I am constantly reminded that one day I will have to live without her or she without me. I keep thinking that our days together will never be enough. One day one of us will wake up without the other. I realise that this day might not be for another 40, 50 or even 60 years but I fear it like nothing else.   


I would really appreciate an opinion from someone who can relate or had to deal with this?"
1435,"All online screening tests suggest mild to moderate depression. Delay in Immigration documents, financial issues, feelings for a friend, all together is creating a havoc in my mental health. Want to rant my feelings out.","I  am an international student living in Canada. I graduated from a  Canadian university in January. I was supposed to get my study permit by  march (normal processing times) which would have allowed me to get work  permit right away. I had savings for 5-6 months and had a job offer in  hand. I was to start my job as soon as I got my work permit.

But  now, it is already May, and I can't work till I get the permit. I can't  return to my home country as my application is getting processed and my  country's under lockdown. I am basically stuck.

The visa issues, the monetary issues due to the current situation is creating havoc in my mind.

I  also have feelings for one of my friends. But I can't tell her till I  am sure the feeling is not a byproduct of my stress. I admired her since  2017. Started having feelings for her since February.

I have never been to a therapist before. But online mental health tests suggest that I have moderate depression now.

My parents or my friends know nothing about the fireworks going on inside my head. I am feeling lost inside.

I hope everything's would work out fine in the end. Rant over."
1436,i’ve never been diagnosed.,"so basically for the past year or two i’ve been feeling very differently, and i’ve taken a lot of online tests, (i know that’s not a good way to figure out if you have any mental disorders, but i needed something that explained what i was feeling) the tests suggested that i had severe anxiety and depression. and i don’t really know much about mental illnesses but i feel like i haven’t really had many “experiences” to like, i guess trigger, those illnesses. but if any mental health expert would like to reach out and help me i would really appreciate it. thank you all and don’t forget to stay hydrated :)"
1437,How should I talk to my therapist about self harm and suicide,
1438,Do I have OCD ?," I used to live with my older sister for few years who had severe anorexia. 

She would down a box of laxatives everyday and do nothing but diarrhea 24/7. 

That explosive farting sound, the splattering of brown fecal liquid , her jumping up and running to the bathroom ... it was horrific. I literally felt like my life was a pile of shit. We were living in this shit storm hurricane. 

Of course she never cleaned up the splattered shit liquid . It was either me ,mom or dad. 

I used to clean the toilet 4-5 times a day/.  I'd lift up the toilet seat to see if there is any splattered shit.  I just wanted to make the sight and sound of SHIT just to stop. 

We lived like this for 4-5 years . 

Now I live alone.  Yet every time I see anything that reminds me of diarrhea - I can;t stop the urge to clean it .

Ex. 1 :  A tenant's dog accidentally peed in the elevator and nobody cleaned it up. I literally felt like someone pissed on me and my life. I take photos and text my super.  

Ex. 2 : I wiped the hallway with bleach yesterday because someone leaked while taking out their trash. There was pungent liquid on the floor and it smelled like rotten fish, urine and even vagina. 

The odor was so strong . I felt like I pay a high rent I should not have to live in a stinky place.  I called my super and he said the cleaning person will be here on Sunday. So I sprayed bleach on the fishy liquid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why are some people able to simply walk over and ignore a pile of piss and for me I am so personally offended by it ? I literally feel like someone pissed or shit on my life."
1439,We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,"
I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‘feeling depressed’ or a bit ‘anxious’ is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don’t have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too “other people have it so much worse than me” or “im just over exaggerating.” This is not how things should be. People shouldn’t have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who’s lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ❤️


PS. Mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more. I just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many. Thank you for reading!"
1440,What constitutes having PTSD?,"Long story short, I was thrown in juvie, put into a psych ward, and put on a six month probation for a crime I was framed for when I was 17.

It ruined a couple years of my life. I wasnt allowed on school property, so I had to go to an alternative school. That place was full of the worst kids id ever seen. Kids who deserved to be there.

Then there was the psych ward, which was honestly the worst couple weeks of my life.

Now, I'm scared around police, I can't trust anyone with any kind of authority, and to top it all off, I missed out on my senior year of highschool.

I didn't realize how bad it hurt until I was watching deadman Wonderland (A series in which the main character was framed for murder), and I just saw similarities in how things went down, and I couldn't help but cry.

I don't know if I should look into going to a psychologist. The last time I was in a mental facility it was genuinely mental hell.

What do you think?"
1441,My inner critic doesn't give me any breathing room.,"Hi all, I've been struggling with my mental health for a few months now, I'm incredibly hard on myself and don't really give myself any self love or compassion. I went through a breakup and my initial response was to go emotionless, to hide away from my feelings basically, and the relationship itself was pretty toxic because of my low self esteem. 

I went to a therapist to help me out with all of this and in one of our early sessions I mentioned I'm terrified I'm a narcissist with no redeeming qualities. He sort of smiled an empathetic smile and explained for around 1-2 minutes why he was confident I wasn't one. I haven't been able to go to any sessions recently because of covid and it's just building up in me. What if he's wrong? I really don't want to live a life characterised by manipulation and a lack of connection. I just play this narrative over and over in my head and I feel it's holding me back from making progress towards a healthier lifestyle. 

I don't really know why I'm sharing this I guess I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm aware of the parts of my personality that need work but I'm just terrified I'll never be able to grow emotionally and this fear is what's keeping me from actually making changes that would eradicate the fear. Anybody experienced anything similar?"
1442,A title to know.,"Hi everyone. Is there anyone who knows more or has experienced the Rebecca syndrome? If you would tell your story or at least tell me if it's a thing, it would be very much appreciated."

1445,"We're doing a video series making mental health advice actionable, what do you think?","Therapy changed my life over a decade ago when I was reeling, depressed, and anxious from a breakup. I have a fundamental belief that it can change anyone else's, even if they don't think they need it.

At the same time, I think most people don't understand therapy, and don't understand the value they can get from it. And even though it's becoming more accessible, it's still inaccessible to most whether it's for monetary or social reasons.

Since I'm a video producer, I decided to make a video series making mental health advice clear, actionable, and entertaining. The idea is that we have therapists and coaches provide me and my friend with one ""challenge"" to improve our mental health, that can be done without supervision. Then we film ourselves trying that out for a week and document the results. 

I'm curious what y'all think about some of them. I'll share one and drop the rest in a comment.

1447,8 Ways To Protect Your Mental Health In A Time Of Crisis,https://lifestyle.pinasbalita.org/protect-your-mental-health-in-a-crisis/
1448,Living with the aftermath of abuse. How to stop emotional breakdowns or violent thoughts ?,"Hi, this is my first time posting here. I need help with something, but I feel like I have to explain the situation a bit more so that it makes sense.  

I'm 21 now and was physically and emotionally hurt as a child and teenager by my parents. I'm very emotional and cry easily especially when I'm under stress. I never understood why. I never talked to a mental health professional about it either.

Today my parents had an argument about something minor (me not wanting to open the door to a stranger and it turns out it was some company guy of my father's.)  and when I tried to explain my mother had none of it. My mother has a ""furious screaming"" type of anger. Her anger can be calmed when I bring up truths like it was 7 am, I was alone, in my pajamas and I didn't know this man standing at the doorstep.

None of that works with my father. He is silent, but stares me down the entire time. As soon as I tell them my side, he raises his voice and shuts me up instantly. My mother watches on. In tense moments I get very scared and get a lump in my throat. The entire time he's speaking I'm holding back tears and have this gut wrenching fear that any second now he's going to stand up and hit me I just know it. Like if I move away or look him in the eyes too long this will trigger him exploding at me. I can't describe how fearful I am in situations like this. There are images in my head flashing in front of me of how he'll  stand up and slap, kick or hurt me. It's just violent imagery of all the ways he can hurt me. I can't make it stop. 

This entire situation felt ridiculous and I let out a sigh and not saying anything and he interpreted it as me thinking this was funny and I almost started weeping right there, but just let him talk and avoided eye contact. At one point he was done and I quietly went to my room. Basically what had happened is that I inconvenienced my father by not opening that door and not telling that guy that my father wasn't there, so my father had to make a call to this other man. That's it. All this because of a phone call. 

Neither of them hurt me this day. I chalked it up to my father thankfully getting older and not being as agile he was when he was younger. Yet I felt just as threatened today as when I was a kid and didn't know better when to shut up. When I was little I made many mistakes and I didn't know how to diffuse situations and got hit easily, because I was dumb and didn't see it coming.

The images in my head worry me. This is the reason I still don't have my licence, because my father is always my co-driver and has to instruct me to drive, but whenever something small happens like the engine dies, he blows up at me and how badly of a driver I am and I just start to weep uncontrollably and can't stop anymore, while I have images in my head of how he'll just grab my hair and smash my head against the steering wheel. I'm crying writing this and I just can't handle thinking about it I'm just so scared of him when he's angry or annoyed. I don't understand it!! He didn't hurt me for a long time but neither the crying nor the images in my head stop. 

Is there any way I can make them stop? I don't want this to happen anymore. I love my father and he isn't mad all the time, but when he is my fear takes over in moments like these. I want to be able to talk to him when he's mad and not immediately crumble. I don't want to be scared of him anymore."
1449,Can someone with a happy childhood still turn out ill?,"I’m still young and I still live with my parents. My parents aren’t apart. They are happy. They’re healthy. They’re supportive of me and my brother. They love each other. I was never been beaten as a child. I wasn’t abused. We’re not poor. We’re middle class.
Because of this I can never accept me having any kinds of mental illnesses. But I still have this desperate self hatred. I harm myself to cope with it. I isolate myself. I have self destructing habits.
I have unhealthy coping mechanisms. It feels like I’m faking it all. It feels like I’m disrespecting people who have ‘real’ problems. It feels like I don’t ‘deserve’ to have depression. (That wasn’t the right word but you get me)"
1450,I'm hangry and depressed,"I'm a type 2 diabetic and just found out that whole grains make my blood glucose way too high. Whole grains are usually touted as great replacements to refined grains but they don't work for me. So do some fruits.

So I'm stuck starving myself with cheese, meat, eggs, and veggies. On top of that I can't have any comfort foods when I feel depressed.

I'm just smh. What's the point of this meandering, grueling existence when you have depression and can't even have a slice of cake? Or a damn sandwich. All to die in the end anyways."
1451,I created a support server to study during isolation,"I did a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ge5dx6/support_group_to_get_our_degrees_you_may_need_this/) yesterday about a study server  where we could have videochats, no audio and no faces, in order to create a virtual space similar to a library.

It will be focused on creating a good study habit and be mindful about it, also on mental health support regarding study anxiety. The plan is to be held accountable by other members, and to have a safe space where we just hop in and mind our business (you should shoot your textbooks and nothing else), and in case share knowledge, tips, links etc. I am posting it here because I do think it helps to share during isolation.

We will have sessions planned each day, and you **have to partecipate everyday**, 5 mins or 5 hours? Both are ok. Other than that you will share your goals and we'll help to plan, and we could support each others, if we are on a slump, a panic attack, a depressive episode or just feeling unmotivated.I am from EU, and in uni, but everyone is welcome!

1452,How to deal with the fact that life has no meaning?,"I can’t get this off my mind for a few years now. 

Considering the hugeness of the universe and how humans have existed for less than a moment in comparison to the 13,8 billion years the universe already exists, you won’t change my mind that we are meaningless from that perspective.

I do know that many people believe it is our job to give our lives a meaning, and I think that makes sense in a way. That the meaning of life is to give it a meaning.

However, even though I somehow agree with that, I can’t get myself to really believe in it. I really tried, but I still don’t see the point in working so hard every day of my life if it never pays off. Yes, there are some moments when I feel happy. But everything else isn’t really worth them. 

How do I deal with that? Is anything wrong with me or is this something everybody thinks about and just chooses to ignore it most of the time?"
1453,I don’t know what to do anymore 2: electric boogaloo,I’ve been really struggling lately and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’ve been cutting more and more often and I know someone’s going to find out if I don’t do something about it

1455,Loosing weight on Sertraline,"Diagnosis: Depression and Social Anxiety.

I am a beanpole. Also quite restless, jumpy and agitated.

I've been prescribed Sertraline to deal with it. I've lost 11 lbs (143 lbs -&gt; 132 lbs) when going up to 50mg, and another 9 lbs (132 lbs -&gt; 123 lbs) when titrating up to 100mg. I've got down to 75mg and regained 5 lbs, but having difficulties to regain more mass. Also the heightened restlessness and agitation kills me. I think that it might be due to Sertraline's Dopamine and SIGMA properties, but not sure. For sure is that I am loosing too much weight Auschwitz-style.

It does help somewhat with Depression and Anxiety, makes me content, but the indifference to anything and everything is unsettling."

Evanston Hospital,1973-75

As a young lad I spent time there as a guest.
After suffering a major trauma in my life.
This place and the people I met there saved my life.

1457,i need help,"Im a 21 year old female college student. my mental health has completely deteriorated beyond my control and i need help. i dont know what to do. i cry every day at least 4 times a day uncontrollable. i cry any time i have to talk about my emotions. i feel so fucking empty and sad all the time. i dont want to exist anymore. the past 7 weeks ive been living back with my parents who are as supportive as they can be but deep down do not believe there is anything wrong with me. i feel judged every time i confide in them and i hear them talk about me every single night when they think im asleep. i usually end up crying myself to sleep because of it. i am a horrible student. i have been my entire life. im smart but i have an inabiliy to focus in class and procrastinate everything. i also hate my major and get seriously depressed thinking of the fact that i have to do math for the rest of my life (my dad made me chose it). most days at school i cant even get out of bed until 4 in the afternoon. however now that i have moved home i get woken up every morning bright and early. the only problem is that my anxiety keeps me awake until around 3 am most nights. i havent slept in weeks. i also stopped eating a few weeks ago. i cant even look at food without becoming physically sick. i force feel myself so i dont die or pass out. i also have anger issues and ive had them my entire life. ive never been treated for anything other than seeing a therapist twice for anxiety however i stopped seeing her after i realized i was zoning out everything she said and didnt remember anything after appointments, and i realized i couldnt open up to her about most of the things in my life bc i was too scared to talk about them. i cant go to my friends bc im always a happy cheerful person when theyre around and they would never take me seriously. i called my doctor the other day about seeing another psychologist but she hasnt gotten back to me yet to set up an appointment. i feel there is no one in the world i can go to. i feel so alone. i can not exist like this. this morning i gave my senior project presentation in front of the entire math department and had a mental breakdown and cried in front of everyone. i also had a horrible project because i procrastinated it so much."

I have some objects/situations in mind, and I'm curious for your input on how you, as a person with OCD, would interact with the objects. That could mean how you use it, how you would store it when it's not in use, and anything out of the ordinary (excuse me if that's offensive. I don't mean to) that you would do with the object.

1460,Zero motivation,"Been having issues with having no motivation for anything these last few months. Whether it’s getting out of bed, cleaning, cooking, even finishing a 5 hr shift at my part time job feels like it’s not worth it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or how to even get over it. Also doesn’t help that I can’t really talk to anyone about this since everyone I’ve bothered to talk to just shrugs it off as me being lazy. I feel like I’m at a dead end, wandering in an abyss I can’t get myself  out of. Any advice please."
1461,Schoolwork,"When the lockdown first started I was actually kinda on top of schoolwork but since I spent 12 hours straight doing work I lost all motivation and stopped doing as much work. Now I’ve got so much work I have no motivation to do any more of it , especially since a lot of it I don’t understand and 1 of my 3 subjects I hate doing.

On top of this I know I should be going to the gym (I.e my garage) but I have no motivation to do that either, and see it and more of a ‘chore’ than anything (idk how else to word that lol)

And when I should be doing stuff I just get distracted and go on reddit or play videogames, and I constantly feel deflated and demotivated to do anything; even getting out of bed.

I know this is probably all stupid of me but I’m just panicking so much and idk what to do with life anymore."

Any advice or idea what it could be? 

I've had this a few days ago then I felt alright for a day but it came again yesterday. I don't think it's depression because it was only a few days. 
Could it be some sort of small burnout? I've school from home and I was really productive in the beginning but one day my drive to work was just completely dead out of nowhere. I eat pretty healthy and I work out but still feel like a mess mentally. 

Any help would be really appreciated."
1463,Mental Health and the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Wondering if any of y’all that have dealt with mental health issues like depression, PTSD, anxiety have felt a sense of calm in the chaos the pandemic created. I have been dealing with all the above for about a decade and when the world suddenly stopped and panic ensued I found myself curiously able to ground myself amidst all the uncertainties.

1466,Should I go to a psychiatrist or my PCP for anxiety?,"I have had anxiety all my life and I have always seen pediatric psychiatrists and my mother has made my appointments and gone with me. My doctor ended up moving 4 years ago and I never got a new doctor, so I have not been on medication or anything for 4 years. It was okay at first but I have very bad anxiety now and I think I would benefit from taking medication again. I’m 24 now and I’m making my own appointments obviously. I have a PCP who I have only seen twice. Once for a birth control prescription and once for a school physical. I have not been there in over a year, she just refills my prescription when I request it. 

So my question is, should I make an appointment with her (my PCP) and discuss my anxiety and see what she recommends? Or should I go directly to a psychiatrist? I would rather go to my PCP because I’m paying out of pocket and I think it would be less expensive, but I’m just worried they’re going to think it’s weird for me to go in there only for anxiety. Do people normally go to their PCP about anxiety? And can they even prescribe anti anxiety meds?"
1467,Questionnaires or guides to help articulate how you feel?,"Hello, I do not post often but I was hoping to get some help. I speak to multiple doctors and cannot fully articulate how i feel.

He used violence to force me to perform sex acts on me. If I tried to resist, he would drag me down the stairs by the foot, or kick and punch me, one time he held my head under water in the bathtub. This happened at least twice a week when he would put him in charge of babysitting my siblings. I was also abused by a family friend from the ages of 12-14, when I told my parents that he was abusing me, they immediately when to the police, when I told my parents about my brother they shut down and refused to go to the police, they continued to have my brother around me and expected me to go to therapy, and get over it so they could pretend it never happened, I’m 25 now and it still affects me most days, I am trying to set some basic boundaries that my brother doesn’t text me in the family group chat. I told him to stop texting me and he is still contacting me. Everyone wants me to just shut up about the rape because it ruins everyone’s day anytime they have to hear about it. I want to set some boundaries and be left alone. Am I an asshole for setting my foot down?"

1471,Why am i such a fuck up?,I used to be a happy kid always out and then boom the teen years crippled me. I can't even hold a relationship or a friendship without feeling like I'm not even wanted.

1472,What sort of help should I be looking for? Loads to unpack here...,"I'm an Asian American male (east asian) approaching 30.

Growing up was pretty good, until I got to the age where I realised how asian men were perceived in terms of dating and love life. Throughout high school I was mocked by women - I grew up realising that even women from our own race threw us under the bus happily. I basically withdrew and became pretty much a loner. From the desperation brought on by the realisation of how society looks at us, I got into my first serious relationship which turned out to be abusive, and that ended up setting off a whole chain of events. Ended up having to leave the US as the only conceivable way out, and had to work my way through alot of anger at what happened.

Almost a decade later, I've worked my way to the top of society in a completely foreign European country - degree from their top university, job at one of the most prestigious multinationals, own property, the works. But whilst things on that front couldn't be any better, it's almost as if my mental state has taken a few steps back. I've more than caught up from my past - From being mocked by women for being an Asian man, the tables have turned considerably. However, the anger and resentment has grown - towards Asian and White women in particular. I've had my fair share of sleeping around, I've probably outdone by leaps and bounds the guys I was jealous of in high school and university. The quality of the women I've slept with and dated too since my abusive relationship have been amazing. I've even found myself in a long-term, stable polyamorous arrangement with 2 white women - something that I as an Asian man never thought was possible. Its shitty because I've come to realise that most of my choices in terms of my love and dating life have been to prove something to the world rather than choices I make for myself. Would I have found them attractive if I wasn't told that they being white women were out of my reach? Its shitty because I have come to realise that these 2 women genuinely love me for who I am and accept me for who I am - not as an Asian man, but simply as a man - but yet, while I do love them, I can't see them as individuals; as people - I project my views of women and white people onto them unfairly, and this has become even more intense in light of everything going on with the Coronavirus. I find myself questioning my attraction to them - in what I am doing being with them, am I no better than the Asian women who actively pursue white men? I feel like am a horrible person and I cannot avoid the reality that they are in effect, trophies in my conquests.  This is so, so bad because these two women do not deserve that at all, with everything they have done and given me.

Now that I am settling down in this country, with these women potentially becoming an important, permanent/long-term fixture in my life, I do find myself at a crossroads with these issues.  


There's just so much to unpack here but I am beginning to realise that I will never be happy or satisfied until I get this mental clusterfuck undone. To the professionals and the more experienced members here... where would someone in my shoes even begin? It's one thing getting to the office, sitting down in that chair, but with so much... I'm just really concerned that I start off on the right foot since there really is so much to unpack."
1473,i need some help,"hey everyone im sorry to sound like a sap in advance. ive been struggling w depression for 7 years now since i was 12, im almost 20 now and it has developed further into severe clinical depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, and paranoid bipolar disorder. ive been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend for about 3 years now. recently a few months ago i caught him looking up his ex's and a few other girls on socials and i expressed my concern about it with him, and he assured me nothing is going on. lately ive been noticing him taking his phone everywhere with him, leaving it on DND and recieving calls and texts from unknown numbers, taking his phone to the bathroom and leaving it upside down when placing it in the room so the screen is down. I haven't went through his phone lately because I'm worried that if I find something I will have a mental breakdown and it will hurt me worse than him. hes been displaying all the classic signs of cheating; treating me differently, being overly and underly affectionate at times, changing his attitude and acting weird towards me. I have no proof of him cheating and I keep thinking my gut is giving me the feeling that he is. but it may be my anxiety taking over and giving me false paranoia. idk what to do ive tried to talk to him about it but its not an easy subject to bring up without a fight insuing. i just need some advice on what to do 😔"
1474,Had a harsh breakdown,"I'm a fairly young bipolar schizoaffective, recently medicated. Had a meltdown that resulted in me planning everything out in intense detail so that no one would even know when or how I dissapeared. I was going to kill myself. I rounded up all of my valuables, checked the prices for a cheap ticket to California. I was going to get a cheap raft and all of my favorite foods,a bottle of jack Daniel's, and some raw meat. Then I was going to air it up and take it out into the ocean, eat all my foods, or as much as I could and to it off with the bottle of jack. Pop a hole in the raft and then just be gone without a trace.
I'm having a hard time dealing with all of the stresses of life, after losing multiple jobs due to my illness, both of my vehicles getting wrecked, eviction notices, hospital visits, everyone calling to check up on me constantly. I had a promising future as programmer, I was going to go to college and chase my dreams. It all got crushed, I feel alone, helpless, hopeless, and purposeless. Really, I think what I'm trying to get out of this is someone I can talk to, or someone going through the something similar to just give me those few words to help me stick it through. I want a normal life, badly."
1475,PLEASE READ ALL : What a sad sad life I have to live/ the life of an verbally/mentally/physically abused child,"I’m only 17 man. For a month+ I’ve been getting worrisome symptoms : bumps all over my skin as in face, arms, chest,  (not pimples) ,raised red skin lesions/lines, On and off dizziness and lightheadedness, nausea, flashing lights in vision . My parents completely ignore my symptoms and rather blame it on the fact “I don’t sleep” while I sleep 8 hours every day although it being in the later times like 6 AM , just how every teen is currently no school. I’ve sobbed in front of my parents in extreme fear of my health begging to go to a doctor and they just ignore me, tell me go away, continuing talking on the phone completely ignoring their son sobbing for help. I tried taking matters in my own hands as a plan to seek attention so I can go to a doctor . I slammed and broke my mothers phone her, yeah the same one she continuously ignores her son on , calling family members saying I’m crazy on ( I am nowhere near crazy and very intelligent) When she seen it she said she was going to tell my older brother and causing a big scene , then I started yelling LISTEN TO YOUR SON HES PLEADING FOR HELP AND YOU VALUE YOUR PHONE MORE THAN HIS LIFE. this action resulted in me being whipped with a belt out of my sleep (around 2pm) by my sibling leaving dark lines and scars I still have today. My skin was so puffed up with belt marks after that beating and for what? Because I was seeking attention from a neglectful family. They also took away my PlayStation 4, the only thing that keeps my anxious and suicidal thoughts away (these past 2 weeks without it has been hell, I no longer can get away from my panic attacks about my health , depression and plain loneliness from quarantine. Now when I still plead to go to a hospital/urgent care, my mother says I’m making shit up in effort to get my ps4 back (WTF) my mother came to my room saying she’s gonna get my idiot general practitioner to prescribe me pills to go to sleep at night (obviously subliminally saying I have mental problems and need narcotics/Percocet/xanax type drugs to go to sleep, although me being a regular teenager going to sleep at 6 am like everyone else since there isn’t school so I yelled wtf and punched my door in anger, fed up of the assuming I’m crazy . This punch and hell caused me and my 350lb brother  putting me in a lock and pushing his bodyweight against me  shouting loudly, I put my arm up in defense after he let go assuming he was gonna attack again , and he said put my fucking arm down.. Why? Because I was sick and tired of the way my family views me and reacting in anger how unbelievable this is the way my family views me. They think I am a mentally retarded child even though I’ve been in all honors school classes my whole life, taking 12th grade math in 11th grade etc. I spend hours reading the encyclopedia , something I’ve done since I was in elementary school. The insane amount of knowledge I have . Now i sit here, terrified of what’s wrong with me as I will finally go to a urgent care today and get bloodwork done. I am not crazy. I have health anxiety. My worst fear is death and I have reason to be scared when something is off. I should consider writing a memoir/book"
1476,feeling like a useless human being,"dear readers. 

i don't know what to do. recently i feel again so useless. i can't work thanks to my muscle disease. i can work but not do heavy work or stressful work as it cause my muscles to cramp up and then i start to feel pain and go into hyperventilation what shuts down my muscles for some seconds. doctors will help me live with it and learn to move around, do things proper way. 
my family don't understand this and think always i fake it or don't have it but i live daily in stress,  no idea where it even come from but i live in lots and lots of stress each day. also lots of fears.  fear of nothing, fear of dogs, fear of going out and i can name alot more. i am introvert as a person and that makes it even harder for me as i am scared to talk to strangers as that stress me out alot. 

next what makes me useless and feel like i am worthless is the fact that i want to lay down alot. i feel at  night so heavy in my head that i just want to lay down. the reason for that is also unknown to me. it can maybe be cause of my girlfriend who is working in Kuwait and i hear her not so much as during Ramadan, it is so much work for her there and i worry alot about her. she knows it but she have to work also and so i let her do also. i want to help her and be there for her but i can't cause i am far from her and i am not allowed to get there also. 

i want to do so much but all i do or try fails. i love things and i try alot to work it out, find ways to become good at it but i still can't.  or i get pain in my muscles or after months of practice, i notice i can't get better and i fail. or anything else. there is always a reason why i can't make it work.

i am a perfectionist but also don't have patience enough to get it. or i can do it or i can't.  i am willing to learn and get better but i want to see progress and need someone to pull me up always, someone who is there telling me what i can do better and do good also. some positive vibes cause negativity is allready around me. i blame myself and put myself always so low. i need some positivity but it's hard to find. 

sometimes i wish that i was dead as then i don't give my family such problems as they aren't happy with me. all they do is look down on me, talk bad about me and don't respect me and my issues.  they are even against my girlfriend and my cousin even tried to take her away from me. i have to stay strong and fight for her cause she is there for me, even we are far and she support me but i am sometimes completely exhausted and broken.  i been in depression before and i still have them from time to time. my girlfriend know i have it as she also have depressions sometimes but i didn't tell her what i feel now. i don't want her to know as she have it hard enough allready and i don't want to hurt her. i want to make her happy and have good days during her hard times. i don't want to be the one who will push her into a big depression. i care alot about her and i love her to much to see her suffer. 

i make this post cause i want to write down my feelings. i want everyone to know how useless i am as a human being.  how bad i am and worthless even. how nobody can really respect me as i am a nobody. a bad and weak man. if you can even call me a man. 
i even lose my eye sight sometimes but get it back also.  i get dizzy sometimes but i always get better.  
that's me in a nutshell

Thanks in advance for reading through this and wish you all a good life ahead. may God bless you all

sincerely 
man from Belgium"
1477,I just need somewhere to vent.,"Hi, 

I've been struggling a lot for the past years and it's hard to come to terms with anything really that has happened to me and not blame myself as much as I try not to. Long story short I went from one abusive/toxic relationship to another, and the latest one really took a toll on me. I thought he was the one I would spend the rest of my life with. We were together for three years our families got along well but he hid his true self from me. He cheated, had an affair, spent his money on drugs ( cocaine, molly... etc )  and started putting all  his anger and frustrations on me. It took me a year but I was finally able to say enough is enough and for that I am proud.

It's been almost 6 months since I put an end to it, but it still haunts me. I have nightmares of the fights, screams and trauma he put me thru. I cant help but feel that I deserved it and should've stayed and just realized that my life was meant to be that way but I'm trying. 

I tried putting myself out there, thinking maybe if i met someone my mind would just leave him behind, however I realized that as soon as someone shows me any emotion I become attached and obsessive thinking that it  could possibly turn into something when in reality I might just be scared that I will live the rest of my life alone. I have heard this from my parent's; since I am divorced do not have a college degree and have lived with men I will never be taken serious. It's been years since my parents told me that but every time I was or am mistreated by someone I care about i relate back to what they said and start to believe it's true. 

Life has been getting a hold on me lately and it's been making it harder and harder to deal with anything.  I cant shower daily, I had to force myself to shower after going days without one, I'm having a hard time sleeping and waking up, I get nauseous just thinking about food,  I'm constantly angry at the world and myself ,living alone hasn't been easy on me either and the drinking started again which isn't helpful since I am on anti depressants and birth control. 

 I constantly crave love and attention while believing I dont deserve either and don't love myself or even care for being alive. 

Tbh if I didn't have my pets to give me somewhat of a purpose I would be dead by now. 

I'm just honestly tired of feeling this way and needed to vent. 

Thank you to whoever too the time of day to read this."
1478,How do you keep up with online school?,"It’s been a month and a half of online classes and it’s starting to get to my head. I sit down in front of my computer for hours on end everyday pretending to my parents that I’m happy even though I’m not. This is mentally draining. Recently I’ve stopped attending my zoom classes because I don’t fell motivated anymore. My grades are also starting to change from A’s and B’s to F’s and D’s. A few calls from my teachers has been made to my home and hearing them makes me even more demotivated because knowing I tried my hardest  just to hear from a teacher that “your failing my class” really gets to me. I don’t even feel human anymore.
Sorry for if there any grammar mistakes because at this point I honestly don’t even care anymore."
1479,it (sadly) ended up to be true,[removed]
1480,Please tell me ways I can be less depressed during lockdown.,I am usually a really happy person and hang around with my 2-3 friends. But since the lockdown started my friends are not very online. I want someone to talk with. I am very introverted so cannot really start a conversation with anybody new. I'm just stuck in my empty flat alone and for the first time in my life I feel really depressed. Please help reddit what can I do?
1481,Helping someone going through phycosis or a schizophrenic episode,"I have someone im very close to who i believe is going through phycosis or a schizophrenic episode
The person is a female teenager
If you have experience with helping someone in a similar situation please dm and i will explain more."
1482,Why does my mood and perspective change so quickly?,"I’ve had a rough childhood, I was abused by my stepdad and hid it from my mum for 8 years, and was born with cystic fibrosis, so my anxiety has been pretty bad my whole life, as well as being dumped a couple of months ago and losing a lot of my friends as I cut them off due to them being toxic and two faced. I was due to get treatment but this has been postponed. I can read advice on here, and honestly for a few hours I feel brilliant, but I notice the next day I can feel bad again, then feel good again, then feel bad, and this repeats several times a day. Sometimes my perspective even changes often too, I can go from being completely motivated to having no motivation to having motivation again several times a week. This makes the whole self improvement process more difficult, as when I feel low, I tend to reinstall my old habits."
1483,I (17 F) have recently been going through some really tough lows and I don’t know how to stop them.,"Ever since quarantine I’ve been experiencing these awful lows and I don’t know how to stop them. I’ve never been depressed before or suffered from any mental illness, I don’t know if I’m overreacting but recently when I try and sleep at night I start feeling so dead inside and just so heavy. 
I start thinking of my future and all the negative things that could happen, my chest feels tight and I just feel so helpless. It’s genuinely terrifying and I don’t know how to snap myself out of it. I don’t really feel anxious, I just feel like I’m hopeless and lonely and lost. A few nights back, I began spiralling like this again and when I was finally able to stop myself from thinking in that way, 3 hours had gone by. I haven’t told anyone about it yet. 
I’ve also been getting into random arguments with my family members these past few weeks, where I have these bursts of anger and I get so angry over things that never seemed to bother me before. Again, I don’t know if I’m over reacting but this is really started to scare me, and I don’t know how to stop these feelings. Any ideas on what’s going on? It might be the isolation from quarantine, but I live in a joint family household so I do see other people daily. I also have not suffered any trauma and am very thankful for my family and my life in general, so I don’t know where these emotions are coming from. Any help on what to do and how to stop it would really be appreciated."
1484,I finally told my parents something was wrong,"I finally told my parents I might have depression

I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I just needed to shout into the void that after 2 years, I finally did it.

I’m in my last semester of college, and due to a credit fuck up, I have to take more credits than normally allowed, on top of finishing a senior project.  

However, just getting work done for me is like yelling at a driver in the front seat: rarely do o have control. 

Last night, after trying repeatedly to try to write an overdue 7 page long essay, I started having THOSE kinds of thoughts. I had them on and off ever since my junior year, but they really came to a head when I had to start taking online classes, particularly last night.

So I decided to wake my dad up and up and asked if I could talk to him. Eventually Mom woke up too and we all talked for an hour.

To anyone reading this considering telling your parents about your mental health, please do it. I got nothing but love and support from both my parents. Never did they get angry, or try to belittle what I was feeling.

I’m finally going to talk to a therapist, and actually get diagnosed. I’m also dropping two of my classes that I most likely was failing anyway, and making them up later, even if it means I graduate a bit late.

TL;DR Don’t be afraid to talk to your parents about mental health"

1486,Feeling aimless in life,"Does anyone else feel terrified of life after major milestones? Like graduations, first jobs, completing degree/employment programs, etc.

Background: I'm a 27 y/o female with a bachelor's degree. I graduated college at 22 and started into a development program with my current company right away. I am also a newlywed and we have just purchased our first single family house. I have I history of dysthymia/depression and anxiety.

I've always had a goal to work towards. Everything has always had and end date in sight and a specific thing for me to achieve. In college, I worked towards the end of each semester and ultimately graduation. In my post-grad full-time job, I worked through a series of rotational positions as scheduled by the framework of this program I was in. Eventually I reached the end of the program, and have now been in the same spot for 3 years. When I got engaged and set a wedding date, we had a specific date to work towards.

Now that all of that is behind me, I'm left feeling overwhelmed by this massive expanse of life in front of me. I'm not sure what to do next and I'm feeling pretty down about it. I feel lost and aimless and I don't know where to go from here. The thought of getting up, going to work, coming home, etc. for the rest of my life is terrifying. Does anyone else feel this way?"

1489,Tetris: Coping mechanism??,"I suffer from anxiety and I stress about things a lot. My brain is always on, going over what I should be doing, what I haven't done and what people might think of me. 

I've been playing a lot of Tetris 99 on Nintendo Switch and it's weirdly meditative. 

I know this sounds weird but hear me out. 
When I'm playing, mind goes completely blank and I can play the game, empty minded and methodical. It absolutely shuts out all of the background noise and I find myself feeling energised and much more upbeat after playing it for a while.

It's weird to say that a video game like this is like meditation for me but it really does help. 
Has anyone else ever experienced something like this or have similar coping mechanisms? 

If not, give it a try. I'd love to see if this works for anyone else."

1491,I'm having an anxiety attack right now., It makes me cry and become aggressive. How can I calm myself?
1492,I need some advice..,"Hi, before I start, I was due to start treatment for anxiety, but this has been postponed. I had a very rough childhood, my dad left and my stepdad abused me for 8 years which I hid from my mum. I also have a long term health condition. I was recently dumped, and all throughout the relationship I felt uncomfortable and like I was walking on eggshells and one argument would mean she dumped me. The first conflict we had, I was dumped. For two weeks I couldn’t function, was complacent with my medication, felt sick all the time, cried a lot. I’ve been working a lot on self improvement but I just notice my mood can change even several times per day. I’m always seeking approval, always seeking validation, even though I know this isn’t good, I can’t function without it. I allowed my ex to treat me terribly because I didn’t want to be alone. I spend a lot of time alone, but I would much rather be in a relationship and with groups of friends and knowing that others care about me, because I don’t love myself enough and don’t believe I’m worth a lot. I never set boundaries in my relationship or anything like that, and whenever I brought something up, I was stonewalled or gaslit. I want to change this though, I want to become someone who can just be happy and comfortable living my own life. What are some tips I can do to change this? One thing I notice is dopamine boosts lift my mood for a while but then I just resort to my old habits. I’ll do stuff like delete tweets if they don’t get enough likes, refuse to message people first because I think I’ll come off as a creep, even people I find attractive etc. I’ve always been a pretty social person, which might sound strange, but I’ve always had some sort of social anxiety, struggling to start conversations etc. I can’t help but think I’m all to blame for being dumped even if that might not be true, and as much as I am trying to stay positive there’s times when my anxiety is triggered and there’s times like I said I resort to my old antics. How can I just be happy with myself, not need anyone else, not need any outside validation, and be able to interact with others easily. Thanks"

1496,Depression or delusion? Or both?,"Hi! I think this is my first post here.  I (25F) have a question I'd love some of your input in. I'm not looking for a diagnosis or advice or anything but I'd like to hear others' thoughts about what I went through. Don't want to spend too much time in my own head, ha.

I'm currently diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, and depression. My parents are older (67 and 71) so I never really knew about any kind of mental health issues in my family, so something else could be going on, but no one's talking about it (generational stuff, y'know?).  For years, I dealt with severe depression and anxiety. I still do, but with the help of years of intense therapy and medication, I finally have my head mostly under control. I've been diagnosed with a lot of things in the past including bipolar disorder (types 1 and 2), GAD, and MDD. There could be others, but there's a chance I don't remember. I've been put on several medications in the past (I went through I think 10 in the span of about 3 years? That's an estimate though) and I'm currently on 80mg Prozac (fluoxetine) a day, 300 mg Trileptal (oxcarbazepine) a day, and 1mg clonazepam as needed. This combo is definitely working well for me.  

I think the sheer amount of medication changes I went through messed with my brain in some way, but what I'm thinking about started in high school before I was on any meds at all. When I was about 16, I think, people were staring me down and whispering about me as I passed by. It was like everyone fell silent when I passed them because they hated me so much and didn't want me to hear the things they were saying about me. There was hate in their faces from what I can remember and I remember being scared and anxious as I walked to classes. I didn't know what I did to make them hate me so much. I just remember feeling intense feelings of being hated by my classmates. I figured I must have done something really wrong. Obviously, this had an impact on me and I started absolutely hating myself for reasons I couldn't understand. I just knew I was bad somehow. These feelings generally didn't last, though, and when I came out of this ""state"" I felt like I woke up from a dream or something. But I had been at school the whole time, going about my day. No one ever said I was acting weird so I kept this to myself. My boyfriend (25M) who I went to the same high school with (we reconnected after a few years) told me recently that no one ever had any feelings of hatred toward me, ever. He hung out with a lot of people, and he doesn't recall anyone saying they even that they didn't like me. Apparently, everyone just assumed I was shy and quiet, but no one ever hated me in the way I thought they did. 

Fast forward to college. At this point, I was positive that I was invisible and no one could see me, and no one would notice if I was gone (obviously, because I was apparently invisible). I ended up skipping a lot of class because I was convinced of this. I was always surprised when someone mentioned that they had missed me in class the other day, or when I saw my attendance grades were shitty. Again, these ""states"" don't last forever, and when I do come out of them, it's like coming out of a dream. I should mention that I was sexually assaulted during my first year of college, and these states got much more intense after that. I know this is a symptom of PTSD, but that doesn't explain why I've been getting these since high school. I had no prior trauma that I can remember. 

I'm now finishing up graduate school and thankfully these ""episodes"" or ""states"" or whatever are much fewer and far between. At the beginning of grad school, though, I was still convinced that no one would notice if I skipped a seminar - even though there were only five people total that would be in the room. There are other times that I've believed some things that turned out to be false, but I don't want to get into them right now because this post is already long, and they're actually really hard and scary to talk about. 

But my question is - was I delusional, severely depressed, or both? I can say with absolute confidence there were periods in which I thought I didn't exist, or that I existed outside others' reality. It was like, I could see them but they couldn't see me? Like, I was looking in from a two-way mirror? It's hard to explain but I hope there's someone on here that has either experienced something similar or has some insight as to what my head was doing at the time. 

Currently, as I said, I'm finishing up my Master's. I'm doing better than ever! I'm very lucky to have an outstanding psychiatrist, access to therapy/medication, and a solid support system. This post is mainly just me being curious. 

And if anyone's going through something similar, I'm proof that it does get better. Stay strong."
1497,My friend just went walking somewhere for this night because she felt very bad,"My friend has confirmed deep depression. We argued 2,5 month ago and started chatting only few days before now. I don't know her now as much as I did, but that house escapes happened before. Usually it made her feel better so now I don't worry that much. Still, I am not sure that she will be fine, although she somehow always makes it out. She is a strong and fragile person in the same time. It's hard to talk to her not hurting her feelings so I just didn't say anything against this. Can anyone say something about this situation? I need somebody's words to feel at least better. We arranged to meet tomorrow in the morning to just walk around the city but I'm not sure anymore that it's a good idea. Especially after she said that she can cry for hours or hit anyone irl if she is feeling bad."
1498,"As some who lives with depression, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Game Stardew Valley dealt with depression and suicide","I'm a gamer, and not too long ago I bought Stardew Valley. I quickly realised that one of the characters in it, Shane, was a depressive. This made me a bit apprehensive about how well the game would deal with the subject.

However, Shane's in-game narrative is actually quite realistic and I was really surprised at home well a game dealt with the subject.

So, I [made a video](https://youtu.be/x88Q8yTidJI) about one of the game's cutscenes that I feel encapsulated how well it deals with it.

She doesn’t think depression is real because she doesn’t go through anything like that in her life. 

Having to stay at home because of covid with my parents took a lot of my energy, mom often nags, blames or whine about her life, she constantly talking about her friend (their story, children, life, whatever that i don’t really care) kinda bragged about them, she treated my brother differently from me and sis. She remembers all the bad thing i did but none the good thing i’ve done. She blames her fault on others but not my bro and don’t want to be corrected, always sensitive and act like she’s fragile and cries when everything doesn’t go as she want. I grew up steered by her and having told about what to do next and what to say in almost everything i’m not really sure about anything. She wanted me to be a doctor to fulfill her ego, but i failed the tests and when i said i can’t do it, she cried and said it’s okay but she’s clearly disappointed in me. And then i chose graphic design as my major based on what i like, drawing. 
My dad doesn’t care about us and last year he left us to take care of his mom who’s faking sickness, but then came back to us in bad condition because his diabetes got worse. All of us despise him, my mom probably still love him but she acted like she doesn’t and always try to keep him by her side since he’s one of the black goat and she love to nags about the past about dad’s family.

Just a month ago i’m thinking of drop out from uni just because i feel nothing goes my way and what i’m doing now is just burdening my older sister who paid for living expense and most of my tuition and some of it is from my parents’ savings, both of my parents is ‘retired’, older brother help paying only some of the living expense. I talked it out about dropping to my sis and she said i should finish it since i’m already in 4th semester and shouldn’t worry about GPA, i agreed to that condition. My sis always supports and corrects me, i also told her about my negative thoughts but we don’t talk about it much.

I always have thoughts like what if i die, what if i wasn’t born, what if i’m not born into this family. I noticed that i cry a lot this year, feeling tired, i’m having hard time waking up and falling asleep, couldn’t get assignments done on deadline and procrastinate before doing any of it, online classes feels like heavy burden, i overthink about stuff my mom said like i’m worthless, shouldn’t have born, etc, i used to ignore them or just talk back to her but these days it got back to me and i feel like what she say might be the truth. I always try to look ahead for the future but lately i can’t. I don’t want to die yet but at the same time i’m feeling broken, and tired of this.

I’m not sure if i’m really depressed/ too much overthink/ tired/ lonely/ playing victim/ being too emotional, or just have bad time management.

If I try bring it up she insults me and makes me the issue, once they both randomly left the house and my brothers were worried, she got home and blamed their relationship issues on me, despite me still trying to get along with him at the time. 
The last time he spoke to me he was screaming about how he was indeed racist and homophobic (I'm bi), and how it's Adam and Eve. My mum always pushes the issues onto me and if I ever try to confide in her about my feelings she is tired and I'm being selfish, and yet she always pushes her issues onto me. I keep having good patches with my mum, despite avoiding her bf whenever I physically can, but this always happens, I keep having suicidal thoughts and wishing I could just stop being here, like a burden, but I also know I can leave in less than 6 month for uni and dont have to see them anymore then. It's the only thing keeping me going, knowing it's almost over, I've been waiting nearly 3 years for this. I wish covid had never come because it means I'm stuck home more often, not that I have friends who want to hang out in person much anyway (text) or a best friend or anything like that, I just feel so stuck.
Every time he raises his voice I start feeling sick and anxious and feel like I'm going to have a panic attack, before I could go to my aunt's to stay to feel okay (they're really great) but now I'm stuck here.

I cant remember most of my childhood. According to my mother I ""lost my spirit"" when I was 7 years old, and she felt like she lost her child. I do remember some things. Sexual feelings around 8-10. Wanting to be sexual at 8. Is this normal for a child? I tried committing suicide at 8 according to my mother, again at 17, my childhood and teenage years I had no friends whatsoever and couldnt attend school due to my crippling depression, I was essentially a hermit.
I have been trying to look back and unlock those memories and have realized a few things. I was and still am scared of men. Friends fathers, male teachers, any adult males. I was heading to sleep just now and got the image of these big male arms coming to grab me and I jumped, i cant sleep now because i feel a massive weight in my heart. I dont remember being abused but I do wonder if I was. I've talked to my mother about it and she said she always wondered if I was abused. Was this the reason I lost my spirit and ended up like this?
How can I make sense of this all? How can I heal? I spend my entire life running from my childhood and its tiring. I feel like something has been stolen from me and I cant run from that feeling.

1510,Having bad thoughts. Looking for help and explanation.," Hello everyone. Forgive the lack of structure and grammar, I’m not a native english speaker and really can’t focus right now. I’m having a bad time so I came here with the hopes that somebody will give me some answers or advice.  For context, I’m male mid twenties slav, so I can’t afford help from specialist especially during these troubled times. 

Recently I’ve lost my job and my 5 year long relationship is pretty much over, we barely speak and live separately for a month. She was the closest person to me, the only one who supported me. She has the issues of her own, so living together and dating helps neither of us. Last year was the worst, we lost the connection, common interests, passion. I guess we just got tired of each other. I have nobody to talk to right now, I tried to talk to my buddies but I can’t get any advice or help they just laugh it off and continue talking about their stuff or just get some reassuring cliche that obviously doesn’t help at all. I’ve been that way for almost 6 years but it’s worse this year. 

I feel like i've wasted my life. I feel like I’m the worst of all. Constant mood swings, can’t sleep at night, everything is a chore to me (even my old hobbies like gaming), lack of motivation. Just a couple days ago I was casually shaving and suddenly burst into tears for seemingly no reason. I’ve become person I never wanted to be: bitter, lazy, always upset or angry, i can’t stand people laughing in public because i feel like they’re laughing at me, seeing people enjoying their lives upsets me even though i’m not jealous.Having inferiority complex makes things even harder. Days just blend together and I keep wasting my time and life. I feel like I’m stuck and nobody can help me. Nobody will even try. My relationships are fake and toxic, I’m stuck in the past, always negative. I’m not sure if I’m introverted by nature or just become one. Lack of non-toxic social interactions makes me feel even worse. I have literally couple of people I message or talk to occasionally, mostly while playing lol and sadly it’s the only time I talk to somebody except family. All my old acquaintances left my city or randomly stopped talking to me/deleted from social media I assume due to the shit I’ve become.I tried to find some new friends on multiple occasions but it didn’t work out. Everything I touch just gets ruined. I feel like I’m degrading.  Don’t know how my psychological state is called but I’m pretty sure that it’s not normal and it gets worse everyday. Can you tell what is wrong with me and how can I change it? I’m really tired, it’s getting harder not to think the worst. I’m having bad ideas lately, but I’m stuck in the loop of self-pity and anger and afraid to commit to anything."

It only makes me feel more alone when I realize i'm talking to a fucking chat bot or something like that. I need to quit googling my symptoms and try to get back to enjoying my life and practicing gratitude. Then i google how to do that and a slough of apps like Calm and other meditation shit catch my eye and then YUP you guessed it 'enter card details'"

1517,Has anyone not been feeling great at all about their body lately? What do you do to cope?,"I'm not sure if it's because I haven't seen anyone in a while, but I can't really look at my body in the mirror anymore. I've been working out and doing things that normally make me feel better, but fasting for Ramadan only makes me bloated during the day and grumpy most of the day because I can't eat. This has brought out all my insecurities; I feel like I'm on my period every day(emotionally)!

How have you been coping with not feeling pretty?

Any advice helps!"
1518,Not sure what’s going on with me.,"So, lately I have been extremely moody. Like I will wake up feeling great and a couple hours later feel angry and suicidal and then go back to feeling good. I had a baby 6 months ago and have been dealing with postpartum depression, but I don’t think this sounds like ppd to me. I have also been really impulsive lately as in spending lots of money at once and taking a very last minute trip 13 hours away from my home just because. I know nobody can diagnose anything here, but any insight to what could possibly be going on would be awesome. I’m sick of not knowing where my mood is going to be all day."
1519,Teen psych wards?,"Been thinking of asking my parents if I can go to one, just have a lot of concerns. One, that my parents won’t take it well, aka how should I ask?

I feel like if I go, when I come back the makeup work will make me ten times worse. 

Anyways let me know your thoughts/experiences please."

1521,Struggling right now,"Today I got an anxiety attack. I have so much stress. With so much on mind and no real outlet since we are quarantined. Everyday is becoming daunting. 

I probably sound like a sad sappy person but I’m feeling very lonely. I feel forgotten about from friends and family. I do have my husband but I have a fear of being too much. 

Any advice on how to pull through anxiety and depression during this quarantine? How are you guys coping?"
1522,My intense social anxiety has stolen most of my life from me. It feels too late.,"i wasn’t like this when i was a kid
i wasn’t that shy. i always had a lot of friends. i read more than anyone else i knew, it was the teasing joke in my family. oh, tessa’s reading again. i wrote all the time. i loved acting. i tried new things. i was a person. and then little by little it all got eaten away, until i felt too paralyzed by fear to be anything at all. and now it feels too late. it’s felt too late for a very long time now. it feels like everyone else continued to be a person, and grew. and that i’ve been at a standstill, paralyzed by fear and self-hatred, for the better part of sixteen years. i'm 27 now. sometimes it's been ok because people would find my shyness cute or w/e and i'd manage basic things. but now i just seem weird and mean. and it feels like. how do you possibly catch up? or love yourself? or have anyone else love you? when you’re not even a person? i’m not sure.

i have a therapist and i've been trying to work through these feelings for most of the past decade. i've made a little progress here and there, but whenever a bad life thing has happened, i feel way held back. i feel worthless, like i offer nothing. it's starting to feel pointless."
1523,"What does mental illness look like? How do I know if I really need help? (Long post, looking for advice)","I'm 18 in my senior year of high school, and all I can say is that I feel like very little has changed for me over the past 8 years of my life since I started middle school. (Also, sorry this post is going to be long and all over the place). Also trigger warning?? I mention hurting myself, suicide, etc. 

I struggle to stay motivated in general, but recently it has gotten worse since I have been home. I know every family is a little dysfunctional, but my relationship with my family isn't the most stable. I often fight with my mother, my father never wants to be a parent, and my brother struggles with his own emotional health as well. I am not biologically related to any of them. 

We are not poor and live comfortably, but the house has a lot of issues. We have to turn off the water to the entire house when we are not using it because there is a leak in our basement that we don't have enough money to repair. There are constantly bugs everywhere (especially now that the warmer weather is coming), and food in our fridge is often left to the point that it becomes expired and rots. We also just have too much stuff it overwhelms every room. It was only this year that I came to realize why I never was able to finish cleaning out my entire room - there's just so much everywhere it's overwhelming to even know or figure out where to begin or what to do with all of it. I get stuck eventually and lose motivation. My room is definitely the ""cleanest"" out of any other room in the house, but that's not saying much. Bags of trash, dirty dishes and dirty laundry are practically everywhere. That's not just my room either. 

My house has been like this for almost as long as I have lived here. I know this might just sound like I'm lazy, and technically I have cleaned my room entirely before but it's been a while. I just figured the environment probably also contributes to my mindset. 

Throughout my entire childhood, I have also struggled to maintain or develop close friendships, and I've never understood why. During middle school, however, I was close with a lot of kids who were struggling with their mental health. I had three close friends tell me they wanted to hurt themselves over the four years of middle school. I have never considered myself suicidal because I never actively went out of my way with the intention of dying. I have definitely thought about it though. Nowadays, these thoughts mostly manifest themselves in the idea of disappearing or wishing I never existed. 

High school was okay. My freshman year was good until winter term. I had become really close friends with this one girl who always put other people down. I didn't realize it until winter term, and because it felt unhealthy, I started to distance myself from her. Then I realized, I never made any other friends. Whenever I try to tell someone I don't really have a lot of friends, they will point to the comments on my social media pages. There are a lot of people I am friendly with because we shared classes together or had mutual friends, but they aren't the kind of people who would be checking up on me. I don't hold that against them at all, I just mean to say we just didn't have that kind of friendship. As a senior, I would say I really only had four close friends - one of which left my high school and spiraled into substance abuse. We are no longer close because she cut me off the last month of our junior year for a guy. 

\*\***At this point I'm not even sure if this explanation would be helpful but the TLDR of it all is this**: 

I feel like I struggle to stay motivated. I'm not happy unless something good happens. I don't always have bad days, but last summer was probably one of the lowest points of my life. I lost interest in a lot of things that I used to like. I had zero sex drive, I never wanted to eat, and I always wanted to sleep. I didn't do anything except go to work, sleep, and eat. I constantly feel guilty for not doing enough, but can never seem to maintain the motivation to do more with my life. I have spent so much time in quarantine playing a video game that I'm pretty sure I only like because it provides me with an outlet to ""escape"". I don't want to sound dramatic, because I do have good days where I don't feel sad or bad about myself, and there are days where I feel social and I want to talk to people. I can still smile and laugh at memes on the internet and I still am able to have fun if I call my friends. But the majority of the time lately, I just see myself withdrawing from everything around me. I feel trapped in my own head. **So my question is, what does struggling with mental illness look like, versus just struggling with emotional stability? Is it the same thing?** My mother has always downplayed and dismissed my efforts to explain how I feel and has told me I just make a big deal out of nothing. I used to idolize her opinion that my perspective is so skewed I don't know myself anymore because I used to believe she knew me better than I knew myself. I also feel like the way I have always understood mental illness was that it was crippling like depression keeps people bedridden for days. I don't experience that, mostly because I'm afraid of hat my mother would say to me. 

I should also say that my sleep is pretty irregular. During middle school, I would constantly stay up past 12 as late as 2-3 am on many nights. I can't do that anymore because I get so exhausted but I used to stay up late watching youtube or procrastinating my work because I never wanted to fall asleep feeling sad. 

**Not sure if anyone will read this, but I would appreciate really anyone's input.**"
1524,I’m beginning to resent my ex husband spontaneously and it burns me.,"My ex has accused me of cheating on him and has taken the initiative of discussing that with my mother and sister; now they associate me with being like my father and I’m beginning to wonder when she will realize that I’m just like her. My mother is also accusing me of being physically abusive with my ex, like my father, as well. 

Let’s get this all straight: I never cheated on him; I moved all the way to Germany and missed out on a lot of my life to be with him and apparently a threesome was all it took for him to have a problem (something I thought would fulfill something we lacked in our sex-lives). He had been looking for reasons to divorce me so that he wouldn’t have to come back to America. How do I know this? Because he attempted to break up with me several times after we discussed that I was no longer happy in Germany and he kept pushing his plans into affect... he was finishing his master’s and knew he didn’t want to leave Germany. 

Now I’ve left, seeing someone new and trying to figure my shit out and now, he was to play confessions, knowing how my family can be.

Pertaining to the physical violence... he and I got into a physical altercation YEARS ago. It was one of those situations where I tried to keep him restrained and he hit me, which lead to me hitting back. My intentions were to never put my hands on him at all; I saw my father put my hands on my mother and I told myself that, that wasn’t love. But my mother will never understand that I’m not my father so I won’t even bother getting into that. 

Looking back at it, the love me and my ex had was nothing but a codependency of two grown men with internalized “daddy issues”... almost a year later, I’m going to therapy in the morning and I’m hoping to solidify that true love, starts within myself. I also hope to convert that resentment into something positive or learn to move forward from it. I don’t want to be angry.  

I try to take on accountability for everything in my life but I’m learning how to handle the resentment and anger... I’m disappointed that I basically had to start my life over a few months ago... Deep inside, I feel like my life isn’t going anywhere and I’m scared and I feel alone... but I have goals that I’d like to attempt and it’s something I can work towards, in therapy."
1525,Why do I really dislike people who do cowardly actions?,"I do not know if this is the right place to write this so tell me if I am wrong.

I wanted to find out if you guys could tell me why I dislike cowardice so much. Growing up I would always go out of my way to help people like that since I felt everything needs a helping hand, but it seemed to never stop. They would just do it over and over.

The other day I had a friend tell me he was afraid to drive his Audi because what if someone tried to steal his car (this is like the 3 time he mentioned it)... I was really annoyed hearing this. Why did he buy a car if he I so afraid to even drive it. Also why would people car to even steal his car.  its like really??

I think another reason I dislike cowardice is because I've never seen a dad that wasn't cowardly. Like even my own dad when he spoke to me couldn't look me in eye or hold a conversation. I had to guide him through the conversation when I was 7. 

I also have to lead conversations, and deal with people who can't look me in the eye all the time as well.

So, tell me what you guys think :)."
1526,anyone else find it hard to physically show emotion?,"so basically as long as i can remember iv always found it hard to convey emotion on my face, i don't have a resting bitch face, my resting face is completely blank and emotionless. my mam has told me several times how it makes me look stupid and it makes me feel really self concious. as a younger kid i was really happy but always found people telling me to smile when i thought i was, or that i look worried or sad when im just reading something. my face also feels really strained when i smile, more so than i think is normal. i also find it hard to laugh and even when i genuinly do have been told it sounds fake. when i went on a date with my bf a few months b4 the covid shutdown i told him about it and he is the same, though its not as bad for him. i just wanna now is anyone else like this?"
1527,I’m (F19) very scared about my younger brother (M13),"I’ll try to write this as short as possible. Basically, my little brother started having weird problems from when he was around 8. For example: He was very uncomfortable when anyone from my family crossed their arms. Then he started actually forcing me and my fam memberd to stop crossing them. It was very weird. It stopped in a few months with my parents but he is still agressive when he sees me doing it until these days. I literally cannot do it infront of him. You can say: what, he is a little kid. But like he will punch me or do literally anything from stopping me. It’s very unhealthy and my parents tried everything. Another thing is, that he REPEATS my coughing or sneezing. It was kinda funny at the beginning but he is doing it for 2 years now and it’s freaking annoying. He has problems mostly with me, another things are: when I play guitar, he shouts at me and he literally broked my door once bc of it. It’s really scary. He also has tendency to “return” every touch I accidentaly give him.

He also has “smaller” problems with my parents, like he hates when my mum has nailpolish on and he is kinda agressive but not like when I do it. He also throwed a book at her when she said no to something.

I’m really sad he treats me this way. It’s true, that when we were young (I was about 10 and he like 4) I didn’t want to han out w him that much, you know, I had my friends over and he was like: i wanna play w u guys. It’s possible that something like this cause this. I’m also very afraid that he may be like this or even worse in the future. Now, it’s something like OCD and not a proper reaction to things but mostly in my family. it can actually turn into something bigger and I’m very scared he’ll do something horrible in the future.

He has problems with controlling himself. He won’t do anything, that’s uncomfortable for him. Like he can’t work out bc it’s “hard” and he cannot push himself. My mum always tried to keep him busy and to develop his character, but he is just too lazy.

The question I want to ask is: do you think this will get better w/o getting a therapist? Does anyone have same experience? What shall we do? I personally don’t think it’s normal. We tried talking to him 1000000 times and sometimes he refused to admit he is doing wrong things, sometimes he is genuiely sorry. He likes programmating and lego hehe. So he doesn’t really play any violent games. He is actually very handsome and cute boy, I’m just really sad he “hates me” this much and that it’ll get worser.

Also, we tried to get him into therapy, but all therapist in my city wants to take children 15+, it’s really impossible to find one, who would take care of him."
1528,My Metal Health Cure,After 1 year of having auditory hallucinations and finally getting a second option. I was over medicated lol.

1530,Seeking help,"I'm a guy and I'm 18. This is my first reddit post so I'm sorry if it isn't structured very well. I think I may have a few mental health issues, I also have asperges syndrome and type one diabetes (idk if these are relevant) I'll start with the most recent issues I've been having, over the last 5 years alot has happened to my mental state and alot of it I don't really know the reasons but I've been getting more and more anxious and parinoid about little things, like the way someone says something to me or even the way they are when im in the room can cause me to spiral into thoughts about what I've done wrong to upset them or make them angry even though there is no reason for me to think these things I still do. Almost every time walk somewhere I'm looking behind my back to see if people are behind me, there never are but I still have this feeling that I'm being followed. Another thing that is more recent is my fear of the dark has gotten so bad to the point where I always keep a light on in my room and force my self to stay awake until I physically can't anymore, I don't know why but I just get and overwhelming sense of dread that something or someone may be there. Another thing is that I have become very self aware of my existence and its driving me mental, I have to comstanly push thoughts out of my head. Sometimes I have thoughts of things that I can't explain but they just won't go away, not bad things but people or things. I'm sorry this post seems like such a mess, I hope someone can help me"
1531,Panic attcks when listening to music,"Ever since my last breakup I found it extremely hard to listen to any song on the topic of love (wich is like 80% of all music and 2 thirds of all my playlists). Faster pace or abstract songs are ok but slower ones, or that show love more explicitly (actually says what they did as lovers) I simply cannot stand. Even though the song is beautiful or shows hope I just can't breathe or start crying. I really hate this because I used to like many of these songs and now I can't listen to them without having a breakdown.
Any tips on how I can stop this without proffesional help? 
(I know it is not as serious as other posts so if it is too unimportant please suggest me another subreddit that can help)
Thanks a lot!"
1532,"Why on Earth are meaningless platitudes used as a ""Medical Treatment"" for me?","So this is a long story being cut way down. I first typed out the whole story and it was nothing but long rambling history of me.

Basically I was born with a skin deformity, and as I grew up it it got worse and obviously made me look like an an abomination. Like clear as day, cut and dry, black and white. It's not invisible, I'm deformed. I have been my whole life. 

Yeah it's an issue, it was less of an issue when I was a teenager for relationships. because it was all quick and wasn't supposed to be anything more than some fun. Now I'm older and people my age don't want someone who looks like me. I've been told *so many* times that it's just too much. And I agree, it's horrible, I couldn't imagine waking up and seeing my partner looking like a horrible burn-victim every single morning. 

So I'm starting to get bitter about everything and go seek a counsellor. Imagine my surprise when actual Medical Treatment consists of ""Positive Thinking"". Telling me that: ""It's not that bad"", ""others have it worse than you"" or what got me the most ""Well they're just lying"". Seriously. I have an actual horrible deformed body that's been noted for my literal entire life, but no, clearly the different women I've dated were all *LIARS* about not liking a horribly deformed monster. 

What the hell? Honestly? With all the big fuss about mental health over the years I'd thought it would have gotten at least a little bit better since they sat me down and explained the horribled future I'd have when I was a 10 year old.

I go with a genuine problem - my demformity is causing me problems. I'm dressed from neck-to-toe any time I leave the house or meet someone or anything that doesn't involve me being 100% completely alone. There are no mirrors in my home, my windows are covered up, my laptop doesn't have a camera and the camera on my phone is taped off. 

I have a problem: I'm miserable because I'm deformed. I'm also lonely, which is because people can't look at my deformity. 

But when I got to see about my mental health, their solution is platitudes? What the fuck. How does meaningless garbage help me? 

They keep dragging me into a room with 2 nurses and get me to open up and talk about it and my past relationships and yet try and counter it all with stuff like ""they're just lying"" or ""just being mean"". Like, no, no they weren't. They clearly weren't. You're the one lying right now and trying to tell me to lie to myself constantly. 

They keep telling me that I'm not ""deformed"" or ""Scarred"", I'm just ""different"". I'm nearly 30 years old, get the fuck out of here with your bullshit. 

How on Earth can anyone say this nonsense is a Medical Treatment? All this CBT stuff is all the rage right now, everyone getting their heads checked out, claiming it's helping them overcome anxiety. But all they're telling me is to lie to myself and call everyone who doesn't gush over an abomition a Liar. 

How is that supposed to help anyone? I'm clearly a bitter and lonely person, trying to brainwash me into thinking I'm this beautiful person is a horrible charade. 

How is this even a remotely acceptable form of Treatment?

This is an actual trained Medical Professional."
1533,weed induced psychosis,so about two months ago I smoked a lot of weed and it made me feel like i was watching my life through a tv almost as if i was stuck in my mind. I haven’t recovered and i’m still having those same feelings. it’s given me a lot of intrusive thoughts and now i can’t stop obsessing over pointless things like death and the beginning of time. I’ve quit smoking but with the lockdown I feel like i’m wasting my whole life and i’m going to die with regret. Somethings that have helped are distractions like spending time with my family and working out but after i’m done i go right back into the downward spiral any tips or experiences you’d like to share or how long it took for you to recover
1534,Obsessive thoughts impacting my health,"Background: been with my wife 15 years, 2 kids. She knows how many people I slept with before her, but I purposely told her not to tell me about her past as I have experienced jealousy in past relationships. I knew about 3-4, including one random hookup of hers, but it never bothered me and I never thought about it. Recently, I found out about a guy she slept with 5 years before I met her, a one night stand. Ever since, I can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t sleep, my stomach hurts, mind racing. Her phone is linked to our shared computer, so I can see her texts and social media. I actually found out about the guy when I was using the computer and a chat with her friends about how she recently ran into the guy at Tim Horton’s, and how awkward it was. Ever since, I’ve been stalking her social media, scouring her old posts, analyzing every little comment. In my head, I have her sleeping with 100s of guys, even though I logically think it’s less than 10, and fewer than my number. I need help. Anyone have any good coping techniques to stop obsessing? I don’t think I can bring it up to her because of the way I found out. Any suggestions on inoccuous conversation starters I can use to guide the subject there? At this point, I think I would be better off knowing the real number so I can stop obsessing."
1535,Anyone know if this is normal? And if not what could it be?,"Sorry if I won't go into much detail but I'm a very quiet person and often find that I can't talk much about myself. But there is something that is worrying me a bit.
I'm a 21 yo guy, I'm a very very chill guy 99% of the times, I study hard, I'm in a relationship and I'm trying to do my best in life. I'm pretty much your average guy.
Now the problem is, sometimes, and I'm talking about rarely, like, once every 1 to 5 months, I start getting sad about the most tiny little things and after this goes on for a few minutes my heart starts pounding extremely fast and the only thing I can think about is to get a razor and cut myself or if not available to hurt myself in other ways, punching myself, etc.
This is about it really, I don't think this is normal behaviour and would like to hear some educated guesses about whether I am mentally ill.
Thank you for your understanding everyone, and for having taken your time to read this post"
1536,feel so hopeless and helpless,"im (23f) just so miserable right now. and people who i try to talk to about it assume its to do with covid19. its not. im always like this, ive just only now reached breaking point that i feel i have to bring it up to people. 

i iwsh  i could formulate what i want to say here into a nice neat reddit friendly post that isnt just an incoherent rant that people will scroll past but i honestly dont know if im capable of that. 

(im so sorry how long this turned out, i just feel really bad right now and i feel like i might burst if i dont get this out of my system somewhere.)

i find it really hard to elaborate on my problems (took me years to even acknowledge i had problems) because im not TOO anything. im maybe not the most depressed of my friends. my social anxiety isnt the worst. my grades, at school at least, were good. i had troubled sleep but i didnt want to complain to friends and family who were insomniacs. im a little lonely but probably not as much as i should be. everything SHOULD be ok. im unemployed but my parents are supporting me so i shouldnt complain there. ive even had a friend say to me after the worst year of my life where i was suicidal, 'you know, youre the only person i know who's always ok'. i even am lucky enough right now to be receiving therapy on a reduced rate, but i hardly know what to say in sessions. i almost wish someone who actually made the most of the opportunities i have had them instead of me. 

its also hard to me to explain whats wrong because everything in my mind seems so nonsensical and contradictiory. its so hard to put into words. somethings just **wrong.**

i have been told i seem like i could have aspergers or adhd but its ONLY just come up in the past year or so. the idea that i might be able to find some community, or label, or treatment, or resource, that would help me understand and tidy up my head makes me want to weep with joy. but i have no diagnosis so i may well not be. even if i am, the waiting list to see a specialist is god knows how long. and HEY even if i do see someone, and get the magical diagnosis that i seek, obviously that wont make my problems go away. there is no relief in sight, just continued exhaustion and confusion no matter what happens. 

even short term solutions like talking to friends and family, or trying to find solutions and community in other places (such as reddit) dont seem to ever work out, a fact which makes me feel even more confused and disconnect from reality than ever. i try to explain to someone how i feel and they just dont get it, or i clearly dont articulate it well and they misunderstand, or they make it about them, or they just ignore me. that is, if i ever actually manage to voice my thoughts. more often i just sit there with my mouth slightly open, trying to formulate words that accurately convey what i mean, until the other person gets bored or frustrated and i get too self conscious to keep trying. its miserable. i just cant stop thinking about all different ideas and possibilities in my head, what to say, the repurcussions of what i could say. 

pretty much every time i try to decide on anything, my mind starts trying to draw up a decision tree and follow it all the way back, desperately trying to reduce uncertainty and figure out 'the best approach'. but pretty quickly i get overwhelmed and my mind just goes blank (to put in programming parlance, it very much reminds me of a 'maximum recursion depth' error. my brain is doing too many operations and i run out of memory and so freeze completely). one of the only things that helps me at all at the moment is writing down every thought or concern in my head just to get them out and stop them buzzing around like a bunch of nasty cooped up wasps.  but even doing that is difficult. say im sat on my bed. i feel overwhelmed. i need to write down my thoughts. i get up. should i write on my phone, laptop, or a notebook? phone is the hardest to type with and flows least well, and i dont know which app to pick. for my laptop ill need to seek out the appropriate document format to write into, and my laptop is slow. or i could write in a notebook. but what if someone finds it? do i need to be self conscious of what i write? great now im worried about that. should i use a pen or a pencil? where should i start? is what i am writing down making sense? does it matter? does my spelling matter? etc. 

i know thats weird but i cant help it. my mind just spirals out of control. i give the impression generally of someone who is reasonably functional, i do chores, i cook, i went to university, i even had a job once. these were and are really difficult for me, as i am almost always exhausted and overwhelmed, but i just try to suck it up and get better because as far as i can tell, theres no place for me in the world if i dont. i want to be a nice person but the exhaustion that comes from potentially confusing social exchanges can make me irritable, so i withdraw. i want to be smart and independant, but often i just want to coddle myself, and sit about watching childrens cartoons or something, because the anxiety that comes with challenging myself, and worrying about potential failure, and just generally finding focusing AT ALL extremely tiring (i havent mentioned the attention span so much as the anxiety thing but god, i cannot get myself to focus on studies and i have tried. so. hard.) is too much to bear and makes me feel literally ill or close to panic attacks quite often. so yeah. i do the bare minimum. the house is always messy enough to bother me but its not DISGUSTING. my grades are bad but i havent COMPLETELY failed. although ive been close, and have failed university modules multiple times. i honestly think itd be cruel of me to elaborate more on that, because i have written far too much already. but people in my life still assume im smart and doing well, because for some reason i cant tell them (or cant convincingly tell them) otherwise. they just think im being modest. 

i dont see a positive future ahead of me despite on paper to others looking like im doing fine. ive never been a particularly happy person (i realised recently ive pretty much always had a low mood, i just thought it was normal, and that happy people were lying or exaggerating or something). everything is so difficult and there seems to be no reward, break or respite, even for someone like me who really cant point to any external sources for my problems. i feel so strongly that ive almost managed to convince myself im objectively right, that life is not good and never will be. im not gonna do anything about that. im not suicidal. im just resigned, and tired. ive been struggling with these issues for a while now, talking to a doctor, getting anti depressants, getting therapy, and i am still the same me with the same problems. my self esteem if anything is crashing lower and lower with each moment, and the doubts i have about the possibility of me succeeding, getting a job, gaining indepedence,  just seem rational. my mindset is informed by the general trend of my life. yes i have had some successes. ive even been told i could be very successful before, back when i was capable of functioning in school and i was supposedly intelligent. but life has proven to me that that particular academic intelligence i may have had counts for nothing when you cant focus or motivate yourself to save your life.  its weird because last week i was actually in a decent mood, i was studying, exercising, reading, quite successfully. but i cant keep it up. forcing myself to be that person just makes me crash worse (like now). actually right before writing this post i was just trying to study but felt sick and couldnt focus AT ALL so, here i am. 

if you read this, or frankly even scrolled down to the bottom of, or hell even clicked on this post. thanks. you deserve a medal. and if you have anything positive to say i would appreciate it very much. theres still so much in my head that i need to get out but im running out of steam and this is so long im already tempted to just delete it all. ultimately, i feel crazy, and it seems like nothing and no one can help."
1537,school,"i know people are doing homeschool right now, but people who are normally doing online school any other time, how much has your mental health and relationships with people improved. i want to start doing it when i go back, as i would have an anxiety/ panic attack nearly every day. i don’t want to at the same time as it could be damaging to my mental health and relationships with my friends as i’m introverted and see them mostly at school and i’m just getting confused with myself at this point"
1538,sessions of self pity. and too many of them for my liking. (+ a question),"not sure if this is the right sub and i dont even know what the purpose of this is tbh. 

there's this one thing is always doing yet hate to. pitying myself. for example, i listen to all my friends problems and rants and to them venting and help them out as much as i can. i dont have the courage to tell them i want to vent too, so i just leave some hints. they never pick up on those. then there's always that one voice in my head saying stuff like ""oh yeah poor you, putting other's needs in front of yours and never getting a chance to vent"". kinda feels like im bragging to myself, if that makes sense? it makes me pity myself. it can range from simple thoughts to be spending nights crying in bed until i fall asleep. one thing that i've noticed always happens, is a slight, yet very noticeable pain in the wrist. i wonder what that is? sometimes it spreads to my fingers/hand. sometimes it's my chest, but almost always my wrist."
1539,I want to help my depressed ex,"I think I have a unique situation here and I need help. I dated a guarded girl for 9 months (guarded as in, super hard to open up, never needs anyone in her life, scared of being hurt type of girl). We broke up last September and yes I do miss her a lot still, but that doesn’t really matter right now. Now, I wouldn’t call her mentally ill because she’s a healthy and normal girl in high school that does her schoolwork and sports. But in the inside she has trouble expressing her feelings and has never opened up about her inner emotions to her family or friends. She has a wall where she shows a different personality on the outside to people, where in the inside she is insecure and has trouble expressing herself, she keeps all her problems to herself and never lets anyone know of her struggles.

Anyways, from past experiences, I’m worried about her. She has done harm to herself before, and I (her ex) is the only person who knows this. Her family has no idea of her problems, and her friends do not either. Ever since this quarantine started, her friends have told me that she has not been talking much to anyone, just staying in her house and doing schoolwork. 

I want to ask her how she is doing and if she’s in a good state of mind, but being her ex, every time I send her a snap or text, it’s either a short response (obviously annoyed) or no reply. Does anyone have any thought on what I can do? I understand that talking to an ex is usually a bad idea, but I do not think this is an ordinary situation. I have no intentions of getting back with her, all I want is for her to be happy and safe. I care about her deeply and feel the responsibility of letting her know that I’m there for her. Any advice would mean a lot to me."
1540,"I can’t be with a person who has been to a mental hospital/takes medication, I think it’s because of jealousy.","I can’t remember when this started, but I think that as I got older and met more people who has been sent places and takes medication, it reminds me of my very first suicide attempt, and how no one ever reacted.

The reason to why I dislike being with them is because if I know that they take medication or has been sent somewhere, it’s the only thing that is going to go through my mind, it’s the only thing I’ll think about when I’m with said person.

I think it has something to do with jealousy. As someone with a lot of mental health problems, 2 suicide failed attempts and 5 years of screaming for help without any reactions from anyone, it hurt to see people who are actually getting help.

I’ve never had a therapist, I’ve never had medication, I’ve never been sent anywhere, the only thing that has ever happened is that I got a simple meeting with a psychiatrist, maybe my problems aren’t valid? Maybe that’s why no one has ever reacted.

Why is everyone else getting help and being sent places to be protected, what have I done wrong? Are my problems really valid?

Can someone please please please tell me how to get rid of this jealousy, I want to be able to be with people without having these thoughts..

Please..
I’m begging you.."
1541,Idk what to do,"So my friends mom or now ex friends Ig her mom was very rude to me and a few of our other friends. (My friend had BPD btw) anyway I her mom forced me away. She’s tried multiple times but I tried my hardest to stay because I didn’t wanna leave and deal with the stress of hurting my friend, being hated by so many people, having rumours spread and losing multiple other friends. One night me and 2 others from our group were talking. And her mom started freaking out at me and obviously the others knew because they could see my face and I’m a very sensitive person so it’s very very obvious when I’m upset. And anyway my friends mom knew we were talking. So she started freaking out at the other one. She was calling me names and making stuff up as usual. Then the one of my friends her mom wasn’t freaking out asked her if she could stop then she got mad at all of us and told us to leave. She made stuff up about me to the others in our group and piper. Which hurt. And I sent paragraphs apologizing to everyone. One day me and her daughter were talking and then all of a sudden she lashed out and just left. So I was like ok maybe I didn’t do anything wrong it’s ok since she always randomly lashes out because it’s apart of BPD mood swings. So I didn’t take it personally. Only when her basically sister came on and was blaming things on me. I tried not to beat myself up to much over that. Past few nights she’s been freaking out at me every single night saying stuff like it’s my fault, telling me the rumours her mom made up, saying things that me and my sister said that we never even would say and saying I’m as bad as her abusers. Which really hurts and obviously I took that. Yesterday she also sent multiple cutting pictures, she cut my initials into her body and dropped by my house and left a jar of her blood. You kinda can’t not feel upset and bad after that. I’m trying to not hurt myself over this. But when she’s freaking out at me it’s hard not to. And I’m very impulsive so if I get a thought sometimes I don’t even think before I do it at all. It’s not like it’s a good or bad idea it’s like ok I’ll do it. And she encourages me too which doesn’t help. Ik this is just because she’s upset but it hurts and I hate that I hurt her. It isn’t my fault that any of this happened and Ik that but her blaming me makes me feel so bad. I wish I could just make her happy but she won’t even talk to me normally. I asked if she’s ok earlier because yesterday she kept telling me she’s khs. She replied “fuck you I hate you” “why would you ask that” “yk that I’ll never be ok from what you did to me” and “why are you even alive” and Ik she genuinely feels like that and hates me. She said before she even wants me to kms when she’s in a good mood. She was in a good mood before she texted me and still replied with that. So it isn’t only because she’s upset. Maybe I’m just a bad person and I don’t notice. But even if I am I don’t wanna be I wanna make everyone happy. That’s all I want I don’t wanna hurt anyone. Every time I hurt someone else I end up beating myself up whether that’s mentally or physically. I wish I could do something bad to myself that’s worse than what I’ve done to her. She said that isn’t possible tho. Maybe I shouldn’t do that but I really want to. If anyone even reads this and comments please just be honest. If I seem like a bad person just straight up say it. I wanna be better."
1542,How to deal with the fact that people have strong and different opinions/views? Am I just oversensitive or are people really that divided today?,"I have noticed in myself that I like to be neutral about many things and not have strong opinions, at least publicly. That's  because of several reasons. 
1.I believe the more extremist/strong views you have, the more irrational you are. 
2.I am also scared of having different views than someone close to me because from my experience people are oversensitive and react strongly to differences in opinion. They may even start hating you if you even slightly oppose their worldview. And I don't like social rejection. 
3.It makes me sad when I sit with people and they express their often irrational, hateful and often uninformed views. I would rather sit quietly than argue with them. Many people have accused me of being too moderate and without any personal views and that's far from the case. I just don't like conflict. 
4.I feel like in today's world people are very divided and blindly support ideologies/religions/art/music/people/idols/books/authors/ without assessing things rationally and knowing where to draw the line. On the Internet especially, but in real life too. 
5. Everytime I go out anywhere, people start talking about politics and ideologies and maybe that's just my culture but I am sick of it. Yes, people should talk about it but in this day and age people get overly sensitive about that kind of stuff and can't even have a good time. They forget that they are people and are obsessed. with their ideological identities. Liberal, conservative, feminist, mgtow, traditional, progressive whatever. I don't remember a single day where I wasn't thinking about a certain ideology or why people think the way they do. Maybe I should get off the Internet for a while lol. 

Is this just my perception, am I maybe the oversensitive one? Am I overly politically correct because of fear or is the world really more conflicted today when it comes to ideologies? I feel like everyone strongly identifies with something and we all hate each other secretly. 


TL;DR how do I become more free in expressing my views in a world where everyone is so different and sensitive and there are so many ideologies?"
1543,l can't sleep anymore without thinking about all the bullying l had in school.,"pardon my English, but l have to get this off my chest. l'm 26 now and l can't forget the bullying l had 10 years ago. l got bullied in middle school and high school l got sexual harassment as a guy and always got hit on my face l was coward and never took a stand for myself my self-esteem is 0% because of this and that effected my grades at school l wasn't able to graduate from high school because of bullying and l bet that the ones who used to bully me having a decent job and forgot completely about me and l'm the one who got shitty job (will get fired soon due covid19) and keep remembering their doing to me. l keep asking myself why l didn't stand against them why l didn't fight back why my academic life ruined because of them? l'm just keep crying inside. l keep trying to be a warrior but those negative thoughts always find ways into my brain.

1544,Anyone Ever Feel Like This??,"a few weeks ago or whenever it was I went through a  mental breakdown, can i even say that?  I was ready, crying my eyes out repeating the words I want to die. Feeling like I was drowning in pain, my emotional pain turned into a physical one where i got a migraine. I keep having these explosive moments too often, it builds up and then i breakdown and tell myself i can't do it anymore. well this past week or so, I didn't feel actively suicidal in fact i didn't have any urges to kill myself. I woke up fine, I wasn't happy or motivated but i was just fine. I went about a week like that i'm still currently in that state, I don't know if it had anything to do with the crazy amount of ginger tea and water i've been drinking or spending time at the trail soaking up the sun for a few hours. to be honest i didn't like it, the state of being fine. Am I crazy? Just about 2 weeks ago i was in so much emotional pain contemplating suicide for no reason, and now that i'm out of that state, why do i miss being depressed? 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that being in a depressed state was weirdly my comfort zone. When i was ""fine"" I Felt out of place like what am i supposed to do now that i'm not suicidal. So many things are contingent on me being suicidal. For example how am I suppose to finish school, make plans to travel, or other big plans when I don't even know if I'm going to be alive next year, or in a few months, weeks ect???.  Now that I am more aware of my hereditary mental illness I know that without medical intervention I will never be able to complete a goal. So guess what until I can get that help I don't attempt to enroll myself into classes or make big plans with people bc at some point i will hit a wall where I am a hair strand away from killing myself. So when I feel ""FINE"" what does that mean for me, it changes everything I start to feel all these things that I want to start doing now! but I remember i can't cause i'll have an episode and end up dropping out or canceling ect. Also being alone with my negative thoughts and emotions feels like this dark toxic blanket where I can close my eyes and forget about all my worries and dream of a place where I will soon feel nothing."
1545,Are we allowed to be hurt over loneliness?,"Specifically, I'm asking if males are allowed to feel this way."
1546,I don't know how to get help.,"So I really don't know how to talk about mental health issues as i've always kept everything to myself and I don't know if this even is the right place for this. But here goes nothing.

So let me make this clear, nothing is medically diagnosed and I hate to self diagnose myself but for the sake of driving this forward i'll just come out and open up about my thoughts on what I have. I most likely have depression. 

I've heard the same ""diagnosis"" from my mom, sister, girlfriend, multiple friends, classmates have talked about how down I am all the time, my teachers have tried talking with me and at a recent health check up earlier this year a doctor told me I wouldn't be fit to join the army because of my mental health. Keep in my mind that was just a health check up and he got that from talking with me for 30min to 1h.

Basically everyone I just listed has told me to get some help to talk and open up. The thing is I don't want to talk. I honestly feel like that there are people more in need of that kind of help than I am. Like I have bottled everything up until now so why change that? But recently I have gotten just so much more exhausted and unmotivated to do anything. I just want to be as happy as my friends seem to.

Some background info:
I haven't had anything tragic happen in my life which makes it weird to think I would have mental health issues.
In grade 5 I got caught trying to choke myself with a rope which caused me to spend couple months in a place that haused other troubled kids (I don't know what it is called in English)
Grade 7 I got caught cutting myself, after that haven't done anything.
I have alot of sleep problems, as a matter of fact I am writing this at 2am.
I used to have a ton of friends but after grade 7 I just lost the will to keep people around me anymore and keeping in contact became really difficult and exhausting."
1547,How can I learn to express my emotions?,"It's become quite aware to me lately that I struggle immensely to describe my emotions to others and even myself. I don't know what I feel, or if I'm even feeling anything (if that makes sense). I don't discuss my feelings with any of my close friends, and very little with my SO. When my SO asks what's wrong, I feel like I lose the ability to even talk. I've recently been thinking that my inability to express my emotions is due to emotional neglect (or maybe even emotional abuse) from my parents. I really want to get better at talking about and feeling my emotions because I fear that I'm distancing myself from my SO and I don't want to screw things up. I don't feel ready for therapy, especially due to coronavirus and insurance issues."
1548,Are mild hallucinations something more serious?,"For the last few years I've started seeing flashes and small animals (enough that it startles me and makes me back up or jump, this happens about once a week) and when I have a lot of stress I'll have strange tastes in my mouth or smell something that isn't there.

Lithium (1200mg)
Propanolol (40 mg)
Buspirone (90 mg )
Mirtazapine (15 mg)
Trifluoperazine (10 mg)
Pregabalin (450 mg) 
Alprazolam (0,625 mg) 
Bromazepam ( 30 drops )
And I will schedule another psychiatrist at the first opportunity. All I wanna know if there's any physical danger on going off all of this, because I wanna feel who I really am.
I'll keep the alprazolam because I know it's dangerous going off of it. And trifluoperazine because I feel it's the only one that truly helps."
1552,Please Help,
1553,i need help,"hi

i did something im terribly ashamed of: its nothing bad or that caused anyone harm, really. long story short, a few months back i guess out of boredom i downloading a dating app and well, sxted with a (considerably much much older) stranger. after the thing i felt repulsed and made sure to delete everything.

everything was ok then, a few days back: honestly, out of nowhere, i talked to this person again with the same intent, and it happened again. i felt repulsed again but

 i feel like i dont have any power of will. im incredibly anxious now, i feel ashamed, dissapointed w myself, paranoid about being discovered, or having pics shared online that someone can recognize, or that it will haunt me in the future. i feel gross, depressed and can't seem to do anything without it reminding me of what i did.  
i don't (and won't ever) talk about it to someone i know out of fear of repulsion or dissapointment. i can't look at my family or friends in the eyes. i feel like i have jeopardized my future and crushed my dreams out of something so stupid.

how can i forget about this, move on, and feel like this will never matter, when i all feel is paranoid, and completely doomed?

So I posted a little about this before, but I was supposed to start CBT just before the pandemic hit in around March / April. I was going to be treated for OCD, intrusive and negative thoughts and behavioural stuff. As of right now I just feel like I'm going to burst any day now. I've already been called irrational, silly, emotional, etc. And the self loathing is just getting worse everyday, I guess I just really need some advice from people going through similar things?

Thank you, I hope you're doing better than me."
1555,Is this PTSD? Or what is wrong? Please help.,"So a year ago, I went through an experience that ultimately mentally and emotionally hurt me. I was in a public setting when this happened. After that said experience, whenever I passed by the place I would begin to experience extreme anxiety &amp; panic. I’m talking shortness of breath, increase in heart rate, nausea &amp; physical hand trembling. I would have to mentally prepare myself or stop to recollect myself if I were to pass by or visit this place. It physically, mentally &amp; emotionally would hurt me to have to go here. 

Whenever I talked to my friends about it they would say it was PTSD. But when I think of this I think of people who have gone through much more traumatic experiences. 

Is this just my anxiety acting up? 

Now a year later, I will have to visit this place often once again. &amp; I am scared I’m not mentally and emotionally strong enough to revisit the place. Even thinking about it triggers my anxiety. I’ve never experience anything like this before. Please, any comments or suggestions is greatly appreciated."

1557,"Finally graduated, expect a congratulations but get yelled at instead","I FINALLY GOT MY BACHELORS DEGREE! I am 22 years old and just graduated from IU. But let me tell the backstory.. when I was 17 and in high school I was in a very abusive relationship. He was very controlling and abusive and pressured me into sex when I didn’t want to and wanted to wait for marriage. He ended up getting me pregnant and decided to keep the baby. We have not been together for almost three years. He is not really in my sons life and is a deadbeat. High school was TERRIBLE. It was the worst experience of my life, being pregnant in high school and the whole town knowing. Fast forward, I go to IU a year after community college when my son was one year old. I also suffered from PPD and was taking care of my son without his fathers help. While at IU, I got sexually assaulted three times, was in a very emotionally abusive/toxic relationship, my grandparents died in a house fire on my birthday, had undiagnosed ADHD (didn’t get diagnosed until a month ago at the end of my senior year), and took care of my son at the same time. The last five years of my life have been HELL. I just took my last final and texted my family in a group message and told my family I just took my last final at IU and the only response I got out of six people was “good” from one person. This was terribly upsetting to me. I have been going sooo hard for so long and the only thing I get is a “good”? I was upset and mentioned this to my family and they started yelling at me and my dad said “you’re just stressed out.” And I’m like no I am not, I am just upset because I expected more than that. My mom, being the one that replied, started yelling at me as well saying I was taking it deeper than what it was. My dad then starts yelling at me even more and kept saying “why would I give you a compliment when you’re just asking for it.” Like WTF. All I was expecting was an “I’m so proud of you!!” Or something like that but instead I am being yelled at. I feel like complete shit. I have never been so disappointed in my life.

I've lost two friends to suicide and my previous best friend of 9 years has been slowly dying from anorexia for years (been in and out of hospital, close to death multiple times). They also tried suicide multiple times and almost succeeded once (dead for over 5 minutes). All of this was in my early to late teens. Recently I've noticed I have an irrationally strong response to people talking about suicide, self harm, eating disorders and very depressive topics. I have panic attacks, feel intense fear and dread and all i can imagine is them dying in front of me without me being able to do anything. It's impacting my own mental health a lot. I feel like I should be able handle this better but I'm unable to control my reaction. I'm wondering if these experiences can have resulted in some kind of trauma? Should I talk about this with my therapist?"

I have BPD, so it's hard to find a good therapist, not to mention I was kicked out of the only place in my town for a disagreement with my old therapist. The hotlines are a waste of time in my opinion and extremely unhelpful. I have been rushed off the phone twice, and just because I ""sound fine"" doesn't mean I am, even a little. I've been hospitalized 15 times since a teenager for suicide, and gained some traumatic experiences for myself in all those times that I'd rather go back to jail than back in one of those places. My family doesn't really care, it's more of a ""what now"" ""just get over it"" type thing. I'm definitely a great disappointment in my family that's for sure. And I have no friends. I've come to realize that more and more lately. I give my heart to all these people and all they do is stop on it, betray me, abandon me, make fun of me either to my face or behind my back. I'm always there when people need me but no one's ever there for me. And I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I guess that's why I'm here. I hate reddit honestly, not the reading other people's posts part, but posting my own stuff. People pay me just as little attention on here as they do in real life. I just feel inadequate, like I, my life, and everything I am and do is nothing but a waste. And honestly I keep thinking to myself why not just end it, though I wouldn't. I tried to many times at no results, I'm terrified of failing once more and surviving but having other parts of my body fail. I see a therapist now, she's nice and all, but not a good therapist, or at least not what I need for one. I have ambition in life, but at the same time I either fail or am just not good enough for anything I try. I thought about getting a dog just as a companion, but I am so all over the place mentally I can barely keep up with myself some days, and I would never want a poor creature to feel unloved because I don't pet it enough or give it enough attention. Plus it's to much committment, if I decided to travel I'd have to make arrangements for them also, and I'd never want them to leave my side either. I can't get a relationship, I have terrible social skills, and I'm terribly awkward meeting new people. Besides that I just have no luck with women. I have very little money, no job (I get SSI), I'm mediocre looking at best, I just have nothing to offer, put it that way. I do think it's nonsense that you can't love anyone until you can love yourself. That's an opinionated ideology at best. But I'm just all alone. I feel like, I don't know, I just need someone to talk to is all I shall say, but I have no one. I have no one who cares, no one who will listen or even give me a hug, and it's days like these I just don't know how I will get through it. 
I'm sorry that this was so long. I was just wondering if anyone ever felt similar so at the very least I can know I am not alone. I'm sorry. Thank you to whoever actually reads all this. I do appreciate that much from you."
1566,is it normal?,"i don’t know how to start this and i feel kind of guilty posting something that’s seems rather unimportant here when people have it way worse than me but i think i just kinda need to get some clarification or advice?
so i’m almost of age but i just feel like the most incompetent human being because i’m just not able to do easy everyday tasks since i’m too scared of them. for example: i can’t do phone-calls because i start to panic, i never go anywhere alone and if i do i feel uncomfortable and scared.  i’ve also lost interest and motivation in almost everything. i only continue to go to school because i feel like it’s the only possibility i have. i don’t know what to do with my life. i don’t have any goals whatsoever. 
but i still feel better than i used to because i found very good friends that genuinely care for me (+my family) but if it wasn’t for them i wouldn’t see any use in continuing to exist to be honest. but still i wouldn’t say i’m an unhappy person most of the time because feelings like these mostly come in waves. it’s something i know deep down but i just ignore it or forget about it for a short amount of time. 

i honestly don’t know if this is just a completely normal thing that everyone goes through and i’m exaggerating or if this might be a bit more serious. but i still feel guilty for assuming it might be because i know people have it worser than me.
&amp; i also apologize for grammar mistakes because it’s not my first language!"
1567,"If we are capable of creating hell for ourselves, are we equally as capable of creating heaven?",Not attempting to stir the religious pot. Just using heaven and hell as a metaphor for misery and bliss... I guess I could have just used those... in search for hope.
1568,Today I am struggling...,"I have an amazing life. I am a mother to an amazing 2 year old son, and I have an amazing fiancé. After a failed marriage and years of struggling to come out of the closet, I finally felt like I had it all. But now the depression and anxiety are catching back up to me. I keep obsessing over the tiny problems and it is keeping me from getting anything done. Even when I do accomplish something, it never seems good enough to me. I am constantly apologizing for everything, basically just for existing and if I can't pull myself together soon, it is going to ruin my relationship. I've tried talking to my fiancé about it, but she doesn't have any experience with this kind of thing, and as much as she tries to be supportive, I still end up feeling alone. I haven't felt suicidal in a long time, but these thoughts are creeping back into my head...I'm not sure what to do anymore. I don't have insurance, so getting in to see a Dr and being able to afford it is proving to be pretty difficult. I just feel like I am letting everyone in my life down and they would be better off without me."
1569,Homicidal,"Every time my boyfriend pisses me off I want to hurt him. Today I almost did. I swung on him, kicked him, clawed him, screamed at him. All because he told me I needed to stop smoking weed and find a better alternative for helping me sleep. It just escalated so fast. There were things said and done on his end that certainly were not helpful to the situation that pushed me to that point. But I should NEVER have acted that way. I’m so scared it’s only going to get worse. I have recurring nightmares of mutilating myself. I have a history of self harm and these dreams, along with this explosive behavior, are making it really hard for me to not just get angry one day and drive my car into a brick wall, probably Over something small. I’m just so. Angry. All the time. Why am I like this? Can I be helped? I’m scared to ask for help from a doctor. I do not want to be told I’m crazy. if I ever hurt my partner I swear to god I will never fucking forgive myself. If it gets worse I will kill myself before I hurt him. I just hope it doesn’t come to either."
1570,My rant,"Dont know where to start, or comfortably write this without feeling cliche and self absorbed :/ I was born into a broken family, my earliest memory is my mum tripping me down the stairs, at the age of 4 I was given a choice her or my dad, I chose my dad. He lived with a woman pregnant with his child and who already had 2 daughters 10 years older than me. She didn't accept me as part of the family and my days consisted of school, bedroom, dinner in bedroom and sleep, I was locked in the room and had a Lego toy box that I did my business in. By the age of 6 he figured her out and saw that she was abusive to me, we moved into our first house just father and son. I loved it till he met his next girlfriend, she lived abroad but they knew each other through a mutual friend. It was round about this time he started drinking heavily, beating me and my dad was never the same again. I got home one day from a supervised visit with my mum, she got me a subway to take home for dinner. Long story short my dad went in a frenzy trying to get this sub chasing me around the house butt naked, he got me trapped in a corner and started shoving his dick in my face saying ""eat my sub baby"" repeatedly I tried reaching out to family about the abuse. My dad manipulated me and swore me to secrecy. The moment it all went wrong is the moment I lied and told my family nothing was happening because not long after we moved abroad so he could be with his now fiance. Within a matter of weeks their relationship feel apart, 4 weeks into a 4 year stay. She hated me, she beat me every day for the smallest thing, she forced me to watch as she poured alcohol over my dad and begged me not to set him on fire while he was out cold. Thinking back I should have begged but I was a kid. For the next 4 years I went to school and home to be locked in my room every day. My dad started going out binge drinking and she would forget about me, I had nothing but peanuts to eat for 4 days. I was acting out at school, bullying other kids and when they found out things just got worse till ultimately they were threatening to kill each other and me. I phoned  child services and had my self put in care at the age of 11. My dad fucked off to the homeland, he left me without a word. I was 11 years old in foreign country all alone in a care home that wasn't much better than my previous residency, stale bread every night for dinner because I was late due to having to travel by 2 busses and 2 trams to just get to school around 40mi away. I managed to create a email and Facebook account at a local library and contacted my mum, aunty, anyone that could maybe help. Finally got sent back home to stay with my grandparents, poor people the shit I put them through fills me with shame and hate for myself.  They allowed me to go see my mum who I hadn't seen in years and at first it seemed great like I finally had a parent. All she was interested in was getting me stoned and using the pocket money my grandparents gave me every week to get weed. I know they say weed isn't addictive but for me it became everything, the love I'd never experienced, the friend I never had, the joy i never felt. I became so obsessed with it that nothing else mattered, I moved out of my grandparents at 15 to live with my mum so I could smoke weed whenever I wanted. She quickly became very abusive, telling me I was a failed abortion and trying to have me arrested was one of her favourites. I quickly made myself homeless and by 17 I had my own flat, by 18 I met the only girl I will ever love, by 19 we moved in together and now I'm 22, shes 24. Our wedding was supposed to be this month, for obvious reasons it has been postponed till next year. I'm a fucking mess though, I feel like a 15 year old trapped in the body of a guy who is falling apart at the happiest time I  his entire life. Im not sure if I can cope with the memories, and feelings of complete emptiness for much longer. I cant even hold down a job. I just want it to end, I dont want die but I dont want to live. I just wish i wasn't me, i dont have friends i have drug dealers. The mental health help where I am is terrible. I cant see how i will ever get better. I think my fiance would really be better off without me in her life. It's hard to remember every detail but I've conjured up everything I can right now."
1571,"Hello darkness, my dear friend","It's been a while since I came here. I'm not sure why I haven't deleted the account back then.

I used to lurk around a lot using this account to feel, I don't know, better? To feel somehow understood, that it's OK to feel like sh\*t. Then at some point I felt like I was just feedbacking the feeling so I stopped coming here.

But here I am again, trying to shake off the feeling that something's going to go really wrong. I also kind of feel st\*pid, I mean, others have it worse than me, shitty experiences, shitty parents, shitty people around their lives. None of that happened to me, but I distanced myself, I don't have a close bond with my parents, it's like I just live with them. I wonder if I'd keep in touch with them if I were to move out. I probably wouldn't unless they do. Just the occasional happy birthday messages stuff. 

My issues are related to work, at first. Then realized that was the bomb that fully opened the door to all my insecurities. I hate to read ""high functioning X"" (I don't remember the word, just the feeling when I read it). WTF does it mean?! People would say things like, you should switch jobs. What if I can't get another job? I never excelled at anything, I'm not the most, the top, the worst, the whatever at anything, so I'm not the smartest or most disastrous person. Meaning as a person with the use of reason, I should know I could find an average job and keep it, but how am I supposed to reach to that point? To get to the interviews, get rejected, get over it and so on?

A week after the quarantine I thought I could make it without therapy and I was ""happy"" about it... lies, I'm reaching a new low.

I hate us all.

Keep safe."
1572,Those with anxiety: How have you faired since COVID-19?,"Prior to staying at home, i had sport and the ability to leave my work at the office. But since COVID-19, i have no real way to work off the anxiety jitters and not enough of a separation between work and home (i work from home now). I also had a therapist i can see in person, and they are available through webinar, but I don’t know if i want to pay the copay for therapy online.

Recently, I’ve had pretty bad indigestion and a higher heart beat because of the anxiety.

What have you found to work for you?"
1573,Is it normal to feel anything when friends or family members die or get in to accidents?,"My ex go into a car accident today she may never walk again. My friend call me to tell me, I was in front of my girlfriend and she’s asking me if I feel bad but I don’t really care but idk it’s like I don’t feel nothing, it’s not that I don’t care but more like I don’t feel anything. That same happened when my grandpa that I loved when he die I didn’t feel anything. Is this normal?!"
1574,How do I tell my mom I want therapy?,"I’ve been feeling like I need to talk to someone for a while now and I have no one to talk to and everything is kinda building up on me and I just need someone to talk to about it but I don’t wanna burden my friends or make my mom feel like a failure or anything. I’m a college student but back at home now because of Covid. I tried looking into online therapy on my own earlier in the year but I didn’t like the therapist I was assigned and it only offered a free week before I needed to start paying and I do not have the financial ability to pay for therapy without insurance or my parents’ help, but I’m also still on my parents’ insurance so I want to ask them. I’m just not really sure what to say, especially because I’m not sure how therapy sessions are really working right now in the midst of everything going on. Thanks in advance for any advice:)"
1575,I cant put into words how i feel,"‪Does anyone else struggle so hard to explain how they feel? 

Like I literally dont think a word exists for the emotion i feel all the time like its not happy or sad i just dont know what it is‬.

I’ve had a pretty traumatic time over the last 2 years. I’ve been betrayed and disappointed. I’ve had to figure out a whole new way of living after having to cut out a lot of horrible people i was once close to. So, now i feel very alone. I have a wonderful family. But, part of me is just gone.

My mum told me i’ve been a totally different person the last 2 years and i agree with her. I was so confident and knew exactly what was good for me. My relationship has been pretty rocky. He’s betrayed me a lot. We aren’t together at the moment but still in contact after he begged for me back.. i am scared to be without him as i have no idea what my life would look like. 

I cant explain how i feel. Its just an emptiness thats always there. Whether im having a good day or a bad. Its just always there lingering.

I do have a therapist and im on medication for depression and anxiety (although I’ve never had a proper diagnosis), which i haven’t really seen make much of a difference. I’m worried i’ll always be stuck here. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
1576,Why don’t I blame myself for anything?,"I hear a lot of people who struggle with suicidal thoughts, depression, or other mental health issues always blaming themselves.  But no matter how shitty I feel and no matter how suicidal I am, I refuse to blame myself.  Instead I’ll blame my parents for not raising me right or I might blame others for treating me like shit.  Am I a narcissist or something?  Like what the fuck..."
1577,Have any of you experience/experienced this type of situation?,"Hi I am a 14 year old biracial girl living in Australia. My school and my household is predominately white. At my school I receive criticism and racial slurs. I am thought of by my white friends too Asian and by my Asian friends too white. My dad left my mum and my siblings when we were little but my brother and I got to see him a bit before my mum asked us if we wanted to see him or not. Though he was addicted to video games, did drugs and was pretty irresponsible, I think that decision was not for two children to decide. I haven't seen him or heard from him in 9 years. Ever since my mum met my step dad over a dating site my life so far has been a roller coaster. He is a large, red , loud and very controlling Australian man with bloodshot eyes and the worst temper. He threatens to hit, kick, or belt me with a belt constantly. He has also done all those things to me and my siblings before. I am always told by hims that I am ungrateful, selfish, lazy, rude and have a bad attitude. He has caused me to self harm and have a low self esteem and confidence. I am unable to do anything right for him. His relationship with my mum had differed from verbally, physical fights that involve a lot of swearing, to taking us on sub par holidays somewhere local. (Though I am grateful to have gone anywhere). I have noticed that it is always me receiving backlash and criticism. Not long ago him and my mum had the worst fight I have seen. Police and divorce were involved. However not to my surprise, my mum said she's give him another chance. I balled my eyes out because my hopes of that manipulative man leaving my life at last were destroyed. My mum explained they couldn't divorce because they weren't financially stable for only one parent to look after my siblings and I. That day I stood up to my stepdad subtly only for him to push me so hard I thought I sprained my ankle. I have recently had my phone taken off me because I looked at it briefly to check if I had any messages. My step dad came in fuming and grabbed it from my hand. That night he yelled at me and degraded me pointing out every aspect that was wrong and I needed to change about myself. Tears streamed down my face as he told me I am ungrateful, rude and a drama queen with a bad attitude. All his lecturing and emotional abuse has lead me to self harm. I am not old enough to leave home and whenever I state being exited to live somewhere else or move out he becomes triggered and insults me for acting like I don't want to be apart of this family. I find it hard to accept that I am the most targeted and least favorite family member even though I get the best grades and try the hardest to fix my personality and try hard to make everyone happy. I hate my life lmao"
1578,I’m new here so sorry if this had been done before but I’m feeling so broken,I’m (29 F) living by myself in MA during this quarantine. I highly suspect my mom is a narcissist. She and I got into a fight on Easter. I’m not welcome at my parents house anymore so now I’m all alone. I live by myself. This has been so difficult for me because of quarantine and everything going on. I have never felt so alone in my life. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel so broken.
1579,Is this what OCD is? Please help.,"So I’ve been experiencing the thing where you have to check if something is off for quite some time now, this has gotten so much worst than it used to be a year ago. Now I literally take about 2 - 5 minutes constantly checking if I’ve turned the light off, closed the door, locked my phone or even whether I’ve accidentally posted something on social media or not.

For a longer time I’ve always felt the need to look behind me for no reason. It’s not as though I feel like someone is watching me(although I did used to feel this way but I believe that’s just random paranoia) I just constantly do it until it feels “right”???

Before this I had an issue with constantly clicking or doing something. Hard to explain so I’ll give an example. Whenever I play my game console, if I have used the right side of the controller too much or if I’m noticing that I’m using that side more than the left then I start clicking random buttons on the left just to make it feel right. I also keep pausing the game for no god damn reason and it’s so hard to stop this habit.

One more thing that happens to me is compulsive thoughts. Like, intense ones that I can’t get out my head. 

This has became so much worse compared to around a year ago and it’s even bothering me whilst typing this. Everything I do has to be even. Is this what OCD feels like? Or am I normal?"
1580,I don’t want to do CBT again.,"My parents are making me see a psychologist in a few days/weeks. I know I’ll get diagnosed with something. I’ve struggled with my self esteem for years, I almost never present stuff because of this. It takes me weeks to plan a presentation, even the smaller ones.

I haven’t really had any motivation to do schoolwork for the last couple of years of my life either (it’s gradually gotten worse over time). I don’t have any plans in life or anything anymore. I’m always skipping classes too. I also had thoughts of suicide during the winter this year, even wrote a note, but I don’t think I was really planning on going through with it though.

I’ve also had problems with obsessions and compulsions (mostly hand washing and counting stuff, and also needing things to be “even”). I self harm every day because I feel the need to. It’s probably an obsession.

I know you shouldn’t self diagnose, but some of the symptoms I’ve mentioned are very likely to be caused by certain mental illnesses. I’m pretty sure I will be diagnosed with OCD. CBT is the main treatment for that, I know, but I don’t want to do that. I don’t have the energy, time, or motivation to do it. I just want medication to help ease my symptoms. I don’t know why I’m even writing this here, guess I just have to vent somewhere."
1581,Is it weird that I feel guilty for feeling happy?,"I‘ve been diagnosed with GAD, and I’m recovering from depression. Every now and then, I get a sudden boost of motivation to combat my negative thinking, or I realize how distorted my thinking has been and I try to be positive and rational instead. And most of the time, I feel good when I do this, because I’m actually exercising the things that my therapist has been telling me to do this whole time. However, without fail, I always feel guilty for trying to feel better. I always end up feeling like me feeling good is all fake, or that I’ll end up being sad again anyway, so why bother. I just always get the discouraging thoughts that me aiming to feel better all of a sudden is futile and disingenuous."
1582,Feeling jealous and stressed,"I’m sorry, but I can’t help it.

Looking through posts about people having so much free time, recently bought a house, or are in somewhere peaceful (I have 2 very loud cousins). Looking through Minecraft (my favorite game) post of people having so much time to build amazing things. It’s making me jealous.

It’s making me want to do all of them, but unfortunately, I’m (16F) still in school. Struggling with schoolwork’s, attending Zoom meetings, and friends still bugging me with how much they want kids. (They’re looking through baby posts to distract themselves)

I’m suffering from depression, anxiety, and a eating disorder, and I feel like the stress from school is making it worse. I kept getting thoughts about it ending it all, but looking through posts on Minecraft or  rave posts on childfree sub keeps me up, but also makes me jealous on how they’re free now while I’m still struggling.

I keep wanting to end it all, but my body is not letting me. 

I’m stressed out and don’t know what to do."
1583,I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,"It’s past 3 am. I have my alarm set for 9. This insomnia is recent, and almost certainly due to the puberty blockers I’ve been on for two months or so now. That’s not the important bit (is anything?).

For a long time now, I’ve felt something was wrong. I don’t know how long. Time blends into itself. Yesterday feels foreign, like last week does, and last month, and last year, and five years ago. I’ll learn a game I really like came out six years ago. Doesn’t feel like it. What even happened between then and now?

Regardless. Dysthymia, maybe. Anxiety? Both. Or not. I have trouble getting out of bed. Except when the obligation is important (and as I have little to no life, that means school). Always calculate how long it takes to get ready; get up at the latest possibly snooze. Doesn’t matter for when I set my alarm. I’m late, sometimes. Miscalculated. Despite math being one of my few skills. Classes are online now. I follow them in bed, sometimes. 

I don’t have any friends. Feels childish to type. It never felt like something that was wrong with me; few people around here share my interests. And I share few of theirs. I’m an introvert, and having few friends doesn’t bother me. My sister’s enough. She moved out a while ago (it’s been at least a year now, logically speaking). I text her sometimes, or she’ll come over for a few days. That’s the extent of my friendships.

I stopped sharing my interests years ago. It’s gaming. Weird looks always ensue. Not that I do it that often, anyway. Usually just sit on my ass and watch YouTube videos. Insubstantial ones, frequently ones I’ve already seen. Sometimes, I’ll actually engage in an interest of mine. Piano, or reading. I always feel exhausted after a few minutes. Like I’ve done all the reading or playing for the day. I enjoy it, really. I just can’t do it for long periods of time.

Now I just dodge the question of interests. Can’t even lie about it. Or I say a half truth; it’s piano, it’s reading, it’s drawing... though there’s always the feeling that they’ll see one of my drawings or hear me at the piano and find out. I lied.

And about friends. Perhaps the issue is not some sort of misalignment between my peers’ and my interests, and more substantial. I feel like a blight among those around me. I don’t want to ruin the... hegemony? Beauty? Wholeness? Of their friend circles. I look weird, act weird. It’s the autism, partially. Imagine the Mona Lisa, but with a green blotch on it. Looks weird, no? Shouldn’t be there. C’est moi. So I stay out of others’ way, when possible. Quarantine has helped.

I know others who can’t really make friends irl. Not uncommon. Y’all are redditors, you should know. I joined a discord server for one of my interests. Thought I might make friends that way. Went on it quite infrequently, haven’t been there in weeks (months? Again unsure). I ain’t got a clue how people go from “person on server” to “person whose username I recognize” to “person whom I DM”. Much less friends. Fucking inscrutable. Too much pride to google it. 

I thought writing this out might make me sleepy. It didn’t. Oh well. Might read the replies when I get up. If there are any."
1584,"Bad dreams making me depressed, tired and wondering if my memories are fake.","WARNING: LONG POST 

I have had bad dreams consistently for 2 weeks and they have caused me to question what I have been through.

I have been dreaming about my narcissist father who abused me in my childhood and my ex friend of 5 years who bullied me

While I know my experiences with my father are real, I dont know if my experience with my ex friend was real

- she always criticised what I wore on casual clothes day

- always told me I acted too much like an adult but when I was in year 7 and changed for her she told me I acted too much like a child

- got jealous when I got good grades and was very sarcastic with me one time, saying 'what did you get, missy?'

- always talked about herself but never let me talk about my things (she asked me why I never talked about myself, so when I did, it wouldnt last beyond a few minutes I felt, then would go back to talking about herself)

- always dreaded seeing her

- according to my friend at the time (we are still good, just lost touch) she called me an asshole on facebook. He looked very serious, considering he jokes around all the time.

- always got angry because she was tired, yet I felt like i couldn't be in a bad mood around her because I would be criticized. 

- reminds me of my father (always having to be right) 

- got angry when i said the reason why i didn't go to school one day was because of her and she made herself the victim and didn't talk to me. She didn't apologize nor did she hear me out. 

I told some of this to my chaplain at school and agreed that she was jealous of me. 

I did bad things too. I gossiped about her to a girl about her being spoilt and her mother being a horrible example to her and she went and told her and she got very angry.

I talked about her badly with my other friend at the time all the time. 

I ended the friendship by not responding to her messages on email.

I apologised to her via text about the gossiping and she didn't respond. I am very conscious now about what i say since i live in a small town and I know how it feels when someone talks shit about you. 

I know she was hurt, but i don't know if she knows that what she had done is bullying and if she feels remorse. 

My question is, what should be my next step?  I was thinking of talking to my youth worker about it. Thank you for reading this far :)"
1585,I just want to vent,"I don't know where else to go, I've tried therapy, medication, support groups, the whole 9 yards but nothing is working. its been almost 3 years now and nothing has changed, I honestly want to die. I have for a while now but i can't put my family through that again. Since my dad took his own life in november of 2017 I become less and less intrested in anything i dont even want to eat or shower anymore I've lost all hope I once had in myself.

I feel lost and I can't take anymore of this pain I hate feeling this way and I honestly just want it to end, it hurts even more when people tell me I'll see hiim again or hes in a better place when I can't believe any of that I know I wont see him again I'll never hear his voice again or get to hug him again hell I'd take and feeling of his hand on my shoulder just to know he's around. I have no one I can talk to especially family because I dont want to upset them by making them think of what happened.

Honestly I just don't know if I can go on without him, he was always my motivation and he pushed me to be better but now i dont know if I can keep going, it feels like my whole world has come crashing down on me and I don't have anyone left to help me. I just needed to get this off my chest so I wasn't keeping it all in and to stop myself from loosing my shit."
1586,I feel like somethings wrong with me,Sense the start of this quarantine I’ve realized I’ve only lived my life through distractions  through out my whole life I’ve had one big dream of doing YouTube which I’m pursuing now but as of right now it feels like the only thing that brings me happiness aside from my niece. Not to say that my immediate family does not bring me happiness just it wears off I guess and well my emotions feel almost out of my control I feel like I’m always numb except for certain periods where I’m very happy but then it can be followed with sadness or anger but mainly sadness. And for some reason I can’t escape the thought of drowning myself I keep getting the thought to do it in my head and it scares me I keep feeling like my life has no meaning and the thought of drowning myself keeps coming back if there’s anyone who could maybe talk to me on kik who could maybe help me understand what’s going on a bit better maybe if you had a similar experience i would appreciate it a lot

1588,Trying to get it together.,"I know everyone is struggling at this time so I feel too selfish to ask for help. I’ve stopped taking my meds which was a stupid idea, but I can’t go back on because I’m too paranoid about them for no sane reason. 

I’ve just wrote up a to do list of work that’s overdue and it’s just thrown me into another anxiety attack! I don’t even know what my work for art class was. I need to do my applications for makeup but don’t have all the materials for the designs I’ve created or a willing canvas/model. My drama class is giving me two times the amount of work their supposed to. And my tutorial tutor sends me a new ‘compulsory’ questionnaires everyday for some reason. 

My business partners have found it necessary to have a video meeting every other day (which is more than we would usually) to discuss absolutely nothing of importance. I get that their lonely but I have other work to get done. 

I quit my main job before this so I have hardly any income, only from the few commissions I’m getting. So I can’t afford to order the new sketch books, the scripts, the paints, the canvases, the everything! I’ve somehow lost everything I need as well. 

Omg this whole thing is just horrible. My dealers aren’t even dealing during this either. The streets are too hot! So I can’t even get a downer or a lift when I really need it."
1589,A friend is struggling and I don't know what to do.,"A friend (18) of mine (17) has struggled with mental health (suicidal thoughts, cutting, rare drinking to cope) for a long time, but has been able to somewhat keep it in check. However, with the current quarantine, being unable to see any of her friends and stuck inside with her family, she isn't doing well. I want to help her. but I have no idea how to help and nothing I can do or say really helps. I believe she could truly benefit from counseling and/or therapy. The problem is, her family is very dismissive of mental illness, they tend to blow her off and make jokes at her expense if she reveals anything about her mental state, meaning it would be very hard for her to seek out something like that. Does anyone have any idea what resources exist, even just an online chat something, that could help her? We're in the US, if that helps."
1590,“The Caretaker - Everything at The End of Time” A experience I will never forget,"
Here’s a little journal i made while listening to this: 

Stage One: I was at ease, and enjoyed the music. Although giving off an eerie feeling, it felt like I was just remembering old places. The odd thing is that when I was thinking about it, i felt almost calm when I thought about death. It felt like I was looking for something. Not anything big, just something I had forgotten. 

Stage Two: This is where I started to get a little on edge. At first I was comfortable and calm, but when it hit the 3rd or 4th song I started panicking a bit. I thought about reality and what it meant and by the 5th or 6th song I really started crying and getting panicked. I started seeing things as I zoned out (which was often as i had just taken benadryl). I started seeing the ceiling come down on me, and the ceiling almost looked like it was melting. I had to take a break as I started to a little more panicked then i would have liked. As I looked at the cabinets they started “melting” again. I felt like I was dying, and that reality was being pulled away from me. Everything felt so incredibly tense and I started sobbing as I felt my childhood being ripped away from me. I’m only 14 but I have a VERY strong stance on reality (I am/was a metaphysical anti-realism believer. Still can’t decide yet), and oh boy, stage two was a place where I didn’t want to be. I felt like everything around me was drifting away and I started to become aware that my mind is  probably the only thing that exists. I started sobbing as I thought about what could happen to my mom or my boyfriend when they became older. Everything had begone to go downhill and I started a train of depersonalization and derealisation. It felt like the room was spinning and I was beginning to rub my skin (I was about to start scratching, but I just started rubbing my arms and rocking back and forth) as I contemplated death. I felt like nothing was real and that was incredibly frustrating and emotionally exhausting for me. I started to image (and almost physically see) what life really looked like. I began to feel as if I was stuck in a simulation as the room started to melt away and I saw black planes all around me. I stopped and took a break, and then went onto stage three.

Stage Three: Stage three was surprisingly calm for me. I was a little disappointed that it couldn’t drag me back in at first. I started humming along, and eventually was brought back to what I call “Realism Anxiety”. It wasn’t until the 3rd or 4th song that I started really getting anxious at this stage. I think it was either the distortions, or the piano keys repeatedly going down, and then playing a couple chords that brought me back. I realized life is repetitive and then I got more anxious. I realized things just repeat over and over again. Am I huge? Am I tiny? Who knows. Are there universes inside quarks or atoms? Am I extremely tiny? Am I inside an atom’s universe. This is where I started getting back to my impulsive thoughts. Everything sort of disappeared for a moment, and I realized I could be the only *actual* being. At this moment, I felt like a god. I felt like I was the centre of the universe (which I technically am) and that I controlled everything. At this point I felt I had godlike status and started panicking. I don’t want to be the only existing mind. It wasn’t until “Bewildered in other’s eyes” that I started panicking real bad (not as bad as stage two, but enough to make me shake). I felt like this song was one of the most intrusive of my thoughts. I started thinking about how everything was gonna die out, no matter if I like it or not. “What happens after death?” I asked myself. I started panicking when I realized the worst. “What if I’m in a coma and I’m living life as if i’m fully conscious?”. I started panicking even more and was sent into one of the worst anxiety attacks of my life as I realized that the life I live, whether I like it or not, could very well be a fraud. I thought about how that if I WAS in a coma, I’d have to relive life all over again. Everyone I love would be ripped away from me and I would no longer be connected to those I care about most. Im very shaky as I’m writing this and my stomach feels like it’s tightly being squeezed. I feel like crying and I eventually do. All the relationships I have would be gone. My boyfriend (whom I plan to marry. I may be young but I’m old enough to know what marriage material to me is), my mom, my children I plan to have. That would all be fake, and I would wake up from my coma, and realize that it was all a dream that lasted however long I lived (assuming I wake up when I die in the “dream”). Everything sorta fell apart as I got towards one of the eerier songs on stage three. I started yawning, and I started questioning whether or not anything was real, including me. What if I was just a brain in a jar, with enough electro stimulation to be able to simulate real life? What if I was living in a simulated world? I started rocking violently as I was beginning to question my own sanity. I started thinking about death and how it would be an alternative to living. I started thinking about what if when I die, I just don’t experience anything. I hope to die by suicide, when I am older. I hope that I get to choose euthanasia instead of anything else. I hope that when everyone I love dies, I will be able to say my last goodbye  to the world, and end my world. At this point my heart is racing and I’m getting pins and needles and I feel as if everything is moving faster. I feel like I’m dying in this moment. As I start to think of the death of loved ones, the illusions are coming back. Everything looks shaky and wobbly. The walls start the melt and then closing in again. For a moment, I’m glad that I’ve met everyone who I did. I’m glad I did all the things I did. I love everything I ever had more intensely in this moment. Then I look at the words on my phone and they start to droop too. I feel like Im floating. I feel like I’m having an out-of-body experience. I get this pulsating feel. I start to get cold, like water or some type of water like liquid is dripping down my kneecaps. Everything feels empty.

Stage Four (Songs 1-3): I get a sense that I’m actually about to start having an anxiety attack. Yet I continue going. There isn’t any backing out now. Plus I have nothing to do right now anyways. I start to get overstimulated and am overwhelmed by everything that’s going on at once. The music, my rats playing, the tv in the next room over playing music and it starts to fuck with me. I feel like I’m going to crack. I feel like everything is going to collapse and then... My body goes kinda numb and I can’t stop moving otherwise my anxiety gets to bad. I’m typing at a million miles a minute and I feel like my blood is going to boil over. I literally cannot stop moving. My body won’t let me. I’m only one song into stage four and I feel like Im dying already. I feel so impatient and am waiting for something bad to happen. I’m not crying anymore i’m just really anxious. One phrase keeps repeating in my brain subconsciously. “And everything will turn to dust.”, it says. I had this in the back of my mind at stage one because I was trying to get in the mood but now it’s just incredibly intense. I hear something knocking on my door but when I say “Come in!”, nothing is there. I forgot to take my Abilify the night before and I blame it partly on that. This music is making me hear and see things that aren’t real. I close my eyes and start to imagine what it sounds like. I think about where this music might play at and all my phobias come out at once. At this moment, I start to imagine a church. I have a **VERY** intense fear of churches. I keep hearing the knocking and I start to hyperventilate. My head starts to hurt when I do that and I stop. I deeply breathe, as I still have some control over my thoughts. My heart is pounding out of my chest as on and off radio or tv static start to play in the background. I’m not backing out now. I don’t care if I have nightmares about it or not. I keep going as the tv or radio static gets louder in the background. I close my eyes once again and I swear on my existence that I saw tv static. I hate the noise so much, and it’s becoming so intense that I start to stop breathing. The knocking occurs to be getting louder and more frequent. I refuse to even look of the side of my bed because Im so scared of everything in this point in time. The room starts to appear as if it is folding and bending. I focus on one certain point and just stare at it. Holy shit, I’m not even half way into stage four and I’m already about to breakdown. I suddenly start to break on the third song. It’s so overwhelming, yet I keep going. I have to, otherwise I won’t be able to find myself in a state like this again. I start twitching and everything seems to have forgotten me. The world is suddenly ending and everything feels so much clearer. I think of everything I take for granted. The grass, fresh air, my memories, everything. I think about it long and hard while listening still. “I will no longer have these one day” is the new phrase that keeps repeating in my mind. But what if I never had them in the first place? The knocking starts up again. I feel at peace suddenly. I then start to calm down a bit. But just as I start to get calm. I get into my thoughts again. I get disoriented and start shaking really bad. I grab my charger to plug my phone in but I can’t seem to fit to charger in the socket. I eventually get it and I start to breathe more slowly, laying on my side. I get really paranoid and feel as if things are crawling on me and that there was someone (or something) behind me. I start to feel calm again as I lay on my back. I become paranoid that everyone has forgotten me, or that they only think about me in their dreams. I decide that at the end of stage four, I will take another break. So I wait for it, and think about everything I love drifting away.  I stop the music, and as everything goes silent, I break. I start having one of the most intense anxiety attacks in my life and it was not fun. I left a few minutes for when I start up for stage five. This will *hopefully* ease me into it. 

I felt really really calm when I started it back up again. It was easy to get back into it and I was starting to become a lot more calm. I hope this feeling lasts. I still feel fidgety and shit but it’s ok. It wasn’t as bad as earlier. 

Stage Four (Song 4): I got immediate chills and anxiety dude. I started shaking like a motherfucker. I’m sweating and i keep feeling things that aren’t there. I closed my eyes once more and I couldn’t do it for more then maybe 2 seconds. I keep having flashbacks, and everything feels as if I’m going to die. I feel so on edge. What is this place? How did I get here? I’m not talking physical place i’m talking mental place. Why is my mind doing this to me?

Stage Five: I’m going insane I swear I can’t do this I feel like banging my head into the wall and i’m only into the first few seconds. Just fucking kill me already I swear this hurts so fucking bad. Where the fuck am I and what the hell happened? I fucking hate this I swear it’s like being on a bad trip. Everything feels unreal and whenever I touch something it feels like my hand could go through it. Did I do it? Did I reach a self-realizing mind? Everything I touch is solid yet I feel like I could walk right through it. 

FUCK THIS HURTS SO MUCH WHAT AM I EVEN THINKING? I can’t breathe I can’t breathe it feels like my chest is closing in in itself. I hear the screams of people in the music and I can’t help but think of fucking breaking because this is truly the most emotionally and mentally torturous thing i’ve ever sat through.  What is anything anymore? Why am I here? Goddamn, this is so depressing. I hear the chants and moans of the people singing and the music I can’t help but think of why anyone would go through this. It hurts so much and I’m so anxious and I hear everything at once. The echoes of birds in tunnels. I looked away from my phone and everything went blurry. This invokes a reaction I’ve never felt before. What. The. Fuck. I can’t help but feel dread, as I lay listening to this. 

Stage Six: I was calmed at first, then everything started playing and I started panicking again. I lay silent and and pulse my legs as the low rumble echoes throughout my mind. My head hurts, it’s getting dark, and I’m starting to go insane. Great! Just what I need. I start to get into a state of delirium and it pounds me in the chest. It’s like something was tearing out my ribs. everything hurts so bad yet it feels so good. I feel hysterical, and begin to think about — odd things — to say the least. I stay thinking about my death and what will fade away after I die. Everything feels good in this moment. I am calm and collected and my thoughts are the opposite from earlier. I can’t help but think about what it would be like to die, and for a brief moment, I contemplate it. Not at an old age. But now. What if I died now? What if I chose to die now? ”I could,”, I thought, “but what would happen after I die?”. I contemplate killing myself for a couple minutes, and then I start to get on edge again. Everything just seems, TOO perfect. And then 1:25:00 rolls around and shit is making me so sad that I actually debate if i should just end my story here. it’s not the music itself though. it’s the thoughts that come along with it. I then think about what would happen if I just kicked the bucket, and everything was real. Where would that leave everyone I left behind? I can’t continue these thoughts.

End: Well here I am, sitting in silence as I contemplate life and the meaning of it and whether it’s ok to leave just yet. Would I wake up from the coma? Will the world continue? Will the simulation end? I’ve spent my whole life being scared of death and now that i’m looking it right in the face, I’m calm. This was a very intense experience on me and it may as well be traumatic. Never in my life have I experienced such incredible raw emotion. Thank you to everyone who made it this far, and remember. Reality is real enough. 

[Tl;dr] I look death into its eyes and go through a traumatic experience.

1592,Cognitive Decline?,"Since being on my current treatment for depression I’ve felt that I’m not as sharp, smart or creative as I used to be. I just don’t feel as “with it.” Has anyone else experienced this? I feel a bit stuck as I am thankful to have found a treatment to my depression but I’m frustrated to not feel myself. I’m not sure what to do. Would love to hear others’ thoughts and experiences."
1593,"This is his story. If you are suffering from mental health watch this, I strongly recommend it. And share because you never know who might need to see this or who needs to hear these words to help them out of a dark patch in their life. ❤️❤️❤️",https://youtu.be/-46UtbSheVo
1594,I constantly make up stuff about myself,"I dont know why and it's never done maliciously, but I always seem to make up little stories of things I've done or have happened to me when I'm talking to people. It's almost compulsive at this point and sometimes Ive told the same thing so many times Ive almost started believing it. Why do I do this? What even is it? I've noticed it as a thing recently and I'm just a bit concerned"
1595,Is anyone else stuck in a constant state of nostalgia?,"I’m definitely really depressed, and also very introspective during this weird time. I find that I spend so much, almost the majority of my day thinking about past experiences, relationships, memories. because I’m stuck inside and living with my parents again I feel like I took my life for granted, even though I was still pretty depressed before. I’m especially caught up in old romantic interests from like a year or a year and a half ago, more than I have been in the past. I’m just tired of constantly living in the past, but living in the present right now feels like a challenge. is anyone else experiencing something similar?"
1596,What happens next?,"I’m unsure how to start this, or even what this is supposed to be. I feel totally hopeless due to the virus and it’s impact on my life as well as a great deal of uncertainty about the future. I just wanted to be young in the summer with the person I care about but I can’t see them because of lockdown. How long do I just stay inside, till my states order is lifted? The rest of the year? I’m sad and angry and all I can find when looking for help is the old “appreciate how much worse is could be” and how I have it better then others. NO SHIT, how is that supposed to help me. How is that information supposed to inspire a sense of hope in me. I legitimately live for my parents and other family/friends at this point. I feel numb to everything, part of me wishes I would catch it so I could either recover from it and live a bit more normally or die in a way that doesn’t involve my own hand. I guess that’s all I have to say right now, I’m sorry if COVID is hitting you worse and I seem privileged or insensitive. But I don’t really care about offending anyone anymore, I’m just trying to find ways to care for myself and so far the wide web has offered fuck all for advice."
1597,Terror,"I can’t describe this properly, I made a new account to hide my identity, this is something I’ve been dealing with recently that I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy. 

I am a healthcare professional, and I have no idea what’s going on, no way to generalize what I’m feeling, no disorder to blame it on. so I came here for answers. 

I suffer from a nervous tic disorder, and recently I was put on seroquel (quetiapine) to help calm my tics. Things were great, my mind was clearer than ever before, and I felt like I could get things done better without my tics interrupting my practice. My tics were debilitating. They would be loud, and they would even cause harm to my body. I split my lip because I “Popped” super hard, and bled like I never have. I had gotten these tics severely since I had a major head injury, I’ve always had them, but not as bad since I cracked my head open on solid asphalt. So my tics required treatment, and before I sought treatment they were been getting worse. 

So the seroquel was working, until one day something changed and I can’t fucking figure out what it was. I had clocked out of my shift, long day, mostly felt fine. I sat in my jeep, and all of a sudden my temples fucking squeezed like a snake was constricting my head. God the pain, it was terrible. Nothing like a migraine, or a headache, it was a sharp pain accompanied by a loud and I mean SHARP buzzing/ringing sound that wouldn’t go away. Voices telling me I’m worthless, things like “your patients hate you” or “the girl you like thinks you’re a creep” [im young by the way, early 20s] the voices still to this day won’t shut up. I come home, and I feel great sometimes, other times like tonight I bawl my fucking eyes out wishing someone would shoot me. I have no answers. In the outside I seem like a happy young man, but no one knows what terrible things are hiding behind my mask, flesh and bone. I just want the suffering to end. I’ve always had mental trouble, but not like this. NOTHING like this. I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy. No one should go through this. The pain, the fucking buzzing sound, and painful tears streaming down my lockjawed face. The thoughts attacking me. The inner voice telling me I’d be better off not existing. 
“Everyone gets like this” people have told me. They’ve got not but a clue what I have been going through. If this is normal “depression” that is so frequently diagnosed, then god damn you guys and gals are fucking SOLDIERS. This is hell. I’m not sure if it’s the atypical antipsychotic doing this, or if it’s a brain development, or what. I don’t know what to do. I fear judgement, even as a healthcare professional I still fear judgment. Even as a young male which our social media built society holds to a higher standard than ever nowadays, and paints us as unemotional and heartless, I still have feelings and a fuck ton of emotions. I don’t know what’s going on. But I hope I can’t find some answers. My fellow colleagues think it’s the medication, and I should give it a few more weeks for my body to adjust. I second this, however it’s going to be a rough couple of weeks if this is truly the case. I just pray to god that I come out of this. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone."
1598,Anyone wana talk? Just feeling lonely.,DM?
1599,cant cope having to survive the pandemic doing sex work,we’ve been forced into desperate situations and the govt is just saying oh well tough luck. its terrifying to think this could last for months to come. im unable to work a normal 9-5 job . i didnt get the check. i cant move back in with my abusive family. i cant see my therapist. i dont fucking know what to do.
1600,I feel an incredible urge to think all the time.,"For some reason, I feel like if I think (worry) about my problems enough, then I’ll eventually figure out a solution to them or a different way of looking at them. But that’s never the case, and I just always end up spiraling and worrying about things, and trying to search the internet for answers for what seems like hours on end. I never solve my problems, and I realize that, but I still do it anyway, expecting a different result every time. Is this normal for someone with anxiety?"
1601,I want to die young,"Im not suicidal (used to be but not right now), and i think that in the present moment im actually in a good headspace :) But I dont really understand why people want to be alive? (does this make sense). Whenever someone tells me about how they love their life i get really confused because even though im not suicidal anymore i just dont really see the value/importance of life. Anyway, my friends and I were talking about what age we will want to live until and a lot of them said 70+ and i was shocked honestly. Before they told me that i wanted to say i wanted to be at most 40-45ish but eventually i didnt tell them that bcuz i realized itll sound a little worrying. I just cant imagine living for another few more decades..."
1602,Why do people act like having more empathy makes them better.,"This is really pissing me off so just let me rant. I have empathy to an extent. It's not much and I will instantly forget it if someone crosses the line but that just means that for me at least they are no more than a fly buzzing around outside. It's not like this makes me dangerous, if anything I feel like I'm more collected than most people I know because others don't affect me much. And i just find it funny how people are all ""mental health is normal we will accept anyone for who they are even if they have mental illness"" until you get to people who aren't as empathetic as most, then all the sudden it's okay to look at people as thier illness. Lmao. Oh also, people who brag about being empathetic need to stop. Like no we don't need to hear about how you cried over someone else getting a scrapped knee. If you really noticed other people's pain that much you would probably notice how some of us want to rip our ears out just so we don't have to hear you. It's just ridiculous."
1603,Emotional relapse,"Hi this is my first time posting here (on mobile so formating is iffy) tldr at the bottom. 
I'm an 18 year old male and I have had some major emotional difficulties with my upbringing I thought that I had gone past most of my mental health issues and had been pretty clean I guess for a year or two now but in the past months I've had some really bad episodes of depression and anxiety attacks (frequent thoughts of self harm or worse). The only reason I'm sharing all of this is just to ask if anyone has some tips on how to deal with this situation I'm am generally a really reserved person but I don't want to go back to how I was and emotionally I'm becoming increasingly scared of myself. If you do take the time to comment on my post i would like to thank you sincerely.


Tldr: increasingly worse mental health and emotional relapse wondering if people have any tips of dealing with it in a healthy way."

1605,My friend is suicidal,"My friend who I’m very close with just told me he wants to end his life, his reasons were that he doesnt find anything enjoyable in life and that it feels like a never ending loop, he drinks himself to sleep everyday and he tells my other friends and I that he is going to kill himself soon because he doesnt care anymore, I cant help him. Anything I say is just countered by “I dont care anymore” “nothing to live for” “theres no point” he is very young to be having these thoughts and I dont know how to help him can I get some advice?"
1606,Baiting people with your 'bad mental health',"We all feel sad and lonely sometimes. But theres a distinct difference between clinical depression and chronic anxiety and just feeling s little sad for a bit.

I've seen too many posts on facebook by friends (one friend in particular, actually), and they're usually pictures on like floral backgrounds saying how people dont check up on them, and you 'know who the real friends are when you go through a bad time'.

This really annoys me. I've been diagnosed. I've been to doctors, I've been to therapists, and each therapist has said they're not qualified enough and that I need to wait another 18 months to get a better therapist suited for me. Dont tell me that people dont check up on you when no one checks up on me.

A little background on this one friend. She is for the most part a good friend. But every conversations ALWAYS leads back to her. How her life is going, how many guys have ghosted her, how stressful uni is. She never gives details, nothing that could let people help her. She never tells us what specifically about uni stresses her out - is it the people? The work load? Are the teachers unfair to her? We will never know, because she never says anything. She always starts a big conversation and then when I try to pry for info, her answers are short and just give off a 'I'm bored of talking to you' vibe. She often answers questions with ""yeah"", ""mmm"" or ""me too"".

This girl knows that everyone in our group of friends has mental issues. There's abuse, depression, oppression, homophobia in all of our histories, and she doesnt do a damn thing to reach out to us. I havent spoken to her in months in text, and the few group facetime calls we've been on, she ignores us all while we all chat and catch up, and last time she actually fell asleep.

I know full well that people are gonna reply to this saying ""you dont know what she's going through, you cant judge her, she obviously has her own problems and needs help just like you""

And I get it but hear me out.

The day she checks up on one of us without turning into a conversation about her will be a cold fucking day in hell. I dont think I've ever had a conversation with her where she hasn't just changed the subject towards herself. It's selfish. And yes, she may need help just like the rest of us. I guess you do know who your true friends are in bad times, because she has never once checked up on me after a breakup, or when I've had a breakdown or a panic attack or anything similar. She never once has asked me how I am and not turned it into her show.

I hate it. We all need to be selfish, but this is years of friendship. I try my hardest to help when I know that someone is down on their luck. I dont know why she doesnt have the same empathy."
1607,Teacher diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia. How can I help if he has an episode during a lesson.,"I haven't personally witnessed an episode, but apparently the other day on an online assembly he started forgetting things, repeatedly standing up and sitting down, repeating things, and looking unwell.

1609,My sister is my biggest antagonist,"So I’m in therapy, I’m trying to better myself. Things I’m working on: regulating emotions, communicating clearly, expressing my feelings when I’m feeling them so I don’t bottle things up and explode. 

My sister my whole life has continued to just tick me the fuck off.  Whether it’s assuming my mood by my tone of voice or just completely disregarding my feelings on certain things— she just doesn’t get it. I’ve recently expressed how her behavior past and present has impacted me negatively— but all she thinks I’m saying is that I hate her.  Which is not what I’m saying at all! It’s so frustrating. 

Have any of you felt this level of frustration with someone in your life? 
How have your issues with them been resolved if at all? 


She assumes that I don’t like her and that I don’t want a relationship. It’s further from the truth. I’ve always wanted her to be my friend but she just doesn’t get it. 

I don’t know, I’m so upset right now. I got so frustrated that I did that thing where I hit myself on the head. And that’s usually reserved for when I’m really upset. 

I don’t get to talk to my therapist until Monday so I’m venting here."
1610,I'm curious if I'm having panic/anxiety attacks? For those who do I need some advice,"I'm a 17 y/o male, I'm going to provide some background, idk if it'll help but it may be relevant. I have had a history of depression, I used to have a bad habit of self-harm, and have had my fair share of suicidal thoughts, and one failed attempt (thankfully) most of my ""intense"" suicidal thoughts are gone. I never went to a therapist for a variety of reasons, mainly being I don't want to spend my parents money on therapy, especially with everything going on right now, and I have religious parents and don't want to go to a religious therapist, I want to figure it out without that. Anyway, onto the question. So over the past few months I've been having what I thought is considered panic attacks, I have been having difficulty breathing, my body kinda just goes crazy I don't know how to explain it exactly, it's almost like i need to move my body really fast, or cover my head, or anything just to stop the thoughts that are coming into my head, it's very overwhelming. I typically shake, and a variety of other associated feelings. Though something I find odd is when I'm in front of people, especially my family I don't have full on panic attacks, I will shake my legs under the table, or breathe quickly and quietly but I don't have panic attacks like I do when I'm alone. So my question is, am I actually having panic attacks or am I just overreacting (also my apologies I hope this isn't inappropriate)"
1611,My mom wants me to call my psychiatrist tomorrow to try and get my medicine changed.. but I need to tell her that I have a suicide plan to get help at the same time.,Any advice on how to do this? I’m scared to death because I hate phone calls in general. I know if I tell her about my plan I’ll probably get admitted into the hospital.. but honestly that’s probably what I need. Any suggestions on how not to chicken out of telling her though? Email/writing a note to help unfortunately is not an option.
1612,Anyone just wanna chat? Tell me about your life. Whats goin on.,No judgment. Just here for anyone who wants to talk. I'm not good at giving advice but I'm hear to listen. Stay strong my people.
1613,I'm stuck and lost,"(this is a long post but any help/advice would be great) 
I am an 18 y/o girl without any friends and I feel like I'm stuck and I can't do anything. I feel like I am so totally behind everyone else my age and so so painfully alone.
During the end of secondary school I became so low and anxious I got myself in a state where I could no longer attend school. My parents didn't know what to do and as I hadn't showed up to school in a while they sent people to the house to check on me. They also booked appointments for me to see somebody from Mind (a mental health service). I pulled myself together enough to attend the 6 appointments they give over a 6 week period (you cannot have more than that) and after that I was left in a worse position than when I started. During the appointments I was essentially told that there was nothing actually wrong with me other than that I was copying my mums mental health conditions (anxiety and depression) but didn't have them myself and I should return to school or my parents would be fined and I would make everyone around me's life even worse if I carried on. I felt bullied in to that being my only option and forced myself to painfully finish my final year of secondary school only completing half days and not receiving any more that the minimal amount of GCSE's. In total I was off of school for nearly a year. 
Before all of this happened I was part of a large friend group but as at the time nobody really understood what was going on (and nor did I) there was no explanation from me so I received anger from them and lost all of my friends one by one.
After secondary school I completed a very minor progression course at college (intended to be a stepping stone and to build my confidence) and after that I did a year of a different course but nothing to give me a grade or achievement. Throughout this time I was still very low, had not managed to make any friends and felt awful within myself.
Now I have a job that is nearly full-time and very customer involved which I wear the same fake appearance to everyday that I have worn for I don't know how long at this point. I did try to go back to college as it was my last opportunity due to my age but after a few weeks I felt myself slipping again like I did at school and backed out (which i sometimes regret even though it wasn't too long ago). 
I do have a wonderful boyfriend who is the only one who knows about how low I feel on a daily basis and how I struggle and he has told me to see a doctor but after my last experience when I was at school it really scares me as I feel they will just send me away again and I will have to pretend I'm okay forever which I don't think I could do. Laying here as I write this at 4.40 in the morning after crying quietly to myself for the past few hours I don't know what to do anymore"
1614,It’s over for me,I don’t have anything left.  It’s all over for me. Can someone help me please
1615,So i wrote this story kinda poem thing about my MDD. Hope someone out there thinks its good,"Sometimes i feel like ive just won the lottery, like i could stand up and sing to the sky and tell the world im proud of who i am. sometime i feel like i could walk along a beach strutting my stuff like a model or a movie star. Sometimes i look up at the sky, soak in the sun and smile as wide as i can...but sometimes, when im standing in the sun storm clouds start to blow over and sometime i feel sad. Sometimes getting out of bed feels harder then climbing Mount Everest and the walls in my room grow a dark black color that consumes my every thought. Sometimes my brain becomes to crowded and the good days start to seem more and more like distant memoirs. Sometimes all i can do is remember ever minute of pain ive felt in my life and sometime it just plays on repeat in my head like a broken cd player that i cant fix. Sometimes my thoughts become all consuming and i lose the fight and sometimes, well im laying on the floor gasping for breath in between my silent screams i see the face of whats haunting me. A spirit soft and bitter sweet, with a call that carried sailers to death. She holds out her hand and places it in mine, She reassures me that she will hold me until my time comes and i become another tick on the wall. I take her up on her offer and sometimes... when all is to quite, i let the spirit win."
1616,i’m concerned for myself as if i’m a separate person,"My suicidal thoughts feel so deep rooted in my subconscious that i’ve become worried I might commit suicide in my sleep. I feel like if I sleep ill lose the control I have while awake. I don’t want to die, I just don’t want to be alive. I’m not sure what to do:( i’ll probably just sleep but i’m concerned"
1617,Why do I have the biggest breakdowns when my boyfriend and I have a little misunderstanding.,"Everytime I swear here I am sat here crying because my boyfriend hung up on me &amp; I’m feeling so worthless and shitty... it just confuses me to why I’m like this I just can’t get over anything. 
My boyfriend had cheated on me in the past like months ago and I’m still completely shattered by it, every little thing breaks my heart and makes me feel like I’m never good enough that I will never be good enough that I’m just a mistake in his life that all I’m doing is ruining it but
 I love him and I really want him and I to work out that’s why I even forgave him all those times he hurt me. But I’m still so depressed he says I’m pretty? It hurts me bc he called the girls cheated on me pretty etc. he said “I love you” to them he may or may not have meant it but he said it while in a relationship withme and that, that right there fucked me up imagine being so I love with someone, head over heels and to find out they said “I love you” “I want to marry you” “have kids” “get you pregnant”  “fuck you” do all these things with these other girls and for him to say I love you it hurts I love him I do but I don’t want to lose him regardless of what he’s done to me and that’s what sucks I don’t get me at all. I could sit here and write a book of everythings he’s done which bad, but idc I’ve been trying so hard to make us work and it’s arguments over little things which I always start and I can never let my pride down, I sometimes comment on the girls he cheated on me with like “oh shut up you loved her or you fucked her” and that right there starts a huge argument which almost leads to him leaving 99.9% of the time.
He always tried to leave me? Like if if you want to truly leave block me delete me from your life if you’re going to say it then fucking do it and stop messing about. There’s so much more but I need a chill sesh for the night.."
1618,I feel like I’m going crazy and I don’t know if I’m experiencing BPD because I have been unable to cope with myself for a while now,"I’m in pain. I feel crippled over my past experiences in life and how many horrible things have happened due to me. I’m thankful to have a loving boyfriend. But most of the time I feel as if I’ve already gone too far and that I will never be the same girl as I used to be to him. I’ll never be the same girl to my mother either. Because I can’t cope with myself. 

Beginning around fall last year I had a mental breakdown over something I don’t even remember. It was like any other one. But this time, I took my feelings out on my boyfriend, I pushed away my mother and father, and begged for them all to love me again because I knew what I had done. I locked myself in my room and lost my appetite for a couple days. 

And then I developed this horrible cycle. It hurts me. It hurts those I love most and I can’t stand myself for doing it. When something happens that I feel threatens my relationship, or threatens me, or hurts me even the littlest bit, I lash out. I can’t help myself. I sit in my bed and hold my phone texting rapidly, sobbing, yelling incoherently, screaming at the top of my lungs. I throw my phone at the wall or I spam my phone. My mind hyperfixates itself onto what I think will happen to me, and how I “know”, deep down everyone lied to me and wants me in pain. And doesn’t love me. That it was a lie people told me that they ever loved me. And I will cry for hours on end whether it be late at night or the afternoon or morning, and I will kick and scream and bawl and lock my door, and once the rage I feel is left then there’s the period where I submit. I feel like I’ve died because of the mental exhaustion. I want to go to sleep. I want left alone but I can’t be left alone because I want the reassurance somebody still loves me because to myself I am a terrible person, even though I am loving. I know I am a good person. I love life. But after these episodes I don’t feel like living anymore because I know that this animal really is me. And I’m not beautiful or loved by anybody. Because nobody who deserves to be loved would be a psychotic, wailing mess.
It happens every week or two. At one point it would happen every day. I can’t think when it happens. I get consumed with rage and I don’t know how to do anything but wail and gasp for air and scream, and throw things. I growl and have these fits and it doesn’t even feel like me. I feel trapped. And when I think about the people around me who ever saw me like that, I feel crazy. But I really am fine. 
I have traumatic experience with my mother threatening to call the ambulance for me or to take me to the closest mental institution because of these outrages. After I have these episodes I feel empty for a while until I’m reminded I’m loved, and recognize I need to breathe, that I need to calm down next time. But it never happens. I can’t. I can’t stop it when my whole body shakes from rage and I don’t even know why. And then I get happy for a while. I get happy until it happens where I get upset and then I feel myself teetering on the edge, and the next thing I know I’m screaming or yelling. I feel crazy. I feel like an animal. And the worst part is that I have never been a danger to myself or others. I just cry and wail for hours. And I want reminded I have a purpose in life. I want comforted and told I’m loved. Because it makes me want to die how bad it hurts when I know in my fit I say to somebody, “You liar. You want me gone and everybody wants me gone”
I regret everything I do when I lash out. I hate it. I would do anything to learn how to stop myself or tell myself I’m not as bad as I think I am, because I am damaged and I am hurt. But with everything that’s happened I feel like things people have said to me are true. That they don’t know why they try to help me. That I need locked away. And that I am crazy. And it hurts more than anything, and I can’t take the pain away. I want it to end. I would do anything to stop these episodes. I just want it to end."
1619,Please let me know what this means and what is happening.,"For most of my life now, I've been dealing with an overwhelming sadness but for no apparent reason. I like my life, and there's nothing wrong with it (at least that's what I think). I'd randomly just start thinking and thinking, or the smallest thing would happen, and sometimes nothing happens, and I'd start crying uncontrollably. Usually when I cry uncontrollably, I try to stop but no matter what I do, i can't. While this is happening, I often find myself cutting, burning myself with candles/matches, and even just scratching so that i can feel something different from overwhelming sadness. I feel like i deserve it for disappointing everyone i love by feeling this way. I have tried to overdose, and I have thought of slitting my neck. A year ago, I started wanting help. I don't want to feel this way anymore, but I felt like my feelings were ignored and no one cared. After trying and trying, I stopped. Not too long ago, I started wanting to again. I looked up my symptoms and clinical depression seemed the most accurate. When I talked to my mom about it, I almost immediately got shut down. I don't know what to do anymore. If anyone has any idea on what it might be, please let me know."
1620,I have too much going on to not be ok,"Not sure if this is even the right sub for this. I have been at various levels of depression for almost 5 years. I have a history of pretty bad self harm. Lately I seem to have turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism. 

But I can’t not act ok. I have so many things going well for me despite my issues. I also have so many responsibilities. Ones that can’t be ignored or put off or passed to someone else. But things are slipping and I’m messing up. I’m afraid someone will notice soon. 

Idk what the point of this post is."
1621,He told me I’m pretty.,"He told me I’m pretty and said he wants to feel me. But does he really like me? I’ve been told so many time “show me your body or you won’t have my attention.” It made me feel so dirty, but I did it anyway because I strive for attention. He told me I’m pretty. But does he actually mean it? Or is he just trying to have sex with me? 

He told me I’m pretty. But I know I’m not. I’m disgusting. And now I’m purging just to make myself look better for him."
1622,short temper related to PTSD?,"hi, i'm wondering if anyone else here who has PTSD has a hard time controlling their anger/ having a short fuse? i am constantly angry and i also have an ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude due to the circumstances in the world right now. is this usually a survival tactic for people who have PTSD?"
1623,My dream the other day,"I had a dream the other day that I was talking to someone and they were asking a lot of questions on why I feel the way i do, while also taking notes. I've only ever had one therapy session ever so all I know about it is what's on tv and what my friend tells me."
1624,Please help. Im not asking for someone to diagnose me bc Ik it doesn’t work that way but does anyone have any idea on what I’m going through? Is it normal?,"-Randomly get very irritated at what everyone does 

-Randomly don’t wanna talk like it hurts 

-Seeing random stuff sometimes triggers memories that aren’t even sad but cause me to get really really sad 

-Certain things annoy me sometimes and other times don’t 

-Randomly get very irritable 

-My mind about something changes fast 

-Random thoughts change my mood really fast

-Thoughts randomly pop up bringing me into a state of panic

-I sleep for hours and can’t wake up unless someone forces me up

-I disappoint my sisters because my mood changes from all happy and energetic to sad and not wanting to do anything and this makes them think I’m lazy 

-I randomly get into this bad mind states when I was just happy and I feel gross and I don’t wanna anyone to come near me or talk to me but it makes me feel reallly bad"
1625,I cant take this coronavirus shit anymore.,"When will this damn virus end? I pray to God it doesn't last for two years. When will this social distancing shit end? I'm tired about hearing new cases, the incompetence of the Trump Administration, and honestly where is the hope or good news? I honestly want to kill myself right now."
1626,Mental health monitoring in schools and colleges,"Before I come across as ignorant or uninformed - I don't have any background or much knowledge in mental health studies. These are just thoughts and I would love to know/study more. 

I think schools and colleges should focus on mental health of students. Everyone has a dark side to themselves but is it possible to detect the struggles a child could be facing from an early age? And I'm not talking about counselling after a kid acts out. I'm talking about actively monitoring mental health before the child does something unfortunate.

I guess it would add value to the society if its new members were aware of these struggles and knew how to handle it better.

Having said that, hypothecally if an education system is equipped with a right approach and right people to carry this out - is there any negative side to it? For example would it introduce some kind of paranoia about one's mental health?
I would love to know if there are any good studies/books on this topic."
1627,I don’t even want to get better.,"I just want to live in my parents house and play video games and eat junk food for the rest of my life. Nothing matters. I don’t care. I have no motivation, no drive, no hope. I’m a friendless, loveless loser and have been literally my entire life. It’ll never change. It’s just who I am. I should have given up a long time ago. No one cares, anyways. 

Why should I even try to do anything? Like, no one cares if I don’t. No one wants me to succeed. There is literally nothing that makes any of it worthwhile. Nothing at all. 

I was born a retarded defective loser and will die a nobody who has nothing to be proud of and nothing to live for. And I’m okay with that. I fucking hate it but I don’t see how it could possibly change.

I don’t want to be happy. I don’t want to feel joy in my life. I don’t want to be able to accomplish goals and grow and better myself. I don’t want to do anything except drink the slow dopamine drip of the internet circus.

I don’t fucking understand what the hell is wrong with me. I don’t think I’m depressed. I’ve been depressed and suicidal most of my life and this isn’t that. I’m just fucking jaded and sick of it all. I’m sick of trying and failing at literally everything. I think at this point I’m crazy enough that I try to fail. I try to fail why pretending that I’m trying to succeed because it’s easier that way and it confirms my sick biases. Even when I succeed, I only see the failures. I can’t even feel like I accomplish anything. I can only see and feel pain and suffering. 

Every single time someone has tried to help, I’ve brushed them off. I’ve rejected every hand stretched out to me. That’s probably why they stopped.

I’m drowning and the lifeguards have all decided that I’m too dangerous to risk their lives to save.

But I’m not drowning. I’m just sitting in my fucking room doing nothing. I have so much I kinda want to do. I have a car to work on, a RC plane to build, an E-bike to ride, a fictional universe to work on worldbuilding. I should be putting out job applications and trying to form contacts and connections. I should be trying. 

I can’t try anymore. I gave up. I’ve failed to do everything I’ve tried all week. I can’t start my homework. I can’t bake the cake I wanted to. I can’t tidy my room. I can’t do my laundry. 

I just don’t fucking know what’s going on. I’ve had a headache for weeks, and I’m dizzy with vertigo half the time. I have to take Tylenol every day just to think straight. Water, caffeine, sleep, food, vitamins, none of it helps the headache. Only painkillers. 

I’m not angry, I’m not sad. I’m a bit anxious, and I’m certainly some sort of upset, but I don’t know what it is. I don’t know what’s wrong and there’s no one who can help me."
1628,Breaking Habits of Depression Anxiety &amp; Abuse,"(22 F) I had depression for almost 10 years (age 12 to 22). After finally being able to leave an abusive household, and seeking help from my church, I’m finally comfortable speaking about what I went through. I no longer feel like depression controls me. I can say that for the most part, I’ve found a lot of joy in going to church and I’ve found a lovely group of ladies who love and support me. However, there’s quite a few habits I picked up in those 10 years. For example, isolating myself in my room and not speaking unless I was spoken to are both things that became normal for me. I was always walking on eggshells. I never formed any friendships because it was easier to just stay quiet. And over the years, in a sense, I became afraid of my own voice. So now that I want to be social and build these friendships, it’s almost like I don’t know how. It’s been almost 5 months of seeing this group of friends 3 times a week and I only just recently let my guard down so they could get to know me. What are some ways to break these old habits?"
1629,St. John's Wort,Has St. John's Wort ever actually worked for anyone? I'm considering starting it again. I've taken it before but not consistently enough. The only thing I experienced were very vivid dreams.
1630,I think I might have Borderline personality disorder or something similar but I don’t know I just need to get it out.,"For years now I’ve known I’ve had anxiety and depression, but I feel like things have maybe changed? Gotten worse? Turned into something else? I don’t know. I don’t actually know if it’s BPD, but I got it stuck in my head and this is something I’ve been struggling with for a long time now, so I figure I’d try and talk it out here. I appreciate any help. 

I feel like I practically no control over my emotions at this point. I have terrible mood swings and sometimes have noticed that I get irrationally angry, though I usually think it’s rational at the time, or I’ll get incredibly sad and anxious over things I probably shouldn’t. I’ve experienced things where I think they happened one way, like if someone was yelling or berating me and have multiple people tell me that they weren’t. I don’t know. 

The other day I saw a post somewhere that talked a bit about BPD, and some of it kind of sounded similar to me. I looked into me and some things seem similar, but there are some differences. I don’t think I’m really afraid of anyone abandoning me and don’t go to extremes to stop it. I also have seen that suicide/self harm seems to be a symptom; I’ve had suicidal thoughts before, but I’ve never hurt myself and I don’t think I would ever act on them.

However, some other things did make some sense to me, even things that I didn’t really think of as being an issue before.

Ive been kind of paranoid about people, not like they’re plotting to kill me or anything, but that people are talking about me behind my back and turning each other against me. I kind of always lumped this in with my anxiety-brain where I overthink everything I say and think I had to have said something that made someone angry or hate me forever. But it’s gotten worse, to the point I think if people do stuff that has nothing to do with me is somehow or is just normal is a slight or a plot against me. 

I also saw something that mentioned feeling like you don’t think people or situations are real while under stress. I don’t know if this is what that means, but sometimes I’ve had feelings where I feel a bit, lightheaded maybe? And I kind of have a moment where I think everything might be a dream and isn’t happening. 

I don’t think I’d say my romantic relationships are particularly intense or unstable, I definitely do have an issue of idolizing men at first and thinking they’re the one and are going to make me happy and fix all my problems, and then undervaluing them. I think this happens with new friendships sometimes too, not that there are many of them. To be completely honest, I sometimes have that weird idolization of people I’m not in relationships with but know, and think if I could get into a relationship or friendship with them, everything would be okay. 

I definitely have an unstable view of myself. I go from moments of loving myself and actually feeling good about myself to hating myself, wishing I was dead, feelings that it’s right for me to think that everyone hates me. 

I guess I just don’t know. I’ve seen counselors and therapists before but I’m very bad at talking about this type of stuff. Which means they don’t get to know most of my symptoms or actually how I’m feeling, or things about my past - I know that’s a problem. I’m hoping maybe if anyone has some insight here I may be better able to express my feelings to someone and hopefully get more to help me.

Thanks you."
1631,Do I have PTSD?,"If you asked my what my hobby was for the past decade, it would unquestionably, obviously be anime. Everything that I liked had something to do with anime. That kind of changed, and I want it back but it won’t come back. So, about 1 year ago, I had watched this anime called One Piece. At first it was good and all - but eventually, it got really really slow. I’m talking slow like watching paint dry. I kept telling myself “it’ll get better!” “There’s no way an anime with this many episodes can be slow for this long!” I was wrong. Episodes 500-880
were as slow as hell. I couldn’t see an end. I didn’t. I lied to myself that it would get better, but it didn’t. I wasted so much time, and my mental health took a toll. I almost went insane, but I kept saying “I will meet this goal” “it will get better” “I will get to the end of it”. And guess what? It didn’t get any better. I was depressed for a good week. I was so burnt out and couldn’t do anything. Now, anytime I watch anime, I automatically lose interest and feel extremely burnt out for no reason because I expect it to be like One Piece even though I know it isn’t but my mind sees it as one piece. It’s literally only anime. I could watch cartoons, movies etc without getting bored or a weird sensation. 
Is this some sort of PTSD? Or something else?"

1633,I'm not sure if I'm sociopathic or it's just my age,"From the title itself I could probably take a good guess as to what a majority of you are thinking right now ""oh he is likely one of those self diagnosis types"". No I am quite the opposite, i hate people who self diagnose which is why I'm here on this subreddit to briefly explain why I'm unsure of wheather I am sociopathic or it I'm just experiencing the coming of age (just to mention I am only 14 years old).

Many people know me for my tendency to not care about much if anything that doesnt benefit me in some way. When I do something I regret (for example: hurting someone either emotionally or physically) I only feel the regret if my actions backfire on me. I do care for some people a lot, such as family and very close friends but I also betray their trust in some ways which does hurt me a little bit however I get over it fast. 
I also have an addiction to two substances: Nicotine and cannabis. Nicotine keeps me calm when I feel regret for what has backfired on me pretty much sedating my emotions completely and weed is just an addiction (bear in mind my use of weed isnt heavy, it is usually half a zoot every 2 days or 3). 

I'm unsure of whether or not this is sociopathic or my puberty distorting my emotions. Again I want to make clear I am not self diagnosing, I came here for an opinion or a quick summary."

1637,I’m not normal,I realized today that I am not normal. It is not normal to have suicidal thoughts. Or self harm. Or not remembering how to be happy.

It had only occurred to me as I saw a pack of razors on the table and had to lock my self into my room so I wouldn’t do anything stupid. I just wish I was normal
1638,The world we live in is terrible and I don’t like being apart of it.,"Maybe you’ve seen me post here a few times, and this will likely be my last time posting, it’s just that once you post, a few people respond but after that your post is never seen again. Maybe I’m selfish to post again because there are other people who need help too, but I guess the situation has gotten worse. My parents are great but they don’t understand what’s inside my head, they just keep blowing me off. When I do post on here, people do respond but they don’t seem to understand what’s inside my head either (no offense). Yeah, I do appreciate that some of you stopped in to help me out but at this point only I can help myself, so now I’m just telling you, the most I can ask for is an upvote. I’m under 18, I like to write, hate school. Last time I posted I was told to just try my best in school anyway, but I just don’t see a point. I don’t see a point in anything really. I feel like I see the world for what it really is. Most of you people, graduate high school, go to college, then get a job. But I think that system is bullshit. Everyone is trying to pressure me into their bullshit system, but no matter what I won’t give in. I believe in some of those government conspiracies, so call me crazy all you want. It just feels like my life is a test, I’ve lost sight of reality, I don’t really know if anything is real. I guess I’m one of the philosophical type people. But at the same time, why should I believe in this society? I hate it. Everyone looks at their phones all the time, it’s not the life that anyone should live. If you are reading this, don’t help me, help yourself. Not that you are like that, but some of you may be. Although don’t be like me. I think about ending it all the time, I believe in an afterlife. Don’t give me your atheist bullshit because I don’t need to hear it. I believe that we wouldn’t be here if there wasn’t a afterlife. (I don’t believe in heaven and hell, it’s okay if you do, I’m not making fun of you) but I believe in something. I can already picture the comments in my head, saying how I’m wrong. Believe it or not, I’m sad that this system is the world now, but in a sense I can live freely now, it makes me a little happier. I almost want to become a bank robber or something, to make cash. I don’t care if I get caught, it would be better than this system people live by. My entire family believes in the same stupid system, and I can’t stand it when they say I have to make to right choices because it wouldn’t really matter. I just want to live my life, but I can’t because of all these stupid rules. I don’t care if I’m broke, and homeless, I still have one thing, and that’s the fact that I won’t ever live in this society. I’m becoming a writer not to make money, not as a job, but because it brings me peace, it gives me a purpose to be here. If someone is somehow monitoring me, then good. Now you know how I feel. It feels like nothing is real. Some of you might say I need help, but that’s part of the system too. So if I live or die, so be it. If I get arrested, I don’t give a fuck anyway. Guess this will be my last post, not that I’m going to off myself, but because I’m sure your sick of hearing a person who speaks truth. Leave a comment if you’d like, but I just ask for an upvote that you read it. Hopefully some of you listened."
1639,having dreams about my bullies,"sophomore year has been the roughest school year of my life.
i used to get bullied a lot but i kinda got a break from it in 8th and 9th grade. then it just came back worse. every single day in almost all of classes and even outside of class, i'd get made fun of because of my appearance and name in front of everyone. thank god quarantine came around, but i still think about them yelling and laughing at me. 
i always tried to ignore it but i couldn't. joking about it was way out of the question as well because i was too embarrassed for them to know wha happened.
evey time i see someone that looks like them or even something that has their name, i hate it so much. i've already been depressed and on-and-off suicidal, but this really made it worse. i've been having flashbacks to my past bullying and recent bullying, and the recent. bullies have been showing up in my dreams. its been over 5 months and it still bothers me. i'm even more embarrassed that i got bullied than i was when it happened.
i feel like ill never be able to forget this at all and that im weak for even letting them do this not once but every single day.
plus, i only had one friend and he was barely even a friend because he insulted me almost daily so i definitely wasn't gonna talk about it. hed just laugh at me
sorry if this is repetitive"
1640,Am I a horrible person for having these thoughts?,"Hi. I’m gonna get straight to the point here.... I made a friend on discord in December and we’ve been talking to each other and play together on ps4 frequently ever since.. but since I rarely make friends I feel like I got attached too quickly. I already view him as an older brother and I think it’s weird to think this way about him after knowing him for about 5 months. But that’s not it, I sincerely hate myself for thinking this way and one of the many reasons why I’m suicidal is I get..... I think it’s jealousy I’m feeling. Not necessarily because he talks with other people tho, but because he talks with other people but how he talks with other people, if that makes any sense. I really hate myself for having these thoughts and I feel like a toxic horrible person for having them. With these thoughts I feel like I don’t deserve to have friends or know any people and I feel selfish because of it too. Am I a horrible toxic person?"
1641,My moment of truth. Maybe it will help you.,"It has been a momentous one week for me. My eureka moment came to me when I was at breaking point. I was weighed down by all the negative cycles that had continued in my life for so many years, that I just took the decision to break it that moment. I am going to keep that weight down and walk away from it because I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE’S ACTIONS. I am accountable ONLY to myself. I can choose to react with negativity or respond with kindness, even to myself. It is perhaps easier said than done, but I am consciously and actively watching myself and catching any tendency of mine where I am allowing myself to plummet into a negative spiral. This affects every single relationship. Do not mistake this for forced positivity. No. Preventing yourself from going down a negative spiral does not mean jumping around with explosive positivity all the time; it means ACCEPTING that something negative happened.. and moving on from it. Accepting that part of you that felt that negativity too. And once you do, you’ll stop projecting that on other relationships and feel more loved too. Once again, this does not imply acceptance of toxic behaviour, it means allowing yourself to move on from it and being accountable only for your own behaviour and not someone else’s. I have felt so much lighter and better about life after this. I wanted to share this here, because I’ve received such kind words of support from absolute strangers that have helped me hang in there."
1642,Advice on how to deal with someone stuck in self pity.,"I'm a college student who is back at home now due to COVID. It's just me an my mom here, and she is completely draining me of all emotional energy, and I dont know how to help her. 

She is stuck in an endless loop of self pity. She feels bad because she thinks she messed up my childhood because she spend the first bit working all the time and then got depressed after losing her job for years to the recession and wasted time with me. She feels this is the last time she has with me, and because all we do is sit at home, we are wasting this too. 

She doesnt have any friends anymore. She pushed them all away years ago either because she was self conscious or she felt a friend wasnt good to have around a kid. She goes to work, which she hates, then comes home and does nothing. She's miserable, and she wont do anything to change it. Rather, she has tried stuff, but it doesnt help. She tries to get me to go places, or tells me to pick a place, but because I don't have ideas of places I want to go, or I'm not actively enthused, she begins yelling and crying and it tears me apart. 

I feel bad for her and I want to do something to help, but I've tried everything I possibly know to do. I've tried to go places and put up a face like I'm having a tin of fun. I've tried suggesting she reconnect with other people. I've tried telling her how she is draining me and making me miserable. But she has a degree in psychology,so she knows what she's doing and she cries and gets upset that she's tearing me up which makes me feel guilty for not being an infinite font of strength and emotional energy.

I am absolutely out of ideas on how to make it better. 
So out of ideas I've turned to reddit to seek help. She cares so much, but she cant stop tearing herself and me apart,and I dont know how to break the cycle. With COVID, I'm stuck here for months. And I cant keep dealing with these meltdowns every week/2 weeks for months."
1643,"Every time I'm in a situation, even if it's just walking to the shops, I think of the worst possible thing that could happen to me. (getting kidnapped, killed, blown up etc.) Because I believe that if I've thought of it, then it can't happen now the element of surprise is lost",Does anyone else experience this? I get dissociated bringing all the bad things to life in my head. It's been getting worse lately.
1644,"Do involuntary patients have any way of contesting how they are treated in hospital and if so, do they ever win?","When I say treated I don’t mean medical treatment, I mean how they are generally  treated by Staff such as their freedom of movement or their privileges/restrictions within the hospital."
1645,Manic as Hell,"I dont sleep, I have been so creative lately with my art and writing that I'm genuinely surprised. I have not been so creatively productive in years and I'm riding this high like no one's business, but I'm kinda being bad about it. Like, I'm not k own for really acting out or getting paranoid while manic (I have type 2 so I basically just ride the hypo) so I figure what's the harm. Still taking my antidepressants but I take my mood stabilizers infrequently. I know that's not the best thing to do, but it has been 2 years since I have self this alive. I dont want it to end."
1646,Masturbation,This is a legit question. Can masturbation worsens anxiety?
1647,"I'm growing more and more tired of living. I'm not suicidal, I just want it to be over with.","The title says it all.  I'm 24yr old guy and I just want my life to come to an end.  I have nothing that interests me.  I'm going to school for something I can care less about.  I'm failing a math class because I just don't want to do homework.  I'm my parent's basement bum.  I think about moving out but then I think that it's just too much.  I just resort to pay cheap rent at home.  Nothing strikes my interest. I force myself to do nearly everything. Work, school, even gaming.  Nothing is making me happy.  I live every day hoping I'll be done and be relieved of my miserable life.  I even force myself to listen to music or even to watch a TV show.  I just don't care.  All I want to do is lay around and sleep.  I don't care if anyone texts me.  Often times it takes me a while for me to respond because I just don't want to talk.  I just don't see a point.

  I've been taking an antidepressant for a little over a year.  I'm still waiting for it to work.  Everyone says it takes a good while for it to kick in.  It hasn't had an effect.  Hoping by 18 months, something will kick in.  

So yeah.  I'm wondering why I'm even posting this.  I'll just read all the posts, thank those that responded, receive notifications for about a week, and then I'll be back where I started.  There is no way out.  I'm basically in a locked in room in the bottom of the ocean.  

By now, you probably can guess that I don't have much friends.  And yeah, that's accurate.  I'm not exactly friendless, but I just don't have any that are close friends.  

I'm not sure what else to add at this point.  Your thoughts always help for a day or two.  That's better then nothing I suppose.  

What would I like from you? I'm not sure.  

Thanks for reading.  

I welcome your thoughts... Either positive or negative."
1648,Society and guys.,"
DISCLAIMER: I wrote this based off of my personal experiences, the community I live in, and the experiences of people I am close to and have talked to. I am not trying to start a fight so please do not take this like if I am trying to say that girls are aggressive or guys are oppressed or anything of that sort. Also take note that this does not apply to all people (of course) and many guys and girls are not in the situations I talked about above this. Anyways, please do not take this the wrong way and have a good day beautiful redditors. 


 I want to talk about how society messes with a bunch of men/boys/males. Ok so society teaches guys that it’s “un manly and stupid” for guys to cry and if you see a guy crying 9/10 people will just walk by and with guys it’s always that mentality, “suck it up”. But whenever a girl cries, people come running to comfort them and ask them what’s wrong and everything, and they may forget that guys have emotions too. Girls also are in a position in the world where they can express their emotions freely and without judgement where many guys are afraid to because of the chance they will be made fun of, and ignored and are just afraid to where many/most girls can in most situations. Because of this, many guys have been basically programmed to never cry, under any circumstances and many have actually forgotten how to/literally can’t even if they put effort into it. We’re not robots. This isn’t healthy at all. We need to express our emotions too. 


Again, don’t want to start something and I’m being sort of cations because this is my first time posting lol but yeah don’t take this the wrong way again, and have a beautiful day you amazing people."
1649,Seeking mental help during COVID,For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety. I usually try to soothe my panic attacks and sad girl episodes with weed. Recently I’ve been trying to quit to get a clearer head and it has shown how severe my anxiety is. With the world shutting down I haven’t been able to do normal shit when I’m sad like hang with my friends. So I’ve been trying to go through this alone and everyday feels exactly the same. My anxiety is so bad I feel like I’m losing who I am as a person due to fear of trying. I’m suicidal and I’ve been trying not to feel depressed but it’s so hard and I’m so tired. I really want help but with everything going on it seems difficult to get back on the right track. I don’t take any meds and I saw a shrink a few times when I was 17 (21 now) but it was too expensive. I realize that I need to work on my mental health and I want to take the steps to get better even if it means paying to see a shrink. I see that I can’t even do that now with everything going on so I just don’t know what to do. Everything is just really hard and I feel so alone. I’m trying to stay occupied and keep busy but it’s hard when you’re stuck inside with your thoughts 24/7. Sorry for the sob story I am just looking for some resources before i end up doing something stupid. I love my family and that’s the only thing stopping me rn is seeing them hurt. I’ve never been one to look at online resources such as like a suicide hot line or anything just bc I feel like it wouldn’t help. If you guys have any positive experiences with online sources I’m all ears. Or if you have any advice on what I should do to get better please lmk. I’m a college student so I really can’t afford much as far as a shrink but I’m willing to pay what I can to try and get better. I just want to feel like myself again. Thanks ❤️
1650,I am incredibly bad at waiting for things in the medium term (3 ~ 5 days),"Whenever I'm told I need to wait for something (material objects, like online purchases in particular) it preoccupies my mind and clouds over more important issues at hand. Sometime it's so unbearable that I've done things like travel an unreasonable distance just to get a hold of something on the same day where an online purchase and a bit of waiting would have sufficed. This is particularly true when the waiting spans across work days. I'm OK with short term waiting (waiting in lines) and long term waiting (when something is weeks or months away) but my aversion towards medium term waiting is definitely not normal and it has lead me to bad decisions in the past. 

Not trying to get diagnosed or anything but just wanted to see if there are likeminded people here."
1651,I just want to talk about this,I journal every thought I have most of the time. It has helped me through everything because I want to tell someone. Sometimes I’ll write notes to people about things that are going on and I’ll keep them instead.  but sometimes when I’m curious I’ll take out my old journals and read them and it’s just a bunch of lines of me yelling at myself. bashing myself every single sentence. And it doesn’t feel like me. I don’t know why I do it because I end up hurting myself even more. I’m currently in some kind of funk because of everything going on. But I don’t get why I’m so unaware. When I feel “okay” for once I read the things I write and it just doesn’t feel right. I get mad at myself that I’m so unaware. And I still so unaware like I don’t know what’s happening around me and I don’t know what choices I’m making. I just wish I knew
1652,Years ago I found out about a rare type of bipolar,"My doctor told me I was an uncommon type of bipolar. I forgot what he called it, but I go through the highs and lows every day, super energetic with people, as soon as I'm alone I deflate, I cry a lot, weird things make me sad. He said what was unusual about mine was the extended periods of general high. I go about a year, sometimes two, with just the minor issues, but after that year or two, I go through really low lows, the ones they ask you to call a helpline about. Those last week's and even months where I feel there's no hope and wonder why I bother at all. I've come close to commiting suicide several times, the youngest when I was about 8 or so (bad home situation, I was always in the lows when I was a kid). With Corona and whatnot, I can't go find a new doctor now, I've moved so I don't have an established therapist or whatever it is that I need. I want to read more on the type of bipolar with long elevated periods, because I think I'm dipping into another one and it physically freaking hurts! Google didn't help, can anyone tell me what it's called?"
1653,Discovering my other self,"I woke up around a year ago. I woke up and the last memory I had was an 11 year old going to bed. I woke up in a different bedroom, in a different house. I learned through others that while I was gone, my grandfather died of lung cancer, my cousin committed suicide, and my mother left our family for her meth addiction. I woke up to find 8 years of my life missing.


I learned that while I was away, I sought counseling. I learned that while I was away I was put on 2 mood stabilizers and 1 medicine for PTSD. I learned that these medications were for nightmares I didn't have, at least not anymore. I started loosing parts of my memory. I would go through my day only to black out and wake up later in a different situation. I found it odd that since I woke up I no longer felt sad or angry or happy, I no longer felt emotions.


I asked my father If he had noticed my blackouts. He said I was awake and responsive during the times I didn't remember, but I did act differently. I asked for more details and he stated I always seemed angry, or scared. He said that I was scared of loosing who I was, that I talked of loosing my memories. I learned that I had been fighting for control of my own body with another me that I had never met.


I decided if I was to share my body with this entity, then I needed to contact him. I wrote my side of the story in a journal, and asked him to do the same. I told my father that next time I had one of my episodes, he should direct me to the journal. While I waited for my next blackout it was time to visit the counselor I tried to tell them of this development but they seemed to think I was making it up, constantly changing the subject. They just told me to stay on my medication and sent me back home. 


I eventually got in touch with my other half, who I have started to call Marcus. Marcus wrote that he could only remember times of stress and anger. Through his writing I learned a few things. 

1: Marcus experiences emotions more strongly than other people, while I am incapable of any emotions.

2: Marcus has insane stamina and pain tolerance compared to me. 

3: During times of great stress Marcus took over. 

We continued to communicate through the journal. I found this to be extremely fascinating, and Marcus just seemed happy to have someone who understood his situation. We set about trying to find a way to both exist at the same time, to become one mind. We were unsuccessful, however I did find a way to allow Marcus control without a stressful stimulant. After I became conscious again I left Instructions for Marcus to transfer control back to me. It took him several tries to figure it out, but with help from my father he was able to.


I have allowed Marcus to experience happiness not requiring stress to take over. Marcus is useful to have around, his over reliance on emotions and lack of foresight can be a liability at times, but he is amazing when it comes to physical labor. Its as if our body constantly produces adrenaline when he is in control. I've taken to letting him have control most of the time. I still take over during times of stress and, when in public. Marcus doesn't do well with crowds. We have weened ourselves off of the medication, the counselors continue to prescribe it, but we no longer need it. I would say we took a shitty situation and made the best of it.


TLDR: Some unknown event caused my mind to split into two separate entities. One an overly emotional mess, and the other incapable of feeling emotions. After roughly a year of knowing about each other we figured out how to coexist."
1654,Why do I want to die,"Lately I just feel like dying/kms and I don't know why. I have a pretty good life and some really good friends, but recently just want to roll over and die if I had to opportunity to have a quick painless death I'd take it. I don't even no what's causing me to feel like this, how do I deal with this?"
1655,How do you cope as an individual when theres not a whole left to carry on for?,"The post is essentially in the title, whatever your diagnoses, whatever your situation, how do you cope with it all and what keeps you turning the next page for tomorrow?"
1656,I just want to disappear...,"I have such crippling anxiety I can’t even talk to friends who I’ve had for years. I’ve been in quarantine for a while now so I mainly talk to others through discord but it seems as if recently I get a small panic attack every time I have to respond to some one. I’ve started full blown sobbing before, because I really wanted to tell a Mutual I’d be down to help them with a problem they’re been having but I just couldn’t bring myself to send the message. Most of my friends have all drifted apart because of different reasons. Although I want to talk to them but I start shaking, crying, and breathing at a abnormally fast pace and end up deleting the message. The only way I’m able to send any type of messages is if it’s Anonymous if not i have a mental breakdown crying to my self quietly. I’ve tried fixing my self by joining a bunch of groups I’ve only been able to get myself to message once. 

On top of all that I’ve been experiencing “Extreme mood swings” and my family calls them. It just like I’m a ticking time bomb if I’m alone in my room all day I’m fine but as soon as one of my family members try’s to talk to me I blow up at them yelling, glaring, and ignoring them. I’ve tried to talk to my family about my issues but they always brush it off as “your still growing your hormones are trying to balance them selfs out just give it time”..... BUT THATS ALL IVE DONE IS BOTTLE IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT EXPLOSION.... bottling your emotions and hiding them behind a mask is not a good way of dealing with the pain is what I’ve been told... but that’s what I’ve been doing all my life all that anger, resentment, sadness, depression I hid it all for years behind a happy exterior until I would lock my door crying in hysterics and..... cut

But that’s all I ever knew of how to get out those feelings without receding to others what was going on.most if not all of my friends left me, I wasn’t taken seriously because I was simply a kid. Others told me because I had it good in life mom and dad in the picture a upper middle class family that I dident have the right to be upset. I don’t want to be here anymore. 

I’m not proofing reading what I wrote because I’m on mobile extremely sleep deprived and this was just to get all my thoughts and emotions out in a ,,more healthy way”."
1657,Losing control of body and consequently my mind,I am a 25 year old male and since more than ten years I lose more and more control of my body to spasms and compulsions. I don’t know exactly when it started but i must have been very young because i don’t remember a live before them anymore. I am now at a point where I contacted exit international because the pain of the continuous fight against myself took literally everything away from me. I have nothing to lose anymore and can’t compromise any further. Also I know I am supposed to describe my symptoms here as best as I can but unfortunately they change from year to year and I didn’t really find a pattern yet. I try since more than a decade to at least get a diagnosis on what exactly is wrong with me but nobody is able to give me answers let alone a therapy. My head hurts so much and I decided for myself that this is the end for my suffering.
1658,"Question, would love some insight into my fear!","Hey guys,

So just a quick one here. Can Harm OCD be about harm coming to yourself by others? Instead of on the other hand your harming others? I have weird and horrible thoughts like “what if that persons wanted to kill me” and like the other day I read about government send out little things to spy on people and I seen a spider on a wall outside and my thoughts automatically went to being “what if that spider was sent by the government” my OCD is around schizophrenia and some days it’s better and some days it’s not. I do give it a lot of attention and I know I shouldn’t but I feel this is the only way for me to prove I don’t have schizophrenia and it’s a HUGE fear of mine and also can OCD try to mimic your fears? So like I say mines is schizophrenia so everything I’ve read about schizophrenia about being paranoid and people harming people, poisoning people, seeing this and hearing things. Can having this fear with OCD make it sometimes feel so real because your in so much obsessive state about it? When you get the thought you get that sharp shoot of anxiety until you try and forget about it? I was just wondering if anyone is the same and is this normal OCD can it really mimic and make your fears and the symptoms feel real even though they aren’t? Thanks guys,"
1659,Every day is so hard,"Typing this while I’m crying because I’m just so overwhelmed by everything... 

Interning now but I can’t be productive at home and my work is just piling up. Now I have so many things to rush out by tomorrow with my last two exams of my uni life in four days (only studied one chapter so far). 

I’m so tired of being like this... constantly so unproductive and then feeling so bad about it and thinking I have to make up for it. It’s a public holiday today and here I am working on something I forgotten about that is due tmr when I had the entire week to do it. 

Honestly staying at home Everyday for so long is making me more and more depressed.. I’m so tired of all these I just want to quit my job now and not care about anything."
1660,i might be slightly traumatized by my history class and teacher,"ive gotten multiple panic attacks in her classes since shes pretty strict and has oral exams every class without telling who it will be before hand. Because of that for the whole first semester i would study the moment i got home (5 pm) till 12 am and then wake up at 3-5 am and study till 7 am and go to school. Twice a week id do that for her class. I even once shared to her the distress that kind of studying was putting me in and and she laughed and said ""history comes harder to some people"", bascially who gives a shit as long as shes satisfied with my grade? I was sacrificing my health out of fear and anxiety for her and it was ruining me(i should mention i have severe social anxiety disorder which makes my anxiety about school worse than average). im very bad at remembering history plus its very very boring to me so i need many hours in order to remember what she demands :/. Anyway now every time i think of her class or her (and when i am in her class) its hard to breathe, my heart aches, i shake, it feels like something really bad is going to happen or i might die (even though logically nothing will happen, at the most ill get a bad grade) and i seek ways to avoid her class because i just cant take it anymore. i mute my mic and dont answer if she asks for me, i simply dont join her class with the excuse i have no wifi etc. While we were still going to school every Thursday (when i have history) i would skip to go to therapy (which is the truth but i chose that day specifically to not go to history).My grades are dropping and my attendance is rusty now. Actually studying has become impossible because my brain is constantly in panic mode when i think about history. It might sound stupid but its seriously affecting me very badly and i dont think i can explain it to her or my homeroom teacher, since i need to have those classes, theres not much they would do. They probably wouldnt even take me seriously. She doesn't like me very much too since im not the best at her subject and i usually am honest that its really hard and boring for me. Im not necessarily asking for tips or anything, just wanted to share because its crushing my chest. Sorry if its confusing my english isnt perfect. I hope you're having a good day :')"
1661,Conservative historians and trolls make me hate my passion for history.,"I love history.  However, I spend more time defending my content from angry, politically conservative historians than discussing or learning history.  The result is that I leave feel angry, alienated, and they ruin my passion.  

I feel lost, and I do not know what to do.  

No matter how tame the topic, my content gets politicized.  I posted about an article about the oldest military vehicles still in service worldwide.  People commented, ""Those bombers should wipe those damn Chinese out for giving is Coronavirus.""

I posted about Spolia, a common practice in ancient Rome and other societies about reusing old buildings for new purposes.  The cover picture was the Hagia Sophia Mosque in Istanbul, formerly a Christian Cathedral.  My article got flooded with Islamophobic comments.  I spent the night enforcing a hard ban on ANY racist, Islamic, xenophobic, or comments denigrating any religion.  

They then argued that I was abusing their 1st Amendment rights and pushed me into a conversation about free speech.  

Any article I post about Islamic architecture gets downvoted.  

It seems like the majority of the people in history groups online tend to be politically conservative, older, and male.  

If I publish too many articles about nonwhite people serving in the Army or the Civil Rights Movement they say I am unpatriotic for making Americans look bad.  I feel really lost and exhausted. I hate history buffs."
1662,I WANT to do but I do not feel like doing it. The problem with most of the mid-20s these days.,"I'm in a constant battle to learn and upgrade myself. Although I love the process and idea of catching up with things, I get so exhausted that I end up doing nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I WANT to utilize this lockdown time to upgrade my skills and advance my knowledge(in my field). I am actively able to work efficiently only for say a few hours a day or sometimes not at all. I am taking up long hours to get the things done(which usually do not take up much time). I feel too tired and inactive for the rest of the time. Sometimes I do not feel like doing anything, literally anything(no movie or TV shows, etc).

I make an extensive plan or list of targets and stuff to get done by month-end. I stick it on the wall in front of me to directly look at my goals and work towards them. But I lose my motivation after a few days. 

Please let me know what can I do to feel energized and happily work towards my goals. **I have lost that hustler in me.** How to bring it back? Your advice/suggestion/experience might help. Thank you in advance :)

1663,Break up tips?,"I’ve been with this guy for over 4 years, 19-23yo, first real serious relationship, we live together and moved across the country together away from all friends and family. I have no desire to return to my childhood state. 

I’ve struggled it’s depression and anxiety from a very young age. More so depression then anxiety. Both aren’t good though. 

I’m so emotional over this (I even had a full blown panic attack over it 2 days ago... so bad. Haven’t had a panic attack in quite literally years).

 So much has happened. The last year our relationship has plummeted. We stayed together trying to make it work and it’s failed. He says he is in as much emotional pain as I am but I truly think I’m taking it so much harder. 

Towards the end he’s been talking to girls he has a thing for and we have been fighting so so so much and it’s destroying me. I don’t know how to stop crying all the time and stop being so emotional to sort out the logical side of the situation. 

Before the virus he was in between jobs and now he’ll have to try and find work to afford to be on his own. We have a dog together too and I feel so fucking guilty for our relationship not working. I know sometimes it’s for the best and shit just doesn’t work but I hold so much guilt. 
We are both miserable. And he wants to start moving on with other people already.

I can’t talk to family because my side doesn’t care that much and his side is going to rip into him and blame him when it’s really both of us. 
I feel so lost and hurt. This quarantine has made our relationship really crash and burn.

I feel lost and so hopeless. I think he needs to move out as soon as possible but I’m terrified to be on my own. I know I can handle it, I’ve been technically on my own for a long time, I just know I’m going to miss having around all the time. Even though we fought so much in the end, I still love him. So fucking much. 


Anything helps.
Pls be kind."

1666,Help in learning to be more confident and eliminating insecurity,"For as long as I remember I have always had crippling insecurities regarding every aspect of myself. I have always been insecure about my body, about my personality and about more or less any defining characteristic about myself. 

This has led to me having an awful relationship with myself, resulting in a lot of self loathing and absolutely non existent self esteem. 

The only moments I ever feel secure and happy are when the people I care about lift me up, but I have just gotten so sick and tired of depending on other people for validation and self worth that I feel the need to take it upon myself to learn to love myself and accept myself and all of my perceived flaws as they are.

Relying on others to determine my self worth for me makes me feel so weak and spineless, I am just tired of being unable to exist comfortably without using other people as a crutch.

Where do I begin? What do I do to learn to become self sufficient in this regard? I have absolutely zero confidence, in every sense of the word. Being in lockdown has left me with a lot of time to think to myself and my thoughts as of late have gotten increasingly negative, to the point where my mood feels like it's doing a 180 every 5 minutes. Any starting point would be a help, I just want to overcome this mental obstacle. :("
1667,Sad and feel like I’m going crazy,"I’ve been generally happy and successful most my life until lately. About a month ago my boyfriend of 3.5 years broke up with me and I’ve been having the worst time coping. Part of the pain is from losing who I thought was my soulmate, and part of it is realizing how alone I am without him. I have some friends but none that I’m really close with. Quarantine is making it harder because there’s almost nothing I can do. I feel like I’m going insane, overthinking and questioning everything. Nothing makes sense and I have low hopes for the future. I keep having nightmares and wake up to anxiety/crying. I need help calming down and changing my focus to be more positive. Is there anyone with advice or who would like to talk?"
1668,"Boyfriend experiencing a depersonalization-derealization episode, any advice?","He is normally a highly motivated and active person, always likes to be doing something creative and productive. He’s always super energetic and happy, never experienced any depression and perhaps only mild stress in his life. 

For the past 3-4 days he said he’s thinking about death all the time. About how well all die and life is so fragile, we could all die any moment and then everything we do everything we are is just suddenly nothing. It means nothing. He said he’s been scared of dying in his sleep or his heart stopping. He said he feels his heart and brain and blood flowing through him so intensely, he’s always noticing it. 

Yesterday he said he feels like everything is pointless and seems so superficial. Were such tiny blips in the universe and he said it feels to him that he sees a truth that others don’t and he cannot unsee it. He said he understands this is irrational thinking, knows it’s not true but at the same time it feels true to him and he can’t stop thinking it. He feels detached from everything. He has a very good blog he developed, it gets a lot of traffic now and it’s like his baby. He said yesterday that if the whole thing crashed he doesn’t think he’d even care but ultimately what does anything even mean and other existential questions. He says he knows these are irrational thoughts that are a product of the way his brain is working now but he says he feels his brain chemicals are all messed up and he can’t change it.  

This has been distressing him a lot. It’s clear to me he has a high level of anxiety and is having derealization depersonalization symptoms. 

I’m a psychologist in training so it’s easy for me to see it for what it is, I’m trying to use my background to talk him through it but I’d also like to know from others who experienced this what an effective coping mechanism was for you and what got you through it? What was something someone said to you or you said to yourself during that period that motivated you to cope? What were small things that helped? I would appreciate if people can post helpful replies only. Thank you!"

1670,how to help friends,"hi everyone!

i luckily haven’t had much interaction with mental health issues in my life, but right now i’m finding that i’m missing some ways i can try to support my friends. 

i am realizing now that many of the friends i have in my life that are so important to me are dealing with extreme mental health struggles and i just don’t know how to approach the situations when they bring them up to me. in particular, one friend has been very honest with me about their depression for the last 2 years or so and the other about their extreme anxiety which is only getting worse

how should i be supporting my friends? should i be asking questions to them when they are disclosing their struggles with me? or should i just tell them that i’m there to support them? i’m just a little lost on what the best direction to go is from here :^/

thanks in advance!"
1671,Oh dear...,"Yep, couldn’t get to sleep until 4am and at 7:30am some scaffolders arrived for a flat opposite me. Nearly 2 and a half hours in and I swear the drilling is getting louder.

I know they have a job to do it’s just really bad timing!"
1672,I’m not sure if this is serious or not,"So this has been happening to me for a while now. Probably a few years? I can’t exactly remember but I have this tendency. Not exactly sure what to call it but I’ll just try to explain it as best as I can. My earliest memory of this thing that I have been doing has to be when I was in middle school, maybe 11 or 12, possibly younger (I’m a senior in high school now). So that is around the time I began to read online and read ebooks I found on my phone. And this was usually not a big deal but it has progressively gotten worse I feel like. Anyways, whenever I would read, I would occasionally get this urge almost to do something physical to go along with the syllables of the words I’m reading. For example, if I was reading “the joke was hilarious”, I would do something like scratch my bedsheet to every syllable in that sentence, or tap on the table, or do something with my teeth. So if I was scratching, I would have do it perfectly or to my satisfaction because sometimes, it just wouldn’t feel right or something. It’s really difficult to explain but I would read the sentence over and over again in my head and scratch along with the syllables until I felt like I didn’t need to anymore. And this would only happen sometimes. Not every time I read and eventually, I think I would stop if I got really into the story possibly. A few years past, and I would do it every once in a while but it would never be so much that it interferes with my life. But now, maybe starting last year? Or two years ago, I’ve started this habit of repeating everything I hear from videos that I watch. It’s mostly been from tv shows or movies that I enjoy watching but it gradually starting happening in school when the teacher showed a video to the class. I would whisper and repeat the words they were saying. It typically happens when I’m alone by myself and if I’m around people, I don’t really feel the urge. But I’m starting to. This is similar to when I was reading and to the scratching where I would repeat the sentence over and over again until I felt like I’ve said it properly or until I felt satisfied in a way. Sometimes I have to go back and listen to them say it and then repeat it. Sometimes I mumble and I have to do it and be really articulate with what I’m saying and sometimes a whisper underneath my breath isn’t enough I have to say it louder. I’m addition, I often watch anime, and I have to read the subtitles, and I would read the sentences over and over. I would literally read almost every single caption aloud to myself multiple times. And a 20 minute episode ends up taking 30 minutes to finish. I don’t know why I have these urges. Sometimes I would try to ignore them and I would eventually forget but other times I just HAVE to do it. I feel a little weird because this is an issue that I seem to only have and I didn’t tell anyone. But I ask my friend because she is very knowledgeable about mental health and illness and I ask her to do some research and she said it might be OCD. I know people have this misconception of what OCD is but is what I described OCD? This is starting to really interfere with my everyday life and I just have no idea what it is or why I have it. My family is also quite traditional and we are financially unstable so I just can’t bring myself to tell them. And I’m not sure if this is relevant and I have also never been diagnosed by an actual doctor, but I do have bad social anxiety and just anxiety in general and I might have or still have depression. But that is a whole other story. Anyways, if anyone has any idea please let me know! I apologize for how long this is, I tend to ramble and it’s really hard to describe. So yeah. Haha thanks in advance I guess?"
1673,I need some help here.,"I have this friend and he's going through a lot mentally and has been for a long time. He has always had urges to hurt others. His temper is real bad, and sometimes he gets so angry he thinks he might actually hurt someone. When this happens, he hurts himself instead. ""Better me than them"" he says. He's scared that at some point in the future the urge will be to much and without thinking, he may act on it and possibly kill someone. I'm just wondering if any of you know what these symptoms could in tale on a possible diagnosis. He's been dealing with this since he was real little, and he hasn't gone threw any traumatic events (that I'm aware of.) 

I'm just hoping for another opinion here. Hope I get some answers soon."
1674,I’m worried about my husband,"In January my husband had a psychotic break, I had him admitted into the psychiatric care at our hospital and he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. He is taking his medication as prescribed but refuses to get any psychiatric care. Recently he has been having anxiety and depressive episodes both of which he has never experienced in this range of emotion, he’s not handling it well. How do I get him to get help without coercion. Clearly I can’t force him, nor do I want to make him feel like he’s forced to get help. I’m scared for him and I don’t know what to do at this point."
1675,Every time I’m seeing my psychiatrist I feel even worse,"I’m struggling with ed ( I’m at the sage when I’m eating normally for a year and I’m at my healthy weight), depression and anxiety and every time I’m at my psychiatrist she make me feel so much guilty about myself and every time it’s worse.
mostly I spend all the way home crying and in pain. last time I arrived home from her I was decided to kill my self again last time I had attempted suicide was two ears ago ( I’m seeing her last half of year). 
I don’t want to talk with her about my problems, because I don’t trust her. she seems like she doesn’t care at all.  I’m trying to get better but every time I see her I just want to give up and starve myself to death. 
we didn’t even talk about my past or anything...
only time I feel kinda great is when I don’t have to see her. she’s kept on prescribing me one meds without asking if I feel better with them.
 Bad news I’m five teen so I can’t change psychiatrist on my own. I was talking about it with my mum, but she don’t want to change her or stop seeing her, even tho I have therapists who I kinda understand with (I know he can’t prescribe me meds, but the ones I’m taking now doesn’t help me at all so...) she thinks we did not gonna find someone else and she needs he “advices” whitch sounds like “kept her always busy” and “don’t let her be too long alone” so now I don’t have any free time to do things I like and I  can go meet with my friends maximally for two or three hours. So I just kept at being more depressed and closed into myself.

I don’t know what I should do, I don’t want to live like this I feel trapped and guilty about my illnesses.
 Does anyone experienced something like this ?
 If you have idea what I should do please help.

I’m sorry for my English, it’s not my native language."
1676,Is there a way to overcome abandonment issues?,"(21F) I have always ran away or ruin relationships by fearing that people will leave me. 
As a child, I was emotional and mentally neglected.. since then I remember always being sensitive to people disappearing from my life. I get the feelings of people getting sick of me or tired of me, so I become more distant and I cut people out. I tend to stay away from people and not let people in because of my insecurities. I dont know how to maintain relationships. I dont feel fomfortable talking about my emotions or feelings.
A lot of the times, even when Im constantly with people, I feel really lonely and empty.

How do I stop being detached and disconnected? How do I overcome this? Nothing seems to help. Its really easy for me to say that Im done with this bs negative mental issue, but its really hard to do. I just want to be stronger and more emotionally open."

1678,Dissociation,"Hello friends,  


I am having some really complicated thoughts lately on the status of my own mental health and wonder if anyone has ever experienced this or has thoughts in general on the subject.   


Long story short, I grew up as an only child, in a single parent household, daughter and mother combination. She was 14 when she had me. She is also a narcissist of the very subtle kind that's great at convincing people that she's a good person. My family is not close at all, and I have never been able to keep a friend who knew me for me, or even cared about the soul in my body, so I had no place to turn growing up.  


I learned recently, having gone through a major transformation process, that her abuse caused me to dissociate from myself because I was literally not allowed to be whatever it is that IS me. Anything I wanted was wrong. Anything I needed was wrong. Trying to fix myself made me even more wrong.  I've been struggling to learn who I am since I dissociated so early that I don't even know what I like or dislike in most facets of life.  


I also learned recently that, even more surprisingly, I am transgender. It's all stuff that normally happens in teenage-hood, but I'd dissociated from myself already by then, and I never was able to realize any of it until I started this transformation process. Is it possible that multiple types of dissociation can layer on top of eachother and double down??? This is all not studied at all, and I find myself searching for answers that aren't available to me.   


I'm curious to know what you, the reader, think about this concept; multi-layered dissociation lasagna. Thank you for reading."

1684,"I feel depressed and feel like people are pushing me away, anyone who can relate?","This will probably take some time to explain. So im writing this in hopes of finding people who have had the same issues and that can help. I have seeked professinal help but it does'nt seem to help that much.

So last year I went to a boarding school which was around 2 hours from home. I began missing alot of my old friends which also meant i became pretty depressed. It got to the point where I could'nt take it anymore so I started blaming my new friends for my ""depression."" This was stupid of me, but I just did'nt know why i felt this way. I used to be happy all the time, i used to always like being with my friends. But now it felt like i had to fake being happy, and that no one liked me. I decided to leave the boarding school. From here on my thoughts and depression got extremely bad.

When I left boarding school I was pretty happy that it was over. I felt like i could finally be myself again. I couldn't just stay home all year so I decided to find a high school to attend. This went pretty smooth, and the first couple of days of high school I found new people to be around. I was still feeling sad all the time, and I lost my passion for alot of hobbies such as gaming, editing and doing daily activities. Nothing was fun anymore. I usually got home, sat at my work desk doing nothing for hours. 

Slowly i became really sad again, to the point what i had suicide thoughts. I talked this out with my parents, and even though they were trying to help, it just didn't. This is also where i began to have alot of hatred build up. My old friends that i used to talk to every single day, I found annoying. It felt like they were bullying me, even though I know they would never do that. Every time i would join the discord call, it felt like my hearth was being stapped with a sharp knife. It's a really weird feeling that I have never felt. I of course didn't want to feel like that, so I slowly isolated myself from everyone. At this time I hated everything, my old friends, my family, my new friends. And it genuinely felt like I had no-one in the world who I could relate to. 

This feeling that i had in my heart didn't leave, even though I isolated myself. I had enough and this was the time i seeked professional help. At the psychologist I got told that I had to fight back the feelings. Which meant I had to stop isolating myself. And so I did that. A couple of months have passed now. It still hurts a lot. I can't be myself anymore, because it always feels like everyone is looking down at me. Because now i genuinely feel like no one in the world likes me. Deep inside i tell myself its not real (which its not.) But it doesn't help. I also told my friends what im feeling but it doesn't help. They tell me that they see me as a really good friend, but it feels like they are lying. 

I wake up every day and i feel like shit, im really depressed and I dont wanna talk to anyone. I really hate everything. But i still wish i could go back to the time i was happy, and where I didn't care what other people thought about me. I every now and then still feel like dying because there is nothing in life that is worth living for. Even though I have small moments of happiness a day. Im only 17 so I know it can change, but i wrote this to hopefully find some people who could relate."

1687,Just need to vent,"TL;DR—sleeping for me may be completely impossible for the next 17 days and I need it now more than ever.

Amidst a global pandemic, my wife and I are nearly done buying a house on the exact opposite of the country before moving where I’ll be doing one of the most dangerous jobs my field even has.
Despite having almost no material possessions, it took our movers two entire days to clear out our house here.

We’re currently sleeping in the guest bed room to find that the air conditioning doesn’t work in there (it’s currently just before 6:00 am and it’s 85 degrees out), the landlord is across the world at the moment and never responds to messages, my neighbors are gone and their dog barks every night and they left a door open in their house that slams violently once every 2-3 minutes.

That same wind they’re getting miraculously doesn’t even touch our home, even with all of our windows open. (With screens).

At night we sleep without any blankets because it’s hellishly hot. So the mosquitos come out to play.

Our nightly routine is to take the coldest showers possible, cover ourselves in bug spray, and then wake up once every few minutes to either a barking dog, a slamming door, dehydration, a brand new collection of mosquito bites, an iguana hissing, etc.

We’ll be moving into a hotel in 17 days and I already can barely think clearly. Half of my entire life is problem-solving (and I love it) but I’m so extremely exhausted right now, I sat here for 4 minutes on my porch staring at this cat eating food before I realized it wasn’t mine.  I finally got out of bed to check my email thinking I had accidentally backed a Kickstarter that drained my bank account.

Mostly hoping to just vent, but if you guys have simple fixes to any of these problems they would be appreciated."
1688,I don't know what's real anymore,"I used to know who I am. I used to believe in myself. I thought I had an identity. I could identify some good traits that I had, even if I thought people around me didn't notice. Give me a paper, and I could describe myself.

TLDR;

* *Why* questions lead to a list of causes but no solutions – ""Why do I feel this way?"" ""Why did that happen?""
* *What* questions lead to insight, solutions and steps – ""What do I feel?"" ""What does this have in common with previous episodes?"" ""What can I do to remove myself from this situation?""

Today I’m having a bad day. I’ve been inside for over 2.5 months. I want to share what my toolkit is to remind myself and help others.

1. Drink - the human body is mainly water, it is the one thing vital to life on earth. Pay attention to your pee, it tells you how hydrated you are.

2. Sleep - allow ones body and brain enough time to rest, regenerate and develop. 

3. Nutrients - fuel ones body. Colourful plates are the best feast for ones eyes and mouth.

4. Exercise - over time it becomes more and more pleasurable. Try things, if you don’t like it, don’t do it!!!! Try something else! Start with small amounts, 5 or 10 minutes. Maybe not even that. But try, and keep an open mind.
Suggestions: yoga, running, dance mat (you can get cheap controllers and free software), cycling, dancing, ring fit, partner yoga/acro yoga, kickboxing, weights, body weight exercises, HIIT, rock climbing, pogo stick, swimming, walking, hiking, running on the spot in your living room, horse riding, walking up the stairs and equivalent amount to Everest (or something less intimidating!)
Hopefully you’ll find something you like in that list. You may not be able to try all these things right now, but they’re something for the future. If you move your body and your brain will love you for it, before you know it you’ll enjoy the challenge. There are loads of things you can learn from videos on YT which you can learn at home. At the moment I’m doing two 30 days of yoga playlists, that’s my zen place - love a shavasana.

5. Sun - it makes us happy. Ones body needs vitamin D which our sun provides.  If you can’t go outdoors consider getting a sun lamp, but do your research because they need to be a certain grade to be effective. This is what I am currently lacking, I have a plan to sit outside the front of my house when the sun is next out and remember to do it whilst I’m still restricted.

6. Talk - if there is a concern of bother it can be a relief to oneself to share this with another. Or even to write it down and tear it up. If one is mentally strained or unwell it is even more beneficial to share one’s woes. Others will understand better and hopefully be  more considerate, offer support or help ease the burden. Give people a chance to surprise you.

7. Time - allow yourself time to enjoy. Dedicate a moment, just 5 minutes or even 5 hours, whatever. You are of value and you are worthy of this time. Even if you are required to care for others find this moment, maybe when everyone is asleep, it will make you feel more like a human. Have a cup of tea in peace and quiet, lock yourself in the bathroom with a book (toilet or bath - you choose!), retreat to the bedroom to do something on your own, go outside and just notice all the stimuli, bake a cake.

8. Gratitude - often forgotten. This will really change your life if you do this for 30 days. Honestly. Say 3 things you’re grateful for every day, either out loud or jot them down - whatever. My preference is before bed as that focuses the mind on something positive before sleeping. Some people prefer morning. Whenever suits you! Listing as many things as possible when down is also beneficial.

9. Offer - help with chores, a conversation, a pair of ears - whatever! Doing things for other people is good for you. It’ll strengthen your relationships and make you feel closer. It’ll also make you feel happy that you’ve done a nice thing for someone 

I’m getting tired so this is all for now. Apologies for changing from “one” to “you”. I prefer the use of “one” but it was just too impersonal for the latter tools. 

You may not be able to do all of this at once but dedicating a small amount to start doing something is a victory. It’s not about the individual days or weeks it’s about doing things for yourself so you can find balance and be content with what is some of the time"

1701,Mood tracking &amp; backup habits (Users of a mood tracker app),"Hello [r/MentalHealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/), and thank you, the SAMHAA and your mods very much for having me!

You may have seen this post already on [r/SampleSize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/fyi2ry/casual_mood_tracking_backup_habits_users_of_a), but as this is the only mental health-oriented sub I post it on, I want to stop by for a second to highlight its relevance and its policies.

As I'm sure you all know, mood trackers are an incredibly valuable tool for dealing with mental health conditions.    
As a user of a mood tracker myself, I was surprised by the ""exclusiveness"" of the apps, by not envisioning any kind of progress retention throughout different apps, therefore dooming any user changing mood tracker to give up all their data in the switch.    
And as a firm believer that everyone has different and evolving needs, I want to fix that by developing a tool to improve data portability between mood tracking apps.

If you're a user of a mood tracker app, we'd be really glad if you could help us steer our development process by filling in this short survey about mood trackers and their backup features:

[https://ciakkig.typeform.com/to/FgAHqZ](https://ciakkig.typeform.com/to/FgAHqZ)

We never ask for actual mood information or any identifying elements, so you can rest assured there's no harvesting of personal emotional data -- it's only about the different *apps.*    
Additionally, all the information collected will be jealously kept to ourselves, and will never be shared with anyone outside of the 3 project contributors.   
This is still a very small project, and we aren't sponsored by anyone -- in fact, we are making and will forever make this project [Free and Open Source Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en) and unbound by any business agreements.

I hope this text manages to comply with the moderation rules for survey posts, and thank you again for allowing this post, as this community's contribution is extremely precious and meaningful to us.

Thank you in advance to whoever participates!"
1702,Help With Mental &amp; Emotional Decay?,"My grand issue is pretty complex (or at least complex from my perspective), so I'll try keeping this short.

Overall, I'm a failure. I know the knee-jerk reaction to that is to diffuse someone's mentality of being a failure, but please bare with me. I'm a thirty year old man, unattractive inside and out. I still live with my mom, and haven't had a job in years. I've got a cocktail of mental issues that make ""memory lane"" an erratic rollercoaster.

These are **not** opinions, but facts. And, frankly, I feel like I'm nearing the end of my rope.

I don't know where to go for help. I have a psychiatrist, a therapist, visited the standard websites, have gone to out patient programs, I take my meds, I try to take care of myself, I meditate, I've taken psych classes, and so on. I desperately want to get better. I **want** to work. I **want** to *earn* my happiness. I **want** to exercise. I'm fighting to get better, and yet, I find myself unable to maintain the necessary solutions to my problems. It's not like these problems are impossible, but my mental and emotional constitution is so weak that I find myself crumbling after only a few days, or weeks, of effort.

My emotional state has been fragile lately due to isolation, feeling like a burden on my household, resurfacing thoughts of suicide (passive thoughts. I don't intend on doing anything), but mostly feeling worthless.

I've made several entries like this on reddit already, and its usually after I've put in a sizable chunk of information, and frustration towards myself, that I realize I'm likely just writing to myself. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, and other times I try not to let the silence get to me.

If someone *is* reading this, then ""hey"". Even if you don't know what to say, or don't intend on saying anything, thank you for reading this. I might not know it, but it's kinda nice to entertain the idea that I'm worth someone's time, even if only to read my futile cries and whimpering.

I hope things in your life are going much better, in general.

&amp;#x200B;

(Lastly, this was all copied from my entry on ""r/EaseMyWorry"". I figured I might as well reach out to other subreddits for better odds at finding something useful.

I live in California, USA, if that helps narrow down available resources.)"
1703,tw: suicidal thoughts,"well i've had less suicidal thoughts for about a month and now it all started again. ""i should kill myself, my life has no point, i'm a total failure"" thoughts come to my head. i really feel like a piece of shit and that i don't deserve to live.

1704,"Subreddit offering a space, mental health information and news, support and a place to promote your mental health related work/blogs etc, mainly for people from the UK 🙂","Hello all! As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. [Here is my subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/)

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population.

I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy. Thanks for reading if you got this far 🙂"
1705,I used to be...,I used to be a fun loving out going person. But now having been burnt so many times. Having trained my replacement on jobs numerous occasions. Losing loved ones. I have basically become a hermit. I used to have a few support groups. But I even there began to distrust. On some I can look back and say maybe it was bad or wrong to have cut this person out of my life.  But the one or two I was wrong about. For the most part there was twenty more I was right about. I do mentally question was I wrong cutting all these people out? Am I setting myself up for failure? But the sad part is in all accounts. I was not these people did not care nor ever had my best interest at heart. The sad part is society is set up on a scale of what can *I* get out of it. Yes a lonely life sucks. But it is a safe lonely life. I will be 46 tomorrow and in all honesty. I am not certain how many more I will or want to see.

1707,Anxiety and Self-Esteem,"Hey! I'm new to this subreddit and this is my first post here, so I'll provide a bit of context. I have anxiety which I am taking medication for and I am also seeing a psychologist in order to help myself get better at handling it. Things have changed a fair bit, though, since I started taking meds when I started uni three years ago, moved onto campus for convenience two years ago and finished my degree at the end of last year.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have completed my degree and I have decided to take a gap year in order to save up some money before I do my next degree (I want to do a vertical double degree, which is a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree at the same time). However, since I finished uni in November last year, I have found it very difficult to get a job. I briefly had a position in mid-December, but after about 1.5 weeks, the quality of communication dropped and I had trouble getting in contact with my boss. I wouldn't even be able to keep that job right now due to the COVID-19 restrictions. As a result of this, I am still job searching.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I haven't had a position that I can maintain without needing government support, I would say that I have been jobless for about 7 months at this point and will have been on job-seeking government support for 7 months. The vast majority of my applications have failed and it is taking a toll on my self-confidence. All of my days are blending together since I have nothing to create a kind of 'schedule'. The closest I had prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was going to the gym, but since they are all closed down, I have been way too lax on exercise since it is really difficult to motivate myself at home. I am concerned about what further impact this will have on my mental health, so I'm just wondering if I can have some advice or encouraging words?"
1708,I wish I wasn’t so sensitive when I’m confronted for my mistakes.,"Today I [24/f] messed up in work (We’re working from home). I basically lost 4 days of work through an error of my own, and my bosses, rightfully so, had to tell me the hard reality of what my mistakes could cost the studio. 

They were totally professional about it, but I could tell they were annoyed. 

It’s been three hours and I’m sitting at my desk with a splitting headache from crying so much. I absolutely hate how I respond to this sort of thing. “Telling off” is too childish of a term, but I guess it gives you the idea of what I mean? 

At this age I shouldn’t cry like a 4 year old who’s been put in their room for bad behaviour. When I feel guilt, I feel it HARD. I don’t know what the psychology behind my ways are. Most people my age or younger will just suck it up and strive to do better, but I sit back and feel sorry for myself. 

Anyone else experience this? How can I change? Thank you for reading"

Did he reincarnate or am I just going insane or is this some sort of coincidence??? :/ I already can’t cope with losing him."
1710,i cant feel anything,i cant get myself to cry and i really need to. ive never attempted self harm but i just bit myself till i bled and i dont really know what to do because it felt good i just know this isnt good for me and i have an addictive personality um so any tips to get myself to feel or like anything at all thanks
1711,I dont know,"Im suicidal and when i say what i feel everybody tells me what they they think i feel. When i tell them im coward and is a fucking pussy at talking about his own feelings they refuse that answer and feel that im rebelling at them for staying silent. Im too much of a coward to tell my own feelings and when i do i immeadiatly get knocked down by them saying its wrong, im rebelling. Im forced to have two options, ask for help or commit suicide. To others it may seem over reacting i dont know anymore. Im confused im sad i dont fucking know. Im asking reddit for fucking sakes."
1712,Should I be concerned for my friend?,"Hello everyone. Hope you and your family are safe during this pandemic. I am looking for advice.

I am rather neutral in this situation because I know the ex-boyfriend and the ex-girlfriend. Essentially, at the start of Feb they broke a 3 year relationship up. They had their arguments, but they had a lifestyle like no other. They both travelled the world (Rome, Paris, NYC and Las Vegas all in 2.5 years together), he was always at hers because she didn't drive, he picked her up from nightouts to save her money, he picked her up from the train station in certain days to make sure she was safe, and he spoilt her rotten (he got her a £1050 Tag Heuer, £400 Tiffany's necklace, £200 Gucci belt, £100 MK heels, £80 Adidas trainers, and that was in the last 5 months of the relationship. Wouldn't mind be treated like that myself!). They both spent silly money going to fancy restaurants. But what I'm.saying is, they both had some life style. Don't worry this will all become relevant later.

They last spoke 12 weeks ago. Due to lockdown, I haven't seen either of them. I am also a keyworker and have been doing 10hr shifts so I haven't even been able to text them much. Also I don't want to get involved in either of their recovery processes.

But this is what I am rather concerned about. She has gone strange. Like really strange. She is dressing up as clowns, witches and dying her hair mad colours. She has never done this before, because most of the time her social media is all about fancy gifts and expensive restaurants. I noticed that she hasn't removed his father, but has removed him from her social media. Is this attention seeking?

He has been rather quiet but naturally upset. But he has been doing alright. He won rather a large amount of money over the last 2 months and is looking at buying a house. He also met a doctor who he has been going on a few dates with. According to him, he hasn't even spoke to her or checked her social media as he has found it easier to heal that way.

Should I be concerned for her however?"

1714,How do I stop thinking about suicide all the time?,"I'm not even 20 yet and I actually plan on living for the next 40-70 years, but I keep thinking ""I want to fucking die"".  

I think that if I'm going to die anyway, why not just try and enjoy the long time I'm alive.  

I'm learning to program and Japanese, but I still think about killing myself and I don't know what to do about it."
1715,Having an extremely hard time and looking for some advise,"I am having a very difficult time right now. I have dealt with long term health issues for years which eventually resulted in having an organ removed. My career as a paramedic fell apart due to my physical health. I'm going through bankruptcy because my career fell apart and I was unable to work for over a year due to all the surgeries I had. 

My grandpa just went missing for a week and was found dead in a field and me ex' grandfather who has always been very good to me and accepted me into the family is declining very rapidly and has a date set next week for an assisted suicide. 

Ive been working from home because of covid but I work for a call centre and it is awful. I spend all day getting yelled at for ridiculous issues involving peoples furniture and the company I work for doesn't give a shit about its employees. 

Due to my health issues I already have a hard time sleeping but lately I average an hour or two a night, I feel sick all the time and signing in for work makes my insides feel like they are trembling and I cant breathe. I can barely eat which is a big deal for me because my health issues make it difficult for my body to process food properly to begin with. I have had to sign out of my work a few times lately to just sit and cry at my desk because I cant handle the stress

Im wondering if anyone in Canada, Nova Scotia particularly, has any experience with going on stress leave and what that entails. Im not looking to get off work for months I just needs a few weeks of no one yelling at me to process these deaths. I am originally from another province and have no family doctor in Nova Scotia(I am only staying here because my young son lives here with his mom). Where can I turn? what resources can I use to help me out with this? any advise would help"
1716,Going back to the office.,"I just wanted to put it out to the universe that I’m feeling extremely anxious about going back to the office. I’ve been working from home since mid-March and leaks from Boris’ plan suggest that he’s going to send people back to work Monday! Our bosses seem very keen to get back to normal the second it’s allowed. I don’t feel safe doing that. That seems way too premature and I am concerned about working in a cramped office wearing a face mask all day when it’s completely unnecessary. 

We work online and through a server so it’s by no means essential that we are on site. We’ve worked very well during this time and as a company have actually been very busy over the lockdown period so business is good. 

I’ve been working much more than I ‘should be’ also, and have been finding that frustrating. 

The worst part is that it’s the speculation about what Boris’ plan will be that’s got me worked up. And I have to wait all bank holiday weekend to find out what the actual deal is. 

I don’t want to go back. Not yet. I like this way of living, and just don’t feel ready to return to before."

I'm looking for advice for when my unborn daughter (I'm 5 months pregnant) reaches a certain age when a girl's self-esteem is so fragile. I had so many mental health issues growing up. Throughout high school I had low self-esteem and self-image problems. I even self-harmed and to this day (I'm 27) struggle to not self-harm. I'm wondering if one of the issues was that my main activity was playing the piano, which is such a solitary activity. I didn't grow up playing any sports or doing anything physical. Is it silly that I'm thinking I can prevent mental health problems for my daughter by NOT having her focus on an instrument like I did as a child? I just want to do whatever I can to make sure my daughter does not have similar issues to what I had."

1725,"Why are subreddits like r/Gangstalking allowed, in spite of being detrimental to mental health?","All these subreddits serve is to actively harm people by allowing them to come together in a space without therapists or healthy people to help them. It actively allows them to reinforce their delusions and unhealthy ideas. I think these subreddits need to be banned, because in the end they can cause great issues for therapists/psychologists and families of patients. I myself have a friend who has been diagnosed with psychosis, but now refuses help because he believes the word of this subreddit. I imagine that I'm not the only one as well. I now have a friend whose mental health is deteriorating more and more, because they dive deeper into this rabbit hole and deem it more trustworthy than a trained psychologist or therapist. Subreddits that reinforce people's delusions have been banned in the past, like it did with r/Incels, and eventhough this is a less harmful case, it's still all in all very negative thing. I'm actually quite shocked and upset how little reddit does to protect the mental health of patients that come to this site, it should be made aware what a detriment it can become for not only patients, but also family and friends involved. For an example, my friend now truly believes that he has no mental illness, but that the government is using 5g towers to control him and implanted chips in his head - that's why he's hearing voices. He got all of this from conspiracy reddits like r/Gangstalking. Because of how harmful this can be for patients even in treatment, and considering how popular reddit is, I believe subs like those need to be banned. What do you guys think?"

1727,I want to stop hurting people.,"Im mostly chill person and patient one too,i don't express emotions nor do i feel them that much,but its different with anger.Like its really hard to piss me of too but there are certain triggers get me so angry to the point of  mentally blacking out. This doesn't happen often and the usual triggers are people who keep bringing up stuff i don't want to talk about(more than 3 times after i told them that i wont talk),people making same mistake over and over that affect me,and just way too much social interactions in general.

After some of those things happen i loose control often (verbaly) and for now I've been successful in keeping things that way,and not getting violent physically. I do have urge to inflict pain but i usually do it to myself (nothing serious,just biting either my tongue or lip),after that i like calm down and realise that i got mad over nothing,and that i hurt someone for no reason at all(verbaly). 

I have no idea where this all comes from,and I really dislike hurting others,because i have the habit of telling them to ""f off,and leave me alone"",even if they are just trying to help.Im not asking for any pity,i know that doing stuff like that makes me a sh*t friend or family member,I'm just trying to find a way to stop hurting everyone that is close to me,or atleast tries to.
So I'm trying to find what this is(and no i can't go to the therapist,because my country doesn't believe in mental health and its extremely difficult to visit one),and the way i can stop myself from losing control to anger.

1728,Loosing self,"Lately, I have been loosing my sense of self and questioning everything about my life. I don’t know if it has anything to do with me being stuck at home for a month now or my family. Not to mention, I’m drowning in courseworks that I have no motivation to complete or begin with. I have hard time falling asleep and once I do I sleep for more than 12 hours. This is not how I was back in uni, I did have my bad days but they did not last long like this. I want to cry always cause I can’t seem to stop my thoughts, they get way too overwhelming."
1729,Has anyone experienced anything similar?,"Hello All,

I am looking for advice as i have been experiencing changes in the way i feel and act. I have spoken to my partner and family about a few things and have been told to seek medical advice. I know i should go see a medical professional but i feel i can't express what i feel well enough (Perhaps i'm afraid of what they'll say)

Anyway, for a few years now i have been experiencing extreme mood swings and have noticed there are 3 ways i'll turn

\- Extreme (sometimes violent) Anger

\- Extreme Depression. As in, one moment i am my usual self, then start thinking i'm a useless human and lay in bed for the rest of the day

\- Energetic Happiness? Usually comes out of nowhere, i just kind of bounce around and laugh/smile. People often ask me if i'm okay. I also make strange noises during this, like popping my tongue or something, it feels necessary. 

Sometimes they can lead from one to another, most commonly anger to depression (i think this is quite common for everyone though?)

So thats my first concern.

The next thing that concerns me is i find my brain working at 100% overdrive. Looking around like an owl on speed, chewing nails because i think my body is going to slow for my head and get thoughts going through my brain like something out of sherlock when he's piecing together a crime scene, until i eventually crash, become unmotivated and end up literally hating myself. Often leading to suicidal thoughts, although i have a fear of death so know i will never even start 1% of the process.

Last thing i will mention as i don't want to write an essay and i am experiencing it this second is Paranoia (Not sure if it can be considered extreme because i am not knowledgeable enough to know). But i have developed, within the last fortnight paranoia, I am constantly checking behind my chair as i feel like someone is in my house. If my partner leaves a window open i have to close them as the sound of cars passing has disrupted my ability to hear what's going on and startles me. I currently cannot have fans on or a tv too loud for the same reason. I do have 2 dogs so i should feel secure but i know they'd lick you to death if you even looked at them.

There was an attempted break in at my previous address about 4 months ago so i think i am blaming that.

Sidenote: I am also spending a lot of money through boredom, not sure if its even relevant but i bought an RTX 2070 super trio for £700 just so i could play around with my pc. Probably not anything to do with mental health but reckless spending could be?

Are any of these even connected? Or am i just overthinking things?.

Thank you for listening."
1730,i feel distant from everything,"i feel very emotionally distant from everything. ive been through depression several times in the past so i know its not that but in between those periods i still felt normal and connected to my experiences, but for the last couple of years it seems that i cant seem to experience much of anything (positive or negative/physically and emotionally) and my reaction to everything is pretty much just meh to a point where people think thats my personality and im not sure how to change that"
1731,My Paradox when it comes to attention,"I have been jumping back and forth when it comes to making a post about these thoughts.

Lately, I have been struggling with this idea that I do things for attention instead of exploring something genuine or making something to find meaning in myself or others.  I used to do theater, improv, make videos, write songs or poems, funny posts on FB, and currently have been trying to get into video game streaming.  When I look back at it all, a lot if not all of the poems, songs, FB posts, maybe even improv moments weren't original at all, had lines ripped off from others' songs or poems, or were just direct quotes from somewhere and didn't reference the origin.

Full disclosure, I never did this academically.  I just did that when it came to social or recreational encounters.

Over the past few of years, my interactions on social media have become less and less.  If I did post anything referencing something else, I made sure to cite the source, but because I can't seem to post anything original or if the subject isn't humorous, I just refuse to post anything at all.  I don't make updates posts about my life because I'm starting to see it as a plea for attention or thinking that the post wouldn't be interesting enough so what's the point.

When it comes to my most recent venture, video game streaming, it started off fun and encouraging because I was fresh at it, my cousin (who had been streaming for a while) was helping and sending people over to watch my streams, and I felt I could try to emulate people I follow on YouTube who make gaming videos.   Over time, my cousin focused on his channel and streamed with others,  viewers became less and less and my confidence and motivation waned because I felt like I was falling into a hole of just playing the same game to get the same viewers.  Now, I have only felt comfortable streaming with my friend but it just comes down to the same games again, even though I like them, I don't necessarily want to play them all the time.  When it comes to starting a new game, I feel I want to stream it but know I won't get a good amount of viewers so I just don't play the game.

What turns me away from it more is I feel I can't put my personality into it.  My profile thumbnail is a self-portrait of me by an artist for commission.  When it comes to making an overlay, alerts, or other features that would show more of my personality, I can't think of anything or suggest anything to someone who could make them for me because I feel plain.  I've been trying to draw something myself to make myself feel cool but again, it feels like I'm doing something for attention.

What is really annoying about all of this is that these thoughts have only started manifested because I'm starting to believe in my horoscope.  My wife checks instagram on a regular basis and some of the accounts she follows are basically making memes of horoscope stereotypes and habits.  I'm a Leo and my wife likes to share posts of Leo memes with me.  Some times it's funny because it is accurate but it makes me question everything I do.  Some times I sing because I want to sing or just be silly, but I'm constantly reminded by my wife that I'm a Leo and I do things for attention.

The reason I feel like this post is a paradox or conundrum to me (whichever is the right term for this) is by making this post, I feel like I'm doing this for attention but I can't keep these thoughts in my head.  If it seems like I'm begging for attention, fine.  I needed to write this out for myself because I can't fear speaking my feelings especially my inner thoughts.  I thought it would be better to share this with people who may have experienced this or know of a better way to combat these feelings.  Sorry for the rant."

In december, her mental health started declining again to the point where she had suicidal thoughts almost daily. When quarantine started things got even worse, and now I'm insanely worried about her. The past two weeks she has been acting really weird and not like herself. Yesterday she started expressing that she wants to die/shouldn't exist and that she needs to ""leave me forever"" because she thinks she ruins my life. She's just... very depressed and pushing me away. 

She has online therapy once a week, but I'm afraid she needs more help, both mental and physical (constant stomach ache, passing out frequently, weird sensation in the heart etc) She's told me that her parents (who can be very toxic and sometimes affect her a lot) have been noticing things lately and are very worried, and they've talked about taking her to a hospital. We're long distance (different countries) so I can't come and drag her there, but I'm honestly considering calling her parents and telling them how serious things are and beg them to please help her since I can't. I don't want anything to happen to her, I just need some advice...She's in her early 20s btw, so an adult..."
1735,Murderous ideation?,"I don’t know really what to say here. I’ve always kind of had this itch in the back of my mind about murder. It’s not something that I would ever act on, much like some forms of suicidal ideation, it’s just something I think about. I don’t make complex plans or plan to kill a specific person, it’s more like something that I feel like I should do before I die. This is something that I feel like I couldn’t talk about with my therapist, as they do warn that if they believe their clients are a danger to others/themself then they may be reported. I don’t really know what I’m doing with this post, it’s just something I need to get out. Is this normal? I know it isn’t, but maybe it isn’t as weird as I think it is. I’m not an asocial person. I have plenty of friends, a girlfriend, and a nice family. I don’t know why I’m like this. If anyone has any advice or anything at all I would appreciate it."

Help!,"So after 6 long months of torture after my general doc retiring without notice and abruptly being ripped off my anxiety meds without a taper process, I finally got in to see my new gen care doc yesterday. He agreed to give me back my klonapin for my intense anxiety. I cannot function without my meds. He also started me on effexor. Problem is, my old doc had me on 1mg, twice a day of klonapin. Now, this doctor gave me .5 mg as needed, only 20 in the bottle, with no refills! I have to take 4 at a time to equal what I am used to taking! This isn't nearly enough and I'm nervous to bring it up to him as I don't want to seem like a drug seeker. I've been looking into online pharmacies out if the US, but can't seem to find a good one. I found one. But they said 2 to 3 months for delivery! Do you guys have any advice or experience with online pharmacies?  Any help is greatly appreciated."
1739,Duck Duck Goose - The Tale of Three Diagnosis',"So my Psychologist suggested that I may have Bipolar disorder in early March 2020 so I talked to my family doctor about it and she suggested I get a Psychiatric consult to see what they thought.  After seeing Psychiatrist 1 she wanted a second opinion as I have had a number of psychotic breaks in my life which would mean Bipolar 2 is not a correct diagnosis.  After seeing Psychiatrist 2 I felt comfortable with the diagnosis and that it fit.  They medicated me and the medication has just started working.  Psychiatrist 2 is not able to accept me as a patient due to where they work they only do one time consults.  Psychiatrist 3 talked to me for the least amount of time approx 30 min and we didn't click well.  He really focused on my childhood ability to make friends we moved every 2 years so I didn't have a lot of friends growing up.  I spoke to my family doctor and she is believing Psychiatrist 3 but allowing me to stay on the antipsychotic at a lower dose of 50 mg.  I feel like  the Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis is because he doesn't believe I am actually ill and thinks I am attention seeking.  I have suffered with mental illness for the last 20 years and very few people know about it as I do everything I can to hide it so I am definitely not doing this to seek attention.  The last depressive episode I had was terrifying and I was totally out of control that is why my psychologist suggested I speak with my doctor.  My psychologist advised that she has not seen any signs of Borderline Personality Disorder in me at all.  My doctor wants me to continue to see Psychiatrist 3 and roll with his diagnosis.  I am not sure what I should do or can do in this situation.  

Psychiatrist 1 -  April 2, 2020  
Diagnosis - Bipolar 2 rapid cycling, depression, anxiety, possibly ADHD as well

Psychiatrist 2 - April 16, 2020  
Diagnosis - Bipolar 1   
Recommendation - Quetiapine 

Psychiatrist 3 - April 29, 2020 (This is supposed to be my ongoing psychiatrist)  
Diagnosis - Borderline personality Disorder  
Recommendation - Go off all my meds immediately no need to taper (150 mg Quetiapine &amp; 20 mg citilapram) and buy a dialectic therapy work book then book another appointment in a month.  Once he talked to my doctor he changed that and said I can keep at 50 mg Quetiapine and the citilapram, I took notes during our appointment so he is giving me a different message than my doctor then acting like I am being crazy."
1740,I (F19) have panic attacks almost every day ugh,"So it’s very possible that I have panic attacks bc I’m lowkey scared of coronavirus...but I’m also panicking about other things. Such as, being around people. Like people I know. For the last year, I was never too comfortable being around my friends, not like they were mean but I was just anxious. I repeat, it’s not like I don’t like them, I would rather be around them then like people I go to school with etc. But I got so comfy at home these days and haven’t seen my friends for like 2,5 months now.

I get panic attacks at night mostly. I start crying and sobbing and I feel like I cannot breathe. I guess K should find a therapist, but everytime I’m not having the attack, I feel like I don’t need therapy. Then I have it and I can’t find a therapist in the middle of my panic attack.

My boyfriend know about this but he doesn’t realy understand what’s happening. Like why am I panicking. The honest answer is: I don’t know either! I mean, it is bc I don’t want to get infected but it’s also that I’m just to anxious about being outside. 

Sometimes I cry for hours and then I can’t sleep. I’m so scared this will be a regular thing. I don’t want it to be.  I just don’t

What helps you during panic attacks and also, how can you help someone who has it? I think I can tell my boyfriend what would help me but I feel so blank.

1743,8 Psychological Tricks To Overcome Stress and Lift Mood Up,[removed]
1744,Asking for help,"So extra long story short I am 22 years old and I suffer from depression and sometimes severe anxiety. I never really allowed it to cripple me the way it does now until college and since it has, Ive had so much trouble managing it the way I did before this bad time in my life. I try to ask for help but the company I have surrounded myself with until this point aren’t exactly bleeding hearts and I end up getting blunt truths and problem solving rather than the big hug I truly feel like I need. I’m not here for that big hug (although if your offering I definitely won’t turn you down) but I would like to get better at explaining what I feel even if I doubt their genuineness or my own sanity, which I do very much. But overall I think I really need to get out of my own head but I really just have no idea where to start or how to feel like I made any progress. I know this is a personal journey but I would really appreciate any insight someone could give. Just asking for help on here makes me feel down on myself and I really wish I could do something about it."
1745,Struggle with overthinking,"I've been an overthinker since I was a kid. My mind would never stop thinking about scenarios that already happened and may happened. Over and over again. I guess as a way to stop overthinking, I became denial. I wanna add that I'm  also a hoarder which also started when I was a kid. At first, I started ignoring the items I'd hoard. Then, I started ignoring any schoolwork I needed to finish (I actually like studying and doing school projects but the fear of failing grades makes me not wanna do it).  I started ignoring my health all and just did and eat things without really thinking about it even if I'm allergic to it. 

I only realized it during high-school and my friends  visited my house. They were disappointment and expect idk a better looking and bigger house I suppose. They said it was too messy, so much clutter and smaller than they expect. They even said different from my image. I felt so judged and confused that even now that I've finish college and started working, I don't like the idea of people coming to my house. None of the guys I've dated has visited  my house.

Obviously, this affected my mental health and my personality a lot. I felt so insecure and unsure of my so called friends. Specially since I have experience people denying we were friends when they are ask even right in front of me. (for context, they said they considered me their friends but just felt like denying it) 

I've been trying to improve this past year. I've manage to keep my hoarding problems on a minimum. I dont go buying and collecting stuffs anymore but I still find it hard to let a lot of my stuff go. But the overthinking I can't shake off. And because I learned to be in a state of denial, this became a cycle and confuses me a lot. I work from from and have no friends which I feel like is making things worse. Would appreciate a really good advice. Also wanna note, I'm a pretty positive person. I always try my best and see the good in things but it just doesn't seem to work when I do it for myself."

1747,Tips for Dealing with Overwhelming Emotions?,"My life has been going pretty great over these past 6 months, but the good stuff ended up being a trigger for past trauma I never had the time to deal with.

I'm gonna list the good things that happened because it helps me recognize them for bad times:

* I got hired into my career field and feel pride in the work I'm doing. I even got hired before my student loans were due for repayment.
* I moved into my half-brother's in-laws (living with his mother-in-law, one of his sister-in-laws, and one of his brother-in-laws). They are wonderfully loving people and accepted me as family long before my brother married into them.
* I bought a car for myself, and it was the car I wanted! I also paid half of the car's value as a down payment and should pay off the loan before the end of the year.
* I have something of a weird, complicated romantic relationship/not-a-relationship with the BIL I live with. He treats me with respect and makes me happy, and we work well together.
* I have time to explore who I am.

But all these good things, especially my last bullet above, have triggered an emotional breakdown/breakthrough. I finally have the time to slow down and relax, but back in January, I was thinking about my relationship with my dad (the main source of the past trauma) and realized that it wasn't what I thought it was. After that, a bunch of repressed memories came to the surface as I hadn't dealt with them for at least 10 years.

I feel so overwhelmed with all the emotions, and I have a bunch of intrusive thoughts that make me doubt whether I deserve any of the good things that have happened to me these past 6 months (and other deep-seeded doubts).

Does anyone have any tips on how to combat intrusive thoughts and calm the overwhelming feeling? I just started seeking professional help this week and feel like it's a step in the right direction, but I would like advice from people who have had similar experiences, too."

1749,When is it time to seek for professional help,"I've been struggling with a break up for two months now and this week my situation got so much worse I think I might need professional help. I got dumped by a text after 7 years of being together and just a few days ago I saw him with a new girlfriend. Since then, I only lay in my bed and I don't eat or drink. My kidneys hurt so much. I keep myself busy with watching movies all day long because the minute I'm alone with my thoughts, I start hiperventilating, I barely breathe and my chest hurts like hell. I'd rather pee in my bed than get up and use the toilet. I have no energy to shower, I can't even answer my phone calls. I've been thinking of going to my doctor, but I'm really afraid that she would think that my situation isn't that bad, because it's only a break up. I tried talking to my friends but I can see how I'm less and less in the mood for even opening my mouth. I can't. I don't listen to any advice on how I should get myself together. I can't."
1750,"What do you do after you’ve tried therapy (&amp; everything else) to help treat your mental “illness”?

Therapy has not felt that helpful, up until my newest therapist who’ve I’ve seen for about a year now. 
I have depression, generalized &amp; social anxiety, and CPTSD. As well as being a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) and an empath... basically I take everything to heart no matter if I want to or not, and I’m extremely affected by criticism &amp; hate to upset others.. oh and I have ADHD, so a whole mix of things. And I’m introverted, of course.

Anyways, I’ve tried (and been handed) numerous things to help my mental health, which include: 

-exercising: I enjoy ballet &amp; gymnastics
-eating well (felt more like placebo..)
-antidepressants: NEVER taking those suicide pills again
-herbals such as ashwagandha, holy basil (those were definitely placebo)
-being more social (but that also adds extra anxieties with the social aspect of it) 
-go to therapy (helps ease my suffering only during the time of therapy, immediately after I’m right back to feeling like my shitty self)
-microdosing mushrooms: these have had the most PROFOUND affect and especially compared to everything else I’ve tried, and it’s happened in a matter of 2 months!


I’m feeling like I’m stuck now. Like there’s no more options for me to try. I think reading up so much about mental illnesses and trying to help myself from worksheets online &amp; such,  has like bombarded my mind with like:
 “since ______ is happening, I should be doing _____”  but then I get upset that I can’t use this knowledge “in action” so then I just get overall frustrated because I like expect that I should be able to do this.

Idk, any advice is welcomed. Thank you for reading if you did."

Hello, 
I’m an 18 year old girl, childhood was horrible and traumatic, current life unstable and full of stress guilt and worry. I don’t think I fear anything because anything that should scare me just makes me angry, I turn any pain I feel into anger as well it’s my way of coping with it because being angry is easier than being hurt. That’s been how I do and deal with things for as long as I remember, I’ve been committed to a psychiatric hospital a few months ago before for suicide attempts. I thought I was getting better but now I don’t know what’s wrong with me I don’t think I’m depressed but at random times I start freaking out but not like get frantic, I just freeze up physically but in my head it’s like there’s a storm messing up my brain, it makes me want to cry scream yell and run but I just freeze. It feels like my brain starts working at crazy speed but my body just sits there. I used to be able to just go somewhere quiet alone and it goes away after a few mins but now it takes hours and hours and sometimes keeps me awake at night and makes me overthink and get extremely angry and hurt but still frozen up. It’s been happening for a long time but recently it’s gotten so bad. Suddenly I’d be happy and hyper and all of the sudden my mood crashes and I’m just either extremely sad and want to be alone and cry, or go hectic in my head and freeze up physically. The latter is the worst, I hate it the most because even though both make me feel ugly pathetic and helpless, the latter makes me feel so embarrassed and just want to hide away because it’s so ridiculous. What do I do? Am I just being a baby?"

1755,Meds causing more issues than mental illness itself? Venting a little.,"Been going through a very tumultuous period in my mental health journey the last 2 years. In a way I like to think I'm burning everything down to build it back up new again (unwillingly but it's the most optimistic view I have on it)

Was having perceived trouble in 2015, life long anxiety/depression since puberty. Went to see a psych, got thrown on Zoloft and Klonopin. Next year that same psych threw me on some stimulants as well. This combo helped immensely for a few years. Graduated undergrad, started a business out of school, went to grad school at the same time. Things 'felt' better socially even though my friendship circle In 2018 however, I started having a LOT of cognitive issues reoccurring/beginning, things like memory issues, increased suicidality (please save the hotline replies lol), trouble concentrating even though I was on dexedrine, and overall growing brain-fog and inability to strategize. 

Saw another psych later that year when my first decided to go to another state. The new one was inexperienced, she took me off klonopin way too quick even though I was on it almost daily for a few years at that point. My mental health fell off a cliff. I was like a deer in headlights for 6 months and couldn't even answer a phone call, text or email without having a panic attack. All while still being on 200mg of Zoloft (upped from 150 by her as well). The klonopin withdrawal is a whole story on its own, but I could tell my psyche/brain had been immensely damaged. Had to let the business fizzle out as I tried to recover my sanity...unsuccesfully so far.

About 6 months later things started clearing up a little, but still having increased suicidality, confusion, memory issues (short term, event-based, even long term). I was still living in a massive fog. I decided to wean my way off Zoloft as well in April of 2019. I'm here a year later at 25mg now rather than the 200mg I was on. Each drop has caused a whole host of issues as well but they seem to resolve as my brain gets used to it. I got back on dexedrine July of 2019 and since then been on and off but mostly on still at like 5-10mg every other day. Got a job close to where I live in IT reluctantly just to pay off some of the debt from the business. I'm almost still too depressed because of what happened to continue with the business, there's this big emotional block stopping me from pursuing it any further. Mainly regret and self doubt, that I can't do these things without a benzo an ssri and a stimulant coursing through my veins.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the memory issues are still pretty present, the suicidality is still pretty ugly, though controllable.  The brain fog is still very very present, I can think somewhat clearly after a long period of aerobic exercise, but it's short-lived. The depression is very on and off, but the farther I get from the drop the easier it is to control. I've been seeing a CBT guy the last 2 years during all of this but he's, in fact, witnessed my deterioration rather than my restoration. The last 3 years feels like a \*complete\* blur other than this story I keep telling myself.

I seem to constantly be retelling myself and reddit this story in an effort to gain insight, but all insight I gain from books or reading seems to go in one ear, stick for a day or so, then go out the other and not stick around. I can't tell if this is advanced adhd now or maybe OCD related but I'm really worried about my future. I'm in an IT job unrelated to what I studied, still live with my parents at 26, every job I apply to I haven't gotten a response. I'm terrified to continue to go off my med even though I have a deep gut feeling a lot of problems will resolve once my brain gets used to not having an SSRI blunting emotion and feeling any longer. Maybe even the memory issues will resolve. 

I appreciate anyone who takes a look at this contextual puzzle, really just throwing my situation out into the universe even though retelling my story over and over again is probably the last thing I should be doing. I'm just so concerned with how my brain is functioning (or rather lack of functioning compared to how clear I used to think). Coronavirus isn't helping much but it still feels like the least of my issues and that my problems will probably outlive this crisis, unfortunately."

1758,I'm dealing with Narcism issues,"I think narcism isnt bad enough to be considered as a mental disease but it really affects me and its also have the particularity to hurt more the other people than the one who have it.

Narcism isnt just when you look in the mirror and you say to yourself ""i'm soooo beautiful"", its like when you consider yourself as flawless, that you should be an example for all humanity, that you are some sort of superior to others or that they are inferior to you. I'm conscious of being Narcist so I try to not brag around my friends or my family but sometimes I just dont realise that i'm being an asshole or that i'm hurting the person like for example if I do a mistake and a friend call me out for it, rather than just accepting that i've made it, i'll put the blame on him/her, say that he/she call me out for everything anyway. Or I feel like sometimes, when somebody put more important in priority rather than puting me in the center of its attention, i'll think mean stuff like ""this guy is so self-centered, never take care of his friends"" "" she dont even like me, why am i friends with her"". Also i'm Bisexual will cause other issues because when I see an attractive guy, i find him hot but I also think stupid like ""How dare HE be hotter than me? Only I should the hotest person in the world!"" and i also blame myself for finding him attratctive because its like im being one of those simp who give him attention that I think he doesnt deserved.

I'm also scared that it will get worst someday and I wont even realize what I'll do

should i see a psychiatrist for this kind of issues?"

It’s not just waking around it sounds like they’re bringing down the house. Today I’ve been purposefully keeping really quiet. Keeping the TV really low, whispering to speak, gently closing every door. Nothing today from them, no stomps. Silence for the first time. I just feel like I can’t even breathe without irritating them. I don’t think I’m THAT loud normally. Just living my life...it’s taking me effort to be his quiet.

I worry that I’m suffering from paranoia but at the same time, last week my car was egged after DH and I had a yelling battle (quarantine with a baby and no one else...we had a fight big deal) and then I was talking about driving my car to the back pad and yesterday I was walking out there and found a few roofing nails all facing the same way across the pad I would’ve parked my car on... idk I think they want us gone but for now I just going to continue to be as quiet as I can just to live in peace. Our lease ends in 10 months and we just moved here and I love the house but I can’t live like this anymore. Next place is going to be a house for just us. It’s not even worth the money saved at this point because I feel stressed out constantly."
1760,Questioning my diagnosis lately,"So I’ve dealt with mental health issues since I can remember. My dad was mentally, physically and sexually abusive starting at the age of 4. My mom never believed me and he so he was around until I was about 13, he got caught abusing another child and was arrested and removed from our home etc. Then my mom goes to bat for him through court and shit and that’s also when her addiction to drinking started. My mom stopped caring about a lot in general, and would leave me home with my younger brother and sister and a 2’6 of whatever liquor I wanted and that was how I ‘babysat’ when I was 14. I stopped going to school as much and stuff, and my mom didn’t really care until or unless there was a complaint from school or something because she felt like it made her look bad. Well by the time I was 15 I hated school, I was so depressed, and I had gotten mixed in with a bad guy and an abusive relationship. Eventually I talked to my mom and high school counsellors about it and we got me into see a psychiatrist. And his diagnosis is fair, but I think also lacking slightly. First of all, I only ever met with him once. He diagnosed me after talking to me for an hour. Second, he had a student with him studying and I said I was ok with it but as soon as I started to talk about my life I regretted letting her stay. I couldn’t focus with her also focused on me. And then, the psych was an asshole. I’m Mexican, can speak broken Spanish. I could tell he was also Lantino or Hispanic by his last name and accent. And he was exactly like my dad. Old fashioned, strict and just ugh. Too much in common. Towards the end of my session I remember talking about how I felt and he diagnosed me with Dysthymia, which now also called Persistent Depressive Disorder. He told me I needed to stop being a baby and start taking responsibility. Now at 15 that was totally not what I was expecting to hear, but after I took a second I realized, like my dad, he has way more broken English. I think he meant take responsibility for my feelings, but it took me a while to not feel hurt enough to realize that. 
So now fast forward today. The depression is so crippling still. My anger is so intense. My mood swings are so bad I can’t figure them out anymore. I get so irritated by loud noises, touch, smells anything that affects my senses. Sometimes I feel like it’s more than just depression. And I am wanting to get back into therapy soon, I just had to put so much money into a stupid surgery and that was also stressing me out a lot. Now that’s over and done with though I want to take my mental health on again. I want to talk to a new psychiatrist, one that has enough patience and insight and preferably female like me so there’s no weird fucking reminders of my dad by any chance or any other stupid guy. I hate how angry I get over the smallest things. I also hate how I can’t control it. You want to sing a song you like but I don’t? Stop, my ears can’t take it. You want to make small talk in the car? Nope I’m gunna blow up cus I get triggered by the stupidest things I’m not even sure of anymore. I don’t know what this is all about but I hope I figure it out soon."
1761,Empathy for inanimate objects,"I have this issue, and it ranges from feeling sorry for discarded toys and such - to situations where I've mindlessly been chewing on something like a broken tiny keyboard support, I'll come to the realisation that I've fucked  up the rubber on it badly, and immediately be overwhelmed by distress.

1763,Everyday I fall into this deep depression because I think about all the times I’ve failed those I’ve loved and it sucks and I can’t seem to direct my attention anywhere else,"My mom recently told me she was raped as a child and I feel awful because I wasn’t there to protect her even though I wasn’t born, she shouldn’t have gone thru that — hell no one should.. I keep asking her for the name of the guy who did it so I can “pay him a visit” but she won’t give it up.. my grandmother died a year ago from cancer and I felt and still feel so hopeless because there’s nothing I can do.. I fucking hate that.. I smoke weed and it relaxes my thoughts for some time but as soon as the high is up all these thoughts just keep coming back... my doctor won’t prescribe me any more medication because I haven’t been there since Feb., the main reason why I haven’t gone is because it’s $250 per session with insurance... we also have to move and we can’t find a place so I keep thinking we’re going to be homeless and it’s really affecting my dreams like nightmares... also 3 days ago I watched some women fight on the street then next thing i know some kid came up with a gun and started shooting, first time ever with that experience and now I’m just scared and hopeless"
1764,My degrading mental health.,"Hi.

So my mental health is degraded. I've had depression for roughly 5 years now and it's really worse rn. Idk what to do. My parents dont understand and i'll kill myself anyday now."
1765,Need some guidance and advice,"I'm a 22yr female that has been struggling with my depression and my demons lately. I've had a lot happen to me the last 2 months and I am feeling completely lost.  

My boyfriend confessed to a sex addiction, my parents are living with us until they find a new home because my Mamaw passed away, and I am in a very toxic work environment.  I don't have motivation to go so I haven't.  Most days I call off. I look for new jobs but I'm so scared of not knowing what's going to happen.  I can't shake this. I have no motivation for anything.  I've had depression and anxiety for at least half of my life and I've learned what helps but nothing is helping anymore. 

I guess what I'm asking is what do I do?
How can I find my way again?
How can I get over the fear of change? 
How can I gain my motivation back?
How can I start feeling again other than guilt and regret? 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post"
1766,I think I might be dealing with Depression and Low Self Worth.,"This is a very long story, so be ready.

I’ve had this amazing friendship with this girl that lasted for almost half a year. At some point, I was in a relationship with her. But after breaking up with her (so many times) Our friendship was abit rocky (Let’s call her Jane.)

Recently, my friendships with my other friends (let’s call them Tom and Hannah) weren’t going so great. Tom messages me telling me that our friendship wasn’t working out and that we couldn’t be friends anymore.
I let go of them, get over it and accept it all, and i tell Jane this, to which she tells me that Tom and Hannah were talking about cutting me off on Discord and talking behind my back.

I don’t know why, but I feel this sense of Low Self worth corrupting me and making me upset that Jane is still talking with Tom and Hannah, who was talking behind my back. I feel a mix of Jealousy, anger, sadness inside me. I get upset, and let all my anger out on Jane that she’s still friends with the people who are being horrible to me, and not sticking with me. To make things worse, I hurt myself and tell Jane this. I feel like they’re all better than me and it breaks my heart, literally. I stop talking to Jane and go on instagram to see Tom commenting on her posts, which makes me worse. I stop talking to Jane, as she was mad at me and I get upset.

The next day, Hannah messages to me about how much of a disgusting person I am, for telling Jane about harming myself, to play with her feelings and manipulate her all because she wanted to talk to them. 
This make me think.

I feel disgusted by my own acts for being selfish and that I shouldn’t have done all of this to her as it was wrong. I feel selfish but then again I feel like I’m worthless, as I always think Jane is too good for me and out of my league which drives me to feel horrible things.

Ive fallen into a state of depression by feeling not good enough for Jane, and for manipulating her and controlling her at the same time. I didn’t want to eat, drink or shower at all, and my parents took note of this and I’ve told them everything. I feel worthless that she’s better than me and I feel betrayed but then again I feel like I’m the bad person for manipulating her, which makes me feel worser as a person.

This has happened for a week. I’m struggling coping with the situation, that I’ve lost the bestest friend I’ve ever had because of my selfish acts and I should have let her talk to them, because they’re better friends anyway. My dad booked an online therapist for me to talk to, but she advised me to not post this on Reddit. I wanted to share this situation and my thoughts to you all, because I think I’m dealing with Depression and Low self worth about myself. I really didn’t want any of this to happen, and I feel like there’s hope for me to improve and be better."
1767,depression and ADHD,
1768,I was probably sexually abused in my childhood and I'm realizing it only now (22F),"I think I was slightly sexually abused/taken advantage of when I was a child. At the age of 15 a memory of something odd struck me. I don't want to detail it here but it wasn't something close to rape, yet it was undoubtedly some sort of sexual exploitation. It happened when I was 7 or 8 (via my 12 y/o neighbor).

I didn't tell anyone about it, ever, except for 2 guys I talked to over the internet (no one that knows me in real life knows about it). The last one convinced me it might be the source of my depression and anxiety, and generally my emotional issues. My mood is very unstable. I often feel depressed, but I can wake up the next day and feel sort of fine. Yet I'm never actually fine. If I deeply focus my attention on my feelings I know something is wrong, is not whole - missing. I want to start therapy and I checked with a few therapists, but the current situation makes it really difficult. My university is in a different city (I'm at my parents' right now), and there's no comfortable public transportation. I don't want to start therapy here, because then I'll have to come here just for the sessions, for who knows how long (therapy can take years...).

I also had a weird thing happening with my hair - just after I talked to the last guy, realizing that I might have a deep trauma I'm not acknowledging - a certain section of my hair fell out (they say it can be related to stress). Also, I've realized I'm attracted to abusive men and I have a feeling it's related to my childhood.

I don't know how to deal with my feelings now and I don't know when I'll be able to reach out for help. I don't have a lot of friends. Actually, I barely have them. My closest person is my sister, and I feel so ashamed to tell her about this. I'm also reluctant because she doesn't really believe this thing where people are suddenly reminded of their childhood abuse. She thinks it's false memory.

I'm afraid I'm ""fucked up"". I don't know how to resolve this.

I have no one talk about it with and it makes me feel like I'm about to explode sometimes."

1770,Please tell me it gets better. This pain is intolerable.,"I’m in a very dark place rn. The monsters in my head are taking over. I can’t think positive. I can’t fucking tolerate this, it just hurts so much. I hate being so alone. No one in the world gives a shit about my existence. The world is such a cold and brutal place, people lack empathy. Everyone only chases after money . I’m afraid of the world. I don’t think I’d be able to make it with these horrible mental illnesses."
1771,Picking and Scratching?,"Since I was younger I always picked at my skin, especially if I had a scab or pimple. 
For about 5ish years I've picked at my lips until they bleed. Doctors said I do this because I have anxiety and I should grow out of it. But everyday I worry about my chapped lips and keep peeling with the same bleeding results. 
But this is not the main problem. 
I have, since February, been picking my scalp in the same manner as my lips. Usually around the bottom back of my scalp. 
I constantly have a bleeding scalp and scabs. It has come to the point where I have to let my mom wash my hair cause if I do it, I would do it too hard and cause more injury.
This might be a result of my anxiety. But it feels like I have something under my scalp, but there is nothing there. I don't have any physical problems like dandruff, lice, bed bugs, ticks, or fleas in my house but my scalp feels unsettled. 
The best way I can describe it is that phantom itch that people have when they see a spider or a swarm of bugs they don't like.. 
Does anyone have an explanation for this? 
I want to stop but I keep feeling the imperfections in my scalp and that phantom itch that I continue doing it every day. I'm worried that I will continue and it will get worse or the sensation will start spreading to other parts of my body.
Any advice would be helpful, thank you"
1772,Parents said no meds,"I'll make this short. I've been on and off meds for a while. Lately I've been getting extremely suicidal, I can't sleep nor eat and I get panic attacks left and right. I thought I'll start meds again as this is an emergency but lmao because of literally the smallest arguement about me telling my brother something my parents just went off and said ""I can't wait till you die'' and kept going about how I should/will die alongside other stuff in front of my brother (12 year old)  As much as I hate it it's common but then they found out I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow and he said I'm not gonna give you any money and threatened my family not to let me go or not to give me cash. And he said ""nothing is wrong with you there is no need to go anywhere""   

I hate to sound dramatic but I've kept the fact that I've been raped multiple times by members of their family a secret. And  I have papers showing what you exactly is wrong with me. My face shows it, my moods show what's wrong and here I am told there's nothing wrong with you. 

I'm not religious due to some of my personal problems and they just use that and when I told them prayers and god won't fix this issue they just lost it. So yeah choose your religion and beliefs over your child who is on the verge of doing something.

I'm not writing this for sympathy, I have no hate towards anyone or any religion nor am I begging for anything. I just wanted to share it with everyone.

I hope all of you out there are staying strong and brave 🙏

1773,Getting back to work after taking time off due to mental health,[deleted]
1774,Prescription after visit,"Hi. I had a visit with a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety. He asked me if I would like to try medications and offered SSRI, I said that I was sceptical and wanted to get more information. Since it was past our scheduled time, he said to contact him another time. I contacted the office few hours later and said that I am ready to give medications a try, they told me that I would need to schedule another appointment with the doctor to get the prescription. My insurance is not great so I cannot schedule another appointment at this time, there is nothing more that I can tell the doctor. Is this normal? If I am being offered a prescription but the visit time is almost ending and I dont have enough time to make the decision, does Dr need to schedule another appointment or can he prescribe meds after the visit? 

In this case I will have to pass until my financial situation gets better. I also cannot take another day off at my job to get another appointment."
1775,i just had a dream,"i dream a lot but this morning i had a dream where my mam was talking to me and called me her son. (im trans so that would mean so much to me) she said she loved me and that my dad told her to try start calling me my name. i started crying and hugging her and woke up crying because my mam doesnt know my name, im not out to my dad and my mam basically ignored what id said when i came out. id have prefered a nightmare to this."
1776,Does this ever happen to you?,"When you engage in conversation with people. It feels like you can envision how you come across. How you talk, your body language and such. It feels like I'm looking at myself from someone else's eyes. 

Is it just me? I think it may be paranoia or anxiety, not sure.

Sometimes when I'm talking to someone it's like I'm looking through them. I'm only seeing myself from there point of view. It doesn't always happen in the midst of a conversation too, sometimes it happens after the conversation is finished.

And I think did I really say that? Why did my face look like that? Did I use the right expression? Sometimes I will pursue the person and apologise to them for saying such things. 

They look puzzled. There like ""Sorry for what, don't be silly."""
1777,A Poem that Helped me Through my Darkest Days,"About  two year ago I was facing the darkest times of my life. I was  dealing  with loss, personal troubles and depression. I felt helpless, weak and  tired. I wished I was able to feel strong and  motivated to get my life  back together.

But after several  months of tears and pain I decided to accept this  reality and pulled  myself together and stood on my feet to face it.

One  of the things that helped me through the tough days  were those kind of  simple online videos where the author shares his / her own story in an  attempt to help others facing similar issues to know that they are not  alone in their struggle especially with depression.

So I present to you my own attempt to give solace and motivation to  anyone who's facing painful time and feeling helpless.

[https://youtu.be/Goo6vFrn8cI](https://youtu.be/Goo6vFrn8cI)

I  know that many has clinical depression and facing serious traumas and  that well power alone isn't gonna make things be OK. But  for me the  feeling of not being alone in this was a major contributor for me to  feel better.  
Please take care &lt;3"
1778,Small victory today but I'm spiralling,"I resigned from a teaching job that doesn't make me happy today (specifically, put in my notice today). I'm a part-time retail worker and was temporarily furloughed from that job, which I plan to keep doing after the pandemic restrictions are lifted. I've been at the one I'm resigning from for longer and it's tangential to my dream job; unfortunately it exacerbates a lot of my mental issues.

I'm feeling relieved that this is finally happening, since I never particularly wanted to teach, but racked with guilt for quitting. I have good relationships with my students and staff, and it feels like moving into retail is ""going backwards"" in my career somehow. It's really not, because once I get back to the retail job, I am slated for a promotion. It's perhaps a less ultimately meaningful job, but now I can let my hobby (the thing I was teaching) be a hobby again.

It's complicated and I'm feeling a whole lot of ways about the whole thing. Prioritizing my mental health is scary because it changes so much for me."

1781,"Im finally happy (tw, mentions of suicide attempts and rape)","I made it i finally realised it. Im crying right now im so happy. I just went a week straight of being happy without the aid of perscription drugs or a therapist. I'm on my boyfriend's couch right now taking a break from cleaning to post this. I'm so proud of myself im painting more and singing more and im happy. Its weird i never thought i would ever feel this again. I sorted through my school work, jm going to graduate highschool. Sure i wont walk the stage or have a chance to decline going to prom, but fuck. I didnt even think i would make jt past 16. I remember my mom beating the shit out of me after i got caught stealjng from walgreens (end of2018), and my suicide attempt that night. Two months after being released from inpatient i was drugged and raped at a party and had another attempt. 3 months after that, i told someone about it and ive been discussing it with authority figures. My mom would verbally abuse me regarding that situation, telling me i was lying about it and how i craved attention and how im fucked up. I was alive to celebrate my one year with my boyfriend. Im able to enjoy music still. Im learning how to cook and bake. I want to go to college and teach art to highschoolers. I finally have a plan and i never thought this would happen. And i just really want to help people. I want them to know that its so hard for things to get better but once things start to pick up, it really doesn't stop. Its hard to get things to get better and im remembering the times where i was drunk and high every day and in a mess of a room and hardly showered or went to school. But even just showering, fuck even putting on deodorant. Getting in that habit just leads to things falling into place and gets you that motivation.  I dont know. I feel bad for kind of bragging. But i am so much better than i was a year ago. Ive moved out. Im okay im healthy im stable and im so proud of myself for it and i havent ever allowdd myself to be proud of the little things ive done."
1782,"Idk if this is dissociation, OCD, or both... I really need some advice","
So... this is going to sound ridiculous so I thought I’d talk about it here because idk if it’s dissociation or not. I do not believe I have a dissociative disorder but yeah.

I definitely have OCD though as I’ve been diagnosed

I’m worried I’m experiencing dissociation issues. This started with me roleplaying as an OC who is literally me. Looks like me, same first name, everything. I only did for like a second because my ocd kicked in and I began worrying it was splitting away from me and taking personality traits with it... as well as even certain sexual preferences and stuff. I feel like it’s a separate presence within me... a separate side of me and i just kept getting into confusion spells when I was doing my homework and everything. I even sometimes feel like certain aspects of myself or emotions feel more distant as if they aren’t mine even though it’s how is normally react before all of this. I’m not suggesting I have DID because this just started with roleplaying. 

I’m just really scared because I feel like I suppressed parts of myself and they cane out like this... idk what this is but yeah.

I have had worries about this when it comes to my ocd before and I’m just freaking out.

This also relates to my sexuality and I felt like I “merged” it back into me but whenever I felt attraction for a girl (like on tv or something), it felt kind of distant and just not mine I guess. I didn’t even think of that before and I don’t know what’s going on with me. Can anyone relate with these worries?

Also whenever I’m about to yell out or react at an intrusive thought, it feels like another presence is “suppressing” me..."
1783,I went my entire life thinking I had FAS. I don't.,"I had neuro-psych testing done a month ago and I got my results back today. All things considered, I am completely normal. 

Except for all of the trauma and abuse I've been through. I have Major Depressive Disorder. General Anxiety Disorder. Complex PTSD. 

Apparently anxiety can be so bad that it mimics the symptoms of other disorders. Mine is so extreme it mimicked FAS and ADHD my entire life.

Cool. Next step, getting an appointment with my doctor to get myself on a stronger anxiety medication."
1784,Left Brain… Right Brain.. complex lifetime of issues.," 

(FYI.. Not contemplating anything bad, just venting and looking ideas on how to heal)

Have struggled with general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, mild to moderate depression, self esteem issues since childhood and overall its been a terrible life.  Granted I have had times where I was happy, fun, carefree and several long term relationships, but if I were able to put the good times vs bad times in a pie chart the combined time of happiness would barely be visible.

Sometimes I feel like my brain functions work left side/right side in terms of one being the focused and realistic side and the other being the emotional total wreck side with the loudest voice and dominate side.  This has led me to total internal conflict my entire life, led to poor choices earlier in life, inability to discuss anything that is troubling or brings conflict and disorder to my mundane day to day existence.  Some days I feel ok, other days filled with anxiety then a few days of being depressed and then the cycle starts over again.

I am miserable and lonely, crave intimacy with someone but due to past toxic relationships I am unable to form any sort of intimate bond or physical closeness with someone of the opposite sex.  I have a high sex drive but due to past issues in relationships, their infidelity, crushing events/words/accusations I have an absolute fear of being intimate with someone now.  Left Brain tells me I can do this and I definitely know that, but when it comes down to actually interacting with them, even meeting, the Right Brain takes over and crashes it all.  Funny thing is I can interact with people at work just fine, in the context of work, but step out of the work environment and I am a total shut down at any conversation.

Over the years I have seen psychiatrist and therapist but pretty much bread crumbed my issues because the emotional side of the brain was screaming and yelling louder than the rational side.  The few times I did open up a bit more was absolutely horrible, I felt way worse after speaking up than before and it just destroyed my inner soul more than it helped to understand it.  So.. meds for depression at times, meds for anxiety pretty constant last 15 years and still same internal conflict.

After my last relationship ended I spent about a week inpatient due to being in a very dark place, after that an entire year pretty much in isolation, work was only social acivity, going to therapy and on meds.  Since then, 6 years now, its been home/work and almost nothing more.  One short platonic budding relationship but I was just to broken inside to move forward and not mentally healthy enough to bring anything positive to the table.

Have had several appointments to restart seeing a MHP but due to recent events all have been canceled by the providers.  One moved to another area the others went on emergency basis only.  Going to try again tomorrow and see if anyone is accepting new patients because I have reached a point where I want to change, improve life and just feel relatively normal again.

Can anyone relate to this concept of knowing what’s realistic yet the emotional side is in the drivers seat and pretty much controls your life day in day out?  No idea if it has a definition, name or label or how best to present it to a MHP other that writing it out, more details of course, and presenting the written document to the provider at appointment time.  Last few interactions with MHP’s was all verbal and we see how well that turned out.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
1785,I think I need help but I don’t know what/where/how to get it /// also venting,"I feel like backstory is important so I’ll give a bit. Canadian 23F, I’ve undergone bullying, mental + physical abuse my whole life, as well as I’ve been sexually abused/taken advantage of twice by two different people. I hold no anger towards any of the people in my past who’ve hurt me as I don’t believe it was personal, but I think it’s caused a lot of trust issues. I assume everyone is trying to use me to gain something just because that has been the pattern in my past. I don’t think I’ve had a single healthy friendship in my lifetime. I grew up with very religious families who claimed I would go to hell if I hugged boys, or that I would go to hell if I wasn’t feminine enough or didn’t wax my legs because “as a woman—one of gods beautiful creatures—it’s important to keep up appearances”. As a kid some kids in my neighbourhood would pick me up and throw me in dumpsters and lock me in until I promised them something (anything from promising to go to the store to buy them candy with my money, to promising to kiss them, to promising I would kill myself to do the world a favour) My religious friends cut contact with me after I turned 18 because I ordered a legal beer at a restaurant for my birthday. My school friends would only want to see me if I could do something for them, like do their hair/makeup, or drive them to their bf’s house, or take photos of the group without me, and I’ve accidentally caught them all gossiping about me behind my back numerous times. Guys have complimented me to my face but then told their friends behind my back how disgusting I am or how I’m “f*ckable but not dateable” etc. I am a working 3D artist and have had friends in the art community tell me that my art was garbage and that I should pursue something else. My family have only ever praised my achievements, my grades, they have never shown affection or attention to me just for being me, I have to achieve in order to exist in their eyes. After 1 year of mental abuse by my ex-boyfriend, I told him I wanted to break up and he got aggressive and pinned me down against my will and abused me without using protection (he was 6’4” 200lbs - I’m 5’2” 95lbs) These are just some examples of events that have occurred in the past 13 years.

Boo fucking hoo right? I’m not trying to say I’m a victim and I’m not here looking for pity. I’ve never seen myself as a victim and I never pitied myself because realistically I’ve had a pretty easy life and I’m grateful for what I have. But my boyfriend has helped me realize how negative my internal monologue is, and how little I trust his word (he is wonderful and supportive and he’s given me no reason to distrust him). I feel like I’ve gotten so used to negative thinking that it’s just normal for me — and I didn’t notice how unhealthy it was to think these thoughts and to think of them as facts. 

When my friends called me a sinner for being friendly with the opposite gender I felt like one, even years after I stopped being religious. My family only gave me worth when I accomplished things and I believed them (now that I’m out of school I’m running out of achievements I feel exceptionally worthless). My boyfriends would call me an ugly boy, or complain that I am too short or too flat chested, I saw that in the mirror and that became my definition of myself too. My friends told me I was a bad artist and I believed them. Kids my age told me I was a waste of a person and that I should kill myself and I believed them. I’ve been believing all of it for so long that I don’t know how to not believe it anymore and I need help.

I currently work for a gaming company making 3D models for games, and my boss who’s been working in the industry for 20 years will tell me how impressed he is with my work and I don’t believe him. Women my age will tell me I’m fun or that they enjoy my company and I don’t believe them. My boyfriend will tell me he loves me/my body and I don’t believe him. I want to believe it and I want it to be true but I just can’t. 

********

I want to and NEED to change. I have seen 3 different sets of therapists/psychiatrists/doctors about 5+ years ago when my healthcare covered it and they’ve all just done the same thing: they sit me down and try to talk me into some kind of revelation about myself but I feel like I’m already aware of what’s happening to me. I know the root of these problems and I know it’s not healthy. I don’t need somebody to help me realize my thoughts are wrongfully biased, I need something to help me change those habits and I’ve never had any help go that far. I don’t know how to train myself to think differently as it always feels like I’m lying to myself. Even if a therapist could help me now, I don’t have any health coverage anymore and can’t afford it (and with the lockdown I wouldn’t be able to get help anyway)

If you read this then thank you. I’m extremely embarrassed to be putting something so personal on the internet but I didn’t know where else to go. If you have any advice, any mental/physical exercises, any activities that have been helpful for you or anyone you know to change thinking habits I would love to hear them. I would also love to hear your stories if any of you are undergoing something similar or have in the past."
1786,I hate myself even though I have no reason to,"Hello everyone. I don't expect anyone to read this, but to anyone who is I would like some advice for what I feel like. I am 15 years old and about to be in grade 10, and I have been feeling depressed for a long time (from around 11-12 years old to now). I am extremely underweight and I always think down upon myself, even though I have no actual problems going on in my life (other than this whole pandemic, which has screwed up everyone's livelihoods). I have friends, a family, food, good grades in school, and overall no apparent issues, but I still feel this way and I don't know why. I also think that I don't have anyone to talk to about this, because my friends would just make fun of me and not take it seriously, and even though my parents would be super supportive I cannot bring myself to do that, just because they have their own problems to deal with and I don't want to make my issues theirs. I didn't want to make this too long, but thank you to anyone reading this, as it is nice to know that somebody cares."
1787,I don't know what to do anymore,"I've been struggling with my home life. It's been terrible, and I'm getting pushed to the edge. My mom's boyfriend is a fucking dick, and insulted me and sister many times. He's always complaining that we're rude when my sister is very depressed. She is quiet and I swear she doesn't even act the slightest like a rude person. He's always starting shit. Drinking a ton, complaining because we're making too much noise, fighting with my mom, screaming at her, throwing tantrums like a child when something doesn't go his way. To add on, my mom just got a kitten like 4 months ago and was so happy about getting her. Now she's sick of her and was trapping the kitten in a box the first week we got her. Then moved on to trapping her in a carrier 2 months later. I have to take the responsibility of taking care of her now. She can't even run around in the living room. She's in my room or my sister's room 24/7. I can't get enough sleep. The kitten is in a terrible environment, and I'm trying my best to take care of her. Before we got the kitten, we had 4 cats before her. The first one was about 10 years old when we got her, and she was rescued. My mom got sick of her because she started peeing on the couch. So she threw her outside and eventually gave her away. The second one she did the same thing. The third one got extremely abused and neglected that he was in one of our cabinets for days and never left. He was scared of everything and my mom just treated him terribly. She ended up giving him to a animal shelter. The fourth one was also neglected and trapped in a pantry a lot. My mom trapped him in the pantry for two days while we were at my grandma's and he died. She was crying hard and I was wondering why the fuck she is crying for him when she abused the shit out of him and my other cats. She killed him. She tried to say he got into something in the pantry, which is a possibility, but he was also starving. Today, she got mad at me because she was planning on trapping the current cat we have now in the pantry and I said that was cruel. She got mad and said ""Shadow died because he got into something toxic."" I tried explaining and throwing facts at her, but she just got mad at me. I've been having angry outbursts, panic attacks, and trouble sleeping. It's difficult. I don't know if I can hang on. Please help me."
1788,I'm starting to hate everything.,"This is going to sound like a political post but it's more about my state of mind. I am excluding my current political opinions. 

I have not always felt so bitter bitter towards everyone I meet, and especially not towards my friends and family. But, my whole life since I was a little kid I've hated myself and always one other thing that I've focused on. In the beginning I was raised christian so that thing was ""evil"", or ""satan"", later as my parents indoctrinated me it became ""liberals"", ""Democrats"", then as I got into middle school and highschool I blamed everything on some wild conspiracies I dont even want to share. 

Finally, by the end of highschool I did a lot of psychedelics and was able to understand that every side has its faults, no extreme is the right answer and this is why we should strive for equilibrium (I also was a super fried out hippie for a year but can report I'm past that). Sadly, as I've experienced a bit more of life as an adult, I realize I just can't find happiness in this. I look at different kinds of people and I cant accept a lot of their decisions and just leave them be. Some people outright disgust me. I dont think I should get into the specifics because my opinions can be extremely offensive. 

I just dont think everyone can coexist with certain kinds of extremes still being upheld by people. And right now the mainstream culture has way too many negative extremes that are no good for our future (Both mainstreams on each pole). I find myself constantly angry when I read any news article so I've just stopped reading the news altogether. I am powerless to change these people and nearly everyone would argue I have no right to want to change them. 

The pure futility of all of it makes it hard to live. I can try and focus on my own life and change it but I feel empty constantly, I am moving forward but I have no passion for anything except when I think about movements on a huge scale like politics and controlling people. The scary thing is that I've gone from wanting everyone to live in harmony to just not enjoying meeting new people and wishing bad things about people in my head. My anxiety has gotten worse and I can barely look anyone in the eyes, i don't know if it's from past drug use deteriorating my brain or if my thoughts have begun to poison my consciousness. 

Everything makes me angry now, my friend's sarcasm, my bosses telling me to do simple tasks, my class assignments, even being asked by friends to hangout. I'm reluctant to do any of it. I honestly just feel the urge to sit in bed and think all day but then that's the worst because I'll end up getting very angry or sad - so I force myself to not do this. I'm out every day doing things but just feeling no positive emotion or reward unless I'm getting drunk on the weekends or smoking the occasional bowl of weed. I'm not abusing these substances either, people around me consume exponentially more and seem to function normally. Everything just feels like a damn chore. 

I dont believe in 1-1 correlations between dreams and life situations but if it means anything at all, I've been having horrible dreams. Lots of them about eclipses and satanic rituals (I'm not religious), and a lot about wild animals and crazy people stalking and killing me. Some of them are semi-lucid, to where I know I'm dreaming and can bring in things that I want, except my consciousness is altered so whatever I pick the dream counters it perfectly until I die painfully and wake up. It's been very disturbing. 

I just want to know what people do to stop feeling so angry and things they cant control. Because the things I can control are getting done I just feel no happiness upon completing them."
1789,I need advice!,"*I'd like to start by saying I'm not the best at articulating my thought or espressing my feelings so please bare with me*

Now that that's out of the way, I can continue.
Basically I need advice. I've been growing more and more depressed and anxious over the past 3ish years. I'd say after the summer of 2017 is when things started to get really bad and started to spiral downward quickly. Not that things were perfect before that, but they were ""better"" for lack of a better word. Those couple of months were most certainly the peak of my life. I had the most friends I've ever had then, and was the happiest I've ever been. I actually had people I could talk to and hang out with. I was somewhat a happy person.
After that summer is when I got my first job (I'm 19 years old by the way) and because of that, had less free time. As a result of this I couldn't really do anything or hang out with anybody as I was constantly busy. So I then started slowly growing apart from my friends. It wasnt like overnight I went from having people to having nobody but over the course of time we slowly drifted apart.
Flash forward to today and I basically have nobody.
Because of this I've been steadily growing more depressed and anxious as time goes on.
It's like, in reality I'm sure that if I were to contact people and try to arrange plans I'm sure they would accept (I'd hope so at least), but I'm too scared to because I feel as though I'm burdening people when I message them or call them.
It's basically a vicious cycle of being sad that I have nobody, and too scared to message anybody.
And the very few and far between times that I do build up the courage to make plans with someone, or they initiate plans with me, it doesn't feel ""real"" if that makes sense. It's like a false glimpse of happiness and being social. In the back of my head most of the time though I'm constantly thinking back to how much happier I was a couple of years ago, and that makes present day happiness fell fake. Like a mirage of something that doesn't actually exist.
*I'd like to also mention* I've never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety although I'm sure I do suffer from them. The reason I've never been diagnosed is I'm too scared to seek professional medical help. The thought of sitting with somebody in a mental health setting makes me really nervous. I don't know why. I think it might be because deep down I don't want to seem weak. The only reason I'm making this post is because my username is literally just 3 random numbers and 2 random letters mixed together and doesn't show me as a person. Also I'm saying all this to a keyboard, not a person therefore I don't feel ""weak"".
Please help me. I've never made an attempt at taking my own life. I think about it though. The thing is, I don't want to die... I want to feel better. I'm reaching out in this group because I need advice. Because I don't know what will happen as time continues to pass. I'm sure that as the years go by I'll get worse and worse if I don't do anything. And then who knows what'll happen? Not me!
What would you do to fix this if you were in my situation feeling as I feel?
What should I do?

P.S. I'm really sorry for the excruciatingly long post. I'm sure it wasn't fun to read, but if you did read it, THANK YOU!"
1790,"I'm not eating much because I'm too ""lazy"" to eat. What's going on with me?","I definitely do get hungry, but I just don't mind. If food is presented to me, I'd definitely eat it, but I'd rather just deal with being hungry than have to make food.

The only reason why I still eat is because I'm self conscious about being skinny, but even then it's only 1-2 meals a day."
1791,Wow! I feel better,"After a year in an addiction medicine program suffering from auditory halucinasions, I finally feel good. I got roped into an SBIRT intervention evidence based program without even knowing it. I was heavily medicated and struggled hearing correctional voices in my head. After finally getting a second opinion they said I was over medicated. I cut out everything and wow!. I finally feel like a normal human being. This last year was literally a nightmare being on all these meds. Just a word of advise. Make sure your not wasting your life feeling weird on meds. 😊"

Just wondering if someone else has this and how they deal with it"
1795,Rejection,"How do you guys deal/cope with rejection? It can be in regards to anything i.e a girl or boy you really liked,  a job you really wanted."
1796,"Girlfriend trapped at home and doesn’t think she’ll last, has multiple mental illnesses","My girlfriend has been trapped in her house for almost two months with quarantine. She hasn’t been able to see me at all. She has depression, anxiety, and bipolar 2. Her mom has kept her completely isolated. We keep trying to see each other and get shot down. Her mom hits her, pulls her hair, and wrestles her phone away when she has panic attacks. She gaslights and never admits she’s wrong. Her mom allows my girlfriends ten year old sister to harass her. Her ten year old sister encouraged her to kill herself and her mom did nothing while right there. Her mom also tries to manipulate her. Her mom messaged me asking her to lie and say I can’t see her before. Messaged me after tracking me down on social media. My girlfriend can’t stand being in that house anymore. She doesn’t belong in a mental hospital. All she needs is a loving environment and she will improve exponentially. We need answers to get her out of that house immediately. She does not want to call CPS or police. She just wants to be with me or her dad (parents divorced, dad has no custody). My girlfriend is a minor so she can’t exactly just leave the house against her moms will. I need to get her out of there. I didn’t know where else to post this. If anyone has advice on what we could do to get her out of there ASAP. Then let me know. Thank you."
1797,I need some advice about if I should hide this in therapy or not,"I'm 16, so I'm not a legal adult. Meaning, if I tell my therapist some of these things, they might call CPS, and I might get taken away from my family. I don't know if it really counts as something that I could be taken away for. I'm gonna try to sum it up in the least amount of words possible. My mom has chronic fatigue, and when she got it, it caused my depression, because I'm so close to my mom. The house got really messy because my parents were both sick, and I was 11. They cleaned it pretty well last year, but it's getting messy again, especially because of quarantine keeping us from taking off trash. Gnats have invaded the house. My room is the cleanest room in the house, but they still annoy me so much. I can't stand them. It brings down my mood a lot. My parents, right now actually, are loading the trash onto the truck until they can take it off on Saturday, the only day the dump is open. (We don't have a dumpster or trash service or anything bc we're broke.) My parents really do love me. I know that for a fact. I'm being treated for my problems. I'm given gifts every holiday. I can talk to my mom whenever I need her. She says even if I have to wake her up, but I'm always uncomfortable doing that. I pretty much always get what I want, I just don't ask for much because I feel guilty doing so. (they don't make me feel that way, I just do.) I'm still scared, though, that if I tell my therapist about these things, that she'll call CPS because she'll think it's child neglect. I feel that because their neglect to the house is because of illnesses, that it shouldn't count as that. And they're trying their best to keep it clean for me. It's a lot better than it was a few years ago. I don't know, I'm just scared to bring any of this up because I love my parents, and I don't want to do something like that to them."
1798,Forced back home and my mental health,"I’m 19 and a college student. Like many, due to COVID-19 I was kicked off campus. My mental health has always been a struggle and it’s really taken a hit with being home. My mother works all day and i sleep most of the day because my schedule is messed up and it’s easier for me to sleep all day then sit in the house and be sad. She has been getting frustrated with me sleeping and not cleaning/helping out but when she expresses her frustration it turns into “i pay the bills and provide you with a roof over your head so if you want that to continue then you have to do this” or “if you want to be treated like an adult” etc. i’m stuck because i understand where she is coming from but it’s really hard to hear that every time she asks me to take care of the dishes."

1800,I need help finding help: Where can I go?,"My boyfriend of 10+ years has been struggling for a while now.  He has crippling anxiety, low self-esteem, and is depressed.  By crippling anxiety I mean: he has trouble going to work on a regular basis and holding down a job, he often gets really anxious about leaving the house for normal activities, he has avoided going out and doing things for years, he talks about chest pain/tightness at the thought of doing things, and if he knows something is coming up he can't stop focusing on it or worrying.  He has explained to me that he is anxious and often talks about being down and unexplainably sad.  There have been improvements here and there with his mood/anxiety but overall it has been a steady decline which worsened with his dad passing a year ago. He really does his best to hold it all together, but i think with some basic help his life and happiness could really improve. 

About a year ago he started to express interest in treatment.  But every time he tried to find services something came up (no new patients, no insurance, cost, cancellations.  We solved the insurance, he is on Medicaid (NJ Family Care through Horizon to be precise).  But he has pretty much given up finding someone.  He has asked me to help him but I don't know what to do.  I am so confused by the system and the resources. COVID has made it more complicated.  I know he needs to talk to someone but I have no idea how to make it happen. What do I do? What resources are there to help?"

1806,"Should I stay, how do I manage that? Or just leave?","So, I have used reddit off and on since the beginning of the year. I have found some communities to be VERY supportive. I live alone, and I have PTSD and a service dog, I don’t have many friends and my family life is complicated even though the drama has died down. I have found some great people who are very supportive. But recently, I have been discouraged. I sometimes will comment on peoples posts or make posts of my own and people will take whatever insignificant detail that bothers them and go down a rabbit hole that is unrelated.   


Sometimes I find if funny that they want to stir up drama (told one person that if they don’t trust everything they can’t see they shouldn‘t use electricity or wifi). And others really bother me. They don’t know anything about me, yet they are bossing me around about my life choices. One person even got mad at me because I didn’t want to buy a certain product because it is a large company that breaks international laws (and gets away with it because money). I don’t care what they want to do with their money, but don’t lecture me about mine. Even some people who have PTSD or a service dog can be really deragatory about people who are more or less abled than they are.   


Of course, I can always report them, but it takes time to get it handled, and it doesn‘t mean it doesn’t bother me. But sometimes, if I respond, they just misunderstood something, their tone came off weird, or they just haddn’t had an experience that helped to understand where I am coming from. And I’d like to think that some of those people listen.   


I’m just not sure what to do. I have gotten good advice or support but I don’t know if it is worth hearing more of the crap. I know of these attitudes, but I don‘t need the specific words that come with them. That being said, it is nice to have an outside perspective and not live in a bubble, which is why I came here in the first place."
1807,Feel nothing.," I don't know how to start out with this post. I'll try my best, though.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am a 21 year old male, and I just need some opinions.

 I'm not happy, and I don't really see a point in living (don't worry, I have never thought about killing myself) and I don't really see how it could change. Nothing makes me happy.. like, at all. I just live day by day. Wake up, go to work, come home, use my free time on random stuff, go to bed, repeat. I don't really enjoy my job, and I don't really enjoy my free time.

 I'll try to get in some of my background.

 When I was a kid, I was really ""popular"". I would have friends around me at all times. I had people visiting me every hour, every minute and every second of every day. It got so bad that my parents had to make me a schedule for when I could have visitors and when I couldn't (because I was visibly exhausted).

 This changed me when we moved to a new house a few hours away. For the first time in my life, I was alone. No friends visiting. And it was amazing. This changed fast when I started attending the new school, though. Apparently I'm a very likeable person (more on that later in the post) and people started flocking again. Thankfully, it wasn't as intense because of the ""cool guys vs losers"" mentality of the kids. Normally it's easy for people to categorize other people, but I was kind of in the grey zone even though I generally hanged out with the ""losers"". They were always more comfortable to hang with because they were more introverted. The ""cools guys"" would often ask me to hang out with them and ditch the ""losers"", but I never did, so the social situation wasn't that intense.

 Why am I telling this story? This is what made me. I hate being social, although I handle it pretty well (on the outside). I just want to be alone all the time. After one hour of being social I already feel exhausted. It has ruined friendships and is ruining my current relationship. The worst thing is, I don't give a fuck, but at the same time.. I do.

 I. DON'T. KNOW. ANYMORE.

 I am kind of a chameleon, I blend in. I feel like I don't know who I really am because I morph my personality depending on who I am close to, I morph my moods. It's all happening subconsciously, though (I think). And this is why I think people seem to like me so much. I just fit in. I'm never happy, I can laugh and I can seem annoyed, but I know that none of that matters, cause it's all an act. I haven't felt real joy in a long time, I haven't felt real sadness in a long time. I can't even remember the last time I cried or held back tears. I just don't feel much, I just exist. I spend my workdays looking forward to the weekend, but as soon as the weekend arrives I just think: ""Why?""

 Why do I look forward to the weekend? No reason. It's not like I do anything special.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have a hard time actually describing it all, so I'm sorry if it's really messy and badly written. 

 If anyone has some specific questions or answers, I would appreciate it. If not, it's okay. Just wanted to try to better myself without going to a therapist (don't have money for it and my parents know nothing about this)"
1808,Why don’t I like praise?,"I feel like I should enjoy being praised for something I did that was good, or to be thanked for it. But I don’t.

1812,Can't stop thinking about disturbing movie,"So about 8 months ago, I went to the theater see a movie. I will not be saying the name of the movie or characters or specific plot details, because the more I think about this movie the harder it is to forget about it. If you know which movie I'm talking about please do not mention the title, characters, or specific plot details.

It was my first time seeing a horror movie. The only horror/thriller movie I had seen before was Alien, and in my opinion that's more action than horror. This movie was advertised as a psychological thriller, and I thought it would be interesting to watch as opposed to something full of jumpscares and gross imagery like ""It"" which was playing at the time. Boy was I wrong.

The movie, from what I got out of it, seemed to be an allegory about the dangers of man's sexual desires. It contained several sexually disturbing scenes with imagery, music and sounds that seem to be permanently stuck in my head. After leaving the theater I was turned off for about a week because of how sexually horrific it was. 

For about 2 months after I saw it, it was always on the back of my mind. Sometimes it would just be a thought that lasted a brief moment, and sometimes it would linger for hours late at night keeping me awake. But eventually it wore off and I didn't think about it very often. Until recently. 

During the lockdown, the thoughts have returned and I can't go a day without thinking of this movie for long periods of time. I can't eat seafood or look at anything related to the ocean without triggering the thoughts of this movie. I can't watch any movies with the same actors. (Again, to reiterate: please do not mention the name of this movie, the characters, actors, or any plot events) Often when I masturbate the thoughts come into my head. I feel disturbed and upset whenever I think about it and it's gotten in the way of my happy thoughts.

Has anything like this ever happened to you? How did you get over it? I've tried looking at other disturbing things to try to think about them instead, but that doesn't work. Do you think this will get better once lockdown ends and I go back to daily routines?"

1814,I don't know what's wrong with me,"I (29F) have preferred my own company ever since I was a kid. I would always make up imaginary games and tie my scarves into dolls and play by myself for hours. Being on my own has been my comfort zone for as long as I've been alive. But the older I get, the more messy that state of comfort gets.

My dad was often deployed for months at a time when I was young and my mother forced me into a parental role with my younger brother (24M). She was always drunk and had too much of her own temper to deal with his tantrums, so it was left to me. My time to truly recharge was rare. The fact that I was always trying to be alone made my brother think I hated him. This obviously added up over the years. Interpersonal relationships are getting more and more exhausting for me to maintain. I don't understand why it feels like a chore for me to give my time to people I like. They aren't taking advantage of me. They aren't bad people. I just always find myself anxiously waiting to leave and get back to my bedroom.

This whole pandemic has made me question so much. All of my social media is full of people saying they miss their friends and I just...can't relate. I've met some really fantastic people in the last few years and I'm so glad they're my friends, but I just don't miss them. And I don't know why. 

I don't even know if this post makes sense. I'm sorry. I have so much spinning in my head."
1815,Help me,"I never told anyone but I think I'm depressed. I mean it's obvious looking at my life. It's like I'm not for this world and everything is just turning into chaos... my social life, profession, health, relationships.. Maybe I'm not trying enough but nevertheless I feel like I'm a sinking ship. Everything I did past 6 years is absurd. I don't like talking about self hurting, it's meaningless and sounds very sick, but to me it feels like the only way I can revenge my wounds and sadness, through pity. The main reasons for my wounds are unfulfilled wishes and for each one of them I was one step away from making it true but I failed every time because I'm a coward. Like there's no point in living like this, because I never broke from these chains. Sometimes I get these sad episodes and I would always try to hurt myself but it's nothing serious. Ironically I'm coward to kill myself. I would never do such a thing but it gives me a relief if I know I may do and I try something and stop. I don't want to live but at the same time I don't want to die. I treat this sadness with swimming, but quarantine took it away. I also try to educate myself spiritually and it helped me see things as they are. I concluded that all things I mentioned above are just social norms which don't matter.....until a member of your family uses them to hurt you. I know that deep inside my feelings I buried my broken feelings and when someone digs them I get very upset and I don't want someone to dig the wrong hole. I'm scared for me in the future because all I can see is that my misery will only go worse. I find writing relaxing but when I'm emotionally upset, there is no control in me. I'm 20 years old and I'm dragging this passive depression since 13 yr old. Help me please."

1817,Losing hope,My anxiety and depression have been kicking my ass lately. Today has been the worst day yet. I haven’t wanted to kill myself this badly ever. My heart has been racing and I just want to stab right through out or slit my wrists. I just used the suicide prevention online chat and that was shit but I heard calling isn’t much better. I don’t want to go inpatient because I have so much shit to do and I can’t put it on hold but also money?? I’m just stuck and don’t know what to do.
1818,Today wasn't so bad.,"Woke up had a bacon sandwich w/brown sauce. Got ready, met up with my cousin. Finally got to try out my new tennis racket I brought. Was reduced 70% from £100. Had a couple games. Had to travel about 15miles to pick up something for my auntie.

On the motorway I took the wrong exit twice, usually I would hit the fan over something as petty as this. I was calm, just eyes on the road and johnny cash in the background.

Had a nap woke up to a nice fish filet meal make by my mother. Went to the supermarket to grab some treats.

I end the day by having a clean shave, then massaging a nice peach cream balm into my face. After that, indulging in a Madagascar vanilla cheese alongside a cup of strong tea.

Usually I stay in bed."
1819,Im considered about my mental health,[deleted]
1820,I don't know how to talk about depression,"I sometimes realize how drained I am, how I used to be passionate about so many things and now I'm just... dry. I wasn't always like this. Any time I found rock bottom, there was a hole and I kept falling. What happens? Why am I like this? Why can't I stay excited? Why is the world losing its color?"
1821,I have a really bad issue with my neighbors playing music (PTSD/trauma related),"Thanks to my Mom's drunk moments in the past, music playing is a really, really bad trigger for me. I've been sent into suicidal fits and self harm sessions from music alone. However my neighbors are currently playing music during the day, and right now at midnight. I can't keep coping like this at home, and I'm starting to crack. A while back I legit thought I'd end up killing myself because my mom was next door, drinking, playing music. I can't keep putting up with this. This has affected me for two years now.  


It's a seriously terrible trigger of mine and I don't know what to do. I'm really, really scared and I just need some way to stop this. I'm so tired of playing music at ear harming levels to block it out. I'm so tired of shaking and wanting to hurt myself because these idiots keep playing music at midnight! It's the worst trigger I could possibly have and the summer is pure hell because people ONLY play music. I just want to feel safe and I don't know what to do!  


I'm 15, and live in Britain. I don't think I can get away with calling the police and complaining about noise;;"
1822,I told you not to get close,I told you it would hut me. I told you I end up hurting everybody. Why the fuck didn't you listen?
1823,What is wrong with me - please read if you're serious,"I'm writing this a bit drunk because it's the only time I become vocal about this shit.

I have a number of things I know are wrong but haven't really accepted they are wrong and thought it's almost normal.

First thing which is the most concerning is, on a biweekly basis I think I'm a god. My logic is that everything is a simulation, no one exist truly but myself because there is no proof of existence beyond my own mind. Therefore if I'm the only real person then I must have some sort of purpose, eg a test subject for a version of time. If I'm the only thing that truly is real then I am God. Also tied in is every now and then, I have thoughts that my family is trying to wipe me out. I do stupid things like second washing cups and not eating certain food they made me. I included this on this point because after reading online, they are potentially connected. 

Second thing is less concerning even though it really shouldn't be. I put a deadline on myself, if I don't get to wear I want to by a day I'll keep to myself in 7 years, I'll kill myself. Sounds extreme but I really don't want to live a life I don't want to. Recently I've considered bringing it forward eg tonight, I won't so don't worry. I don't own a gun and that's the only way I want to go tbh. 

Thirdly, is something that I don't know is an issue or not. Pretty much, I do not care. I don't care about my family or myself. I care about friends only, i put that down to being able to choose people I want as friends therefore I'd like the choise I've made. 

Fourth , least important because I kinda like it sometimes. I'm pretty sure I have adhd, I constantly forget what I'm thinking or doing whilst thinking or foing it. I miss what someone's saying even when it's a one on one conversation. 

Last but not least I've turned 18 a few months back, I planned to get a car and talk to a therapist in private but dew to obvious recent going ons I can't get a car or talk to someone so I'm left how I am. I waited until I was 18 because I didn't want to talk to my parents not out of embassment or shame but because they never help. My mother petty much uses any excuse to get attention, even a ill son, it's awful. And my dad is easy to talk to but can't keep something from my mother, especially something like this. 

I'd love some feedback, even though I'm pretty drunk autocorrect and second reading is doing a great job for me.

There's definitely something I'm missing but linking back to the fourth point I've forgotten was I was gonna write whilst writing it.

Thanks for even reading."
1824,How do I find a psychiatrist to go to?,"Sorry guys, this is the first time I’ve done this and I just feel lost. I started googling and I found some but I don’t know who to call. How do I know who takes my insurance? Is there anything specific I should look out for? Should I just start calling and try to find whatever one is available for an appointment soonest?

Thanks for any advice."
1825,Decided to try therapy again. What should I expect?,"Hello guys. I'm nervous about posting, but I feel I need all the advice I can get. 

To give a little background on me, I come from a fairly abusive background. My dad suffered from cocaine addiction and alcoholism. He would often lash out at my sister and I when we were kids. He would also beat my mother in front of us. At one point, he threatened to murder me if he found out I knew my mom was cheating but didn't tell him (I was 5 at the time, and had no concept of extramarital affairs).

My mom meanwhile, suffered from issues with men in her life. Her dad was very cold and abusive towards her. He disowned her because she didn't get into a college he liked (Harvard) even though she did get Ivy league acceptance. She married a man who had mafia association prior to my dad. After that failed, she married my dad, who took part in drug running in Miami. I say all this because, for the longest time, I was the only man in her life she didn't feel afraid of. She instead smothered me, and gave me unreal expectations. She only saw me as the man she wanted me to be, and not for what I was. 

For most of my childhood, I was miserable. I got kicked out of two elementary schools, and all though I had good grades, my conduct was often keeping me in trouble at school. Still, I wasn't depressed, or at least, not as depressed as I assumed I was. 

Then something happened to me when I was 14. I remember so vividly this experience. I had gotten back from a friend's party, at was at their home relaxing. Suddenly, I felt depression roll over me. It was like a switch turned, and I felt so down and helpless. For years after, I asked to seek help. But both my parents denied that anything was wrong and that therapy is only for ""crazy"" people. 

A few years back, when I first joined the military, I sought out mental health. I told them about what I was experiencing, and about my past. But to my dismay, they ignored everything. They told me it was normal to feel stress and sadness when life changes occur.

I'm now 27, and experience strong bouts of depression, anxiety, fear of abandonment and yet, seem to push everybody away from me. I'm married, but seperating from my wife. I decided, since I have healthcare and am seperating soon from service, to try therapy again. When I went this week, the therapist told me they were glad I was honest with them, and apologized that my prior provider ignored my problems. They said they'll also look into getting me medicine to help with my emotions. 

This leaves me asking, what should I expect? I'm still so afraid, and everyday feels like I'm left feeling two distinct feelings of depression in the morning, and numbness at nighttimes. I'm sorry if that's a bad or weird question, but really I just want any advice or help I can get at this point."
